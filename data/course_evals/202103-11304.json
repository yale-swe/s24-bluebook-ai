                "I learned a tremendous amount about Japanese history and about how to understand Japan in the context of world history.",
                "This class was amazing. I know so much about Tokugawa Japan. We explored many aspects of this period and I found it all to be so interesting. I have never experienced a 70 minute class go by so quickly.",
                "Great for learning about the history of Japan through the Tokugawa period. I found myself actually retaining a lot of information and connecting it to things I learned in other courses. The class gives an overview of the social, cultural, and political influences during the period alongside more detailed anecdotes.",
                "Professor Drixler's course is not just a survey of premodern Japanese history but provides broader insights on political theory, aesthetics, demographic studies, and ethnography. Besides getting a comprehensive overview of Japanese history from 1550 - 1880, we were encouraged to contextualize what we learned critically.",
                "Comprehensive insight into all manner of Tokugawa Japan: the great warlords & samurai, sustainability, demographic change. I enjoyed the breadth of coverage, far beyond the political intrigue of that era. Many readings consisted of digesting first-hand accounts of events/primary texts, which were intriguing to analyze.",
                "An overview of Japanese history with a deep focus on the Tokugawa (1600-1868) era. How to analyze, critique, and engage with primary and secondary historical sources. Questioning historical narratives and contingencies.",
                "For those who don't have a background in Tokugawa history, this class makes you feel knowledgeable about this era and leaves you with more questions to explore.",
                "A comprehensive overview of early modern Japan, coupled with a newfound appreciation of the culture of Tokugawa Japan. This course gave me insights into history, population dynamics, urbanization, and culture which are generally applicable. Lastly, Professor Drixler also provides us with great sidebar material on other Asian societies and even contemporary Europe as it came into contact with Japan."

                "This is the best class I've taken at Yale, and I am a STEM major. Professor Drixler is the most interesting, well-spoken lecturer I've had, and he cares so much about creating a positive and inclusive learning environment. Each lecture felt like a story, and lecture built on each other more or less in a chronological way, would I really appreciated. Readings were the perfect amount - usually 50 pages or less a week - and they related incredibly well to lectures and were always interesting. I have only wonderful things to say about this course.",
                "The biggest strength of the course is the content. I went from knowing absolutely nothing about Japanese history to feeling like I could hold a relatively informed conversation about Japan from 1550-1850 with most people. I wish the themes of the lectures were a bit more organized thematically. The first half of the class was kind of like \"what happened before 1600 and the Tokugawa Shogunate began\" and the second half of the class was kind of just like \"things that happened during the Tokugawa Shogunate.\" I wish there was a clearer and maybe deeper thematic connection between the different sections of the course.",
                "no weaknesses",
                "STRENGTHS: Prof. Drixler is incredibly passionate about the subject matter, the class is organized well, even though lectures are not posted we received summaries of the notes at the start of each class, discussion sections were a nice size and the readings were interesting. Generally, a fascinating class. The art assignment in lieu of a longer paper was especially nice as a way to engage with the whole of Tokugawa cultural rather than just one literary source.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: The 75 lecture minute at times felt too long and like the material was dragged out just for the sake of filling time. Also, the problem set was based on obscure source research and apparently designed to take 3 hours but ended up taking everyone in the class 10 hours at minimum. Otherwise, it was good.",
                "Professor Drixler is a terrific lecturer and prepares easily digestible informational handouts to supplement his teaching. I do not have any problems with the weekly lectures, though a number of them were dryer than others. The exams were sensible and manageable. Some of the assignments such as the \"problem set\" I found rather pointless and it was a slog.",
                "Fascinating era of history to learn about, and well constructed syllabus. Professor Drixler was an engrossing lecturer to watch every week, and made lecture worth going to every week. Unfortunately, there was huge variation in workload from week to week. Most frustrating was the chaotic organization of an otherwise great class: major assignment guidelines were given rather late and time expectations for these were vastly underestimated, especially for the scavenger hunt \"p-set\".",
                "Professor Drixler for sure. The course material is engaging as well.",
                "Strengths: This course was probably one of the best I've ever taken at Yale. Professor Drixler is a great storyteller and his lectures are full of interesting and thought-provoking material on a subject that he cares about deeply. The course gives you a window into a world that no longer exists and challenges our assumptions on the normative standards of society.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: can't think of any major ones",
                "Strength: Lecture notes were great to have, the workload of the class was very manageable",
                "This is the best history lecture I have taken at Yale. Drixler marries a comprehensive overview of Japan with an encyclopedic knowledge of Tokugawa society. The one slight weakness is that he tends to spend a handful of lectures getting lost in the weeds, but he almost always manages to synthesize some general takeaways from the material at hand. Strongly, strongly recommended for the generalist student of history or the East Asia aficionado."

                "Absolutely. Humanities and STEM majors alike (I am a STEM major, and this is my favorite class I've taken in my 4 years at Yale). The workload never felt overwhelming. Lectures were beyond interesting. Readings paired well with lectures. Fabian is the sweetest, kindest soul at Yale.",
                "Yes. I learned so much about Japanese history. I went from knowing nothing to feeling pretty confident about my general knowledge of Japan, which is kind of wild. However, the class was not structured in the most engaging way. Lectures were often far too long and difficult to follow. The readings were interesting but not amazing. It was a pretty good course but definitely worth taking because of the sheer knowledge you gain.",
                "Yes take it. I loved it so much.",
                "YES! I would absolutely recommend this course if you want an overview of the history of Japan through the Tokugawa period or if you simply like history. There are so few classes here that focus in on the overall history of a single nation, which is incredibly helpful if you plan to pursue further studies in East Asia. It also just makes the material more enjoyable to learn when a class is not hammering away at a single dimension of history. The workload was spread out nicely and I never felt extremely stressed about completing assignments. Prof. Drixler was really understanding and tried to accommodate peoples needs/schedules. He is also a really engaging professor that seems genuinely delighted to discuss the subject.",
                "Certainly! The somewhat disorganized nature of the course is worth putting up for a fascinating journey into Tokugawa Japan.",
                "Yes, it was an engaging course, Professor Drixler is a fantastic lecturer and section was always interesting. The workload was a lot though, i did not expect 60-100 pages of reading a week.",
                "Definitely  you can when a professor is excited to teach a class, and Professor Drixler is one great example. Although he has a slightly annoying habit of going overtime, it didn't bother me that much since the lectures were interesting. If you're interested in any of Yale's history classes as I was, this class is a great selection.",
                "YES, this was my first history class and doing well felt very attainable. Professor Drixler is passionate about his work and he stays after class to thoroughly answer questions",
