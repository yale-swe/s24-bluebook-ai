Petty cool theories into how we can \"measure culture\". Also how to contextualize these techniques in the sociology world (readings about the positives and negatives about quantifying culture).",
                "I learned how to use R to analyze text data. Specifically, I can now use sentiment analysis to measure text sentiment, build structural topic models to understand the topics present in the text, and use word embeddings to see how different words are used in context.",
                "NLP techniques (word embedding, topic models, network analysis) and how they can be applied to answer sociological\/cultural questions.

                "The course material was super interesting and always very practical, but we also spent a lot of time talking about the rationale behind using computational methods and when it could actually give deeper insights. I really liked the balance between hard skills and their applications. I think it would have been helpful to have more time dedicated to coding together, maybe like a lab instead of a discussion section, to make sure we were all on the same page.",
                "Well taught, interesting material",
                "Strengths: Prof Daniel is really good at explaining the statistical reasoning (better than explanations I learned in machine learning). The PSETs are a fun way to get real world examples into what we learn. \r\nWeaknesses: Maybe this is just me, but I did not enjoy learning about the sociology that much. An overview of it was nice, but we got really nuanced into defining what culture is, which I thought got drawn out.",
                "Strength- the p-sets were written well to teach us how to code in R, such that we were walked through the code and what the different lines did, and office hours were accessible\r\n\r\nWeakness- the lectures often seemed disconnected from the graded work of this course. They were interesting, but sometimes it was frustrating to have very technical coding homework while discussing big-picture topics in sociology.",
                "Strengths: Professor Daniel and TF Jeff were the most responsive teachers via email Ive ever encountered and provided plenty of supplemental learning through these methods. Lectures were engaging, open for frequent questions throughout the lecture. PSet assignment descriptions and psets overall provided a great overview of the technical aspects of the classmore informative RMarkdown files like those descriptions to follow along with would be great! \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes discussion periods were quiet. I appreciated walkthroughs of examples like the difficult network analysis rather than more simple coding introductions that perhaps could be better conveyed through a reading\/distributed RMarkdown file.",
                "Weakness: students would likely struggle a lot of they don't have prior coding backgrounds. There was less support this year because a TA was moved by the department to another class, which isn't the instructor's fault. If the students decide to use current coding approaches that have not been demonstrated before in class, they may struggle a lot.\r\n\r\nStrengths: for those with coding backgrounds, a very accessible approach towards learning applications such as topic modellings etc. It really demystified a lot of these otherwise seemingly unapproachable computing solutions. The homework really helped to provide a strong guidelines on how to use them as well as plenty of practicing with them.",
                "Strengths: learned really cool and new coding methods; real-life applications; interesting readings and class discussions \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very little help with the coding aspect of it; no student learning assistant to distribute the work of helping students; coding in class was very briefly explained"

                "Yes! I think this class is an excellent introduction to computational social science",
                "Take this if you have some coding background and are interested in the intersection of culture, especially via social media, and computer approaches. This class is also helpful to graduate students. For example, if you're interested in things such as marketing and how to see what your potential audiences are talking about. You'll learn a lot and have opportunities to do your own projects and be able to take about them in interviews."
