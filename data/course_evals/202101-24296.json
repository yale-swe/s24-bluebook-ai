I am so grateful that I took this course because they made programming approachable in a way that no other programming course I have tried has been. I have absolutely zero recommendations for how the course could be improved. It was the best course of my whole degree. Looking at my final project, I feel like I learned so much and improved my knowledge of programming a lot. But, importantly, it was never painful and I was always excited for class.",
                "Cathy and Doug are both phenomenal human beings and wonderfully clear instructors. If you have never coded before or only have basic experience, their labs give the clearest introductions to Python that I have ever seen. I wish I'd been able to take a class like this / learn from someone like Doug when I was just starting out. As for the course itself, the lectures are really interactive and Cathy is so supportive in helping you design your own project and find a dataset that suits your interests and needs. I can't think of any real weaknesses! If anything, the psets could have been slightly more difficult; unlike other computer science courses I've taken, I didn't spend very much time actually learning and understanding what each line of code was doing, because the psets were modeled after labs and graded on completion. However, I appreciate the need to accommodate the wide breadth of coding levels present in this introductory class. I don't know if I'm naming weaknesses so much as wishing there was an intermediate or advanced version of this seminar, so we could keep going!",
                "The format was perfect. One day would be devoted to learning about a technique and the next we would all work on how to use it using google collab. I am not comfortable with coding but the instructions were really easy to follow."

The lecturers are fantastic, the workload is very low and the course is perfectly organized. You also end up learning a lot of incredibly useful coding and data visualization techniques, and then get to put them to use on a final project of your choice. As a CS major, I can also say that this course had a better introduction to Python and APIs than any other class I've taken - Doug is an absolute treasure.",
