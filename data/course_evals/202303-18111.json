                "I love that it can be taken go at your own pace because of the modules and they are a great way to learn difficult material.",
                "plenty of office hours offered to get your questions answered and/or help on p-sets",
                "Love that it can be taken asynchronously.",
                "Strengths: optional asynchronous format worked very well for me \r\nWeakness: TFs were usually not super helpful in explaining topics, course can also become unengaging",
                "Strengths: \r\nInstructor is excellent\r\nAsynchronous option and flexibility in exam times make the course very accessible. \r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\nWould have potentially benefitted from a more clear/consistent formatting of the slides (just in heading/subheading/etc.) so that it is easier to follow along in notes and know how each sub-topic relates to the larger topics discussed.",
                "Strengths: super flexible in the amount of time I would spend on the course, had great example questions, a pretty silly professor \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think certain assignments could be worded better to better understand what is being asked for, and a few teaching aides would reschedule office hours last minute.",
                "A lot of office hours. I loved the asynchronous format to learn the way we can learn best. And being able to rewind in lecture videos and rewatch them. Towards the end of the first half of the term, no one was replying to Ed discussion anymore and I was unable to challenge my grades. The other weakness is psets are vague in details. So missing any component of an answer is deduction in grading.",
                "Strengths: ASYNC, a lot of office hours to find answers to your questions, organized\r\nWeakness: TA's were sometimes unreliable as one will say an answer was correct and the other will say the opposite",
                "A weakness is that it is very easy to fall behind due to the virtual options. A strength is that there is a lot of help available and the professor was very engaging.",
                "The main strength of this course is its organization. Professor Reuning-Scherer was very structured and posted all of his materials on Canvas, which was very helpful. I wish the grading for this course was a little bit more transparent, especially on the homework. I felt like I sometimes lost points for things I did not understand. I also wish we had the opportunity to do more group work in this class.",
                "Weaknesses: \r\n- Although the course was advertised on Course Search as a stats course specifically on political science, almost all examples throughout the entire course had nothing to do with political science. Course Search said that the course would include \"problems presented with reference to a wide array of examples: public opinion, campaign finance, racially motivated crime, and public policy,\" but the examples ended up revolving around concentrations of water or minerals, animals, and other STEM related topics. I understand that the methods are technically the same regardless of subject matter, but I found it very frustrating and unengaging to keep working with material that is not relevant at all to my interests or future academic work. \r\n- Many of the TAs were not particularly helpful or successful in explaining concepts of the course, but rather resorted to giving out problem set answers. \r\n\r\nStrengths: the remote option allowed for flexible learning.",
                "strengths: if you want to put little effort into a class and get a QR credit, this is a good choice. JDRS's home videos at the end of his lectures was a major highlight. weaknesses: the political science section had nothing to do with political science. Our data sets were still about roaches and manatee boat deaths, etc. This made it a lot less interesting",
                "Jonathan is a good lecturer, no practice problems for exams",
                "I think the strength of this course is how flexible it is with the students. Having the options to go in person or watch the livestream is really helpful and gives you no excuses to not go do the class. The amount of office hours available is also extremely helpful as you can always find a time to attend and join office hours. Having the test online also really helps as someone who gets really anxious and stressed to take tests in person.\r\nThe weakness of this course is connected to the strength and that is that it's so easy to fall into the trap of catching up with lecture later and falling really behind. So I recommend to go to class every day if you can. In addition, I think the PSETs can be a bit more connected to the exam so we can be better prepared for them.",
                "Strengths it's really helpful how many resources the course has including recorded lectures and videos, as well as the several office hours each week. I took stats in high school a few years ago, and it was a helpful refresher to have all the different materials. I can't think of any particular weaknesses.",
                "The many options for office hours were a strength of the course.",
                "The course covers a breadth of information, but there is a large amount of deeper learning that the student has to do on their own for full comprehension of the material. Since problem sets are assigned weekly, office hours are more about answering homework questions than digesting the volume of new material.",
                "I found this course to be challenging. The workload was high, and it was difficult to find help through office hours (which were mostly virtual). There was an error in the grading of one of my exams, and it was very difficult to resolve. I know other classmates faced similar challenges with regrade requests or missing grades.",
                "The structure of the course was pretty straightforward, but I took the political science section and we didn't do anything related to polisci. It was just a standard stats class, and I wish there were more datasets actually related to political science.",
                "Asynchronous is a tempting option many students will take, but once you start getting behind it wont stop. As stated in the syllabus, you have to stay on top of it.",
                "I found the flexiblility of the course very helpful. I think it could be improved with more time between pset deadlines. It felt like a lot of work for each week.",
                "The asynchronous unit was extremely well developed and very helpful.",
                "Really approachable and available Professors and TAs.",
                "While the asynchronous option enhances the accessibility of this course, it is important to acknowledge its inherent challenges. The difficulty lies not only in the complexity of the content, making it inherently demanding, but also in the rigorous nature of the tests. Despite the availability of office hours to excel in assignments, navigating the challenging assessments requires a dedicated effort and thorough understanding of the course material. Also the course didn't have much support before the test.",
                "I would say there is a good amount of support because office hours are always there and there is someone to help you. The content is delivered in a way that is easily accessible to everyone, which makes it very easy to understand. The only real weakness is the lack of practice exams given before finals or midterms because there is a disconnect between what the problem sets look like and what the exams themselves look like.",
                "I think the strengths of the course lie in the knowledge and humor of the professor.  He was really engaging in his lectures and came up with different ways for us to remember certain statistics concepts.  I think a weakness is the strengths of the TFs who, in my experience, did not always explain things very well or were reluctant to help to the extent needed."

                "Would recommend",
                "Yes and no, this really depends on the type of student. The class does move very fast as the professor will warn you on the first day of class, however, if you are someone who adapts informations quickly then take the course b/c it was fun and it's async so the class is very flexible. If you're a student who really wants the professor to slow down and explain some parts of the topic more in depth then it's a bit difficult as this class is big and the professor may take weeks to reply to your request through email (better to go in-person to ask questions).",
                "Yes, it's good to have a foundation in statistics and this course is very efficient at teaching the basics. But you do actually have to internalize the material, which can be difficult, so it's not a gut or a QR to be taken unless you truly do want to know some stats.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student interested in learning the basics of statistics. It was a very helpful introduction to many important concepts that can be further explored in more advanced classes.",
                "Unfortunately not. The course did not approach teaching statistics in a very systemic way; for instance, we were only shown a map of the various statistical methods, which helped categorize what we were learning and doing, in one of the last lectures. Before then, we were learning various methods without much clarity on what each of them would or would not achieve. If you already have a solid background in stats and are willing to learn a lot on your own, the course is probably doable. But if you are looking for a QR with more structure and guidance, I would recommend other courses!",

                "I would recommend this course to other students. You have all of the tools to be able to get good grades on your PSET and pass the overall class. If you are looking to fulfill your QR credits, this is a good course to do that. But be aware that it is a lot of content.",
                "Yes, it's a good QR! Stats is helpful knowledge to have and there are a lot of resources to guide you along the way.",
                "Yes, I think you learn a lot of helpful statistic principles that could be helpful for many fields.",
                "Since this course is often a prerequisite for majors, I believe the class should be recommended for that sake. Otherwise, the course itself is minimally engaging intellectually and requires a large amount of work for less return on knowledge. The teaching fellows were very kind and helpful, but the course itself fell flat in many ways.",
                "If they also must take this course to complete a requirement, I guess so.",
                "Yes, if you have already taken AP stats. If not, it can be a little fast paced.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it was a helpful introductory course to statistics.",
                "Yes, learning basic statistics is a very valuable skill to have.",
                "Yes. Really structured learning with plenty of resources to succeed.",
                "I would yes if they have a strong background in stats.",

There is an extensive amount of help pathways if needed, but the course information is really interesting and a good basic introductory for people hoping to get into statistics."
