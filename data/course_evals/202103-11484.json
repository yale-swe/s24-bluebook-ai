                "Strengths are I learned to become a lot more fluid.",
                "The resources of this course (the textbook, online exercises, activities, etc.) were extremely helpful in aiding and increasing my learning of the Spanish language. Our verbal engagement in class also drastically increased my comfortability speaking Spanish and my pronunciation. The organization of the course, however, was often lacking. I would frequently attend class and be confused or surprised by what we were doing because it was unclear based on the syllabus.",
                "One weakness of this course is that they give a lot of busywork. A lot of the work is not valuable to learning Spanish and I found myself rushing through it to get to the next assignment because it wasn't teaching me anything. I also did not like that much of this course felt self-taught and the class felt like it didn't have any structure. In class, our professor would just tell us to talk to each other without any further instruction. I didn't like how we didn't learn any grammar structures in class and instead were expected to teach ourselves advanced grammar structures. Overall, I think that this class needs much more structure and less busy work.",
                "A strength is that it focuses on all areas of language such as writing, speaking, and reading. It also teaches you a lot of vocabulary. It could be improved by having a stricter in class time schedule or plan."

                "Overall, yes. The course content and activities helped me learn Spanish to a degree I had never learned in before, yet the lack of organization was often frustrating and confusing.",
