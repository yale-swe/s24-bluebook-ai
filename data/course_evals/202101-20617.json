The professors for each module frequently went into pretty complicated explanations of certain topics within the module, but the pace was often too fast to understand anything easily. I managed to do decently well in the course and complete all the quizzes, problem sets, projects, etc. but I did not learn as much as I hoped I would. I kind of just got through the class without learning very much. Maybe in-person, as opposed to on Zoom due to the pandemic, it would be better. I don't know for sure though.",

The module on virology, for example, helped me understand how and why the Coronavirus pandemic unfolded as it did.

                "Strengths: Professor Kankel was nice. \r\nWeaknesses: Grading was arbitrary, had no idea what going on half of the time, certain professors graded modules extremely hard for no reason, modules weren't as interesting as I thought they'd be. However, in the end it ended up being fine.",
                "This course was a pretty low workload and an easy way to get a science credit out of the way during your first year. Each of the modules had a different professor so it was kind of hit or miss for each topic. In the end, the grading was pretty generous, but the grading of each module seemed highly arbitrary and inconsistent, perhaps because each was led by a different professor. The problem sets and quizzes could also be better spaced out, perhaps by having the problem set due by the second meeting of the module and leave the quiz for the last session.",
                "More organization and assignments that have more relationship with the course content.",
                "Strengths: some topics in the course can be interesting, it is a laid-back first year seminar and science credit, you get to study a little bit about a wide range of science topics, and each module is taught by a different professor. \r\nWeaknesses: very low engagement is required to do well in the class and it is generally hard to stay engaged with the class; the structure of the class is flawed because the three-week modules don't give professors enough time to teach in-depth, which often resulted in almost every student in the class being confused and lost after lectures; the classes are long (hour and a half) and only meets once a week on Friday afternoons  maybe two fifty-minute sessions per week would be better.",
                "Did not like the idea of a two-semester course binding, but it was interesting to change topics every 3 weeks and keep the course fresh. Grading was also very vague and we did not even receive our first grades back until midway through the second semester of the course.",
                "The strength of this course was the wide scope of material that it covered in a short span of time. The lectures were structured so as to succinctly introduce the fundamental aspects of various fields of study, without going too far into potentially-confusing mathematical and biological details. The professor was always willing to provide additional guidance and clarification, so I never felt lost in the course. The workload in the course was higher than I had anticipated, though, as there was usually a quiz, problem set, and presentation due every third week. If you spread out the work, however, these assignments are manageable."

There were not any really specific practices geared towards learning during Covid-19; I imagine the course was run how it normally would be run, except that everything was on Zoom and not in-person, and that quizzes were done online rather than in-person. The quizzes were perfectly fine in how they were handled.",

Every third week, however, there was an opportunity for student engagement in the form of a required presentation. I personally prefer listening to talking, so the format suited me quite well. Someone who expects regular class discussions might not feel as engaged as I did, however."

                "If you want a science credit done by the end of your first year, are looking for a half credit to tack on each semester, and are willing to sit through some pretty boring material, then yes. Also, this class is technically labeled a seminar, but it is really a lecture course with student involvement once every three weeks.",
                "I honestly don't know what to think of this course -- whether it was easy or hard, good or bad. I don't feel like I took away a ton of content but it did inspire me to look into future courses in certain areas of science.",
                "I probably would not recommend this course to another student, especially if they aren't able to get another first-year seminar in addition to this one. I was lucky to get another first-year seminar in the fall, which I really enjoyed. If I had had to pick between this seminar and the other, and had chosen this one, I would have kicked myself for it by the end of the year because my other first-year seminar was awesome and this one simply was not. I took it to get a science credit, so at least I got that, but even so I feel like there must be other science credits for non-STEM majors in which you can get the credit without too much stress but still learn something and be engaged with the class. I did not learn as much as I wished in this class and I was not very engaged. Part of that was certainly my fault, but the class definitely didn't facilitate learning and engagement as well as it could have. I just wasn't very excited to go to class. Maybe it's a lot better in person as opposed to on Zoom during Covid, but I can't be sure. On the positive, the workload is very very light so if you have four credits already and want to add a half credit to each semester, it might be a good class to take for that reason. Be aware, though, that in order to earn credit for this class, you have to take it for the entire year (both semesters), and you only get one credit total  half a credit per semester.",
                "I think this course would be much better as an in-person seminar, would not suggest if it stays online.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student with an interest in the STEM fields. A basic familiarity with biological concepts definitely helps in understanding the material. But even if you come in with little biological knowledge, as I did, you can read up on the fundamental biological aspects between modules and still be successful. Be prepared to put in some work into preparing presentations and studying for quizzes. These assignments are not too difficult, but should better not be put off to the last moment. You'll come out of this course feeling like you can hold an informed conversation on topics you might have never thought about (such as the age and composition of the universe).",
