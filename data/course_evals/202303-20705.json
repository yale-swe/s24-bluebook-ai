                "This course allowed me to gain a perspective nuanced in social, political, and cultural factors regarding the performance of music and the persistence of musical trends in the African-American tradition. With Professor Michael Veal, I feel I was prompted to think on my feet about the connections between the persisting cultural factors of the United States during the mid-twentieth century and the performance of the genres of jazz, blues, and rock. A specific instance of this was a very insightful conversation about the connection between the technological advancements of the Space Race and the global militarization in relation to the theme of transcendent modes of being and the use of psychedelics by musicians during that time period. Our frequent and often intellectually dense conversations made this course very stimulating. The intense integration of observations about the music of both John Coltrane and Jimi Hendrix with observations about elements of their music also made this course very palatable.",
                "I learned how to contribute and participate in a smaller class setting, which was great! I also improved my note taking and analysis abilities.",
                "Learning how to approach music from a variety of cultural and political lenses, and challenge my own biases and preconceptions.",
                "I learned about Jimi Hendrix and John Coltrane and their music.",
                "Before this class, I really didn't understand how deeply you could think about music. After all, it's just notes, right? Wrong. If you are an appreciator of music, this class will expand your mind in so many ways and show you just how rich is the information you can get by digging a little deeper into what you listen to.",
                "Learned about the origins of rock and roll and it was really cool to trace to connection back to the old blues traditions."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths included the interesting topics of discussion and the use of readings as background knowledge to develop more complex ideas during class time.",
                "A major strength to this course is that it prepares to you think critically about social context of music. Furthermore, the workload is (for the most part) very manageable as the bulk of the semester revolves on writing just 5 reasonably sized papers. A weakness though is that the timing of these papers can be a little rough, with sometimes just a week to write, so it may be hard to devote time just to that. Another weakness, in my opinion, is that sometimes the required readings for the seminar are a bit lengthy and sometimes vague; they contain a lot of biographical information and it can be confusing to discern exactly what information is going to be useful for discussions in class if a specific reading is discussed. Another strength is that the professor, Michael Veal, is very easygoing, understanding, and easy to communicate, at least in the classroom setting. He's very approachable and is not difficult to a request an extension from. Lastly, another weakness is that it can be confusing to determine what exactly professor Veal is looking for in papers, but he is usually quite open to answering questions about writing.",
                "It had engaging reading and subject material. It could be improved by more equal participation amongst students.",
                "Veal is one of the most well-spoken, talented professors I've ever had. He's knowledgeable and humorous, and his lectures\/seminars were always engaging. There was a lot of writing, but it is a writing credit so it made sense. Sometimes feedback on the papers was a little vague, and I couldn't quite figure out what was expected of me in that context.",
                "I think that the professor was very engaging but the course could have had a bit more of an outward look at the social and political factors impacting the 1960s and how these musicians were a part of that.  The grading was overly harsh.  The professor held an obvious bias within in the class.",
                "Strengths: First and foremost: Veal. Absolutely amazing prof. Every time he opens his mouth I get the sense that I'm talking to a world-class expert on the subject. He will guide you through breaking down some seriously complex ideas in a way that feels so natural, and he never takes himself too seriously. Definitely kept the class lively. What's really neat about this class is the different levels of depth you can get based on your proficiency in music. Some students with a high theory background contributed heavily to technical components of discussion, while those who didn't focused on historical and contextual lenses. No lens is better than the other, but it just added some organic variance in opinion and what we discuss. Weakness: honestly the only weakness I can give this class is that we had not 1, but 2 essays for the final. Not great, but fine if you plan around it.",
                "Strengths: Professor Veal is the biggest strength; he's very knowledgeable about music and an overall very chill guy to talk to. Weaknesses: some of the readings were very lengthy, but you dont really have to read all the excess and can just focus on the important stuff for class discussions and essays. Also, Professor veal was a bit disorganized and had to assign the last two essays to be due on the same day  (though we did have like 3-4 weeks to finish both, so it wasn't too bad. However, it was during the final weeks of the semester so we had to study for other classes too.)",
                "Strengths: Professor Veal is very clearly passionate and an expert about what he teaches. He creates a comfortable and engaging environment where we all would laugh before class and in between when he would put on YouTube videos. Discussion was open to all and he facilitated it so everyone can participate, and the content of the course organically made it so discussion was abstract and unique to each of us which I really enjoyed. Most people in the class ranked the seminar as their first choice so naturally everyone was passionate and had a genuine sense of curiosity in the course itself which would lead to us going a bit off the proposed outline of the day but nonetheless still remain on topic. The listenings in class, although sort of a given for a music course, were a great aspect as it allowed for a more sonic experience and also new song recommendations to add to your playlist. Weaknesses: Honestly none, Professor does cold call during class but honestly you'll be fine, he does so in an engaging manner rather than intimidating. Readings are quite lengthy at times but they're actually really interesting so it's worth the time and especially useful for the unit papers."

                "I would definitely recommend this course if you have an interest in the development of jazz or rock music. It was a great way to develop writing, discussion, and critical thinking skills in topics that were extremely interesting. The course analyzed more than just sonic components of songs, but also historical, cultural, racial, sexual, and technological themes present in the music of the two artists.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially with Michael Veal as the professor. He is an incredibly kind teacher that keeps this course interesting at all points. Admittedly, though, this course is likely more interesting for those already interesting in jazz, rock, or music in general, whether or not you're majoring in it. Although, there are points where writing for this class may feel tiresome, but the professor is very understanding of people's situations and grants extensions accordingly. There was never a point in the semester where I didn't feel like I was learning a lot of new and interesting content. One thing to be weary of, though, is that sometimes the readings and can be pretty dense.",
                "Yes! Professor Veal is great and really good at facilitating class discussion. He really makes you defend and explain your arguments which makes them that much stronger!",
                "Yes.",
                "No I would not.  I think that if the course had more structure then I would be more inclined to recommend it.  The concepts are pretty abstract and sometimes seemed too stretched.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class. Anyone interested in music will get their ability to analyze music and obtain actually interesting, useful perspectives leveled up a hundred times. The workload isn't bad, there's no exams (just 5 essays, all 4-5 pages in length except for the last one). Grading isn't harsh. Also, while it's a music class, this class would also be sneaky good for you if you're interested in African American studies or Gender Studies. Lots of options for themes to explore in those categories, but also not required if those don't interest you as much.",
                "Yes, definitely if you're into music or a fan of Coltrane and Hendrix (no technical music knowledge is required) . Not too hard of a class and you get to cover very interesting subject matter with a passionate professor. Also, Professor Veal is a generous grader (at least in my experience).",
                "YES! Whether you're a Coltrane or Hendrix fan, you'll come out the class with an appreciation of both jazz and rock. The course is designed to allow you to evaluate the life and legacies of both artists through different lenses such as sonically, socially, technologically, chemically, etc which truly makes you come out the class with new knowledge despite how much you think you know about either artist. The energy of the class is truly unique I'd say to this course since most are musicians or avid music listeners which just adds another layer to a good learning environment since everyone enjoys being there. The assigned listenings and in-class listenings are actually really good song recommendations that I have now added to my playlists! Overall, you will come out the class each day with a deeper appreciation and respect for music and artists as you get to truly dive deep into the often overshadowed realities Coltrane and Hendrix went through in their musical journeys."
