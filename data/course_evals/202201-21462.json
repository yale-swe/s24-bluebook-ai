                "I felt like I became a better reader",
                "I didnt really learn anything in this course. The reading list weirdly retreads over a lot of the same stuff as other English courses. If youre an English major, this course will be extremely easy, but you wont learn anything.",
                "Learned several examples of how literature can be intertwined with social movements and theories. Delved deeper into certain terms such as extremism, totalitarianism, and mob",
                "How to interpret social justice and politics through a more explicit lens of literature",
                "I learned a lot about political centrism and how it relates to a number of literary works and thinkers, such as Virginia Woolf and Milan Kundera.",
                "Youll hear a lot about how this course is very much about *centrism* which is something I knew little about coming into the course, but I now understand how vastly significant it is and how its a massive force in modern politics and an enemy to progress itself, and famous authors grappled with the ideology in their writing.",
                "knowledge about close reading and the idea of centrism",
                "Broadly speaking, we challenged various definitions that I had previously thought I understood (centrism, totalitarianism, mob, etc)",
                "I really enjoyed this course. I thought the content was well presented and well organized, and the literature elements were always very well aligned with the social justice elements. We covered a wide range of literature, which most english courses cannot always span, but the nature of our class being led by definitions and \"centrism\" allowed for this. I think I gained a better ability to read literature from the standpoint of its history, and pay closer attention to how the period and climate a piece is written in informs how it is written.",
                "How to pinpoint literature along the political spectrum, poetic analysis",
                "This course uses Burkean centrism as a lens to view works by authors such as Federico Garca Lorca, Virginia Woolf, Milan Kundera, Pablo Neruda, and Tim Scott, among others. Social justice is approached through four key themes: totalitarianism, extremism, popularism, and the mob.",
                "The course is a really interesting survey of various political concepts/terms and how they evolved throughout history, with a specific focus on how these histories have led to our current political moment. The syllabus incorporates some really awesome literary texts for those who have an English inclination, as well as theoretical texts and philosophical questions for those who aren't so keen on the literature. Professor North is an incredible lecturer with a really impressive knowledge of literature, history, and literary history; you are sure to learn something from his lectures!",

            "comments": [
                "This course had no structure. It would have benefited from a clearer theme and lecture notes.",
                "Professor North leads lectures in a very interesting and engaging way that breaks down a variety of complicated concepts in a comprehensible manner. The readings for the course are interesting and help develop a thorough understanding of centrism as well as politics. Section was always interesting and the TFs are great.",
                "Recorded lectures sometimes had bad audio.",
                "Strengths: Professor North is an amazing lecturer. He brings fresh insights into a diverse array of topics including political theory and literature. The TA's are also amazing assets to the course - they complement the lectures and readings in a way that ties all the larger concepts of the course together.\r\nWeaknesses: There was not a lot of feedback throughout the course. Since there were only two writing assignments, it was difficult to get feedback on my writing in a way that was conducive to my skill as an interpreter and writer.",
                "strengths: we read many interesting books and Prof North would add many other insights during class that clarified a lot of questions that came up during reading. weaknesses: sometimes it felt like we were speeding through certain material and I didn't get the full picture",
                "The biggest weakness of this course is the syllabus. From what I remember, there was only one black writer on this syllabus, and it was Martin Luther King Jr. as a supplemental reading for one day of class. This class was called Literature and Social Justice, but we spent like the majority of the semester reading things about the French Revolution and the Spanish Civil War.",
                "Strengths: really engaging lectures, great structure of material and choice of syllabus\r\nWeaknesses: a little more guidance on papers, more interactive lectures perhaps",
                "The course provides a strong introduction to literary analysis that was not too difficult to follow, even as a non-major. The readings could be distributed out a little bit more evenly so that the last few works are also given enough attention.",
                "Strength: this class is great for students new to literary analysis, as we practiced interpretive/analytical readings of poems, but also for students new to political science, as the political theory was very clearly explained and approachable.",
                "the lectures were great, and so were the sections. The reading material got a little heavy towards the end of the course, and, although the material was interesting, maybe it might not have been necessary to read entire books that we could only spend 1 lecture on.",
                "This course is great for somebody looking for an introductory literature and/or social justice course. It provides a great framework but does not have a lot of depth.",
                "This course moved slowly at the beginning as we were introduced to the history of centrism, but once we got to the books, moved very quickly. Having more time to focus on and discuss the longer readings would be helpful especially in working through ideas that are a bit more dense. I think a strength was the sections because they allowed us to focus deeply on certain parts of the readings in conjunction with the reviews in lecture.",
                "super interesting lecture topics! not the most engaging class because it is not a seminar structure, but discussion sections were really helpful for digesting the assigned readings and learning critical analysis techniques.",
                "Didn't talk about the books we were assigned enough to warrant the time took to read them. Not really a weakness of the course, but it wasn't exactly what I expected: I think it would better be called Literature and Centrism than Literature and Social Justice. We talked about social justice movements, but mostly just as context, not as how the books themselves contributed to them.",
                "This courses biggest strength is its organization. It is clear that much effort was put into the syllabus to build off of previous concepts in an approachable manner, and reiteration of key concepts throughout the entire course helped bring a sense of concision to an otherwise broad compilation of literary works. In the future, it may be helpful to limit reading assignments to the length discussed in class, as many lectures entailed close-analysis of only a page or two of an entire book. If reading the whole book is necessary, perhaps giving students a heads-up as to which pages will be focused on in lecture will help to further facilitate questions.",
                "Strengths: Professor North is a gemdefinitely take a course with him before you graduate. The lectures were interesting and Professor North structured them to allow for student engagement without forcing students into any on-the-spot situations. Definitely the type of course where you can choose your engagement level. There were a few very simple worksheets at the beginning of the course to help track students' understanding of key terms and concepts; these were incredibly helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: As admitted by Professor North, the reading load is heavier towards the end of the course. The final novel (400pgs) was to be read during the same week that the final paper was due. I could tell that not too many people had been able to read this last novel. If you're skilled at reading ahead, then this shouldn't be a problem for you. But be warned if you're a procrastinator!",
                "This class was fun. Professor North is a great lecturer (energetic, passionate, funny) and the readings had an enjoyable range (Burke and Neruda, Arendt and Scott ... the simultaneously contrasting and complementary relationships between the readings go on). I found myself genuinely reexamining some of the ways I approach the world. I can only think of one small area of potential improvement: maybe the question time at the end of lectures could include questions submitted by students in advance of class (optionally, of course) or questions asked by the TAs, just to liven things up a bit, as people tended to not always ask questions. It also could be pleasant to play music over the speakers before class startsI imagine Professor North could both get a kick out of this and knows songs that relate to his various lecture topics.",
                "The lectures are very insightful because the professor offers his genuine view and backs it up with reasoning\r\nHis explanation of poems/novels are very animated and helps students get into the mood of the literary texts we are reading"

If you are interested in learning about the intersection of politics and literature, I highly recommend it.

The syllabus is truly terrible. Its the worst one from any class Ive taken at Yale. If you want to reread Tintern Abbey for the fifth time but without any other English majors in your section, youll love this class.",
                "Yes if you are looking for an accessible HU/WR credit! I am going to write this in the perspective of a STEM major who took this for the distributional credit. This class will be better if you have a slight interest in either literature or politics. There were 2 papers: one 6-8 page and one 8-10 page. The rest of the class composed of sections and 4 weekly worksheets at the beginning of the year which were very easy and took under an hour each.",
                "Absolutely, even if you don't have a background in either literature or politics!",
                "I would recommend this course to any other student who is interested in the intersection of literature and politics. A lot of non-majors also seem to take this class, and I think it could be a friendly introduction to the topic.",
                "Very much so. I think this course is really insightful and interesting.",
                "If interested in the material, yes. Its a very easy course to not get much out of and do fine if you choose to do so, but then its sort of a waste.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I feel that it provides a great background in political modernity. Our discussions of developments following the French Revolution provided a strong background on the important historical event, and tracking the changes in the meaning of centrism over time. An English class taught in a lecture-format is also pretty unique, and I think a lot of students would enjoy that element.",
                "pretty easy for an english class! only 2 essays during the year, and TAs are very willing to help u get a good grade on them. would recommend if the syllabus readings look interesting to you! if not, this class will feel like a chore.",
                "This might be my favorite class of this year! I really liked thinking about literature in conjunction with its authors' political views. The lectures were always fascinating, and if ever I was bored it was due to my own mindset and not due to Professor North.",
                "Yes!! As a STEM major, I was a bit daunted by the aspect of taking a political literature course. However, Professor North does a fantastic job at making the material approachable for students of all majors, and this class was incredibly engaging throughout.",
                "Yes! Great opportunity to read literature through a lens that you might not otherwise use.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student who is looking to draw connections between literature and political ideology and to do so in a course with a reasonable, fair workload. A student who is not very excited by the prospect of drawing connections between literature and political ideology may want to look elsewherethe lectures and section discussions in this course do tend to revolve around centrism.",
