                "Very good class.",
                "This course introduces the student to basic knowledge required of statistical research. Harry makes lectures are easy to follow and makes sure everyone understands what is going on, which is great for people who find statistics intimidating. He speaks enthusiastically about the subject and you can tell he really enjoys teaching the class. A weakness is that the homework problems from the textbook often require you to peruse through various examples and theorems in the book, so I spent hours trying to understand those. Doing those problems was not particularly rewarding because I felt like I just bullshitted my way through by mixing together a bunch of concepts I did not really understand at a rigorous level.",
                "Homeworks and exams were very challenging.\r\nDid not like the textbook - it had many typos and was confusing at times\r\n\r\nMaterial was very interesting!",
                "great course",
                "The homework takes too much time.",
                "Professor Zhou is an excellent teacher who gives well structured and clear lecture. The course material is at good balance between understandable and achievable.",
                "Though the weekly problem sets seemed like a lot in the beginning, near the end they became shorter which definitely helped it to be more manageable. Despite weekly problem sets being quite a lot, it was helpful in helping us apply what we learned in class and remember it better.",
                "Strengths: the course moved at a very reasonable pace and all topics were explained thoroughly.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none, only potential weakness might be the fact that the lecture wasn't recorded. Sometimes the p-sets were quite difficult and required some sort of trick to solve - office hours was always quite packed.",
                "Strengths: Harry is a fantastic professor and person, lectures are fun and homeworks are fair\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think sometimes the course could've had more guidance, but this has graduate students primarily so I guess that makes sense",
                "Strength and weakness (more so the former than the latter): Professor Zhou is incredibly knowledgeable understanding, and perhaps he is too nice. I feel that sometimes the pace of the class was a bit slow - when Professor Fan taught this class a lot more ground was covered. Sometimes I wished that I learned more about asymptotics which Professor Fan covered, but most of the times I am really glad that this class wasn't very demanding and I was still able to learn a lot about the development of mathematical statistics."

Otherwise, take it if you're interested in statistics, but know that you can get just as much of an intellectual challenge from taking a math, physics, or CS class that may be more useful for your career.",

                "Only if you want to get a deeper understanding of estimator construction and evaluation.",
                "I'd recommend it only if the student has a strong interest in theoretical statistics (ie: is potentially interested in pursuing graduate studies.) A lot of the topics are really interesting and fun to think about, they're just very theoretical.",
                "Yes, I would! Harry makes this course (and any course) worth taking. He is my favorite professor in the S&DS department without a doubt. Lectures were fun to go to, and he makes a huge effort to ensure everyone understands the content. He also sprinkles in personal anecdotes and jokes throughout. Content-wise, you probably know what you're getting into if you're reading this review - it expands on 242 but goes much much deeper, and you learn why those statistical inference tools from 242 are true. It's got a lot of rigorous math, and the way Harry runs the course, the exams are take-home and open-everything (including ChatGPT) but he expects a 50 to be the median score/A threshold, so that should give you a sense of how challenging the content is. But in the end it's very worth it and I'd highly recommend to anyone wanting to get the most rigorous statistics treatment of any course at Yale.",
