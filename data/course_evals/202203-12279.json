                "This course taught me how to break down complex anthropological theory into a framework I could apply to my own life, and specific cultural contexts. I learned how to delve into ethnographies and discuss them in the class context.",
                "I learned a ton about the garment industry as a whole as well as the specific experience of clothing producers and consumers around the world. I learned how clothing adapts to the human body and gains meaning from various physical, cultural, and political factors.",
                "I learned a lot about methods of applying anthropological theory to my everyday life, which actually was incredibly really meaningful to me as a student and a person. A major lesson I learned in this class is that clothing is never neutral-- when we wear clothing, we are always, if subconsciously, expressing something. The question of what to wear is a matter of birth, death, marriage, labor, money, and beauty... we are swaddled in cloth from the moment we are born! And through every moment in our lives thereafter we are defined by how we dress.",
                "This course provided me with a better background of social theory regarding material culture and taught me how to understand ethnographic accounts of individuals within greater economic structures.",
                "I learned so much in this course! The primary topics that stand out to me include clothing as a cultural, political, and social actor, the global thrifting network and global trade market, textile production as gendered work, and clothing as entangled with the body and visual sphere. I gained insight into anthropological and ethnographic studies of clothing and into India and its history with textiles."

                "Strengths: super engaged professor- always willing to clarify ideas and concepts (especially since some of the readings reference some philosophy that many do not have the knowledge of). Assignments were always clear and we actually got to engage with the content outside of the classroom (we took trips to the art gallery and the beinecke). \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes readings felt repetitive and other times quite dense. Extra credit was offered but only if you could attend guest lectures out of class (which I couldn't attend due to work)- maybe would be more beneficial if these extra credit opportunities could be more accessible/flexible with many people's schedules? Sometimes feedback on assignments/reasons behind grading were vague.",
                "Strengths - This course used a really awesome mind mapping process by which Professor Lynch wrote down comments made by classmates on the whiteboard, thereby creating a really cool visual collage of what we had discussed which was accessible for reference later on. The class was very unintimidating, because we were given the opportunity to share \"half-baked\" comments, and so there was no need to formulate a super sophisticated comment before sharing it with the class. The discussion was just a space for exploration. Weaknesses - More feedback on the papers and engagement with students during the paper writing process would have been helpful. The Prof expected you to cite readings from class in papers on completely different topics, which took a good deal of maneuvering.",
                "Strengths: diverse and interesting readings. Great discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the essay prompts were a bit restrictive and didn't allow for engagement with some of the topics from the course. Grading was harsh even though no firm rubric or expectations were communicated.",
                "Seminar conversation flowed in a way that was better than any seminar I have had before. Also, love the syllabus! I could not tell you any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: The course material was well organized across the course of the semester, the readings were engaging and ranged in topic but all connected with each other, the museum visits were engaging, fun, and still relevant to the course material, and there was time for both large group discussion and small group discussion, which improved the seminar format.\r\nWeaknesses: Having a TA in this course was ultimately confusing, as grading from the professor and TA did not align.",
                "Very engaging content and readings and I loved the class trips to the museums. In discussions, would be great to talk more about  the readings. Though I appreciate the free flow of the discussion, sometimes it felt like we missed a lot of the rich content in the readings."

                "Yes! I felt that this class was super interesting and got to the heart of a lot of topics. We have lots of flexibility with paper topics and everyone seems very excited to actually write our final papers.",
                "I would! This is such a unique class--you won't find any other fashion classes because there is so often a stigma around fashion that makes it appear shallow or unacademic, which is completely untrue. Beyond fashion, this course had such an interesting set of materials about Khadi and Ghana's india, including an in person trip to the Beinecke to see original materials and fabrics from Ghandi.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class if you are into fashion. It touches on a lot of interesting perspectives and will give you a completely new perspective on clothing and our dress choices. It will make you second guess why people choose to wear specific clothes and what influences impact that decision for different people around the world.",
                "This is the best course I have taken so far at Yale. Professor Lynch is an absolute gem of a professor and I can't recommend taking a class with her highly enough. This course will teach you not only about anthropology and the anthropological canon but also about every piece of clothing you put on herein. I actually cannot recommend this course enough. I thought the readings were incredibly applicable to my life and that there is relevance in the course material to every single person (we must, as is socially prescribed, all wear clothing). \r\n\r\nThis class changed my life, definitely, and I will think about our discussions and readings for the rest of my life. TAKE THIS CLASS! PLEASE",
                "Yes! Even for people not planning on majoring in ANTH or SAST, this course was fascinating, and I felt it was easy to become heavily engaged with the readings.",
                "I would recommend this course to every student at Yale. Especially if you are needing a credit in humanities/social sciences, this is a great introduction to anthropology and ethnography. At the same time, this class is great for someone in the social sciences/humanities as well. The reading load is manageable and the writing is as well. This class is quite theoretical, so it is also great for discussions and analyzing a common practice (like wearing clothes) and seeing the importance of these 'small' decisions.",
