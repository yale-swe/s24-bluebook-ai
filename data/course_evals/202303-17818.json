                "strenghts: very chill, super interesting, not that much work, great teachers, learned a lot\r\n\r\nweaknesses: had no idea what my grade was in this course the entire time. assignments wouldn't be graded for months. a little unorganized when it came to actually publishing the papers we needed to read. the final project was fun but it was annoying that a few people chose a super boring topic for the entire class. I would prefer more of a science fair vibe where, in small groups, people could present on whatever they wanted. and why do we need to submit FOUR news & views? they get quite boring after a while. I'd honestly shift the format to be MORE lecture based, less discussion based / going over papers. Although reading the cutting edge papers is interesting and should definitely stay as part of the course, the professors have so much experience and so much knowledge, I just want to hear about what they do and absorb as much as I can from them.",
                "I liked that each professor taught what they are passionate about and research. I felt like the discussion part of the class was more stressful that necessary. It was jarring to have the professor in the back with a print out of faces from canvas marking every time you speak. I wish it felt less cold and calculated and more effort was put into creating an atmosphere where everyone wants to contribute, instead of feeling judged.",
                "The organization of the class was great!",
                "awesome professors, awesome course content",
                "I love this class! The content is really cool and approachable, and the professors are all clearly experts and passionate about what they work on. The only improvement I can think of is having a little bit more communication between the professors. I know it must be hard to coordinate between four instructors, but it made the course feel a little disjointed at times.",
                "The course was very engaging, and I really enjoyed the presentation+discussion format. The News and Views were great assignments that took a fiar amount of time but encouraged me to look more deeply into papers and understand them on multiple levels. I liked that the class met on Fridays for two hours. Practically no weaknesses."
