                "This course exposed me to topics and skills that I had not been exposed to before. I learned how to read scientific literature and while I was initially nervous to do this, working in small groups made this a lot less intimidating. I was able to practice my presentational skills through the various presentations we gave in class and now feel much more comfortable discussing topics in front of an audience. Overall, this class strengthened my passion for STEM and gave me more confidence that I will carry with me into other STEM courses at Yale.",

We also got practice grant writing and presenting, and in the second semester especially when we were covering a broader range of topics, I learned about some important history in biological research by reading some older landmark papers (mostly cancer biology)."

                "Strengths: teaches us to think and write like scientists, lots of opportunities for discussion and collaboration with classmates, Dean Chang is a great professor who cares a lot about his students and his work",
                "The strengths of this course is that it really does challenge students by forcing them to engage with the readings every week. One cannot understand the scientific articles if there isn't a lot of effort put into the readings.",
                "A weakness of this class is that students are somewhat thrown into the material from day 1 since we had a pset and 2 articles to read from week one. However, there is a lot of support so students are never left to do the work all alone. \r\n\r\nThis class has many strengths. The discussion based class time gave everyone a chance to engage and become more comfortable sharing their perspectives. The professor always made himself available to students and took lots of time to answer questions. The structure of the course allows for students of all levels to grow.",
                "Getting to know what is being discussed in science",
                "The course covered interesting research (landmark COVID papers in the fall, landmark cancer papers in the spring). We learned to read biology papers in depth, design our own experiments, give presentations, and write grant proposals. The class was a bit repetitive at times, having the same structure of a different student presenting in the fall and a discussion of the pset/next paper in the spring. Also, it uses up the first year seminar slot for the entire year. Psets are long and this may feel like more than a half credit of work.",
                "I loved how engaging the class was and how it allowed me to be more confident when reading scientific papers. I will say that spending a whole semester on Covid, though it was super interesting, got a little repetitive at the end of the first semester",
                "Strengths: This is a great course for STARS students. I really feel like I have such an advantage from being able to take this course, because I've learned skills that aren't taught in many classes or need to be learned during the experience instead of before. I can say without a doubt that I would not have been able to even understand, let alone do, the work I've done in this class at the beginning of last semester. I've improved signficiantly\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Only getting a 5 on AP Bio and not haven taken college bio yet makes this class a struggle to adapt to at first. The learning curve is steep. I feel like there should be a recommendation of taking it concurrently with the bio sequence here or having taken more advanced bio recently in high school.",
                "This course does an excellent job of teaching students how to read and understand research papers which is a useful skill for pretty much any field of study. It was also very engaging in both semesters although the format was different (students presenting papers in the first semester and Dean Chang lecturing in the second), and it made me more excited about research and biology in general. I think having us present often and design experiments (either to present or for problem sets) was an important component of the course. The problem sets were very well-written to help us clear up confusion about papers we were reading, and we were split into small groups to do problem sets throughout the year which helps us collaborate with and learn from classmates. Regarding improvements, since we didn't have exams, there wasn't much of an incentive to retain material from the semester, and although I don't think remembering the specifics of each paper is the point of the course, I think it could be useful to have some way to incentivize students to study more generally applicable information from the papers, like the techniques/methods that come up often in biological research. I think working in groups overall was very helpful, but I think some more individual work, whether it be on problem sets or presenting, would be useful to make sure everyone is understanding what's going on in class."

                "I would recommend this course to any student with a serious interest in research within the biological sciences, as PBR provides very useful knowledge, skills and opportunities to enter the research space.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. Wonderful mentorship from Dean Chang, essentially guaranteed summer funding, and learning to read papers and write grant proposals are invaluable skills.\r\n\r\nNote this is a full year class and often feels like MORE than a half credit of work.",
                "Absolutely. If you're eligible, take it. The skills I've learned in this class will stay with me throughout my Yale career and beyond. I can easily say this is the class where my improvement and gain of knowledge from start to finish is the clearest. Plus, you get to hang with Dean Chang.",
                "While this class did teach me a lot, it was very time-consuming and too much work for a 0.5 credit class.",
                "If you get a chance to take this course and you're interested in biological research, I would absolutely recommend it; PBR was by far my favorite class this year. The class is very small so it's easy to get your questions answered and to get to know the class/professor. Dean Chang also encourages the class to apply for the first-year summer research fellowship and teaches us how to write grant proposals for it/other research opportunities and gives advice on how to find a lab. Problem sets are sometimes challenging, but you have a group to do them with and office hours is also useful, so they're always doable and grading is far. The large assignments (presentations/research proposals) can be stressful, but you get a lot of time to work on them, and there aren't exams, which takes off a lot of pressure and lets you just enjoy learning in the class. It was also a nice way to get to know a group of people that will probably be taking similar courses who you'll see often around campus or during summer research."
