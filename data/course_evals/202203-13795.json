This course emphasizes collaboration and I learned how to incorporate my peers' thoughts into my own work. Additionally, I learned how to construct a capstone project of my own choosing which has been incredibly fulfilling.",

I learnt a bit from the other students in the course since they come from such a diverse set of backgrounds and are passionate about a range of really interesting things. Even then, the readings were mostly unenlightening, the discussion was poorly facilitated and the engagement was so low that most classes were painful to be a part of."

                "The strengths of this course are the written peer reviews, the 40-minute discussions per project, and the ability to work one-on-one with Jim.\r\nAs for what can be improved, I think the first half of the course should be dedicated to teaching us what a capstone is. It would be helpful if we could focus more on methodologies and receive guidance on how to construct a cumulative capstone project.",
                "Strengths: Jim Silk is incredibly knowledgeable and cares deeply about both the subject matter and his students. Not too much outside work, allowing for you to focus on your capstone.\r\nWeaknesses: it depends on your cohort, but this year's cohort was not super invested in the material.",
                "Strengths: the other students in the course, relatively flexible deadlines and expectations. Weaknesses: the expectations for the capstone in the cases where it was a project were so nebulous and made delivering on something valuable difficult - the range of products from student to student was wildly different and it contributed to the lack of cohesion. Jim hardly gave any feedback and when he did it was unfortunately neither timely nor helpful. The discussions were really poorly facilitated and it felt like a maximum of 4 people were ever really engaged at once. A bunch of people dropped out of the program and those of us that were left behind felt just as frustrated with the lack of quality of the program as a whole. I hope other cohorts have a better experience but ours was lacking for a long time, and to the dismay of those of us that tried to give it one last chance, the capstone failed to redeem it."

                "Its required for the human rights program so if you get in and decide to stay (which you do not have to if you dont feel fulfilled by it) you have to do it. If the program isnt deliberately and significantly improved I wouldnt recommend doing it and by extension taking this course. There was some effort to build community this semester and you could see Jim and Shannon trying but the experience hardly improved. Beyond the other students in the cohort, the Schell center funding, and the clout that being competitively selected for this program provides, there wasnt much else I gained from it unfortunately."
