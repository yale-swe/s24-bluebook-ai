On the other side of things, the course structure was occasionally confusing and I sometimes wasn't sure about what I was supposed to be doing on a week to week basis",
                "One strength of this class is that it meets every week, which strongly encourages you to make progress from week to week. A weakness of this class is that there aren't built-in requirements about communication with your advisor. I think it would be helpful if weekly assignments about reporting progress to the class also required reporting your progress to your advisor. It is both helpful and unhelpful that deadlines in this class are not very strict. On one hand, sometimes you feel like you need flexibility. On the other, in the long run, for the writing of the senior thesis, I feel like a greater number of intermediary deadlines would have been helpful to prevent me from writing everything at the last-minute."
