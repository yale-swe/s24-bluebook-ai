I am grateful for the opportunity to have been able to enroll in the labI feel I have a really solid foundation from NROTC courses and the supplement of this lab for all the miscellaneous things to now be starting in earnest in the fleet.",

                "It was always much too long. There was a planned activity that went well, but the ending announcements were reiterated millions of times will little variation, and this part could be cut out.",
                "I really enjoyed lab and actually looked forward to it, though to be fair that's easy to say when it's not a requirement. I always learned something, and I'm excited now to use what I've learned starting off with the Navy in earnest. I know my place in lab was a bit unorthodox, and I appreciated being included in a squad and in the senior break-out room and the flexibility of the unit to allow me to attend.\r\n\r\nMy one comment for improvement is that I did do 100% of the reading, and I looked over all the materials carefully; especially for the longer documents, I would have been excited to have a discussion about them and ask questions of the officers, not go over the key points again in a lecture format. The documents covered the key pointsthey provided neat summaries in bullets of the key points at the end of each chapter and an executive summary at the beginning, and a conclusion. If the expectation for lab is that we would read the documents in their entirety, we covered the key points neatly summarized at least three times before lab even started. It would have been great to spend lab time to hear the insights from the officers from their experiences in the fleet; I respectfully submit that this would be a better use of the time we have with the officers. I must also admit that it's a bit disappointing to come prepared and excited to talk about all the content covered and then not have a discussion on the material.",
