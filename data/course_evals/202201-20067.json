                "Strengths: The small class size is great for discussions and paper workshops. The paper workshops are actually so motivating and helpful. The three different units are split up very well and make for interesting paper topics. Most of the books are excellent. You learn an incredible amount about how institutions operate, which is different from most social theory classes, where you just talk in vague generalities about how power operates. Professor Dudley is so kind and is an excellent facilitator.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many. This is a great class. I think that essay draft deadlines could be pushed back a day (which is what ended up happening anyway, but would have saved some of my stress). Also, the Perry book felt outdated, and while I liked the Menakem, it didn't feel very academically rigorous in some of its research.",
                "Strengths: the syllabus was well organized and the three units within the course covered a lot of theoretical ground. Peer essay workshops were a particular highlight of the course. We were able to think collaboratively through the material and each student's distinct approach to it. \r\nWeaknesses: a few of the class discussions became repetitive as we circled around the same questions, although I think a larger class size would have helped",
                "Strengths: great class size, Prof Dudley is so articulate and asks wonderful questions, does a good job probing us for more; the essay workshops are also a great opportunity to stop and reflect\r\n\r\nWeakness: Would love a little more specific feedback on drafts from Prof Dudley",
                "Strengths: amazing readings, class discussion is well structured to push us to think critically about key concepts. Weaknesses: readings are a lot but they are fruitful!"

                "Yes!!!!! This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and I've taken a lot of great classes in the humanities and in cultural anthropology. First off, the material is gripping. You learn about how American institutions function in ways that control and oppress different groups, which feels like the perfect mix of social theory and ethnography. You get to theorize about yourself, which is a great exercise. And if you haven't taken a class that's a book a week, it's a great way to learn (although a lot of work). The format of the class is also ideal. The seminar is very small, and you write three short papers that you get to workshop. The workshop isn't actually scary; instead, it's really helpful. The prompts for the papers are also exciting to write. Finally, Prof Dudley is such a kind facilitator, and she pushes you to go deeper in your analysis.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in writing ethnographies or any who do not feel like they have a solid grasp of issues of inequality in the US. This course is also good for students looking to improve their writing.",
                "100%. If you want to really understand how inequality manifests and is experienced, take this course. Dudley is absolutely amazing and you will love the kinds of people drawn to this class, they are deeply thoughtful",
                "Yes! This has been one of the most eye opening classes I've taken that has changed the way I understand social inequality in my every day life. Learning about inequality through ethnography offers a critical, grounded perspective of how inequality is lived and experienced, rather than in statistics or in news reports"
