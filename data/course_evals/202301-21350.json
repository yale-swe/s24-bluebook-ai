It still is not fully there, but I am continuing the track!",

                "The course was structured so that students could learn in the lecture and practice what they learned in their discussion sections, which I felt like was a strength. One weakness was that the lectures were not recorded, so it was harder to understand the lessons if you wanted to rewatch part of a lecture that you didn't understand the first time around.",
                "Strengths: content. Weaknesses: lack of example problems in lecture, going too fast during lecture.",
                "This is just your standard intro lecture class. It's not bad per se, but it's not designed to be super exciting",
                "Very lecture-y, variance of TA levels, and lack of recordings were weaknesses. At the end of the day though, if you put in work, you learn a bit.",
                "Personally, I would have liked to see more PSet\/exam-like problems walked through in class.",
                "I feel that the syllabus is pretty strong although I didn't enjoy the lectures at all. Maybe it's just a me thing, but it was challenging to connect the way material was presented during the lectures to its application in psets. Discussion section helped here a lot.",
                "This course was just fine. Not very engaging and often hard to follow.",
                "Strengths: Lots of office hours opportunities, manageable workload, manageable exam difficulty level\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "This courses lectures can be a bit long and they need more example problems. The problem sets could be a little more difficult to match the level of the exam problems and prepare the students better. The workshops are great problems and examples to help with the course.",
                "This class was well-organized, well-taught, and it felt very fair. The problem sets were doable and didn't feel like a major burden. I think that the midterms were well-time in terms of when they were administered during the semester. A weakness of this course was the 1.5-hour lectures. I struggle to sit still and focus on one subject for that amount of time. I think it would be far more conducive to learning to have three lectures per week, 50 minutes each.",
                "The course was very basic with not any knowledge needed beforehand to grasp the topics, it is a true intro course so is correctly advertised. The amount of office hours and sections are more than enough for anyone struggling with material.",
                "Strengths: the curve. Weakness would probably be how unnecessarily difficult the course is considering its an introductory course that is NOT meant to be a weed-out.",
                "I think the topics were all very interesting, but lecture was not as engaging as it could have been. I found it hard, especially in the second half of the semester, to pay attention, and this seemed to be a common theme among my peers. I think introducing examples that would connect more to our daily lives when introducing new topics could be helpful and intriguing.",
                "It's a good intro course and covers a lot of topics. The course was organized and extra help was available. The lectures were less engaging but I think it's just the nature of an introductory lecture course.",
                "Lectures often confused me and I really only gained some understanding of the concepts from office hours and section. More clarity in the lectures would be appreciated, also recordings. A bit more understanding as well that this is a beginner class; I had no economics experience entering the class and quickly became lost.",
                "The lecture notes could be better.",
                "Strenghts:\r\nAs a humanities-student who are enrolled in a lot of smaller seminar courses, in which the level and system of organization depends greatly on the style and preferences of the individual professor, taking a large and well-organized class such as ECON 115 has been a pleasure. In my opinion, the system with two lectures a week and a voluntary smaller discussion session that one could attend in weeks where one needed extra support \/ time to ask questions, but where attendance was at one's own discretion, was extremely effective. Only towards the end of the semester did I start to benefit from student office hours as well as the larger review sessions held before the exam\/midterms, which are two excellent resources that I know so many students found extremely helpful. I appreciate that all the class material (lecture notes, but also answers to problem sets and review session materials) was posted on the well-organized canvas page, which made preparing for the final exam so much easier. The graded problem sets was a good way to ensure that one stayed on top of the material, and they were organized in a didactic way which helped me better grasp the concepts discussed in class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures could have been more interactive, and while the slideshows were clear it was sometimes hard to understand (especially regarding more analytical content) which parts of the lecture were tangental \/ central to a topic. I'm thinking for example of the distinction between the Cournot and Bertrand models of competition for duopolies, which turned out to be a key distinction for organizing the oligopoly-content, whereas the Bertrand alternative only appeared as an interesting extra piece of information during lecture.",
                "I think the textbook was very helpful but I do wish the lecture notes were more clear or the lectures were recorded. It was very hard to hear the professor in lecture and he did move from topic to topic very fast, so it definitely would have been helpful to have some sort of clear organized notes to study from or to have access to the lecture recordings.",
                "Course was organized and structured well and lectures and discussion sections were great.",
                "Lecture often moved too quickly, in my opinion. Prof. Berry spoke in grand terms to explain things that were actually really simple topics when I taught them to myself. I feel like the course required background knowledge that I didnt have.",
                "If the class were recorded, that would've helped a lot. Going back through the slides in preparation for the midterm\/final and deciphering what was taught in the lecture weeks ago was sometimes challenging.",
                "I think this course is taught very well.",
                "The lecture was very very disengaging and often times hard to follow. I often felt that the questions on the midterms or finals werent representative of what we learned as we did not go over much math at all during the lectures but that was what the exam was mainly made up of.",
                "This course could be improved with lecture recordings. I found it hard to catch up if I could not attend a class.",
                "strengths: informative introduction to macro\r\nweaknesses: could be more engaging",
                "I enjoyed this course. I think we couldve solved more example questions in lectures.",

                "Section is very helpful. The exams are modeled after the problem sets well. The exams did a good job of testing us on what we learned, but in ways that were not repeating processes we had done before. They forced us to apply what we learned in lecture.",
                "You learn a lot. Thats also a weaknesstheres a lot of content.",
                "The lecturer was difficult to understand when he was speaking and he often did not fully explain concepts, even when prompted by student questions. He was also not understanding when students needed to adjust exam dates or use accessibility accommodations. I appreciated the review sessions before the midterm and the final, they helped me to study a lot.",
                "Lectures moved very fast and were not recorded, which was tricky",
                "The problem sets were very manageable. It was possible to complete a problem set in as little as two hours, which was nice. The course, however, had no additional resources to learn from. There was a textbook, apparently, but there were no assigned readings. The lectures weren't recorded so we couldn't go back to understand Professor Berry's mumbles.",
                "Lectures are not recorded which puts those who have emergencies at a disadvantage.",
                "Lecture moves pretty quickly, sometimes its hard for me to keep up especially since all the materials were first exposure materials",
                "This course I would say is a very good introduction to microeconomics. I have a really solid understanding of the behavior of mass consumers and of firms, as well as how to measure their ideal action. This part I really through was tended to well.\r\n\r\nI would say that the more individual level of microeconomics was not touched on as well; I feel that I understand firms but not necessarily the way I should act financially, with investments etc, but I am sure that this will come later down the line.\r\n\r\nThe slides were of a great help in studying, and it was very accessible in terms of peer tutoring and office hours. Although, there was little feedback on exams.",
                "Strengths: The course was very well formatted and seemed clear. Weaknesses: A lot of material was crammed in right before (the week of) midterms, especially I felt that way for the second midterm.",
                "I wish we had done more concrete examples in class, as a lot of the problem sets and tests had questions that we didnt go over in class. But section and the review sessions were super helpful in that regard, so the TAs did a really good job there",
                "Video lecture recordings or more detailed lecture notes would be helpful for reviewing material.",
                "Strengths: This course was very accessible and there are a ton of resources that students can turn to for assistance, including peer tutors and TFs. Problem sets were pretty fair and so were exams. Lectures were pretty clear and as long as you attended, you could apply what you learned to completing problem sets and studying for exams. Sections were super helpful because we covered the exact kinds of questions you would see on the problem sets of the week. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were pretty centered around concepts and less so applications of those concepts so problem sets often took extra assistance to complete.",
                "The strengths of the course are the nature of the lectures, which are informative but also interesting and applicable to larger concepts, and the usage of discussion section to practice concepts discussed in lecture. \r\nDue to the amount of content however, lectures had less of the math\/equation content discussed, as it was mostly discussed during section. Including more math practice in lecture could improve student's understanding of the course even further.",
                "The lecture format makes it so that people are not rarely invested committed to the class. Students are too much on their own and the resources at their disposal are often insufficient to get a proper grip of the material. Section never covers all the material that was prepared. And it overall just feels like there is very little accompaniment for an institution of Yales caliber. ECON 115 could be an online course taken from an online educational provider and the difference would not feel very significant from what it is now as a Yale college lecture.\r\nThe TAs and course director have very limited availability and there is virtually no individualized feedback or support on how to improve in the course unless the student insists and takes a lot of initiative, which would be a fair expectation if the resources at our disposal were superbly efficient at providing individual feedback when asked for, but they are not.",
                "Professor Barry was very nice, however sometimes in class it was hard to follow along because he moved fast and mumbled sometimes. Great and kind professor though.",
                "Strengths: Section was very well taught\r\nWeaknesses: Peer tutoring was not well facilitated; peer tutors did not try to help students understand content material but rather preferred to hand out the answer and move on.",
                "I would say concepts are explained very well, however the course moves rather slowly",
                "Weakness: Lectures are not recorded, so even if you go to every class, you can't review the material well if you don't understand it the first time. Plus, it's fast-paced so it's hard to keep up.",
                "I think that section was a great strength of this course. Though they were technically optional, I went to every section and found it to be a great expansion\/ explanation of material that the professor may have glossed over or quickly gone through. I also think that the large class size was a benefit as it was better to have friends to compare PSETs with. I will also say that the shorter length PSETs was a huge relief in comparison to courses that have PSETs which take 6+ hours. I found that ECON PSETs were engaging and took only around 2 hours.",
                "Strengths: teaches many concepts abstractically or in a math context\r\nWeakness: the lecture style was really a downside for me and the discussions not being mandatory did not motivate me to attend so I struggled to understand a lot of the concepts because of the lack of commitment mechanisms. So you would really have to trust your own work ethic. Also, the class is not recorded so it is hard to keep up when you miss a day because the slides alone cannot help you understand the topics.",
                "It was a very large course.",
                "Strengths: Well-structured and efficient lectures, problem sets and section genuinely helped me understand the material better, tons of office hours across all of the TAs and plenty of opportunities to get help when needed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was difficult to get clear feedback from graders on mistakes in problem sets and exams.",
                "I think that lectures should be recorded because if a student has o miss a lecture, they should be able to learn the material regardless. At the beginning of the term, the lecturer claimed that one of the reasons that they were not recording lectures was because, in the semester before, recorded lectures would be watched much more before midterms and finals. Personally, I do not think that the study habits of students should influence the overall course.",
                "There is a lot of support provided to students in discussion sections, peer tutoring sessions, and office hours. But oftentimes these were necessary supplements to the lectures, which weren't always clear and required outside learning to fully understand to the point of being able to review them."

            "comments": [
                "Yes! Very accessible as you dont need calculus or anything like that. High school algebra is sufficient. It was also a great introduction to economics.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are considering studying economics. It gives you a good taste of the major.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in economics as microeconomics is the foundation.",
                "No; the material was organized in a way that was unnecessarily difficult to understand. Slides were not posted on time, laptops were discouraged, and people would show up to review session before the exams and learn completely new concepts by doing problems that simply could've been done in class.",
                "Honestly the lectures are really pretty good and discussion section is pretty helpful",
                "Only if there are recordings.",
                "No, not the course itself, but 115 is a pretty common prereq for a lot of other cooler classes, so in that sense I would recommend it.",
                "Sure, it's a good intro to microeconomics",
                "I mean it was fine just for the QR, but as someone who had no previous econ experience and wasn't planning on studying econ further, it was not totally engaging.",
                "Necessary prerequisite for many higher level economic courses. Would recommend the large lecture class with a better grading curve than ECON 110. Although grading curve is generous, definitely still need to be well prepared for exams.",
                "Yes, this class is a good foundation in economics.",
                "Yes, for sure!! This is a very worthwhile introductory course.",
                "I would recommend this course. The subject matter is pretty interesting, and professor Berry is a very skilled and entertaining lecturer.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as learning the basics of Economics is good background information whether you are an econ major or not, and it is not very hard at all so will not need to be a large time commitment outside of class.",
                "No, not if you havent already taken economics or Calc, or if you care greatly about your GPA. Its really difficult to get an A in the class so be weary of that, it is absolutely NOT A GUT.",
                "I would because it provides a good introduction to microeconomics. I think this is an important piece of knowledge to have with you as you leave college, even if you are not an Econ major.",
                "If a student intends to pursue economics, this is the necessary introductory course and it's pretty effective.",
                "Maybe, I think it will probably be helpful later on but the concepts were very difficult for me when I learned them in lecture and I only understood them when they were explained to me in office hours.",
                "Yes, I thought it was interesting.",
                "Yes! While the content may not always be the most engaging due to the introductory level of the course, ECON 115 nevertheless contains extremely pertinent and useful information also for a non-economics major like myself, by providing a solid foundation to an economics way of thinking about the world in terms of supply, demand, utility, opportunity cost and marginal analysis.\r\n\r\nInsights into the basic function and efficiency-problems \/ market failures associated with e.g insurance, government subsidies, taxes, and minimum wages will be useful in everyday life. To have gained a basic outline of ways to criticize but also appreciate the free market and perfect competition will help me understand and evaluate the arguments of economic debates that I encounter in the news or during national elections.",
                "No simply due to the lack of organized notes as I said above. Studying for and keeping up with this class was extremely hard.",
                "Yes, this was my first econ course, and I believe that its beneficial for everyone to have a basic of understanding of microeconomics regardless of major since we are faced with economic situations and decisions on a daily basis. I found the material to be interesting overall, and Prof. Berrys lectures were engaging. I would note that the workload is not too bad but not quite a gut.",
                "Only if you have to take it as a major requirement!",
                "Take this class only if you plan to major in Econ",
                "Yes I definitely would recommend this course to another student who is looking to dive into the economics world. The teacher is engaging and tas are very useful and instructive.",
                "No unless you need a QR",
                "I would definitely recommend this course!",
                "If a student is interested in studying economics",
                "I would. It is a good intro course, and the concepts matter in the real world",
                "No I wouldnt. The subject matter was very dry and uninteresting and the professor was not the best.",
                "Yes. I learned a lot.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you are interested in economics and the math that comes with it. Well I do feel I learned a little about the business side of things most of the class is just math.",
                "Im not sure.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student only if they are interested in economics",
                "Yes! Great introduction with manageable workload",
                "Yes, if they are interested in Economics. If they are not interested in economics, I would not advise them to take this course.",
                "Yes, if youre an econ student or if you want to learn more about microeconomics.",
                "Yeah I guess. Take it in the fall though.",
                "If it was required. It's not too difficult, just annoying and time-consuming.",
                "Yes - important foundational info, just not fun to learn",
                "This is not a fun introductory class. It will give you the basics of microeconomics, but the \"Ceteris Paribus\" scenarios in which we learn the concepts feel pointless to understand. If you have an interest in economics before coming to Yale, then take the course to get a feel of what econ is like at Yale. If you have no prior econ experience, then be ready to be disappointed by this introductory class.",
                "I would, it is engaging, and even for non-Econ majors, is a great way to learn how to view the economy and make smart financial decisions.",
                "Yes! It gives you foundational understanding of economics",
                "I would! I think Prof. Berry did a great job of bringing us to an understanding of MicroEcon. It is a great balance for the starting economic student; it is engaging and difficult, but not so difficult that it weeds out all of those who are on the fence, and not so esoteric that a beginner couldn't grasp it (but also not too elementary). A perfect mix and a very important class for a young college student!",
                "Yeah, even if you are not planning on majoring in econ, it's a good class to take  a quintessential college class. However, if you feel comfortable having done econ before, maybe try to skip it and go into intermediate (I sometimes wish I did.) But it's a low workload class for sure, especially spring semester.",
                "If youre in humanities\/social science, this is a really good QR to take. Micro provides you with a lot of baseline knowledge that is super helpful in the real world. You also dont need to be super engaged to do well.",
                "Yes, it is a good intro to Econ course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are majoring in something that requires any level of economic application. I think the topics covered in this course are pretty wide-ranging in the fields they may apply to and it's helpful to have this knowledge in your back pocket as you navigate other courses, even if Econ 115 isn't necessarily required as a prerequisite.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning more about economics. It gives you a quantitative understanding of economic concepts that are widely discussed, and deepens your knowledge overall. It is a good introductory course that encourages students to study more economics rather than deterring them.",
                "Ya sure. Its a good introduction to econ.",
                "Yes, if you are really interested in Econ and maybe are doing the major. I took this class because I had never taken an econ class in my life and I wanted to take one. If you are having these same thoughts, you really don't need to take the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are truly interested in expanding their knowledge of the economy\/majoring in economics. Otherwise, I feel as though there are more academically fufilling\/engaging classes offered at Yale.",
                "Yes I would! It was a good introduction to microeconomics, especially with Professor Berry.",
                "If you're looking for a QR and have no prior experience with microeconomics, no. Not the most interesting content and it's easy to get confused if you're not used to that way of thinking.",
                "Yes, I think that this is a good course to broaden your horizons and it's large enough that you're likely to find a friend or feel like there are always individuals learning at the same pace as you. Unlike major requirements, I think that ECON 115 is a great course to take for a social science credit or just out of interest as it would fit nicely into one's schedule.",
                "I would not unless you are an ECON major because it does not help the average person if they want to learn financial literacy or day to day economic details. It is also not engaging and you have to put in a lot of extra time if you really want to get the concepts.",
                "It is a required course for many majors.",
                "I have never taken any economics courses before coming to Yale, and this class definitely presented me with a new way of thinking about and modeling complex problems in a way that felt like a good intellectual challenge. I would recommend this course to Yale students who are interested in pursuing economics in the future or to students who are generally interested in gaining a basic understanding of models and logical reasoning in economics.",
                "Yes, I believe that microeconomics is an important topic and that it was taught well.",
                "I would. As someone who is not going into this kind of field, I still felt like what we learned could help me understand the flow and exchange of money on a micro level. The topics cover a balance of relevant abstract concepts and mathematical formulas. I wouldn't recommend the course to someone who doesn't want to put the time into actually learning and practicing the material, because without the drive to learn, you might get lost."
