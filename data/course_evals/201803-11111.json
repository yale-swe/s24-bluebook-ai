    "I appreciated the rigor of the course. However, I found that is had a disproportionate focus on a video and in that did not address the students interest in learning utilize the language. While it seems valuable to have content from the video, this should be reduced to allow the students to interact more with the language itself",
    "I quite liked the way the course was laid out with the frequent tests which helped me to keep up with the content.  I think the immersion aspect of the course is good as it gets you used to hearing French. But for learning some of the more complex grammar rules I think it would have been useful to switch for English for just a small section of the class to avoid lots of confusion."
