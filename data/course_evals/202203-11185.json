                "One major strength was that the lectures correlated with the homework assignments and grading expectations were made very clear. I found the coding in this class to be pretty accessible, but I had some prior coding experience from teaching myself some basic R.",
                "The homework was assigned a little uncomfortably close to the due date, and the office hours were not really helpful. Walter is a great help if you go to him in class though.",
                "I like the style of Jonathan and Walter! Hope the teaching path of these 2 professors could neutralize a little bit. The first part is kinda too fast and Walter is kinda taking safety speed. But overall I love it!",
                "I think the strengths of the course were that it did a good job of covering basic statistical concepts and presenting information in an understandable way. In the first half of the course, there were extensive office hours which helped with problem-set completion. In terms of weaknesses, I think the shift to the second half of the course was a challenge. Lectures were more restrictive (only in-person and synchronous) and there were many fewer peer tutor hours.",
                "Strengths: You learn stats, it's nearly always engaging, and overall fun. Weakness: Grading on homework can feel opaque, exams are designed so that slightly misreading a question can lead to large point deductions, and there is a discontinuity between the first and second part of the course.",
                "I found the first half of the course to move very fast through concepts that took me a while to grasp.",
                "The content was comprehensive and covered a lot of ground. Office hours were incredibly helpful and the homework reinforced concepts learned in class. The recordings allowed for a lot of flexibility. Only weakness was that providing practice problems for test prep would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: learning to code in R. This is such an applicable skill and the class homework assignments were very easy to understand, engage in, and learn from. Also, there are always office hours going on which is really comforting. Truly, there is so much help for students to take this course. \r\nWeaknesses: the first part of this course was simply introductory statistics that didn't apply to life sciences at all. It would be really nice if the entire course were life sciences focused, but I completely understand why it was organized this way."

                "It gives good life skills like learning R (which I'm glad I know how to do now), but it is not particularly interesting in my opinion. So if you're just looking for a QR credit, look somewhere else, but if you want to learn a new skill this is fine.",
                "Yes! JRS is a great instructor to learn basic stats, and Professor Waltz, although goes slow during lecture (which is not at all a bad thing!), is very nice and you can learn a lot by paying attention. Although during the second half of the class student's need to learn how to use R, I found that it wasn't as challenging as I thought it would be, and I have NO coding experience prior to this.",
                "I would recommend the course if you're looking for a good introduction to statistics and modeling, but I wouldn't say it gave me some great insight into biology or ecological statistics specifically.",
                "Yup! If you want to learn stats at Yale in a relatively stress-free environment, this is a great class!",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student because it provides a good foundation in R, which is very useful to have.",
                "Yes, it's often required but it is truly helpful for understanding graphs in scientific papers and interacting with statistics in a variety of fields.",
                "Yes! I really loved the life sciences statistics course because the material is just so applicable. We learned R at an introductory level which is perfect if you want to know how to code to make graphs that are useful in scientific papers, but you don't necessarily want to spend hours learning an entire programming language."
