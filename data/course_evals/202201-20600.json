            "comments": [
                "Strength: well-collected examples and research studies to support the concepts. All the research studies McCarthy cites are super relevant and build on top of each other.\r\nWeakness: Sometimes felt like drinking from a fire hose, it could be too intense in terms of amount of content.",
                "Weakenss: requiring so many hours a week of course engagement.  I have never spent this many hours on a single class weekly ever in my life.",
                "This course is a way way way to much work. There are hours and hours of pre-class lecture videos you need to watch to understand what is going on during lecture. Each week there is basically a 3 hour take home midterm. It is too much content jammed into this course. This class should be split in half in terms of content and work.",
                "Strengths: lots of resources and material available to students \r\nWeakness: information overload a lot of the time",
                "I think the biggest strength of this course is the instructor, Professor McCarthy. He organizes the class extremely well and does a really great job keeping the lectures engaging. I also think the qsets are extremely helpful learning tools. I felt like I learned so much from this class and much of that was due to the way the class was organized and the way Professor McCarthy lectured. I would definitely say this was my favorite course of the semester and the year, the content was really fascinating and it was presented in a way that was really conducive to learning while being relatively low stress. The only way I would improve the course would be to have a little bit more specific preparation for the final. I think even a couple of sample questions could take some of the pressure off the final; even though we have weekly quizzes and qsets it's hard to know exactly how questions will be formatted and where we should focus our studying, especially since it's a very content-heavy course.",
                "The course provides an intensive survey of neuroscience and got me interested in the field more than I was before taking the class. I think there should be fewer lectures on vision and more devoted to basic brain anatomy. Also, while I made good use of the pre-recorded lectures, it removed the incentive to attend live lectures.",
                "It's incredibly overwhelming. It takes time to figure out what you actually need to pay attention to because the class is semi-flipped; previous lectures are on the course website and we are recommended to watch them prior to coming to the lecture, which essentially covers the exact same content and we are also expected to read the lecture notes, which cover the lectures but also go into far more detail than the lectures. The pre-recorded lectures occasionally have more content than the live lectures and vice versa, so you definitely miss things through the cracks if you don't do every aspect of the class. I definitely feel as if this course could be consolidated because it's just so much content in so many different spots. Additionally, I really disliked that announcements were made through Ed Discussion. It's very easy to lose those announcements in the thread!\r\nHowever, this is a very solid course. I feel as if you can really fall into a comfortable routine with the class and how you absorb the material, although it takes time to figure out how you should do so. The lack of pressure in terms of the grading makes the class way less anxiety-inducing, although it definitely doesn't set you up well for the final. I wish that the final reflected more of the style of the rest of the course, potentially being a final paper or cumulative final project as opposed to a recall-only exam, especially because the bulk of our assignments are open-note question sets. The question sets are amazingly structured and honestly served as a great way for me to fully process the work that I took my notes on. The grading breakdown on GradeScope was incredibly helpful when I wanted to go back and study the material later. There were some issues with the technology this semester, but once we had access to the answers for our quick quizzes and question sets, they became incredibly valuable tools to return to to study from. This is definitely a class that I wish I were more engaged in and had more of a capacity to engage in because I know that it was structured really well to be conducive to success and learning.",
                "No strengths, way too much content covered. Professor McCarthy expected everyone to be watching upwards of 2 hours worth of video lectures prior to every class which was completely ridiculous",
                "Strengths: I really do feel like I've learned a lot about the brain, even if the amount of information is overwhelming. Professor McCarthy's online videos are also very helpful--he gives you a lot of resources that help you succeed. I also enjoyed the qSets--I think these are great for students' grades and also a good way to integrate each week's material. Weaknesses: I took this class as a requirement and was thankfully able to Credit/D it, but there is way too much information. The online videos add up to like two hours (which would be 4 hours per week) and the in-person lectures are like another hour and fifteen minutes. Additionally, even though Professor McCarthy said we would go more in-depth during in-person lectures, it was often just a repeat of the online lectures (down to the jokes), so I found these unhelpful. I understand that we had a lot to cover, but it all felt a bit tedious to me.",
                "P-SETS should be timed. Dreaded doing them. Would have loved to break it up throughout the week.",
                "Strengths: All the lectures contain super interesting and useful information. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There's so much information presented so quickly its hard to engage with any of the information to the degree you really want to. Additionally, while I liked the flipped classroom format, it was a bit hard to keep up with watching the videos before lecture sometimes because of how lengthy they were sometimes. It was a lot of time to attend scheduled lectures (3 hours), watch prerecorded lectures (2-4 hours), complete asynchronous qSets (3 hours), all before Sunday each week.",
                "I liked that we had qsets and that they were worth 75% of our grade. However, the grading of the qsets is harsh.",
                "Although the course material is very interesting, there is just too much information that is expected of students to learn.",
                "very organized and loved qsets because it actually facilitated learning over having quizzes or midterms throughout the semester without the pressure and stress",
                "This course is very memorization heavy. Take that as you wish. If you struggle with memorization, the course might be tough. That being said though, it is fairly interesting and not too difficult all things considered. The only problem I have is that there was no feedback or key provided for problem sets, meaning you never knew why you got something wrong or what the correct answer, which doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nThis course does have one major drawback though. The fact that you are expected to attend live lectures and watch several hours of recorded lectures each week is ridiculous. It makes this course a 2-credit workload at least. Personally, I never watched the recorded lectures and got by alright, but it can put you at a disadvantage to do just one depending on your background in neuroscience.",
                "strengths-- good online notes and pre-recorded lectures, ED was a good platform for asking questions, very interesting course, liked the organization of weekly QSets and quick quizzes and then a final\r\n\r\nweaknesses-- lectures could be a bit dry, had difficulty focusing during lectures, a lot of material in very little time",
                "I found the format of the course difficult to engage with. The lectures and the recorded videos covered almost the same material, which made it difficult to pay attention in class, as I knew I would have notes on the topic from watching the prerecorded lectures. This was unfortunate, because when I was taking the final I realized I had a much better memory for things that happened in class than things I saw on the recorded lecture. If I were to teach the course, I would center the lectures and not expect people to watch the prerecorded lectures in order to ensure that people come to class and take good notes. \r\n\r\nI found the written course notes quite helpful. \r\n\r\nAlthough I read that the point of the qsets was for us to study beforehand so we were studying the material throughout the course, I found that I could do the qsets successfully without studying beforehand, and just looking for information in my notes if I did not remember something. (In general, I read faster than average, so this might not be typical, though from talking to people I believe it may be). Given the volume of material in the course, and as a non major (I took the course to see if I would be interested in being a neuro major) I felt that the format of having everything open book made sense. I would strongly suggest, however, either making the final open book or having 3 or 4 closed-book in-class midterms like it throughout the semester (and teaching significantly less material), because the way the course worked, I memorized/studied no material during the semester and crammed all of the information the day of the final. The format of most things being open book suggested to me that this was how I was intended to take the course.",
                "Strengths: lots of resources; Weaknesses: expectation to do 2hr+ of work outside of lecture time only for lecture time to repeat the same information, the final covered the entire semester so it was a lot of study for",
                "I think the class is super well organized. However, I will say it can be intimidating at first when it is advertised that we need to watch the pre-recorded lectures before class. I think they should be encouraged to be watched, but not advertised as a must-do because that was intimating at first.",
                "I found the amount of videos we were expected to watch before every lecture to be really overwhelming.",
                "very frustrating course design-the videos made us do the equivalent of 4 lectures a week. I spent an absurd amount of time on the class and did not feel like I was able to retain any knowledge. the qsets were often not fairly graded (full credit would be taken off for even just one word). at one point the TAs were 5 qsets behind in their grading.",
                "so much work: lecture notes, pre recorded lecture videos, AND live lectures plus q-sets. At the end of the day, I don't know how much I actually learned--definitely crammed before the final. I wish the course was two semesters long",
                "This course provides an incredible wealth of information for students to learn about the human brain. As a neuroscience major, I found the content fascinating, and I felt very reaffirmed in my major. \r\nThere was, however, an extremely large amount of content that was covered on a week to week basis. I think that it would be helpful if perhaps the course videos were consolidated into thirty minute or, at the maximum, hourlong videos to watch before in-class lectures. It got harder to keep track of them as the semester progressed, because they were very time consuming. \r\nI also really liked the timed, open-note qSets, rather than having midterms. I do, however, think the final was extremely difficult and stressful to study for because it was the first closed-note exam that we had to prepare for  and it covered every single lecture from the entire semester. I am not sure how feasible this is, but it might be good to have a 24-hour, take-home, open-note final. I feel that this would be the best representation of what we had been learning in the class and the style in which the learning was enforced (a timed, open-note problem set).",
                "Strengths: Greg Mccarthy is absolute strength. You can clearly tell he is very knowledgeable about what he is teaching. The fact that he has an entire website full of detailed course lecture notes and videos makes it really easy to stay organized and what to expect each week for preparing for the weekly question sets. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The workload can be quite high, so definitely take this class in a semester where you know you would be able to dedicate most of your time to this class. There are weekly 3 hour question sets that you must complete in a one time sitting so also take that into consideration! But the main part of this class that can be quite stressful is preparing for the final. Make sure to be reviewing the material weekly or start studying for the cumulative final a good 2 weeks in advance. The final is cumulative with material on 26 lectures and a whole section on clinical syndromes and brain anatomy so itll be SO much stress if you leave it to the last minute",
                "I loved the way this course was structured. The weekly homework problems were a great way to solidify the concepts that we learned in lectures.",
                "Strengths, Prof McCarthy is good, explains things well. There are also lots of resources to help you learn the material such as written notes and prerecorded videos. \r\nWeaknesses, the flipped classroom and the way the class was run was not great. Being expected to watch over the lecture times worth of prerecorded videos, sometimes significantly more, then show up to class only to hear repeated information from the videos was not a great use of time. I stopped going to class in person and instead used the class time to watch as much of the prerecorded videos as I could in that time, which of course, was never actually enough time to watch it all.\r\nImprovements, all the content that we should be expected to know should be covered in the live lectures, the prerecorded videos should just be used to supplement our learning, not as a necessity on top of in person class. This is a really interesting class I just wish it was taught better.",
                "I wish that we could have been given a midterm that would help me check my understanding rather than waiting for the final to cover all 26 lectures.",
                "This course has a lot of material and much of it was repetitive the recordings and notes and live content was super excessive but i did learn a lot",
                "The reversed model is confusing because the actual lectures covered 90% of the same material, significantly increasing lecture watching time. However, the q-set model was really nice!",
                "Watching the pre videos and attending lectures twice a week can be too big of a time commitment by the time midterms roll around. Ended up needing to choose one or the other.",
                "Thr course content is very very interesting. However, the amount of work is overwhelming. This would not be such a large problem if there was more flexibility in the way the work had to be done. 3 hours is long time to spend working on one assignment, especially when it was very rare that I had 3 hours straight to work, and considering my specific methods of concentration and productivity.",
                "This course relies far too heavily on recorded lectures, at the expense of cultivating a sense of community or exciting live lectures. The recorded lectures are so singularly important to quizzes and grades that it is very easy to become unmotivated to got to class in person- a great shame. \r\nThere is is no interaction with TAs or personalised support, other than the grading of Qsets. \r\nI don't know the name of a single TA.",
                "Very knowledgeable professor, but I found that the course was extremely dense and repetitive. Lectures covered the exact same material as the prelecture videos and readings.",
                "The only weakness that I can think of was the final exam. While we learned everything on the final exam, there was just so much information from the semester that it was incredibly difficult to study for. I think the organization, material, and teaching of the course is very strong. I enjoyed lectures, as Professor McCarthy does a great job explaining and organizing content. I also think that the information was also accessible, as Professor McCarthy provides an abundance of resources to students. I think that the open-book weekly question sets were a great way to reinforce learning and assess.",
                "The course was very well organized and it was easy to know what the students were responsible for, but the workload for each week was too great to sustain and it felt impossible to recover if you fell behind.",
                "I think that this course, by nature, throws a lot of information at you and expects you to retain it. I felt like the sets were helpful in developing a concrete understanding of this information in a productive way but the quick quizzes were less helpful in this regard. I feel like there needs to be more optional review resources and activities (outlines, study guides, etc) available to help students focus on key ideas, concepts and content from the huge amount of content in this course. The online recorded lectures were very helpful, but at the same time, made attending in person lectures seem pointless and just added an unnecessary time burden. Perhaps, if students are encouraged to both watch the online lectures and attend in person, the in person lecture should be more of a big topic, interactive format.",
                "Qsets were very helpful with keeping up with class material but a study guide for the final would be helpful because there was so much material through the year and I didnt know what was important to know.",
                "Strengths: learn a lot of info in a short amount of time, no midterm, psets forced weekly learning so you don't really get behind. Weaknesses: way too much information expected to remember, minimal guidance for final exam format/content.",
                "strengths: website, clear lectures\r\nweaknesses: high workload",
                "Strengths: Lots of information resources to learn from (website notes, old pre-recorded lectures, live recorded lectures, etc)\r\nWeaknesses: The class was a bit disorganized and requires a lot of unnecessary work. The homework required before lectures were exorbitant and often very repetitive so it made lecture feel like a waste of time. There was also very little room for meaningful engagement with the class (sections, smaller grou work, consistent office hours, etc). The breadth of the class also felt extremely overwhelming.",
                "The strengths of this course is that there is a lot of interesting information. The weakness of this course is that there is an overwhelming amount of information. Additionally, the 3 hour question sets are very difficult to do in one sitting since I have to find 3 straight hours where I am not busy.",
                "I really appreciated that the classes were recorded so you could go back and listen to lectures in order to better understand content. However, this class seeks to explain so much content and I found it overwhelming - in order to keep up, it felt as though I could only think about one week of content at a time rather than building my knowledge throughout the course of the semester. Some improvements I would like to this class would be extra peer tutoring/office hours sessions for classes or more accessible sessions. If we had these opportunities, I was not aware of them. Finally, I found that the final for this class was highly stressful and not a great test of whether I understood the course content. It was a test on whether or not I could memorize I semester's worth of content, not whether I understand and could apply what I had learned.",
                "The strengths of the course are the comprehensiveness of the class, the interesting content that is covered, and the studies and examples given to understand brain function and how different parts work independently and together. The main weakness of the class is the final exam, which is so comprehensive and requires the knowledge of so much detail (especially when all the other assignments are open book), that it makes it difficult to know all the information necessary to feel confident on it.",
                "it's alllloottttt of content and it's not super explained how you're supposed to learn it all, can be very overwhelming",
                "There's a lot of material to this class, and the time commitment it asks for seems a little impractical. The material itself is interesting, but it can be hard to balance this class with everything else. Review sessions near the final were very helpful. Ungraded quick quizzes were very helpful as well, as it gave me a chance to see what I actually knew.",
                "The biggest weakness of this course was the attempt to use prerecorded lectures along with live in-person lectures. It was essentially the same content (even using the same slides). It seemed like too much information that was not very engaging. It was nice to have the weekly Q-sets, but when it came to the final, I realized I did not understand a lot of the material because I relied on my notes for the Q-sets.",
                "The 3hr qset every weekend was difficult in the timing of itwould be helpful to be able to stop and re-open later. I wish we had more opportunities to practice recall in the same format of the final because I was used to open note everything prior to it. A midterm might have been helpful so it wasnt so overwhelming prepping for the final. I liked having resources, but it would be helpful to have some listed as required and some as recommended because there are so many its hard to know where to start (for example, pre-recorded lectures were very similar to in person lectures and it wouldve been nice to know that earlier). Weird that some qset problems were given partial credit and others not. \r\n\r\nI really admired the organization of the course. Dr. McCarthy is clearly very accomplished and passionate about neuroscience, which made me enjoy the course seeing his fascination of the brain.",
                "strengths: the qsets!! loved having the open note format, feel like i learned a ton without being too stressed out\r\nweakness: lots of information and video watching /note taking",
                "strength: good for students who want a foundation for more advanced neuroscience courses\r\nweakness: the mixed lecture format does not make much sense for a post-covid, in person class.",
                "Good information and content, but it is very material heavy and more should be done to reinforce concepts rather than push through more and more each weak in my opinion and that would improve the course.",
                "Strength: knowledge acquired is vast. Weakness: going from weekly open note exams to a closed note final is an invitation for cramming and is not conducive to student learning.",
                "Strengths:\r\nWeekly qsets reinforced learning \r\nProfessor explained things thoroughly \r\nWeaknesses:\r\nWeekly qsets were graded harshly\r\nFinal exam was memorization based while the rest of the class wasnt and this made it very difficult \r\nVery heavy workload as too much material was covered",
                "Online content + in person content complicates things. It was difficult to attend to what was often 6 hours of lecture per week + online reading supplements.",
                "The course had an insane amount of pre-work. Before each class, we would need to read though a long notes page and watch at least 2 hours worth of pre-recorded videos. This is extremely demanding for college students and makes it nearly impossible if you have other work to do that night. It was a struggle not to fall behind. The lectures basically said the same information. I enjoyed going to lecture, but could not always get the most out of it because I couldnt complete all of the pre-work the night before. I think that the class is good, but there is way too much pre-work. Also, it might be helpful if Professor McCarthy did a little recap each time of the general points from the last lecture. He would often mention the specifics of a brain area once and then just assume that you knew everything about it the next time he mentioned the part. This would lead to a lot of confusion for me.",
                "I liked that the Qsets were open-book; however, it felt very crammed for the closed-book final.",
                "Strength: Professor McCarthy is very passionate about what he teaches\r\nWeakness: Assignments were fairly bland",
                "Its so hard. DONT take it.",
                "I think the weekly assignments were a little too easy (not enough critical thinking questions) and we should have had practice with exam style conditions before the final, maybe a midterm would be best (or having the quizzes count).",
                "I think the most common issue with human brain is that the lectures are very dense and it is difficult to retain so much information. For better memory consolidation, I have a slightly absurd proposal. I personally felt it would have been better if qsets happened before the live lectures based on self study of the recorded lectures. For example, at the end of week 1, there could be a qset on recorded lec 1-4, due before live lec 3, with some grace period for Add/Drop.  The quick quiz for week 2 then will be the last step after lec 4 to finally test how much we learned through lec 4. Then the qset for the weekend will be on lec 5-6, due before lec 5.",
                "Strengths: Instructor clearly cares, well organized material.\r\nWeaknesses: too much content. Paring it back would allow for better internalization. Hard to know what to focus on and lecture format not conducive to learning.",
                "It was well organized and the Qsets were doable if you tried.",
                "Needs to be synchronous",
                "If the in-class lectures were supposed to be a general overview of the lecture videos, then why werent lectures shorter?",
                "The information was interesting but it was taught in a flipped classroom model I really didn't like.",
                "The quick quizzes and weekly qSets were strengths of the course as they forced me to more deeply engage with the content and revealed how much information I actually retained from lectures. The structure of watching prerecorded lectures to obtain the courses main content and then using in-person lectures as a sort of review is, in my opinion, a weakness of the course. It takes an incredible amount of time outside of class when in-person lectures could be used for the main content instead.",
                "The strengths of the course were that it offered a fair introduction into neuroscience. Weaknesses were that it was a lot of information to be covered in a short amount of time and you had to be OK going into the final not knowing certain chapters.",
                "WAY too high of a course load. Would have been much more motivated to stay on track and be fully invested if there were less to work on.",
                "The amount of content expected for this course is far beyond reasonable even for Neuroscience students.",
                "I think this course is well organized and highly loaded with valuable information. A weakness of the course is the \"flip-class\" method of teaching that requires the student to watch the lecture and read notes before the lecture is taught in class. It asks too much of the student, both in terms of time and effort. I wish there was a midterm in this class with low stakes in order to facilitate the learning of the material from the first half of the course. The lack of a midterm and instead weekly question sets does not promote the aggregation of information, but rather the rapid learning and forgetting of information presented in each consecutive week.",
                "Strength: Great content and lectures\r\nWeaknesses: very intensive",
                "Strengths Prof McCarthy is clearly very passionate and engaged with the course content. The class covers an IMMENSE amount of information that is all pretty interesting if you are interested in the brain/nervous system/neuroscience. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses there is so much information!!! which can be a good thing but it is incredibly hard to pick out what is important/crucial about the information presented. I know there is a shortage of TAs for the class but a discussion section to reinforce the material outside class would be incredibly helpful. The qsets are a lower stress way of reinforcing information, but after completing the course I would almost prefer having a midterm and a final in addition to the qsets just so we have a sense of how tests will be performed and what types of concepts are important to focus on. I also think it would have been much more helpful to have learned and dedicated more time to the anatomy at the beginning of the course because I did find myself lost much later on and having to reference notes to piece things together.",
                "Weaknesses: way too much content for non neuroscience majors",
                "The strengths of this course are the prerecorded lecture. I think that at this point there's really no way to improve the course.",
                "this course was great! well designed for consistent learning and improvement",
                "Too much information all at once to absorb and be tested on",
                "wEAKNESSES: FINAL SHOULD NOT BE CLOSED BOOK! AND SHOULD BE LESS OF A PERCENTAGE SINCE IT IS SO MUCH INFO.",
                "The material of this course was fascinating, and I found the structure to be set up very well for learning. I would suggest perhaps having discussion sections instead of live lectures to help contextualize the material in the prerecorded lectures as well as creating one practice exam for the final. Alternatively, the final exam could also be more conceptual and instead be an open book exam. Taking the final exam with only the quick quiz questions as practice was simply not enough preparation for the test questions. Other than that, I really loved everything I learned in this class, and I cant wait to use this knowledge in my future studies.",
                "Strengths: the course website was very helpful with the notes and lecture videos. It was a great resource if I needed a question answered or wanted clarification on a topic.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I felt like the in-person lectures weren't really needed since we were asked to watch previous recordings of the same content.",
                "The flipped classroom model provided for flexibility within the course, allowing me to choose when I would watch lectures, within the confines of the psets. However, pset grading was inconsistent and, in my opinion, unjustified in certain contexts, with full credit being taken away for minor errors, leading to extremely low grades on psets to which I knew nearly all of the answers. Aside from this, Professor McCarthy did not provide adequate preparation for the exam, with very little explicit instruction on functional anatomy that took up a significant portion of the exam.",
                "Strengths - you learn so much about the brain\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - too much info",
                "Too much content, made it very overwhelming but Professor McCarthy is a genius",
                "Strengths -- well organized, knowledgeable professor, online resources were great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- This class would be great with a section! It was hard to understand what information I didn't have a great grasp on and I would have liked to talk with classmates about it, especially since attendance in lectures was a lot lower than enrollment. \r\nI also had a hard time studying for the final, and I think two midterms would have been a beneficial change.",
                "The entire structure of this course needs to be SERIOUSLY rethought. The prerecorded lectures and in-class lectures are absolutely outrageous and ineffective.  The timed Qsets do not prepare students for an in-person final. The content is dense, which is expected. But then make the final a timed Qset like the rest of the Qsets! I regret taking this course, which is really sad. I love learning about the brain! It's such an interesting topic, and this class stripped every ounce of joy out of it. I hope that the structure is rethought, and I hope the next generation of Human Brain students can find some joy in it. Because I did not. Thank you.",
                "Strengths: huge scope, huge amount of information covered, difficult concepts broken down well, felt accessible\r\nI liked the Qsets!\r\nWeaknesses: took up enormous amount of time, practically the time of two courses, the flipped classroom made the class unnecessarily tedious\r\n\r\nPlease cut out the prerecorded videos in addition to the lectures. The prerecorded videos were also often way longer than a typical class session.",
                "Interesting subject matter. Appreciate the removal of midterms. Current structure, however, creates immense workload. Nature of grading qsets and the amount of material necessitate immense amounts of work. Other's will describe better. But wow.... unbelievably difficult, and I'd taken neuro coursework in high school.",
                "It was a lot of information and I feel that using both recorded lectures and live lectures was too much to know. I would have preferred having to study either recorded or live lectures not both.",
                "The strengths were that a large swath of information about the brain was covered to give a a glance at many potential areas of interest. However, I felt as though the course was not structured to actually engage with experimental methods and think critically about the data that were presented.",
                "The strengths of the course were the fact that I didn't feel stressed throughout the semester because there were no midterms or anything significant of that nature. However there were many weaknesses in the course. Firstly, I wish there were other ways to learn the material outside of watching a bunch of pre-recorded lectures, reading webpages, and following through lecture slides. These simply aren't engaging. But what made them most unbearable was the fact that that wasn't all, we were still expected to go to hour-long lectures that weren't that much more engaging. I don't know how, but they need to consolidate all of the requirements into something that is more engaging and doesn't take so much time outside of class, because it felt like an online class that didn't even require a professor sometimes, and then the lecture felt like supplementary material; I feel that is should be the other way around.",
                "I did not like the flipped classroom structure. The prerecorded lectures overlapped heavily with the in class lectures, adding more work without actually increasing my understanding or opportunity for learning at all.",
                "I like the flipped style of this course. It is nice to be able to review the materials before class (since the pre-recoreded lectures are posted online), and then review the most important concepts during lecture where you have the opportunity to ask questions and make connections between concepts. I also like the qSets because they allow you to understand the information in a lot more detail than you could remember on an exam. I think a weakness of this course would be the amount of material that is covered. Material is presented in a lot of detail, and although it is not required to remember all of this detail, it is difficult to discern what material we are required to know and what we are not. This can be improved by removing the detail that is not required.",
                "The strengths are in Professor McCarthy's organizational skills when it comes to the course and the low stress of quick quizzes and question sets, which are an amazing part of the course because I feel like my learning is really enhanced. However, a weakness is that we are expected to cram the entire semester's material to learn for a final that yes may not be worth that much of our grade but still is very difficult and therefore has the power to really influence our grade if we are significantly making errors in our explanations/partial credit (we still haven't been able to access exactly what grades we got on the final and how we did/where TFs took points off). It's not fair to have us be able to use open-note understanding of concepts throughout the semester and then have us try to cram this information without notes for more memorization-based testing."

                "Only if genuinely interested in learning about the brain or required for a neuroscience/psych major. A lot of material is presented at a time so this course needs time commitment to understanding the material and also interest or else it can be boring.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student that's interested in neuroscience and how the brain works. I think if you have a genuine interest in the material you'll get a ton out of the class; the content is fascinating and the class is organized in a way that you'll learn and retain a ton of information. While anyone would learn a lot from this class I think it could be difficult for someone who has little to no interest in the human brain to enjoy the class since it is pretty content-heavy and there's a lot to learn. That being said, this was 100% my favorite course of the year and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the subject.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in neuroscience, cognitive science, or psychology down the line. If you are looking to dabble in neuroscience, the workload is a bit high for that.",
                "I would definitely recommend this to psychology and neuroscience students! I think that this is a class that if you're interested in learning more about the nuts and bolts of the mind, it's going to resonate really well with you. However, if you're someone who really doesn't enjoy the sciences, this might not be a wise class to take for a distributional requirement. You can definitely pass this class if you put in a consistent effort, but I know that if I wasn't interested in the topic I would have really hated the experience so much more. This worked well for me in terms of the structure of it, but I think that its structure would definitely not have worked well for some other students. I would be really careful in your consideration for this class. Know yourself and what you enjoy as a student because this class has a pretty upfront structure and courseload and if you have doubts as to whether you'll enjoy or be successful in this class, I'd definitely trust your gut on it.",
                "No unless you really want to major in neuroscience. McCarthy tried to cover too much material for an intro class, there are timed problem sets so you have to set aside 3 hours straight to take them every week",
                "Only if you HAVE to take it, and even then, I'd look into Credit/Ding it. This class was tedious and I didn't enjoy going so in-depth into the brain. However, if you're into neuroscience, you'll definitely be into this class! Personally, I didn't enjoy the material we covered.",
                "I would recommend it but be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to this course. It really should be a two semester course based on the amount of information presented but you only have one semester to learn it so be ready to study.",

                "Do not take this course. I loved neuro in high school and was considering being a neuro major before taking this course, now my current plan is to never take a neuro course again. If you think you want to take this course, you should watch the prerecorded lecture videos at the bottom of the lecture notes on your own time instead at https://campuspress.yale.edu/humanbrain/lecture-notes/ . Most people who take the course just watch the prerecorded lectures and never come to class (because in class you just hear most of the prerecorded lectures again). As a result, by watching the lecture videos you will learn all the things in class, but you will avoid having to do timed problem sets and a closed book final on all the material you learned but have not memorized (which is so much material that it can not fit into the in person lectures), because everything else in the course was open book.",

                "Yes, if you are willing to have this be the center of your semester and/or be stressed about it (and especially the final) during the entire semester. There is a crazy amount of material taught in every single lecture, to the point where you retain basically none of it. I really strongly disliked how the class was organized: you're supposed to watch 1h30min-2h worth of prerecorded videos before every class, but during class, he just uses the exact same slides and repeats almost verbatim what was in the videos. I stopped going to class because I didn't have the time to watch the same thing twice. Then, over the weekend, you have to take a TIMED 3 hour pset that are often challenging and always frustrating because of the timed nature (it's like taking the SAT every week). The final is extremely stressful because you feel like you've literally been behind since day 1, and it's also pure memorization -- the questions are honestly too specific and really challenging because there's just too much information to memorize from the semester. That being said, after being forced to study for the final, it feels very rewarding to realize how much we now know about the human brain. You can really get a lot out of this class if you put the work in because the information is all there. I don't at all regret taking this class because the material about how our brain works is truly fascinating, but there was never a point in the semester where I was not stressed or overwhelmed about this class.",
                "Yes!!! If you are interested in Neuroscience, cognitive science, or psychology, I think it gives you a great foundation and can indicate what areas you are specifically interested in.",
                "I truly would never recommend this class unless a student had to take it. despite this being an intro class, none of this information was relevant while I was taking upper level NSCI classes. there was too much information and I thought the expectation of memorizing all of the information was an archaic approach to teaching that I would have hoped yale would have improved on by now. \r\n\r\nwhen studying for this final exam we were specifically told that info was not important and we should NOT waste time studying it... there were then multiple questions on the test regarding these topics. this seems incredibly unfair and almost as if students were being tricked for doing the extra work of watching all the review videos.",
                "If you're a neuroscience major or you enjoy learning about the human brain, definitely take this course! It provides a comprehensive review of the brain and its systems and functions. Just be prepared to spend about 10 hours a week between preparing for the in-person lectures with the videos and studying for/taking the timed question sets.",
                "Yes!!! Definitely if you are even slightly interested in the human brain, medicine, psychology, neuroscience, or neurobiology.",
                "Yes. It is a lot of content, but if you watch all the videos and take notes it is pretty easy to get 100% in the qSets each week. The final is hard to study for since there is so much content but if you watched all the videos throughout the semester and watch the review videos it is pretty doable. The content is really interesting and definitely worth it",
                "yes if its required - its tough but a very informative course - id suggest watching either the live or the prerecorded and reading the notes - doing everything is unnecessary",
                "I think you need to make sure you are really interested in neuroscience. Don't take it for a science credit, take it because you want to learn about the brain.",
                "Yes. Qsets force you to learn. I feel like I came out of this class with knowledge that will stay with me forever.",
                "I would only recommend this course to a student who has a lot of free time/works best by doing all of their work at one time. I think for me, and many other students, working on one assignment for several hours at a time leads to a lot of fatigue and lack of understanding. It was not a very convenient use of my time so I would want to make sure that the future student knows this/is prepared to deal with this.",
                "No. Excitement/pleasure out of the class were minimal.",
                "If they are very interested in the biological aspects of the brain or it is required for the major, yes. But if they are just looking for an interesting class about the mind and human behavior, there are way more interesting and engaging courses in the Psych and Cog Sci departments.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in psychology and some of the more biological, anatomical mechanisms of the human brain, I absolutely recommend this course.",
                "A few weeks ago, I would've confidently said \"yes\". I learned a lot about neuroscience in this course, the lectures were interesting, and I liked how content was reinforced through QSets and quizzes. However. I feel a lot worse about the course after my experience with the final exam. Leading up to the final, I was confident that Professor McCarthy was adequately preparing us for the exam. He conducted a review session on the last 13 lectures of the course, and made sure to emphasize that he would focus on those topics and specifically focus on the last four lectures in the exam, since those weren't covered in QSets. The actual exam contained almost no questions on the last four lectures, and very few (maybe 20/100) on the second half of the semester. I spoke with several friends taking the class, and we all felt that we had been misled to focus our studying on content from the second half of the semester, when the exam in fact focused heavily on first-half-of-semester content. So in answer to this question, I would have to say: the material is good, but don't trust the instructors. Make of that what you will.",
                "Yes!!",
                "ABSOLUTELY!!!!! If you are interested in this material, please take this class. Prof McCarthy is a very knowledgeable instructor who cares about delivering the material in an accessible manner and will do anything to make sure his students understand the material. He uses psychology to actually structure his class, which I wish more professors of lectures would do. If you want to take this class, I suggest you look through the website and see if the lecture titles/content are interesting to you.\r\nTo succeed in this class, I made flashcards for each lecture and used them to review before every single assignment (this includes quick quizzes, qSets, and of course the final exam). I would say that consistent review helped me a lot in the course, and the fact that I love the material so much to begin with made studying enjoyable. I made sure to not treat qSets as an opportunity to review the material being tested for the first time, but rather took it as an opportunity to learn the DETAILS of the material and explain them cohesively. I loved the structure and content of this class, and while it was time-intensive, I loved every second of it (well, maybe not too much the visual system... but that's my preference).\r\nI also loved how Quick Quizzes took the place of actual assessments, and it really did help to prepare for the final exam. But yes, do not underestimate how much you will have to understand anatomy and step-by-step pathways. Last thing: do not fall behind!! Really do watch the pre-recorded lectures before going to lecture; they make all the difference.",
                "Yes I think the course was very interesting but unless it was a requirement I would recommend students take it credit/d/fail so they felt less pressure to sustain the workload and stress in falling behind and rather just get to be engaged and interested in the material",
                "I definitely would recommend this course. It is a lot of work, not on a surface workload level but more on a level of developing and significant understanding of the course load (by your own initiative). That being said, it truly is fascinating and exciting if you are at all interesting in how the brain works. However, no student should take this course expecting to retain all of the information you cover in class.",
                "If they are interested in the material, yes. If not, the work load is too overwhelming.",
                "No, not unless you need it for a major.",
                "yes if they would like to learn the biological basis of various psychological phenomenon",
                "I would if you have the time and capacity to dedicate to learning all the material because it is a lot. If you are interested in the brain its a great class to learn the complexities of the brain but not going to sugarcoat that it requires a good amount of dedication. If you don't have the room to do that I would opt for an easier science class.",
                "I would not recommend this class to other students unless they are taking for credit/d/f. There is so much information but they do not really teach us techniques to memorize it. It is basically a lot of self teaching and memorization.",
                "I would recommend it if they're really interested in the human brain and already have a general understanding of the different components of it, but if not it was so much content to learn in such a short time that I feel it wouldn't be worth it.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student if there were strongly interested in the human brain. However, it is a lot of work for an introductory course if students aren't certain whether or not they are interested.",
                "I would recommend this course if you're looking for a very comprehensive overview of the brain and are willing to put in the work to understand all the details covered in the class. Otherwise, there are probably more engaging classes to cover a Science credit.",
                "Yes, especially if you're interested in psychology or neuroscience. There is a lot of material to learn but it is manageable and engaging.",
                "not unless you have to take it or are just like really really want to learn A LOT about intro neuroscience stuff. absolutely do not take this course if you just need an easy science credit. this is not that.",
                "Not as a easy course, but a good one if they're actually seeking to study the brain.",
                "For prospective neuroscience majors or someone just interested in neuroscience, this is a great class to learn a lot about the brain. However, due to the weaknesses in how the class is taught, there may be other intro neuroscience classes that you will take away more from.",
                "yes!!! the open note qsets make it accessible to students without any bio experience. super interesting content, although it can be a lot of information/ memorization at times",
                "For NSCI and CGSC students only, yes.",
                "Yes, but the student must be prepared to study large amount asynchronously and make sure to be independent in preparing for assessments and homework sets.",
                "If you have to take it for the neuro major",
                "The class is definitely interesting but I wouldnt recommend it unless its a requirement or unless it is Cr/D/Failed because the workload is very high.",
                "Yes, the human brain is fascinating and it is cool to know how it works. However, be prepared for a lot of work and 3 hour Qsets every week.",
                "If you're interested in neuroscience!",
                "Never",
                "If you can keep up with the flood of material and are excited to, go for it.",
                "Yes, it is a good introduction to neuroscience; it is comprehensive while providing enough detail to engage you as a student.",
                "I took this for fun, but final low-key hard.",
                "If you dont have to, dont take it. You learn a lot of interesting stuff, but there is a lot of content and it can get overwhelming, especially since there are no midterms to force you to learn chunks of the info.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in the brain and want to learn more. At times this course can get very complicated and challenging but utilize your resources!",
                "I would recommend this course, adding that I would recommend it only if a student is willing to devote a significant amount of time to the class and only if they are very interested in psychology, neuroscience, or the human brain in general.",
                "I would recommend this course because overall the topics are very interesting. The final is very comprehensive and difficult however with the weekly P-sets it isnt too strenuous on your final grade and overall the material covered in the course is worth knowing.",
                "Yes, provided they are very interested in the human brain and are willing to be dedicated to a very high course load.",
                "Students who are looking for a science credit should not take this course as the workload is unreasonable even for Neuroscience students. Students are expected to make even more time for the class by watching the actual lectures for the class before an in person lecture that adds very minimal connections to the material that students wont even be tested on.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student truly interested in and passionate about the brain. This course is not for the faint-hearted; you truly are expected to learn an abundance of material. If you do not find this material particularly interesting, you will struggle to keep up in this course.",
                "Yes, if you have the time",
                "Yes, but only if you have to take it for your major or you are particularly interested in the material. This is not a gut science credit and will require a bit of your time and attention.",
                "Yes, but only if they are willing to do the intense work",
                "Yes I would recommend if someone wanted a challenging class without a ton of work.",
                "yes definitely! its incredibly challenging and a lot of material but you learn a lot and its super interesting",
                "YES",
                "Absolutely, if you have any interest in neuroscience this is a great place to start.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who is very interested in neuroscience. This course is one of the most content-heavy classes I've ever taken, and only those who are truly interested in the topic would find it interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student for the breadth of applicable knowledge, but would caution about the sometimes unfair grading that I experienced during the psets.",
                "Yes if you are interested in learning a lot about the brain. But it is a heavy workload",
                "Yes, a good gateway to brain systems and definitely challenging. Not a good choice if you're not a STEM person, very technical",
                "I would if you're passionate about the brain. But only if you have a baseline level of passion or else the amount of work is incredibly prohibiting. I recommend taking notes while watching the prerecorded lectures and then light notes in class.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in how the brain works; It was a wonderful introduction to neuroscience. I feel as though I came away with a much more solid understanding of the challenges of the field as well as its history.",
                "If you are interested in the neuroscience major, definitely take this class to see if neuro might be right for you. If you are already set on neuro, of course, then you have to take this class as a requirement.",
                "I would only recommend this class if you have to take it for the major or if you are going to credit/d the class and learn about the brain for fun. This is because the class isn't structured in an engaging way, and it is simply a lot of memorization which I understand because it is introductory neuroscience. Therefore, I think that this class would be a burden and take away from other courses unless it is required for your major, you are credit/d failing, or you just have an extreme interest in the brain that could not be quenched in any other capacity.",
                "No",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it was organized in a way that facilitates learning and really allows you to come out with more knowledge about the human brain.",
                "I would recommend because I feel I learned a lot of interesting information about the human brain and even other animal brains, and have learned an approach to thinking about the brain in an interesting way where we were able to see studies with fMRI and EEG to look at how different functions of the brain are connected to certain parts of the brain and see how they interact."
