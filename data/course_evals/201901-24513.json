    "this was the most amazing class I have ever taken at yale EVERYONE PLEASE TAKE",
    "Strengths were the class discussions when we had a chance to share our ideas about what we had watched that week.  I also thoroughly enjoyed the papers that we wrote.  The prompts were very open-ended and flexible so we got to write about things we were actually passionate about.  We also got to watch a lot of stuff that I wouldn't normally have watched.  The main weakness would be the amount of material we were supposed to watch\/read each week.  It was simply too much to reasonably ask someone to watch in a week so cutting that down so we could really focus on one or two pieces would have been helpful.  But overall a fun class.",
    "Strengths: everything\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of text on the powerpoints. Probably the only class where it didnt really matter though, the words were so great.",
    "Strengths -- Professor Friedfeld knows and loves this material, loves to hear and understand ANY student opinion, and knows how to facilitate a discussion. Many of the films and readings were great, and exposed me to new material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- I couldn't help but feel as if this course is a bit dated. The syllabus teaches heroes and villains to our generation, but doesn't include OUR heroes and OUR villains. We spend less than one class on superheroes, we don't bring up Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad, we don't talk about Star Wars or Star Trek, we spend almost no time on diverse heroes (no women, no queer heroes, no heroes of color). The detective, gangster, and spy archetypes help us go over some necessary classics (Sherlock, Godfather, James Bond, Pulp Fiction, etc), but also forced us to spend more time talking about idealized straight white male heroes from the first half of the twentieth century than any actual heroes we can bring into the modern world.  A lot of this course is built to facilitate conversation around film, and I feel as if conversation might be more centered on more characters from our generation in the future.",
    "In the course you watch films that are well-done and you have great discussions",
    "Such a fun course! I think it could be improved by more roundtable discussion and perhaps fewer readings, but the watch list was fantastic.",
    "Great professor, interesting readings and viewings, natural and fruitful class discussion."

    "YES friedfeld is a gem he loves this topic so much and is so engaging and this class is unlike any other class here it is a MUST",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about older film and television.  You cover a really wide range of material and genres so it's a good overview of the growth of entertainment.  The workload is not too bad once you prioritize what to watch\/read each week and the discussions are interesting and fun.",
    "Yes, definitely!",
    "Yes; one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale",
    "Yes! I hope that Friedfeld updates the material, but the course is entertaining and worth it.",
    "Anyone who enjoys watching movies should take this class",
    "Amazing class! Eddy is fantastic! Highly recommend.",
    "Yes! Such fun. The watch list is great, honestly learned so much about popular movies and the history of genres throughout the course. The assignments were also really interesting and open-ended.",
    "Yes, great course to be a cultured human being."
