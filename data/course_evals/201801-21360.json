    "Further knowledge of Italian.",
    "Greater facility with speaking and understanding spoken Italian",
    "My Italian massively improved throughout this course, especially my written and spoken communication.",
    "I vastly improved my I speaking and listening abilities and enhanced my writing skills too. Ru",
    "This course advanced my Italian a huge amount. Speaking became more fluid and less forced, and could understand others much better.",
    "I developed a lot of knowledge about the Italian culture and further developed my Italian speaking and writing skills. I also was able to fluently speak the language over Spring Break when I went to Italy and this was quite a wonderful experience. My family is Italian and it had been very interesting to connect with my culture and heritage.",
    "I have become very proficient in Italian, to the extent that I would feel comfortable communicating in Italy.  My writing, speaking, and comprehension skills all improved.",
    "I became much better at speaking Italian and writing compositions. I also clarified a lot of my grammatical knowledge."

   "comments": [
    "Very strong course",
    "I think the textbook was really bad and confusing, it relied on examples and didn't mention a lot of wrinkles in the grammar. The amount of talking done in the class really improved my speaking skills.",
    "Workload could be spread out more evenly over the semester",
    "The course was very engaging and fun, and brought the Italian language to life. However I would have liked more emphasis on new grammar points, so that I felt more secure in them.",
    "The level of involvement and the amount of speaking in the class was great and well balanced with other features such as presentations and films. \r\n\r\nWe could have spend more time working on listening skills.",
    "Casual and friendly atmosphere made it much easier to engage and learn",
    "The strengths are the nice people in the department. All the professors are kind and understanding and want the students to do well. The one weakness is that there are classes on Friday, but I understand the reasoning behind this because you learn a language by using it on a consistent basis.",
    "As a fairly casually-formatted class, it was perfect for those who wanted to put in the effort to learn and speak in Italian.  Others who did not have the same drive probably did not get as many of the class benefits.",
    "This course is really great to help you keep practicing language in a way that is enjoyable and enlightening and helps you become more comfortable."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, its phenomenal to continue learning such a beautiful language.",
    "Definitely yes! It is a review of material learned in L2 and it goes into more depth, allowing students to become more confident with the grammar of the language. Writing and speaking skills will definitely improve - you learn how to talk about more complicated topics.",
    "Sure, if you enjoyed L3!",
    "If you've taken L3 (or even just L2, you'll probably get by), why not carry on to L4? Italian is such a beautiful language and L4 brings it to life even more. You begin to discuss more complex topics and learn about Italian culture - including a lot of food samples. Definitely recommend. PSA: this class really makes you want to go to Italy, which can make you sad if you're a poor college student.",
    "If you are keen to spend time in Italy during the summer this is a helpful course to work on your oral\/speaking which is usually the most important part of your language when working or living abroad. A good class and an easy way to get 1.5 credits.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I have had a wonderful experiences taking four semesters of Italian. I started at L1 and just finished L4. I am sad it is over because Italian was my favorite class and I have made so many great friends along the way. I will be looking to take more Italian classes in the department in the next semester and future.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course.  It was relaxed and enjoyable.",
    "Yes, mostly because Kyle is an amazing professor."
