It is a lot of freedom to do what interests you so be ready to design your own project as it is a huge part of the class. If youre interested in simulating a conference style research review process this class is great for that.",
                "Honestly very little. A lot of lofty ideas about \"conceptual structure\" and a few random papers thrown in there that had no cohesive through-line. Arguably the biggest waste-of-time class I've taken at Yale.",
                "We looked at lots of lexico-conceptual structures at the start of the course and analysing psychological verbs. There was also an interesting bit in the middle on metonymy. Most of the second half of the course was aimed towards our own research projects. \r\n\r\nMake sure you really like Linguistics if you're taking this course.",

                "Strength is its super self directed ! Weakness is despite no prerequisite you really get right into it and can be a bit confusing sometimes.",
                "This course needs an established structure (of what it is exactly we are learning) that it can follow all the way through, and more consistent pipelines of feedback between students and professor. It certainly lacked both this time around.",
                "Strengths: I enjoyed sharing our research projects with others and hearing theirs, and providing feedback on each others. The reading and discussion on metonymy was interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I'm not sure if the course followed a syllabus or what we learnt specifically in the first half of the course. The research project was interesting but everyone's project was so different that it was hard to give constructive feedback as everyone had just done their own research independently. The second half of the course mostly consisted of our professor telling us about the readings with little class discussion or even involvement. \r\n\r\nThere was also a very frustrating end to the course. The >5000 word research paper was due the Friday before reading week (with this deadline in the syllabus) and there was a research presentation the Wednesday after (during reading week) so we could all hear about each other's finished projects. On the afternoon on the day before our final paper was due, the deadline was delayed a week. And then the following Wednesday, our instructor gave us feedback on our presentations so we could edit our papers accordingly. Changing the deadline to a >5000 word paper 36 hours before it's due helps no one, as no one would ever write that amount the night before (!), and then the idea of giving us feedback for such a long paper 72 hours before it was due is ridiculous. Especially since the deadline was in the syllabus and we all had other classes to study for.",
                "Professor Piango is very thorough and great at helping students refine their ideas and projects, but this class could have used more structure and reading assignments. I felt myself wishing we'd spent more time on concepts in class."

                "No. This class was a constant source of frustration in my semester and everyone who knows me knows to avoid this course and this professor.",
                "I wouldn't. It's still difficult to say what we've learnt as a class, outside of our individual research for our final projects. It seemed like we were just analysing lexical-conceptual structures and how psychological verbs function in the first half of the course, and then the second half of the course was just the professor talking about the readings, with us having little to no input."
