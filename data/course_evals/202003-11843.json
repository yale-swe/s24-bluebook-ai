                "strengths: very efficient (low workload, lots of learning), interesting and informative lectures, amazing sections and review sessions, clear format, textbook optional but helpful as desired\r\nweaknesses: unclear content on exams\r\nCould be improved by professor being more transparent about exam content and grading",
                "This class's grade is solely determined by the scores of four tests. That is both a strength and a weakness.",
                "Recorded lectures were helpful for students in different time zones, organization of the content in two sections can make the second segue into the heart of biochem (glycolysis, TCA, oxidative phosphorylation, ATP synthesis + biosynthesis of lipids, sugars, amino acids) hard to adjust to. But in the end the content all comes together, and I appreciated that the focus was never on rote memorization but rather application of concepts.",
                "The timing of grading combined with the grading policy caused some unneeded stress for many students. The \"optional\" fifth exam truly was not optional, because of the fact that the class is curved. \r\nAlso, the TAs did not know what the exams would have, which was not very useful, and discussion sections were essentially a sped-up rereading of lecture slides so they became a waste of time to attend. The Piazza page was next to useless as well, as students would voice their concerns or even just biochemistry-related questions and sometimes it took a whole week to get any response from TAs.",
                "For the first half of the course, I felt that the breadth of information covered was a strength, but a weakness was that sometimes that breadth came at the expense of the depth I felt certain concepts needed. In particular, I wish we had spent more time covering specific examples, which I think would have helped to contextualize some of the broader concepts covered; seeing worked examples of math-based problems would have been especially helpful (though I know this can be more difficult in a virtual course). For the second half, I felt that the opposite was true. We spent a great deal of time covering mechanisms in significant detail, though we were often tested on information that I think required other information.",
                "Overall it was good! Very dense course",
                "Strengths: very interesting content! definitely furthered my interest in biology. \r\nWeakness: the course is fast-paced to the point where it seems like the instructors do not care much about how we are learning. Additionally, grading in the class seems somewhat arbitrary and inconsistent.",
                "Profs and TAs were not very responsive to concerns and questions of students\r\nWe didn't know the format of the final exam until like a day before, despite asking a bunch",
                "The professors didn't do a great job at explaining everything in class. They'd skim over stuff that was tested heavily on the exam and then go into detail about things we never needed to know on the exams.",
                "strengths: \r\nweaknesses: extremely inflexible and unaccommodating which is unreasonable for a pandemic and makes less sense for the actual administration of the class as well, lectures were inconsistent and confusing and it was unusually difficult to thread out central themes to help guide our thinking (this is more so about the second half taught by Breaker than Nachtergaele)",
                "A signficant weakness of the course was the way in which the lectures cover so much information to extreme details. Also, the exams while being adapted for the virtual setting were often too long to be finished in the 1 hour window given.",
                "This kind of class is very hard over zoom. They couldn't really do much more, it just would've been helpful to be in person, obviously.",
                "Strengths  Prof. Nachtergaele is a god among so-so STEM professors and should be granted tenure accordingly. She's the absolute best  her section of the course was extremely enjoyable (great slides, engaging lecturing, well-organized, I could almost always keep up during live lectures it was so perfectly paced, she gave us a pep talk about the myth of scientific genius and the role of women in science, etc.). I liked the non-cumulative exam format of assessment, but Prof. Breaker should know that a choice between a non-cumulative during election week and a cumulative exam during finals week (when you know. We have other finals\/papers\/projects to do) isn't a choice at all. Weaknesses  Prof. Breaker's section of the course was much less well-organized. His slides are so overwhelming you have no idea what's important, he goes on mini-tangents that usually make sense after watching the recorded lecture (because believe you me, it was almost impossible to attend live lecture and not get lost. the longest I lasted was 25 minutes) for the second time but just make you feel totally lost in the moment. Generally Prof. Breaker isn't good at contextualizing whatever he's talking about as a combination of the poorly designed slides\/tangents, and since this is my first real biochemistry course, I was very often unsure if a process\/concept he'd discuss was a part of the overarching process he'd been discussing before or the start of a new process. Another glaring weakness: as the YDN reported (but downplayed), it became very clear that the teaching staff (except for Prof. Nachtergaele who I absolutely don't fault because this wasn't her part of the course and is a new faculty member) had no intention of being understanding about this being a semester during a pandemic and presidential election. Clearly suffering under the delusion that good scientists are ones that are totally disconnected from the world around them, we were expected to just. Study biochemistry. During an enormously consequential election WEEK. Because politics are so unrelated to science that two members of my lab had to shuffle around to different labs because of the Trump administration's immigration policies. Haha. So unrelated. Don't get me started on the sheer condescension showed towards us in the mistakenly uploaded video of (approx. half of) the TF's ragging on us silly little undergrads. I get it, y'all are too smart and above it all to feel sympathy for us. Whoo hoo. Anyway. Again, I reiterate, an \"optional\" CUMULATIVE final to make up an exam isn't an OPTION; it's a THREAT. Who in their right mind wants to take a cumulative final for a course that is clearly too detail-heavy to allow for cumulative exams during the rest of the semester? Also, thank goodness I did well on the last exam because if I didn't? We got our grades back for the exam 2 days before the cumulative final that would have replaced a potentially bad score, so you'd have to totally rely on the vibes(?) you got from the last exam if you were worried about it being bad.",
                "A major weakness of this course was the teaching staff. I never felt like their main goal was to facilitate learning. I and many others taking this course felt extremely stressed at times. We felt like we were pushed too much and asked to do the virtually impossible when it came to our exam schedules. We were not given good feedback about our learning before the next exam. And when we asked to receive this or have the exam postponed, our legitimate concerns were ignored.",
                "The book was so helpful",
                "The content is pretty interesting and the instruction was clear for the most part. Sometimes test questions felt a bit unclear or indirect, but this wasn't a huge issue.",
                "I think having a few homework assignments throughout the semester would help students make sure they were on-track and understanding concepts.",
                "At times, the lectures felt a bit rushed as we neared the end of class time. However, I definitely understand how this is likely a result of the virtual format where timing of lecture teaching is drastically different.",
                "The weakness is the amount of support given to students. I didn't feel like there was someone I could turn to when I needed help.",
                "professors didnt seem to care about us that much...didnt answer emails or give us any feedback on grades",
                "The profs and TFs were wonderful. The material sometimes got a little too specific to feel relevant.",
                "I appreciated that there was no homework. However, that means there's very little practice to check your understanding of the material.",
                "Strengths: Final exam was optional, giving students the option to replace an exam grade. It was great that this option could only help you and not hurt you. Professor Nachtergaele is very organized and a great lecturer; her slides very much followed what she was talking about. Exam questions from both Professor Nachtergaele and Professor Breaker were very fair and focused on the greater picture instead of recalling small details. Weaknesses: Grading was not the most transparent due to changes that were made in light of COVID. Based on the fact that the final was not optional, it was unclear how the curve would work for the course and where people would fall. It is my understanding that these changes will be reversed for next semester. Professor Breaker tends to not be the most organized lecturer and he often goes off on tangents.",
                "I thought the material was interesting, and it was taught well.",
                "The weakness of this class was the fact that it only had four grades  the exams. It would be nice if there were other assignments to help boost the class grade such as homework assignments and quizzes. \r\n\r\nAnother weakness was the fact that tests were through canvas, so we never got our tests back with corrections to see what was done wrong. It was challenging getting used to the format of taking tests online in only 1 hour. \r\n\r\nHowever, making the tests open-note allowed me to not be as stressed about memorizing the material, allowing me to focus more on actually understanding the concepts and themes. I honestly don't know how I was able to take closed-note tests before the pandemic.",
                "It was heavily focused on 5 exams. It could be improved by adding problem sets or practice problems.",
                "Strengths: recorded lectures to rewatch, Weaknesses: grading sucks",
                "Good feedback from instructors and TAs.",
                "Strengths include that TAs are really helpful during review session and discussion sections. Weaknesses are that at times compromise is hard to achieve with the professors and that makes the fact that your grade is determined by only four exams, even harder.",
                "The strengths- lots of opportunities to meet with the professors and teaching assistants\r\nThe weaknesses- the exam format was hard to adjust to",
                "strengths - Office hours are super helpful, including peer tutoring (shoutout to Anna!), open-note exams (even though they were still hard)...and the students in the course who always asked questions during lecture (:\r\nweaknesses - piazza response is slow (and that brews tension!! for both students and teaching team!!); theres a BIG difference in investment between the TAs, like some give out psets and practice problems or prepare elaborate slides that prepare their section way better than other sections which I find unfair (for example, if the TA exposed you to one type of question or focus as you prepared for the exam, you might do better when that type of question shows up on the exam); there must be a better way to transition from Nachtergaele to Breaker or basically into pathways in general - perhaps priming us with practice exam questions so we know what we should be getting out of the enzyme mechanisms. Glycolysis and the citric acid cycle lectures were particularly PAINFUL because it felt like Breaker went nonstop and we were all so overwhelmed when he explained mechanism after mechanism. Perhaps it would be more bearable if he could insert more breaks or applications or something more engaging so it is not too dry. Thankfully the lectures are recorded so the student can go through these at their own pace and give themselves much needed breaks (even though this requires a lot of motivation as well)",
                "One strength is the TAs and their dedication to helping us learn the material. A weakness was possibly the speed of the course, as well as the lack of assignments to help with grades outside of the 4 exams.",
                "The strengths of the course were the very knowledgeable Professors and TAs who made themselves readily available to answer students questions. Also, the course was pretty well organized making the content easy to follow and review when studying. The weakness of this course was not enough\/poor planning in terms exam scheduling (there was a conflict that surrounded taking an exam the week of the election as well as taking the final two exams a week apart); also the timing of the first exam was too long, but was resolved by being able to drop an exam.",
                "Exams are fair, but I wish they would have given us more than an hour as we were always under a time crunch.",
                "Strengths: good details and emphasis on \"why\" something is happening \r\nWeakness: not enough info on the bigger picture of \"what\" is going on",
                "A strength of this course were the lecture slides. They were very detailed and in depth. Also Professor Nachtergaele and Connor (a TA) were great. \r\nA weakness of this course was the actual lecture. A majority of the time we spent learning mechanisms which we didn't actually need to know which made the lectures very overwhelming and convoluted. I felt like I learned very little from the actual lecture and spent a majority of my time teaching myself the material by studying the lecture slides on my own. Also this is mainly applicable to the second half of the semester. The first half was difficult but still manageable whereas the second was quite confusing. I don't think this is because the second half of the course \"is just more challenging\" because it honestly isn't. Glycolysis and the like are very straightforward processes with intuitive steps to get from point A to point B and once you know the idea behind one process you know them all. I think our, or at least my, confusion stemmed from the overwhelming way in which the material was presented. I'm not sure what the course was like in person and if it was better because chalkboards tend to slow professors down (in a good way) and maybe that didn't adapt well to virtual teaching but this was just my take on the semester.\r\nIt could be improved by providing more support for students where the information was distilled and presented clearly- I thought Connor and Professor Nachtergaele were the best at doing this, but the rest of the teaching team continued to use very convoluted explanations.",
                "Strengths: Both Nachtergaele and Breaker were professors that cared a lot about their students and had a great understanding of the course material. For students who have taken biology and organic chemistry, it was nice to see those concepts applied in concrete ways. Weaknesses: None for the first half of the course taught by Nachtergaele. For the second half taught by Breaker, lectures were dense with reaction mechanisms and slides were busy and disorganized. The information tested on midterms did not match what was emphasized in lectures. Additionally, Breaker always mentioned how diagrams on the slide were wrong; however, it would be much more clear if the diagrams on the slides were correct in the first place.",
                "The optional fifth exam for replacing a lower previous exam is a bit stressful as it seems almost required to compete with other students.",
                "Too much information without clear expectations. The exams are too long for the short amount of time given to take them. The first half with Prof. Nachtergaele was great though; she should be in charge of the course.",
                "Professor Nachtergaele was an amazing, engaging lecturer that really took time to answer live questions. Professor Breaker's lectures were extremely dry and mostly went into biological mechanisms in excruciating detail.",
                "I thought overall this course was taught very well. The first half especially, taught by Prof. Nachtergaele was really engaging. Towards the end of the semester, it was definitely harder to stay focused but not because of Prof. Breaker, I think merely because of the  duration of this semester.",
                "I think the weaknesses came from online format but that is something that obviously could not have been changed",
                "Strengths: Professor Sigrid Nachtergaele. Kind, super smart, great at explaining complex concepts, genuinely invested in her students' success, very willing to offer help outside of class hours. A fantastic professor and even better person. She should be given tenure immediately for singlehandedly carrying this class and Yale MCDB more generally.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, Breaker's half of the class. I'm sure he was a great guy, but his slides were busy, his lectures were poorly organized and much too fast, and he would often go on tangents that made it difficult to stay engaged and follow what he was saying. Granted, this was partially because metabolism is just really complicated, but he could have done a lot more to make the material accessible. Also, the class Piazza was barely active; the most activity it saw was when Breaker refused to move the exam we had on the Friday of election week, which was a whole mess in itself. Not a super useful resource.",
                "Weaknesses: The TAs are not very helpful and have limited knowledge of biochem, during the first discussion section my TA said they hadn't taken a biochem class in over five years so they didn't know how helpful they'd be. Furthermore, the grading of the exams was extremely arbitrary and sometimes too picky; the questions are very general and the desired response is sometimes to specific and not hinted at in the actual question. Also, it's extremely difficult to tell what form lecture will be covered on the exam.",
                "It could be difficult to know what was going to be tested (not many accurate practice tests because of the new online format). The professors and TAs did a really good job of providing extensive availability to help us revisit topics and review for exams.",
                "All the material was quite engaging, and both professors clearly cared about the material and tried to connect it to a bigger picture. I thought that having online practice exams for the latter half of the class would have been beneficial.",
                "The only grades are 4 exams worth 25% each. Since the class was virtual, many people took the exams together\/used google and there was a very high average on each exam. I felt I was putting a lot of effort in and was performing at the mean or below on each exam, mostly from running out of time, and it was really frustrating to consistently underperform but have no other grades to show my understanding of the material than the exams.",
                "The main strength of this course was Professor Nachtergaele, and the overall weakness of this course was Professor Breaker and the TA's. I was very disappointed in this course as a whole. Sure, there were some good moments as well as exams that weren't bad, but there were also many opportunities for the TA's and Professor Breaker to make the content more enjoyable to learn and also easier to digest\/be tested, and they consistently chose to make the class more difficult.",
                "I think a strength of this course was the abundance of resources. From the professor to teaching fellows to peer tutors to the textbook, there were many avenues for help and to ask questions about the material. A weakness of this course is the sheer volume of information we needed to know. While, per the online nature of this class this semester, all of the assessments were open book, it was almost impossible to know what information to focus on for a given unit of the class. There was so much information, you could not know what was necessary and what wasn't, and I can't imagine having to memorize all of the information for a closed-book exam. The slides, especially in the second half of the course, were so dense with information that it was extremely difficult to parse through all of the information to study, especially when the exam is only 60 minutes.",
                "The testing arrangements were hard to show what you knew because there was such little time.",
                "the pace of the course is really hard to keep up with. it is also incredibly difficult to know in what detail you must know things",
                "I loved the course but the exams were obviously extremely difficult due to lack of time. But overall it is a well taught course!",
                "I feel that Prof. Beaker could have been more communicative about exams. Often questions would go unanswered on piazza when they were about exams but course material would be answered.",
                "Practice tests more reflective of what will be on the exam",
                "The strength is the instructors' ability to explain information. I was able to understand the concepts as they went along. \r\nThe weakness was leaving the memorization completely up to the students and not providing a more accurate expectation of exam content as even though multiple practice tests were given, they still did not always give me an idea of what I needed to have available for quick recall and what was less important and for enrichment.",
                "the professors taught this material well but the class was a bit overwhelming. It was pretty hard to know what would be on exams, since sometimes in class we would focus on a lot of detail but on exams we would be expected to know the material more broadly, or vice versa. There is a lot of material covered in the class and I wish professors and TAs had been more attentive about responding to students questions on concerns. Because the class was online, it was harder to ask individual questions while on zoom so if our emails or piazza posts were ignored, then we had no form of communication. It can even be difficult to receive answers during office hours because if many people show up then it is hard to ask a lot of individual questions. This was a really hard semester taking the pandemic and differing time zones into account and I don't think this was really taken into account when our questions were left unanswered. I learned a lot but this was a difficult class during a difficult semester."

                "N\/A",
                "The professor who taught the second half of the course should have been MUCH more understanding when it came to the struggles that students faced due to the pandemic and stresses from the election. In addition, he almost never answered valid questions about grading, course content, etc. on piazza and only one TA really ever attempted to answer piazza questions. This led to a lot of frustration with the course during the second half.",
                "virtual recorded lectures were great",
                "Again, the grading policy and \"optional\" fifth exam only caused more, not less, stress. Also, the professors would try to point to specific parts of slides with their mouse cursors but it would help if they drew the physical arrows out or had some sort of highlighted cursor that is easier to see. The virtual sections and review sessions were also pretty useless. Furthermore, sometimes the grading was a bit unfair in my opinion, as there was no true answer key\/rubric, so whatever details the professor had written, the TAs would look for small details that the professor had happened to write as an \"answer OPTION\" and take off points based on that.",
                "Again, I think it would be helpful to see more examples worked out in whiteboard format. I think it can be hard to follow PowerPoints alone for certain concepts in Biochemistry. Additionally, I have some concerns about the way that exams were handled. This was a challenging semester for me on a personal level, so it is possible that I would have struggled in the course no matter what. However, my performance in this course compared to my performance in my previous STEM classes at Yale dipped significantly. Again, this may have been due to personal circumstances, but I worry about the potential for academic dishonesty in online courses, and it might be something worth considering moving forward.",
                "It was very helpful that lectures were recorded and that we had so many TAs and office hours available.",
                "The recordings were helpful because it allowed me to review areas that I struggled with.",
                "Successful: the course itself was very organized. On canvas, however, lectures were not titled in the canvas media library. \r\nWeakness: Not enough practice content, tests were not always fair either, a lot of students stopped attending live lecture which reflects how the instructors did not do as great of a job in keeping the class engaged and at pace with the material.",
                "Professor Breaker in particular wasn't very accomodating, given the pandemic, when it came to student mental health and well-being before exams. That needs to improve. Professor Siggy did a great job of making sure everyone was ready for exams, however. \r\n\r\nI appreciated the ability to watch class synchronously or asynchronously though",
                "Recording lectures helped. More time could have been given during the new format of exams.",
                "Recorded lectures were a necessity and I would've dropped this class as well as the entire track of my major that made me take this course if they weren't recorded",
                "I think that the exams need to be reconsidered in terms of their length or the expectations for the level of detail expected.",
                "I mean it was just lectures. Zoom lectures can be tough, especially with the amount of information covered in Biochem.",
                "Recorded lectures were a plus",
                "Sometimes Professor Breaker would say: \"If we were in person, I would draw this on the blackboard,\" then go right back to his premade slides without doing anything else. I feel like someone should tell him that Zoom does indeed have a whiteboard feature and it would be extremely useful if he would draw out some of the stuff he lectures about.",
                "Large lectures like this transition naturally enough into zoom",
                "I think a course like this is pretty well suited to the online format. This is true especially because of the numerous Professor and TF office hours, which I found to be extremely helpful.",
                "was fine",
                "Unsuccessful: The optional fifth exam, which Professor Breaker kept portraying as a generous policy for students, only added more stress because he didn't give clear policies on how it would affect overall grades (and when pressed, he seemed to give very dismissive answers that had little empathy for the situation he had left students in). It left most of us having to take an extra exam during an already busy and anxiety-filled time, even if we already did well on the four exams prior. \r\n\r\nSuccessful: Having recorded lectures and review sessions; zoom section and office hours ran smoothly",
                "The tests were all open note which I think is super useful during online school.",
                "I appreciated that section was optional. I'm unsure if this is how it was in a non-COVID semester, but it was nice to be able to attend different sections throughout the week if I was unable to make my normal one. I also appreciated that lectures were recorded. I was able to attend almost all lectures live, but it was great to be able to go back and watch the lectures again when I didn't understand something. This really helped my ability to learn the material.\r\n\r\nThe grading for the final exam was not the best. The fact that it was optional and no alternative curve was made for individuals that did not take Exam 5 made it feel like I had to take the final regardless of my standing in the class. In the future, it would be best to not make Exam 5 optional for everyone or more transparent grading systems should be put in place (such as not having your final grade being determined by your absolute grade).",
                "Having recorded lectures and being able to watch them on my own time actually vastly improved my learning. Before, when lectures were in person, I struggled to write down and understand all of the information that the professor would cover throughout in one lecturemost professors really rush through lectures in order to cover all the material. Having the zoom lectures recorded allowed me to watch them on my own time, being able to pause and rewind. It drastically changed my note-taking abilities.",
                "A very helpful practice was recording lectures\/reviews and posting them on Canvas. Also, the posted slides were vital.",

                "Very helpful to have everything recorded, from lectures to office hours. Allows you to take the course and learn the material at your own pace. No concerns for virtual engagement - I think theres always someone at office hours and review sessions so this course is set on that. Open note exams are good - not because they make the exams easier since the time limit is still too short to get a good score solely relying on notes, but because it eases the stress.",

Having virtual office hours frequently was also advantageous. The online exams were well administered for the most part. An improvement I would suggest is having more flexibility in the schedule or doing more careful course planning to avoid some of the exam conflict issues that arose during the semester.",

                "Please reconfigure this course for spring semester  it makes little sense to have the only grades be exams during a pandemic",
                "The lectures were fine. I thought the format for class was great. What could have been improved were the exams. One hour to take an exam with six, multiple-choice questions is a little ridiculous. I think that the questions required more detailed answers because they were allowing us to use notes, but to make us give answers in greater detail in the same amount of time felt a little challenging. This issue was also brought up when our final, but optional, comprehensive exam was given with the same time constraint, not including the extra 30 minute grace period usually allowed for final exams, and the professor chose to skirt around the issue, explaining that there was no reason we needed extra time.",
                "Of all the online lectures I took this semester, this was one of the better ones. The availability of an online lecture that was recorded was incredible helpful for those of us who could not make it to class. One practice I believe could be improved was maybe recording the review sessions or releasing more practice materials for the exams. I believe it is against Yale policy to record student interaction, but if there was some way to either release answer keys or post the slides of the review session beforehand so we could follow along easier, I believe that would go a long way in test preparation. In addition, it would be helpful for the TAs to see the exam before giving us the review so they could guide us to what is important.",
                "Having love and recorded lectures was good. A bit more time was needed on the tests, though. Having ample office hours and then not being mandatory was also great.",
                "it was nice being able to rewatch the recorded lectures. Even though I was attending lecture when it was live there would still be things I missed that I would need to go back and revisit. That is the nature of the fast paced course so it was nice being able to go back to some of the material",
                "Online exams should have more time",
                "There was definitely a learning curve for the online format the tests took. The first exam was especially long, but I'm glad the professors changed the format of the following exams.",
                "The instructor was not very understanding of student perspectives in regards to our needs during the pandemic and election season.",
                "Having everything recorded helped immensely as I was occasionally unable to connect to lecture.",
                "Piazza and office hours were meant to help with learning and answering questions but piazza posts were almost always ignored by TAs, and sometimes emails were as well. This is especially frustrating when everything is online and we can't ask for help in purpose. I was grateful that lectures were recorded and that we were given a wide time frame for exams."

She really showed that she cared about students and their understanding of the course material. The second half of the class was much more difficult than the first in my opinion, not just because of the concepts, but because of the nature of the semester (election + burnout) and because Prof. Breaker wasn't as accommodating as he could've been. I think my biggest issue with the second half of the course was that Prof. Breaker and the TAs rarely ever answered Piazza questions, even questions about the material. There would be so many unanswered questions leading up to the exam, that it was almost useless for Piazza to be there if TAs and the Professor aren't going to utilize it.",
                "It's required for pre-med people and that was the majority of students taking the class. I did enjoy this course though and thought the material was really engaging and interesting. I would recommend this to people who are interested in biochem.",
                "Yes",
                "We weren't able to go through all the content of the course perhaps due to the new virtual format. In any case, though, I thought it was fine as long as you put in the work to go over the notes again. But again, our exams were open note, so these comments wouldn't apply for an actual course that required memorization - then in my honest opinion it's way too much.",
                "The concepts covered in the course are interesting for people interested in any field of biology. Even as someone studying in a field not closely aligned to biochemistry specifically, I feel that what I learned was helpful for understanding a lot of foundational concepts in biology on a deeper level.",
                "It is a course that many majors need to take. I wouldn't really recommend it otherwise.",
                "Overall yes but not excited about it as much as I thought I would be. Material is interesting, but instructors make it unnecessarily difficult to navigate through.",
                "I do not recommend taking this course to another student. Although it's a pre-med course, the lectures weren't set up to allow for optimal student learning and exams were created that basically set students up for failure.",
                "I would only recommend it if it is a requirement. I took it as an elective for the neuroscience major.  Okay class with interesting material. Grading is harsh and the professors are not very understanding. Material and workload is manageable though.",
                "No. I'd sooner drop out and move back to my hometown to finish a biochemistry requirement than take this again with Breaker.",
                "I would recommend this course! I thought it was very interesting, and though it was at times conceptually challenging, I enjoyed it and learned a lot.",
                "I would recommend because you have to learn this material, and it is super interesting.",
                "ABSOLUTELY take this if Prof. Nachtergaele is teaching it again. I really enjoyed her portion of the class. Maybe Prof. Breaker's lectures are better live, so I guess shop it and see. I don't regret taking this as an MCDB elective I'm glad I have this background now even if the second half (Prof. Breaker's half) was a bit painful.",
                "No. Unfortunately, the course is required for the pre-med track and for certain majors. But I would recommend that someone take the MBB version instead because the professor does not seem to care about his students.",
                "Yeah if you need to take it, it is well taught",
                "Yes, it's pretty interesting material and not super difficult to get a grasp on if you take good notes on lectures.",
                "Only if you have to take it.",
                "only if you have to",
                "Yes, esp if you have to take for requirements",
                "Yes. Even though biochemistry requires a massive amount of memorization, this course was still able to drive home certain concepts.",
                "I was struggling to choose between this course and the MB&B biochemistry. I think this was a good choice for me as it gave a wide overview of many topics. I would suggest this to MCDB majors or pre-meds.",
                "Yes, the material is super interesting.",
                "It is required for pre-med but probably one of the harder MCDB cores. Take it if you have to.",
                "not really unless you have to take it for premed requirements",
                "Yes. At first I was concerned about having no psets\/outside work to apply my knowledge and study for exams, but honestly having no other assignments meant one less thing to worry about. Dedicating time to study for exams is intense already. There is definitely a LOT of material so be ready to invest a LOT of your time preparing for each exam.",
                "I took it as a pre med requirement, but I actually enjoyed it.",
                "take it if you need it for MCDB or pre med",
                "I would recommend this course, aside from being a requirement, the professors are really good at what they do and the class content is interesting  it was nice to put all the pieces from intro biology and chemistry concepts into something applicable like different biological reactions and their outcomes.",
                "Yes if it is a pre-med\/MCDB requirement.",
                "Only if they are pre-med",
                "I mean if you're taking this class you're doing it because you have to to meet a major or premed requirement. I haven't heard much about the MB&B Biochem but this class wasn't the worst. It's not super focused on memorization (although that could just be because it was virtual and open note) and more concept based which I preferred. Good luck with whatever you choose!",
                "Yes; if you are premed and need biochemistry, this is perfect.",
                "Not unless you have to!",
                "Yes, I definitely enjoyed this course and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the biosciences.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I know that it is a pre med requirement but that said I think it has been the most enjoyable requirement that I have taken thus far",
                "Yes, if Siggy is teaching; however, Breaker's part of the class needs a lot of restructuring. Can't really speak to how this feedback would translate to a non-virtual semester, but it's not the worst MCDB requirement. Probably.",
                "No only take it if you have to",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. This lack of support for this class and the professors' and TA's responses to students' frustrations made me question if this is the type of field I want to go into. The second half of this class was especially difficult and the lectures were not well structured.  Take the MBB version of this class.",
                "No, because the professor who taught the second half of the course was not very understanding of the circumstances students were going through this semester. It felt like the needs that students were communicating to him were dismissed. It was very saddening to see my fellow peers reach out with their various problems and not having their concerns heard or met.",
                "Very much so, especially if Dr. Breaker is teaching.",
                "Pre-meds kinda have to take it",
                "Yes, especially if you're deciding between this biochemistry and the MB&B, it's quite comprehensive and teaches everything you need to know.",
                "Absolutely not - maybe take the MB&B biochem",
                "It depends. Most people who take this course are not taking it by choice, but instead as a requirement, so my recommendation does little good. I thought the first half of the class was great. Professor Nachtergaele was awesome and her style of teaching is really easy to follow, but I thought the second half of the course with Professor Breaker was a drag to get through. I do not doubt that this course is better taught in person, and I understand that, but I thought there were many opportunities this semester in which the professors\/TA's could have extended sympathy and they chose not to - and I think that is a reason why I maybe would hesitate to recommend this course.",
                "I would recommend this version of the course to another student. I was warned a lot about MCDB 300, especially given the amount of information and the test format, but I believe the open-book exams and recorded lectures eased a bit of that pressure, even if it was still very difficult. I think biochemistry is really interesting, so I would recommend this course if you find the chemical reactions that are the foundations of biology interesting, especially if you liked organic chemistry, but I would warn studying for the exams is very time consuming.",
                "Not if you can avoid taking it. For premed and some majors it is a necessary evil but definitely the hardest class I've taken at Yale.",
                "If it is a necessary medical school requirement take it obviously but this may not be a \"fun chill\" course for your schedule. You need to study a lot for the exams",
                "Only to fulfill a requirement.",
                "If they are up for the challenge",
                "Not unless they had to take it\/suffer through it.",
                "Yes. This course was interesting and if it were not a requirement for my major, I believe I would have still taken it and enjoyed it.",
                "only as a requirement. its definitely one of the harder classes in the mcdb major."
