I also learned some relevant music theory, such as the modes commonly used in gamelan music. In general, I developed a strong appreciation of Javanese musical culture. I feel much more musically well-rounded by having taken this course.",
                "We learned conceptual and practical knowledge of music-making in the Central Javanese gamelan tradition! We got to try out different instruments and perform three songs in a joint concert with the other gamelan class. Our listening skills as an ensemble (e.g. how receptive we were to group changes in dynamics, tempo) improved a lot thanks to Darsono's teaching."

                "This was a solid class to take as a senior! It was fun and Mas Dar was incredibly talented and friendly. Wished there was more commitment from fellow classmates. If you're taking it, please show up and be respectful towards others. One's absence really impacts the quality of the experience for other students.",
                "I love the dedication of professor.",
                "Strength: This is a very inclusive course that accommodates students of all levels and musical backgrounds. It makes the musical culture of gamelan very accessible to people mostly unfamiliar with it. It is very hands-on and practice oriented, which I believe is the best way to internalize and engage with the music. The instructor is superb gamelan musician who is also great at transmitting his knowledge to students. The class environment was friendly and everyone seemed to be having fun making music together; I certainly did.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the course had a heavier academic component, perhaps in the form of supplemental readings, as well as a deeper look into the music theory of gamelan.",
                "I loved the music and the rehearsals, and I appreciated that we got a chance to try out different instruments over the course of the term! Darsono is an excellent teacher and super knowledgeable. The concert is very exciting, and we had two excellent guest musicians joining us. Honestly the only weakness was that a lot of students might take this class because of the lower workload, so they do not take the music very seriously. I think this probably varies year to year and just depends on who signs up."

                "I would recommend this course to anyone trying to branch out and try something different.",
                "Absolutely. This class was an excellent learning experience that made me grow as a musician and provided a blissful break from my other Yale courses. Performing for a public audience at the end of the semester was a lovely way to end the semester, performing as a group for the last time. I will cherish the memories of this class for many years to come.",
                "Yes absolutely! Rehearsals are very fun and accessible. Depending on which instrument you are playing, and your musical experiences, you might find a given song very easy or very challenging - I had both experiences - and Darsono's teaching and the community nature of the course are very helpful in allowing everyone to practice and feel comfortable with the material. For music majors who have been mostly exposed to Western notation, this is a wonderful chance to learn about another tradition!"
