                "I felt like I had a pretty good grasp on chemistry before coming to Yale  this class showed me otherwise. I realized that a lot of my knowledge had been based on \"plug and chug\" methods of just knowing how to do the math behind a lot of chemistry, but I never really understood any of the topics on a deep level, and why exactly I was doing the math I was doing. This class gave me such an in-depth look into a plethora of general chemistry topics and taught me the rationale behind a lot of things I assumed to be simple in reality, they were far more complex than I anticipated! It was always such a stimulating and interesting class.",

I also developed an insight into the factors and energetics that control the extent of a chemical reaction or process. I explored the overarching concepts of kinetics and thermodynamics in chemistry by engaging in discussions of thermodynamic favorability, spontaneity, free energy, and I also enriched my understandings of enthalpy and entropy and how these two concepts relate to free energy. Chemical energetics and kinetics were discussed in the context of and related to various other concepts within the course, including gases, phase transitions, solubility, acid\/base equilibria, and even intermolecular forces. Also related to these discussions was the relationship between kinetic and potential energy and how this relationship plays a role in the progression of chemical and physical processes, as well. The mechanisms and explanations behind intermolecular forces were also discussed, with a special emphasis on the mechanism behind hydrogen bonding."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: peer tutors are super helpful, TFs are knowledgeable and willing to help, Prof. Johnson is an engaging lecturer, PSets aren't overly complicated.\r\nWeaknesses: some concepts are explained with an assumption of physics knowledge (might be a slight challenge if you have a less robust background in physics), exams were somewhat hard to get done in the time limit, but they were graded fairly with regards to time constraints.",
                "This course was very enjoyable; Professor Johnson and the teaching team all had AMAZING personalities and were more than willing to help!",
                "The lectures are fun, but sometimes I feel like I learn more from the textbook. Obviously, you cant cover everything in class but I think it would make the experience a little better if there was more content in the lectures.",
                "Professor Johnson was good at explaining confusing concepts in multiple ways and multiple times to help them make sense to us. Having the ability to go back and rewatch the recorded lectures were also a big help in solidifying that understanding. I also liked how Professor Johnson clearly pointed out what sections of the textbook the lectures aligned with, so it was easy to know where to look if I needed further clarification. The sample exams were also very helpful, and it was nice that the psets were largely graded for completion and low pressure.",
                "Strengths: I think the class itself was good in that there is a lot of support. The peer tutor and TF office hours and review sessions were incredibly helpful. What was essential in preparing for exams was Prof. Johnson's office hour review sessions. I don't think I would have passed my exams without that. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures could get dense at times, especially when it came derivations. I think more screen annotating would have been helpful in guiding the flow of thinking.",
                "Strengths - I don't like STEM but this class was somewhat enjoyable because it forced you to learn the \"why\" behind the topics and understand how things worked rather than just mindlessly plugging in numbers to equations. Grading the Psets on completion rather than accuracy also made it less stressful. The Sapling was way more manageable than last semester. Way less demoralizing than last semester where the average for some of the midterms was below a 70. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the course felt a little disorganized at times. It would have been nice to have the equation sheet that was going to be on the exam prior to the exam so that we could know what equations were important to understand instead of having to flip through Oxtoby. Additionally, the answer keys for the psets and sample exams often had mistakes or were unclear. And a lot of times we got the answer key for the sample exams just one night before the exam.",
                "The strength is that the professor is very responsive to students. Something that could be improved is organization of all the class files.",
                "The strength was that the exams are very fair and there are plenty of resources if you are struggling to understand the material. A weakness is that sometimes the lectures are a bit boring and difficult to sit through because there is so much math, but I think that is just a consequence of the subject. The course is also quite disorganized in terms of providing answer keys, for example many times the answer key for a sample exam would be released at around 10pm the night before the exam. There is also occasional misinformation among the TFs.",
                "Strengths: Though Professor Johnson was truly brilliant, the BIGGEST strength of this course came from the Teaching Fellows, Liv, Evan, and James. They were always SO lively and made the discussions about chemistry super interesting and not boring whatsoever. I really appreciated all of Liv's quirks and how she loved to laugh and make the course as interesting as possible over Zoom. Evan was also really amazing, and you could tell he knew his stuff. The course spends a lot of time making sure that you have a deep understanding of chemical topics (spoiler alert, Johnson often relates EVERYTHING back to thermodynamics). I also think that the other strength was how relaxed and non-competitive this course was  everyone was always willing to slow things down and explain things at a more understandable level, and the course was truly focused on learning over grades.\r\nWeaknesses: There really were not many weaknesses associated with this course that couldn't have been solved by transitioning back to in-person lectures. In fact, I know it would have been even better in person. The one thing I will say is that the exams could be quite stressful when we took them, and even an extra 10 minutes on them would prove to make the experience a whole lot less stressful. However, looking back, it was always manageable, just a little daunting at times! Overall, I loved the course!",
                "Strengths - the exam format (a couple questions repeated from problem sets\/practice exams, lowest question score for each test dropped) was a huge help and kept me from stressing too much about the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: practice exams and answer keys need to be released earlier! We need more than two days to do these practice tests.",
                "The discussion sections and peer tutors were very helpful for learing the material. No major weaknesses.",
                "The slides were difficult to follow along on, but Professor Johnson really does try to make the course as engaging as possible. The new information goes by pretty fast; however, the lecture recaps at the beginning of each class are helpful at summarizing the main points of the previous lecture. This class was more physics-based than I expected, so it was frustrating when the professor expects you to know physics concepts and equations especially if you haven't taken physics in high school before.",
                "I really enjoyed the lectures. My teaching fellow was also super helpful when it came to clearing up confusion or questions I had about the different problem sets. I would have preferred if the answer keys to the practice exams and problems sets were published a little bit earlier. Sometimes they were released only a day before an exam, so I was not a big fan of that.",
                "The TAs Peer tutors and professor were wonderful and knowledgeable about the subject matter. I think if the tests were given 10 extra minutes it would be better timing for students to demonstrate their chemistry knowledge.  The exam review sessions were extremely helpful.",
                "This course does an excellent job at exposing students to completely different fields within chemistry than students are exposed to in first semester.",
                "The course really stressed a cohesive picture of general chemistry using thermodynamics. This was helpful in understanding the root causes of chemical phenomena. While the derivations of various formulas was interesting, it might have been helpful to know which derivations are worth knowing.",
                "The course was taught well",
                "The course was very clear in the timeline and the lectures were very good. For instance, I knew exactly what chapter of the textbook was being discussed and so on. However, I do wish that the exams were edited more so that all necessary information was included on tests.",
                "Strengths: interesting material and topics covered, strong support system that includes peer tutors, TAs, professor. Weaknesses: Few weaknesses, just would have liked study material (practice questions, answer keys) to be given more ahead of time and with more detail.",
                "A strength was that it was taught well and clear to understand. A weakness was that the different sections were not really interconnected so it was like jumping from one topic to the next with no connection between them.",
                "The pace of the class felt fast, but not all of the syllabus content was covered at the end. Perhaps some of the nuance and depth of some areas could be shortened for the sake of covering more content while still maintaining a similar pacing to the course.",
                "Strengths: Mark has a great personality, Liv and Evan are great TFs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes not all the equations needed for a test were on the equation sheet, tests should have been proofread before they were released",
                "This course was pretty well managed--the lectures were recorded, so they were accessible for re-watching.  This really helped, especially with the more difficult subject material",
                "It was much more math-heavy than Chem 163, which means that it offers an in-depth approach to the inner workings of topics, but comes at a drawback since lectures often delve into gritty derivations which aren't necessarily the most engaging.",
                "The peer tutoring and discussion sections were very helpful at teaching concepts and going over how to solve problems. Sometimes the lectures moved too fast and felt like there wasn't enough time to go over concepts in enough detail, so maybe slowing down the pace of lectures overall would be a small improvement. Also, sometimes the exams had typos, and while only 1 exam had them to the degree that I actually felt negatively affected, I felt pressed for time in general during online exams, so proofreading them would have made it less stressful.",
                "This class was a little fast paced, which made it a challenge to keep up with the content, but the way exams were set up made it easier to have a better understanding of what to expect and the guided discussion sections also helped slow down the material and focus more on important details.",
                "Strengths: Professor Johnson makes the class very interesting, TFs are very engaging, Peer Tutors are great. \r\nWeaknesses: The tests are not proof read very well.",
                "I think the class did a great job over zoom. Maybe having the TFs and PTs talk more during lectures so we get opinions from other students who are more experienced.",
                "Strengths: The arc of the course content felt really smooth. Professor Johnson made himself and the TAs and peer tutors feel really accessible. There was a lot of online resources and reviews and helpful additional content. Overall, the class was pretty fun and engaging. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I didn't totally follow Professor Johnson's explanations or lines of reasoning, but it wasn't ever something that some extra studying couldn't address.",
                "A strength is that the discussion sections were very helpful. A weakness is that it was very fast paced.",
                "Strengths: The primary strength of this class that I would say sets this class apart from all others is the presence of the amazing crew of Teaching Fellows. The Teaching Fellows, in addition to the instructor himself, are among the most down-to-earth, supportive people one will ever encounter in the teaching crew of a class. To find evidence of the teaching crew's supportive qualities, one only has to look at the longs hours that they were all willing to stick out in review sessions before midterms and exams. Beyond the teaching crew, the material of the course is generally engaging material that has applications across all disciplines of STEM and is taught well by the teaching crew. The deep dives into select tenets of the curriculum of the course gave some exposure to true physical chemistry. With regards to exams, they were generally shorter, and plenty of sample exams and problems were developed and disseminated for content review before exams and midterms. \r\nWeakness(es):  While the curriculum contains many enriching deep dives into several sections of the curriculum, I would say a problem present with the curriculum itself is the fact that it so closely aligns to the standard general chemistry curriculum. In contrast, the curriculum of Chemistry 163 explored many topics that would never thought to be found in the standard general chemistry curriculum. As such, I believe that there is some room in the Chemistry 167 curriculum to include topics that deviate heavily from the current curriculum."

Also the \"review\" lectures before the exam and the recap of the last lecture at the beginning of each lecture were helpful.",

However, I did enjoy the lectures and the peer tutor hours held and TF reviews were all very helpful.",

                "The residential college-based breakout room that was incorporated into lectures early on in the course was fun and a welcome break from a continuous period of lecture over Zoom. I was sad to see it phased out as the end of the semester approached. However, I thought the inclusion of various guest speakers near the end of the course provided another perspective to and enriched the content being discussed in the course. While not a deal breaker, it would perhaps be beneficial to keep the presence of guest speakers for certain topics in future, in-person iterations of the course.",

                "I would recommend this course if you are looking for a challenging, but rewarding chemistry course. It takes quite a bit of time and energy, but you will definitely learn a lot about core concepts of chemistry. The depth to which each concept was explored was great. There is a huge emphasis on deriving and fully understanding a concept rather than just memorizing equations and plugging numbers into a calculator. Be prepared to be fully immersed in chemistry and all of its nuances.",
                "Yes! This class takes a more traditional approach to chemistry, following the textbook more closely. With Professor Johnson's stories, guest speakers, and addendums, this class was really enjoyable (and will give you a great chem foundation!)",
                "Yes! If you're interested in chemistry and are up for a challenge, this is a great course. You learn a lot and connect so many dots about chemistry and how it fits into everyday life.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in bridging chemical concepts together and getting a fundamental understanding of them. Lectures focus on derivations and concepts while PSETs focus a little more on the math. Peer tutors will be your best friends here as some of the problems can get challenging and I sometimes had to rely on knowledge from AP Chem more than knowledge gained through lecture. This course is definitely more mathy than 163, but not necessarily a bad thing if you take advantage of the resources given.",
                "I assume that if you're taking this class it's because you're premed and\/or majoring in STEM and it's a requirement. I would not take this class for \"fun\" unless you're just obsessed with chemistry. I would recommend this class as a requirement over the regular general chemistry class because we got into the nitty gritty on how and why stuff works and I think that will help me remember everything better for the MCAT. Additionally, the grade distribution was always pretty high on exams (high B) so most people do well in this class, but I'm not sure if that's true for gen chem. MJ isn't teaching it next year so I'm not sure how it'll be with the other professors.",
                "I would recommend, especially if people are interested in taking downstream classes involving thermodynamics.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone majoring in anything biology or chemistry related because it is foundational information.",
                "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to another student, regardless of whether you are a STEM major or just looking to learn some chemistry. If possible, take 167 over 163  I found 167 to be more comprehensive and more interesting. This course is run by an incredible and really amazing professor (Mark Johnson), and the material is usually presented in a way that is digestible and facile to understand. Don't be intimidated by the first couple lectures  they are very math-filled, but the overall course material is not like that. Though it's advertised that you should have some math knowledge, all you really need to know how to do is BASIC algebra and know how to use a calculator  plain and simple, because the math is unimportant compared to the knowledge. The teaching fellows (they work in Johnson's lab, so I'd imagine they will help in future semesters) were incredible people who always added fun elements to this course. I really was sad to see this course end, and it honestly may have been my favorite course I've taken so far! OH! And be prepared to relate EVERYTHING back to thermodynamics and the first law MJ loved thermo, and even though I only understood it on a basic level, it was always worked into discussions.",
                "If they have a choice, they should take this class only if they're interested in an intellectual challenge that sets them up for physical chemistry. I wouldn't have chosen to take this class if I had a choice--I know I won't be taking physical chemistry in the future, but I unfortunately was not able to transfer out of the class. Wish the chemistry department would change this policy.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone who has or wants to take general chemistry. Professor Johnson is a pretty funny guy and his lectures were always interesting.",
                "Yes, if you have taken AP chem in high school and don't remember a lot, this class both reviews and adds new knowledge about chemistry.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It establishes a sound foundation in chemistry, the professor and TF's are friendly and helpful, and the grading is fair.",
                "Yes",
                "This course is necessary in further building on scientific knowledge. It looks at chemistry through a very unique lens.",
                "Yes, this is a challenging course that supplements a lot of what you learn in high school chemistry.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in science because it really broadens your understanding of chemistry.",
                "For those that already have a basic understanding of the broad chemistry topics covered in this class from high school, this course offers a good amount of intellectual challenge and delves much deeper into the complexities of these ideas. However, it is also a relatively rigorous course compared to the alternative CHEM 165.",
                "Yes I would recommend it! I think Mark is a great professor and the content is challenging but still understandable",
                "Yes--chemistry is a pre-requisite, and it broadened my understanding of chemical processes, particularly in relation to thermodynamics and free energy.",
                "If you took 163 and enjoy mathematical proofs, then yes.  This will be a very interesting experience for you.  If you expect this class to be a continuation of 163, with purely conceptual chemistry and few calculations, then I would carefully consider if you want to take a math-based chemistry course.  167 may not be the best fit.",
                "Yes, it's a good introductory chemistry course even if it is a bit challenging",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student as it was super interesting and I felt I came out of that class with a strong understandings on chemistry that I had not had gotten from my high school classes.",
                "Yes. I left the course understanding most of the things I'd learned unlike CHEM 163. Professor Johnson makes the class material very engaging, and the relationship between the TFs and the Professor makes the class interesting.",
                "Yes i think this is a good course for students interested in chemistry and science in general. I also LOVED professor johnson.",
                "Yes, I've been pretty impressed by the intro chemistry sequence. While the content can be reasonably challenging, I've found the courses and the people to be approachable. Professor Johnson has been an engaging and fun professor, and the class is totally doable if you keep up with the assignments (no late work) and can attend peer review sessions.",
                "I would because it establishes a good foundation in chemistry.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is looking to learn more about physical chemistry without wanting to fully commit to a physical chemistry course. This course, while providing a standard review of general chemistry topics relating to physical chemistry, explores a few areas of the class in a lot of detail and rigor that may represent the representation of a few topics as discussed in a true physical chemistry course. I would also recommend this course to a student who wishes to understand the energetics and kinetics that drive the daily physical and chemical processes that we all bear witness to, such as the boiling of water, the evaporation of sweat, and chemical processes that occur within our daily lives.",
                "I wouldn't recommend 167. It wasn't an enjoyable course, the TFs weren't always helpful, and the professor had clear favorites in the class. He extended invitations to them to meet in class rather than to the students who scored poorly and would have benefitted more from talking to him. Additionally, a lot of the material was unclear, especially because the answer keys to homework and exams were vague and didn't contain the answers (or had wrong answers!). Overall, this course was very frustrating, difficult, and unenjoyable, so take another class instead or wait for another professor.",
                "If you had an excellent AP Chem experience, this course feels like AP Chem with a few more equations tossed in. I would recommend this course for at least those who think positively of the previous statement. For those who dabble in the reasoning behind mathematical equations and for those who want to have some experience with the practical side of everyday chemistry and have not already, this course might also be of interest."
