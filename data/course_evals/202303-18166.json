While it is scary to get up in front of people and perform, it is so worth it because everyone has a great time. Not really a weakness because this is just the nature of things but there is a decent amount of work required outside of class, mainly rehearsing. Readings are easy and straightforward.",

You get a lot of freedom in choosing what you want to work on which is also nice.",
