Tests were a bit rough at first and multiple of us didn't finish, but they found a better balance as the semester progressed.",
                "The strengths was the small class size which allowed me to get to know all my classmates pretty well. One weakness was the degree of difficulty for the tests. Some weeks the tests were much more difficult than others.",
                "The course was organized very well and gave detailed outlines of every unit. Improvements would be more time spent on each topic learned since at times the content felt rushed due to how many vocabulary words and grammar structures we had to memorize"

                "Yes! If you're at this level it's the right course to take. I already knew much of the grammar we learned going in, but it allowed me to work a lot on my speaking, listening, and reading which were all definitely lacking.",
                "If you want to improve your German, especially your grammar, I would recommend this course. It really moves beyond L3 and focuses on complex sentence structures. However, the workload did increase from L3 because the asynchronous activities often took up a lot of time every week. There were still bi-weekly tests, but they got more difficult in comparison to L3 (which makes sense).",
                "Yes! This is a great course for anyone looking to improve their German skills and learn more about German culture."
