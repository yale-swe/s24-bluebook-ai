                "In this class, I learned about the mental health challenges Native American communities face. I learned about the historical treatment and social challenges Native American communities have faced as well. In the final paper, I was able to deeply research an area of research I was interested in and learned a lot about the writing process for psychology papers.",
                "Learned a lot about disparities in mental health",
                "I learned about the mental and physical health landscape of american indians and the struggles this community faces in particular as it relates to their health and wellbeing",
                "This is an incredibly unique and one-of-a-kind course that offers a broad overview of clinical priorities for treating American Indian / First Nations / Indigenous patients. No other course at Yale offers this sort of clinical insight for the present-day, and while many of the sources available remain exploratory or introductory, the strength of the course lies in its ability to readapt basic clinical practice to the distinct socio-economic circumstances of the settler \"post-\"colony. Furthermore, it is the perfect course for orienting yourself in the field in terms of \"who's who\" and, in doing so, sets itself up well as a pipeline course for aspiring clinicians hoping to shore up what has always been a criminally and perennially underfunded area of necessary clinical practice.",
                "I learned about mental health challenges facing Native American communities and about the professionals working hard to help. I learned how to conduct literature searches and wrote my first literature review.",
                "This course was incredibly informative about the current state of mental health research and practice broadly and toward Native American communities specifically. It was very good at explaining future directions for all these things and building students into capable people to handle challenges that arise with going deeper into the field."

            "comments": [
                "A strength of the class is the great variety of topics we cover in the class. Each week had a different theme so it was always interesting and we were able to learn a lot of material this way. Another strength of this course was the seminar format where we balanced discussions with lectures from the professor to provide background knowledge. We frequently had guest speakers which each provided unique perspectives on the topics we were discussing.",
                "Thought the seminar was well-organized for learning and allowed ample opportunity for questions and discussions. However, the time we used to break apart in small groups and talk about our papers (especially early on) was rather chaotic and could have been used for more lecture-based material.\r\n\r\nI felt like the term paper was kind of overplayed in the sense that we were expected to talk about it every week, but we didn't submit parts of it in stages. We only were asked to submit an outline prior to the official deadline, and we never got feedback on those outlines, so it seemed a bit pointless. I think that incremental deadlines (ex: submit topic by this date, submit outline by this date, send draft of lit review section by this date) with feedback on each would better match the professors' desire for students to work on and be engaged with their papers for the whole course of the semester. Without those sorts of benchmark deadlines, it felt like (myself included) there was a lot of redundancy in what students would say about their papers each week, since they weren't really working on them at the time.",
                "weaknesses: it was a bit difficult to communicate with professors via email, which made it difficult to schedule office hours; i found the only way to schedule office hours was to speak with professors in class. we also never received feedback on our media analysis essay which made it difficult to understand what the professors were looking for for the next essay; strengths - the teaching staff is incredibly passionate about the subject material, which makes the class evermore engaging",
                "In terms of strengths, both Dr. Beitel and Dr. Cutter complement each other's areas of expertise very well. Dr. Beitel clearly has an extensive background as a therapeutic practitioner, and his training in psychoanalysis offers a perspective that supplements well Dr. Cutter's more orthodox biomedical approach. Dr. Cutter, meanwhile, offers fairly robust first-hand accounts of patient perspectives throughout treatment. Both, meanwhile, are clearly versed in the literature available to such a niche area of clinical practice, and both demonstrate clear relationships with the people impacted by this field's development, whether as practitioners or patients. Additionally, they are very attentive to each students' personal development in the course and provide ample room within each seminar for students to develop their independent papers and obtain feedback from one another.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can name clearly has largely to do with the available literature. Namely, some of the sources seem to preserve outdated or controversial metrics, and more supplemental perspectives could be provided to challenge or reground those metrics in more contemporary critique. That said, this need not assume much priority at all. The course is clearly intended as a survey, and given its uniqueness in subject matter, that alone suffices. Any issues with sources are purely incidental and a result of the field itself remaining under-resourced and underdeveloped, for reasons beyond the urgency of the issues in question and the efficacy of its practitioners.",
                "Strengths of the course include the built-in support for writing a literature review and guest speakers with great insights.",
                "Overall, the course is strong. I think it does what it sets out to do well. The presentations were sometimes slow and the discussions could have been more engaging, but I think that is partially on students and the professors did incredibly well to balance student input and lecturing."

This class fundamentally changed the way I view mental health and research in mental health. I know the lessons, skills, and stories I gained from the class will aid me in my future studies and my future career. Professor Beitel and Cutter are wonderful, kind, and facilitate a very open and welcoming discussion environment.",

                "Yes, i would recommend this course for students looking to learn more about the mental health of native americans and about culturally competent care in general",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student even remotely interested in contemporary clinical practice for Indigenous / First Nations / American Indian communities in North America. No other course at Yale offers this perspective in the literature with such direct and narrow focus.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it because it introduces more people to a field that needs more scholars and professionals contributing.",
