                "Lectures were very surface level but understandable, since this was an intro course. Quincy is a very passionate professor!",
                "Professor Ngan put together very well-organized and engaging lectures. The assignments were also broad enough to encourage exploration, but were not too overwhelming. It was also cool to look at pieces of art during sections. The only weakness I would note is that I wish our sections would have involved walking through the art gallery, as opposed to just looking at pieces in the basement.",
                "I think the lectures could be structured a little better to remind us of the key points or main topics that we are supposed to retain. Some of the readings didnt feel related to the class, so I wish there was a bit more connection between readings and class. I think this class is really strong in how receptive the TFs and the Professor are and how they are eager to receive and act on feedback. Halfway through this semester, there was a Poorvu center review of the course, and the Professor definitely acted on the feedback which improved the course. Its a fun class.",
                "Quincy is a very passionate lecturer, even at 9:25 in the morning, and his lecture slides were well organized. The discussion sections were also very fun; it was to be able to interact closely with YUAG objects.",
                "I loved looking at the art pieces in person during section and discussing them with my classmates. I also thought Professor Quincy told really interesting stories in his lectures instead of just showing us the pieces and the facts about them. They felt like components of historical narratives, rather than the narratives being background facts for the art. I would have appreciated a little more guidance/more explanation on the first assignment (the research paper proposal); I wasn't exactly sure what was expected of me until after I got the comments back.",
                "It's difficult because this is an EXTREMELY broad survey that really does an injustice to the many regions it covers. Asia is a huge continent!! I would've preferred maybe four instead of five topics as we could've then covered them in more depth. As someone of Indian descent I would sacrifice that topic because Quincy didn't seem to excited to teach that material for some reason.",
                "Strengths: the material was very fascinating and the professor was great. Weakness: the professor often read off of his own script and did not include a lot of information on his slides",
                "Due to the broad amount of material lumped into the course, you learn about representative art pieces from the region / time period but don't get to see a broad selection. It's a strength that students are exposed to so much, but it is also a weakness in that little depth is possible, although the instructor did a fantastic job considering the limitations.",
                "I thoroughly enjoyed this class. Any weakness that I initially had were answered and applied during the midsemester feedback.",

Prof. Ngan made sure it was very accessible to non-art history majors and engaging for all. We had multiple sections take place in the Yale Art Museum with the objects that we learned about in class. The two independent assignments (attend a talk and write short report and Wikipedia page proposal/final project) were really interesting and I actually found myself completing them well before the deadline because I enjoyed it. The prof really lets you take charge of your project. We also got days off where Prof/TAs were around to ask questions when there was a major assignment due, so we would have time to work on it, which was very helpful. Overall it was my favorite class this semester because I felt like I learned a lot about an underrepresented field without worrying about punitive grading or needing to become an expert. Would recommend to anyone and everyone.",

                "Yes! I thought the material was super interesting, especially the contemporary art at the end of the course. I also think the opportunity to look at the objects in the YUAG was really cool. The course wasn't too difficult, but it was intellectually stimulating and I genuinely enjoyed going to lectures.",
                "Sure. I saw some cool art but at the end of the day, because the course material was so broad, I felt like I just scratched the surface. Take History of Decorative Arts if you're looking for an intro for the major.",
