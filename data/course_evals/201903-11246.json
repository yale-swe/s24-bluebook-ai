    "This course facilitated the enhancement of my time management skills (ensuring I had the explorations completed by 7 in the morning and not waiting until the last minute to start the problem sets and be up all night finishing them). I learned which outside sources effectively enhance my understanding of the material the best and when I should use them to review."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I got to learn a lot, but it was also a lot of information at once which was a little overwhelming.",
    "Strengths: Brett Smith, the content.\r\nWeaknesses: My instructor. \r\nI believe it would be helpful to review how the math department places students into introductory math classes. It is discouraging when students have already taken BC Calc and are essentially reviewing the content. It makes it harder to ask questions, and made me less likely to work in groups or form study groups.",
    "A strength would be that practice exams and multiple review sessions were offered as a method of exam preparation.\r\nA weakness would be that I was taught by a GA in his beginning years as instructing and some points were difficult to grasp at first.",
    "Small class size made class very engaging. Could improve with less complicated teaching techniques.",
    "The strength is the availability of help with peer tutor hours and office hours. The weakness is that you only meet for 50ish minutes 3 times a week. That, in my opinion, is not enough time to explain a calculus concept in depth to the extent that the students will understand.",
    "I think that teachers being graduate students was a bit hard since they just went through the material.",
    "This course is very fast-paced. It's quite possible that I would've done better had I chosen a different section, maybe one that meets twice a week for a longer time instead of three times a week for only 50 minutes each class, but in that case, the same amount of material is still being covered each week, so I'm not sure how different it would be. I struggled to keep up with taking notes in class while trying to think about and understand the concept being taught, so most of my time spent in class consisted of me mindlessly scrambling to write down all the notes and examples before they were erased, trying to teach myself the concepts later on from what I had managed to write down."

    "Yes.",
    "I don't think many people are taking Calculus for fun, so take it if you need it",
    "Of course not. Anyone who enjoys math would be put off by this course. The only reason to take it is as a pre-req. Nothing about this class is interesting.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student because it is an introductory calculus course at Yale and many majors have this course as a requirement.",
    "Yes, as long as you have Calculus background you should be fine.",
    "I kind of have to because its calculus two and people should take that.",
    "Yes, but only if the student has to take a QR requirement or if the student really likes math",
    "I'd recommend this course to another student if they were very strong in their calculus comprehension abilities, could think quickly, and could confidently think about math concepts in an abstract sense."
