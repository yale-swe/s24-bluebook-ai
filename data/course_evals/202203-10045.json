We examined psychiatry's role in colonized Africa, indigenous North American populations, the Phillippines and Latin America. Anti-psychiatry was also discussed and Michel Foucault's works were tangentially discussed.",
                "We learned about the history of psychiatry in a  colonial context, as well as histories of resistance to psychiatry.",
                "Not only did we learn everything on the syllabus, but I not have a deeper understanding of colonization, decolonization, post-colonialism, etc. and the nuances between those terms.",

                "I know a lot more about the context of colonization and decolonization processes in Africa, Latin America, and elsewhere. We brought in discussions of psychiatry, history of medicine, anthropology, abolition, disabilities studies, and so much more. The format of the final project was also super thought-provoking and valuable.",
                "I gained a wonderful breadth of knowledge about the intricacies of psychiatry and colonization across the world. We had thorough and engaging conversations about academic trailblazers like Frantz Fanon and more. I had an absolutely wonderful time in this class and it has truly become one of my favorite experiences here at yale.",

Curriculum was thus not only limited to oppression, but expanded to emphasize how colonized people managed their own health care institutionsrejecting white-saviorship narratives. Emphasized health as not an individualized issue, but related to larger systems of power, restricting access to the hospital and health care."

                "Phenomenal instructors, great self-selecting group of students. Sometimes the readings felt repetitive but otherwise, a really amazing class.",
                "Strengths: The material, professor, and class discussion was incredible!! Ramos was a great facilitator of discussion and really met all of us where we were coming from such diverse backgrounds and areas of knowledge expertise. He really created a safe community for us to engage with some pretty challenging material and I really learned and grew alot in this class. Weaknesses: Sometimes the readings were a lot and we weren't able to discuss them all in depth so it felt like a waste of time. COuld be improved with less reading but further depth within them.",
                "Some of the readings were a bit long, but other than that the class was great. The class hours were all discussion based and I really enjoyed that.",
                "Honestly, no weaknesses. The class is dynamic and the readings are great.",
                "strengths: the grace and support of professor ramos, the readings are super interesting, very insightful conversations \r\nweaknesses: sometimes we wouldnt have time to touch on all of the readings and i wish we had a clearer allocation of time to talk about all the assigned readings.",
                "One of the best professors I've had at Yale. Actually tries to make the class accessible to everyone, and communicates with students with mutual respect and understanding while still creating a plan for accountability. When the readings are a little dense, Prof Ramos goes through crucial vocabulary and helps the class break the concepts down. Very good at providing context and guiding questions, while also giving students the space to expand on their own thoughts and engage with each other. Was able to write various forms of essays, including two reading responses (which served as great checkpoints to make sure I was understanding the content), and a final teach-in. Very much appreciated the form of a teach-in, which included writing up a lesson plan and lecture. Allowed me to write how I would speak, and was a much more flexible and interesting new format. Also helped me think of how all the content in the curriculum could be applied to current issues in contexts I was personally passionate about. Our Professor was also very available over office hours and provided good and detailed feedback on our writing."

The workload is not too overwhelming, consisting of two short essays and a teach-in. Professor Ramos did an amazing job of being accommodating throughout the semester, directly applying the insights we learned throughout the course into the structure of the class itself. He did a particularly good job of creating a sense of community.",
