I felt like I was challenged to think more critically in this class than any other class I've taken at Yale, and I've been able to genuinely apply this critical thinking to other courses and areas of my life. I was also challenged to position myself within the content of the course and to think critically about my own positionality.",
                "Critical transnational feminist analyses of migration, tourism, globalization, capitalism, race, gender, sexuality, and much more!",
                "I learned about transnational notions of gender and sexuality as well as various feminist theories.",
                "This class is AMAZING! It will teach you how to think critically, engage with theory, and reflect on your own experiences with thoughtfulness. Professor Savci is truly a brilliant professor and her guidance through each class allows every student to benefit from the course. The readings are exceptional and offered a lot of insight on transnational identity formations, economies, and hierarchies of difference. Each class discussion always left me with something new to ruminate on, and I often found myself referring and reflecting on the class outside of our meetings. I cannot recommend the course enough.",
                "Learned new frameworks for viewing and understanding international and domestic issues, and a lot about many different interesting case studies and authors."

                "The seminar was very well-taught, with a good mix of hearing the insights/thoughts of the professor + hearing other students/engaging in conversation myself.",
                "One huge strength of this course is just how much it challenged me to think critically about gender and sexuality. Also, Evren is truly brilliant and cares so much about supporting students while also pushing us to think deeper and to ask questions and lean into complexity. The assignments were also a big strength. The three short reflective essays were a great opportunity to go back through the readings from that module and to think critically about how what we had beed discussing in class played out in my own life. Honestly, I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "The primary strength of the course is its incredible professor. Evren Savci has such a deep knowledge of and evident passion for transnational feminism, and it shines through at every level of this course: the excellently-crafted syllabus (zero skips, every reading is an absolute mind-expanding hit that I WILL be citing as long as Im writing essays), the energetic and engaging facilitation that kept us on our toes and working to think more creatively and critically, the care that she brings to connecting with her students in class and beyond, and ESPECIALLY the moments in which she explained concepts or shared her ideas with the class, which I would always give myself wrist cramps trying to fully transcribe because her analysis is just that good. There are no notable weaknesses I can think oftake this class!!!",
                "The opportunity to apply our own experiences to class knowledge, in addition to the cohesive course curriculum and interactive class environment, made this class particularly enjoyable. I especially liked writing personal essays reflecting on our own lives through the lens of the feminist theory we learned in class.",
                "This course is phenomenal, and easily one of the best I've taken during my time at Yale. The readings will blow your mind every week and Professor Savci led our classes really successfully -- every student was encouraged to speak, the classes built upon themselves, and each seminar would fly by. The papers are accessible and offered an opportunity to apply the readings (which, while amazing, can sometimes be hard to completely digest). Professor Savci was very kind and supportive for every project."

                "Definitely! This has been the best seminar at Yale I have taken so far, and is so well-taught/interesting. Anyone should take this course and learn to see the world through another set of critical lens.",
                "YES! YES! YES! I honestly think everyone should have to take this class. I learned so much, not just about gender and sexuality transnationally, but I also learned how to think critically and to ask essential questions that challenge hegemonic narratives. The course is super well organized and while the readings are hefty, it is clear that everything on the syllabus was put there with a lot of intentionality. The readings and assignments were never unreasonable, and Evren is very understanding and flexible about deadlines.",
                "I wish every Yale student could take a class with Evren at some point in their time here: her classes will push you to unsettle your assumptions and see the world through a different lens more attuned to injustice and the possibilities of overcoming it. Youll be able to critically reflect on the courses themes in relation to your own life and passions, to understand in a new light how the personal is politicaland transnational! n the world we live in now. This class is my favorite so far of college, and I am so grateful to Evren for making it what it was.",
                "Yes, I highly recommend taking WGSS 206! This course truly opened my eyes to the transnational nature of gender and sexuality, and its impacts on our everyday lives.",
                "Yes, absolutely. This course changed my worldview and allowed me to really analyze issues that I had been afraid to tackle on my own. It offers a way of looking at the world not cynically but understanding the patterns and movements that lead to things being the way they are. It is not overly centered on Europe as many classes tend to be, which I found extremely important.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested, and I have already recommended it to anyone who will listen! It is a deeply enriching class, and the seminar environment is supportive for students with any level of WGSS background. You will learn so much about the world, how to re-conceptualize it, and think critically about your place within it (in this regard, I found the class to be a somewhat therapeutic exercise). I think the course has left me with tools and knowledge that I will carry with me far beyond my time at Yale -- you should absolutely take it.",
