                "I thought the material was sort of unnecessary and seemed very inapplicable to real-world ideas. However, I am told these are the fundamentals necessary for understanding deeper concepts which can be used.",

                "The lecture slides were relatively unengaging and the lecture style was sometimes repetitive and unhelpful. Concepts were brushed over without much explanation. Tests were fair, though, and the professor clearly did care about the performance of students. She just was not a very engaging lecturer.",
                "The engagement and discussion we could get by learning in a seminar format was great, I'm glad I got to take this course in this format. The worst part to anyone taking this with a strong math background will be how much calculus the course uses while pretending it's not calculus, when it would make infinitely more sense to anyone who'd taken calc 1 to just acknowledge what it was.",
                "Strengths: This course is at its best when the opportunity to collaborate with peers is provided. This occurred many times during class with practice questions and small activities, but could happen much more in the seminar style setting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures can drag and are not recorded for later reference (even though the amount of material on the actual slides is quite minimal).",
                "This course was very strong in that it was very well taught. However, some of the material came across as a bit dry in the lecture setting.",
                "Curve could be less strict",
                "A strength of this course is the material is well-structured and presented in a good sequence.",
                "Strengths: lots of interesting material discussed in class, teacher is very engaging, reading the textbook chapters before class is very helpful \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not a lot of practice problems other than the weekly problem sets",
                "Very well structured class with great support system",
                "The structure of the class can get boring and repetitive which makes learning at times difficult and challenging. The PSETs and exams were selected appropriately to promote effective learning outcomes. The Teaching Fellow provided a lot of help and guidance outside of the classroom setting.",
                "Strengths: well organized class, a lot of content, most classes were pretty engaging with Professor Simon's dry humor. Weekly psets were not too much work. I especially enjoyed the buzz group parts of class, where we had to talk to our peers and justify what we thought was the answer for an edge-case\/special example question that forced us to try to understand the concept.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: high curve and much more a leminar than a seminar. I only know the names of a few peers in class."

                "This course is totally worth it for anyone looking to learn more about simple economic theory and practice. It goes much deeper than an AP course on microeconomics would, so its a great stepping stone for harder econ classes at yale.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student; it is interesting and provides a basic understanding of an important subject.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I especially appreciated how the course was taught as a seminar, which made it very easy to ask questions during class, which REALLY helps in understanding the material properly.",
                "Yesit provides a good basic overview for economics. While it is intellectually challenging, it is no overly so. The PowerPoint slides combined with the professors lecture style does put an emphasis on taking notes (and not participating as much), but this format ultimately makes it easier to study in the long run.",
                "This class showed me that I was not interested in economics, so if you are interested or are considering economics take the class.",
                "Yes. Microeconomics helps you become a clear thinker and it's easy to see its many real-world applications.",
                "Yes: Professor Simons is a great intro econ professor and covers some justifications\/rational before teaching the topic. She tied in interesting economists, case studies, and good econ books, as well as some of her own anecdotes. Albeit not a seminar, the size of the class is still smaller than the big 115 lecture and does give the advantage that you're sitting closer to the professor and you feel less inhibition in asking questions!"
