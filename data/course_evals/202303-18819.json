                "Chill",
                "The structure of this class is making one presentation based on a graduate text and listening to the other students' presentations, so it's your chance to get exposed to graduate topics in math through presentations and asking questions. However, it is mostly up to you how much work you want to put into this class to determine how much you want to figure out from it, so you could get basically nothing out of this if you didn't actively engage/participate in other students' presentations. Strength is that it's super chill and flexible, up to you; a \"weakness\" is that it's pretty tempting to just coast by in the class and not get anything out of it, especially since this class is just a senior requirement for the math major.",
                "The strength of this course is that you get to choose which topic you are interested in from a list of recommended books. It is self-guided, so you can interact with/get help from the instructor as much or as little as you want.",
                "It was cool to have a more structured chance to learn about mathematical topics outside of a class-like setting. However, I think partially because the class was so chill, people often didnt put a lot of effort into making their presentations easy to understand  it was more like people wanted to get through them, which was kinda frustrating. I think it would have been better if presenters had to give sufficient background on the topics so that more people could follow along.",
                "Strengths: a lot of student presentations and hands-on learning\r\nWeaknesses: can't think of any",
                "The senior seminar feels like an anti-climax. I thought it was going to be a \"final gauntlet\" at the end of my college career, and it turned out to mostly be pretty boring. I worked hard on my presentation, but that was only a few days of work, and the rest of the semester was pretty chill.",
                "Strengths: I did think it was cool that this class was mostly centered around student presentations. Professor Toprak met with each of us, and was helpful in deciding a topic for presentation. It was cool learning from each other throughout the course. Weaknesses: the class was pretty large, so we only really did one presentation each - which was pretty fine in terms of workload, though the class wasn't all that mentally stimulating (though we still covered a lot of cool topics, which was cool). The class was pretty low commitment, which was fine by me, it's just not really the type of class for learning a topic in math in really thorough depth. I think it was both a strength and a weakness that people with varied interests were in the class - I think it was hard to normalize the content backgrounds across the class, but it was also cool seeing people make different connections. On the whole I personally feel these are kind of moot points because the senior seminar is just a senior requirement at the end of the day, and it's not like I picked this class because I was super excited to be there, but I do think there are different ways to make the experience more engaging (maybe if the class was smaller so we each had more time to present, I dont know). - At the end of the day it's a very very easy way to fulfill the senior requirement for math so I didn't leave with any complaints, and I learned some stuff from just sitting in class every day. So not bad!",

                "It's the senior math major requirement, so you have to take it. Thankfully, Prof. Toprak is super nice, chill, and understanding and overall the class had a relaxing vibe. This could totally change based on the professor. Since the class is just a bunch of student presentations, of which one of them you'll present, you can either get a lot out of this class by actively listening to every presentation and asking questions, or just coast by. So, it's up to you, the flexibility is great.",

                "This is one of the ways to fulfill the senior requirement for the math major, and in this iteration it was quite easy, we presented once and then all we had to do was basically show up and occasionally ask a question. So if you're not looking to write a paper (which I wasn't) this is a really really easy way to square away the requirement. And it's pretty chill. So if you're a senior in the math major (or related stuff) would recommend.",
                "Yes, if you are taking it is probably a requirement for your major. But it is a pretty chill way to end your math experience. Workload is low and you get to mostly sit and learn if you care to pay attention. It likely depends on the professor but I would recommend as a way to fulfill a math senior seminar requirement."
