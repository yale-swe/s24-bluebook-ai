                "By taking this course, I learned an enormous amount about Persian writing, reading, comprehension, and culture.",
                "I learned about Persian conversational skills, how to write Persian (speaking and writing actually have two different forms), different cities in Iran (including the cities' respective cultures, locations, dialects, climates, and more), the Persian alphabet, the Persian numeral system, Persian foods, Persian culture (arts, literary figures, music, dance, carpet-making, glass-blowing, religion, mirror work, poetry, theater, cinema, etc.), Persian etiquette, and Persian artifacts. We visited the Beinecke to view and learn about historic Persian works that the Beinecke owns, some of which are centuries old and quite beautiful. We spent a lot of time learning about Persian culture while also learning how to speak and comprehend the language. I developed a strong understanding of Persian grammar rules, which are very different from what I'm used to. We got to know the culture firsthand by watching a movie in class that was entirely in Persian and watching modern Persian music videos. Outside of class, our professor also offered us opportunities such as attending events and protests related to the vital cause for women's rights in Iran.",
                "I am not able to read, write, and speak in persian with a lot of vocabulary",
                "I learned a lot of vocabulary, grammar, and cultural knowledge. I found the focus on vocabulary and grammar very useful.",
                "I was able to immerse myself both in Farsi and also in Iranian culture!",

                "Strengths: I mean everyone knows how to read, write, and speak! That's a huge strength. You can also tell that Professor Shayesteh does care about her students and how they learn.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The textbook and workbook are so bad and disorganized, you really cannot learn anything from them. Professor Shayesteh is the only avenue you can practice and learn Persian, but she expects you to do outside work too. All the vocab and grammar that we learn is so jumbled because of this disorganization. The tests are also very difficult and information that we may have only talked about once is sometimes included. Language table is also very unnecessary the way Professor Shayesteh has structured them because we just learn even more vocabulary that no one remembers because we never talk about it again in class. Language table should strictly be conversation. That being said, Nastaran is an AMAZING teaching assistant.",
                "This course did a fantastic job of teaching a significant amount of Persian in a very short time. We also learned so much about Persian culture (art, literature, Iranian cities, etc.), which really aided in gaining an appreciation for not only the language, but also for Persian customs as a whole.",
                "I really enjoyed getting a deep understanding of Persian culture through weekly discussions about prominent Persian literary and arts figures as well as aspects of Persian culture such as food, music, dancing, aesthetics, gardening, architecture, decoration, and more. It was great to go on a class visit to the Beinecke and explore collections that included historic Persian works. I enjoyed watching a movie in Persian one day and discussing it, along with the occasional music video. I'm glad our professor offered us outside-of-class immersion opportunities such as Persian Students' Association and women's rights events. I also felt that the textbooks we worked with were really good at teaching us to practice Persian, and going over our homework sometimes in class was helpful. We had an amazing TA who ran our language table once a week, and that was a great place for practicing the language. Another strength of the course was that we learned Persian grammar rules thoroughly. I enjoyed doing roleplay projects and presentations with my peers, which were often humorous but also a great practice opportunity.\r\n\r\nI wish we'd been able to read some of the literary works that we explored, but I don't know if that's feasible considering how much actual language curriculum we have to cover. I also think that language table should have been used exclusively for Persian conversation as opposed to for learning new Persian words.",
                "I definitely learned a lot from this course but it could benefit from being more organized. I appreciated when she informed us of what we'd do in class beforehand or sometimes give the schedule for a few days, but a lot of things were assigned last minute, and announcements made late.",
                "One of the best things about the class was the breadth of knowledge we covered and the strong bonds the class formed.",
                "A strength was the application of classroom materials to a broader context, such as the visit to the Beinecke library to view Farsi scripts.",
                "Fun activities and decent development of language skills. Weaknesses: poor organization, too much use of English, and delay in feedback."

                "100% if you want to learn Persian this is a GREAT course, I am truly amazed by the amount that I have learned.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Ostad is such a talented and skilled instructor, and she will guide you through the Persian language in such a way that you will leave the class being able to write several pages in a completely new language, carry out long conversations, and understand Persian culture very well. I don't know of any other language department where the students leave L1 knowing as much about a language and culture as our class did.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Persian is a beautiful and fascinating language. I also think this is one of the few language programs where we are also immersed in the culture and history of the people who speak the language. Our class visited the Beinecke and looked at historic Persian works and explored all things Persian culture (we watched a movie in Persian, listened to Persian music, and discussed literary figures, arts, cinema, theater, foods, dance, music, etc). I found myself wanting to read the great Persian works that we learned about. The class can be challenging, but it's extremely rewarding. The professor will also help you every step along the way so long as you ask for it. The class becomes extremely tightly knit as well, which is wonderful. So long as you are willing to practice the words we learn and work incrementally, you will do well and develop a good grasp on the Persian language.",
                "yes if you want to learn persian",
                "Yes, I would, because it was rewarding and I learned a lot. I think the class is particularly good at teaching the basics of the Persian language, including the alphabet and simple verb conjugations.",
                "It helps in building basic skills in Persian/Farsi. Take it if you genuinely want to learn the language, not just to fulfill the language requirement."
