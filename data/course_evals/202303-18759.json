                "strengths: the content itself is pretty straightforward, the ULAs are GREAT so you always have easily accessible people to help you complete problem sets and study for exams. It is very possible to do well on exams, and the practice exams are often similar in difficulty. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: 1. I did not feel like my teacher explained the concepts very well and I ultimately did most of my learning in office hours with the ULAs. 2. Particularly for the final, I did not feel like the practice material reflected what the exam looked like. 3. class is so slow and doesn't actually prepare you for the problem sets. Spent all my time in office hours figuring them out, because I did not feel like class set me up to understand them or even know where to begin.",
                "Strengths were the review sessions and class environment. Weakness were the teaching style and disorganization of the course. Hated the grading system of P-sets and exams as there was either too many marks for short questions or it was not transparent or consistent as to where I was gaining or losing marks.",
                "I think the extra help of\r\nThe course could be improved",
                "Strengths were in the office hours\/ULA... I feel like I only re-learned topics from my past education and just strengthened that knowledge through p-sets. I wish I was more engaged overall."
