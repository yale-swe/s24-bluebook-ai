            "comments": [
                "I think the final exam really caught me off guard. The fact that we never had a full lab period to practice a sample question made it so that it was really difficult to know what to expect on the final. In addition, the problems that we had for practice mostly went over equipment techniques as opposed to applying concepts we learned over the semester, and as such, was not really representative of the final. As such, while I felt like I spent a lot of effort studying for the final exam, I didn't know what to expect and it was a really stressful experience.",
                "The strengths include the approachability of the TAs and the one-page limit of the post-lab report. The weekly quizzes were also short and sweet.",
                "Strengths: plenty of resources and help from TA to explain concepts  \r\nWeakness: none really",
                "This course was a good supplement to physics 181, and allowed us to explore some of the concepts we were learning, as well as cover some topics we did not go over in class.",
                "This class did a good job of providing clear feedback on the lab reports and lab notes. One weakness of the class was that the directions and questions on the lab handouts would sometimes be hard to understand. I often had to ask my TA or any of the other teaching staff for clarification. I also wished this class was better aligned with the topics we were learning in the lecture course (PHYS 181). We often did an experiment for a concept that we hadn't even learned yet in class.",
                "Final exam weighs for too much relative to how it relates to the execution of the rest of the class.",
                "Nice blend of elements taken from remote labs from the past year to make it a more swift and efficient lab. One lab report every week, weekly pre-lab quizzes, and a lab practical--much less work than orgo lab and honestly very grateful to have a lab that is slightly closer to the 0.5 credit workload it is meant to be than the other labs.",
                "Strengths were that the TAs were helpful during the labs. A weakness was that the labs did not coincide with the lecture class at all, so it was difficult to understand the lab material.",
                "This course is run efficiently and in a way that is very conducive to student learning! They almost never waste your time and keep assignments to the point--reading prep for each lab, and then a one-page lab report as follow up. Labs often take less time than allotted by the course, which is nice, and the TA and instructors are all very helpful when you have a problem/question.",
                "I liked the labs but some were just long for no reason. While usually, I understand them being long to have each part of the lecture, some seemed to drag on very long. However, they did help me understand a lot about physics.",
                "Synchrony with the lecture class; often was being tested on physics concepts I have never learned before and then asked to do a lab about them (extremely difficult especially for those of us who have never taken a physics class before)",
                "It was a good opportunity to explore hands-on applications of physics lecture concepts. However, there were times where the lab class was ahead of lecture.",
                "The grading of lab seems to focus more on specifically following formatting, checking boxes, etc. rather than focusing on actual understanding of the physical phenomena the lab pertains to.",
                "The class has clear communication and instruction, but the labs were very long and some of the questions were a bit hard to figure out especially with only one TA.",
                "The fact that the entire course is based on hands-on activities is a strength in itself. Besides this, the class is overall very well-organized with the distribution of weekly manuals, quizzes, and it demands a reasonable amount from students. My only suggestion would be to reserve the week before the Lab Practical Exam for a practice practical that involves using each of the lab tools and equipment.",
                "Felt like the final was not a good representation of testing my knowledge gained from the course. It was incredibly difficult and weighed for a big portion of my grade.",
                "No weaknesses, all good.",
                "The labs are mostly connected with each other, which is great. However, there is a lot of time where the tasks are boring and repetitive, meaning the lab time is extremely long and unsatisfying.",
                "This course is exceptionally well organized. Information is distributed in a consistent and helpful fashion, the Canvas course page is always up to date with files in the correct locations, the lab manuals are easy to follow, and the teaching team is highly coordinated. I found the content of the labs enjoyable, and the TFs were always helpful when answering questions. The lab notebook assignments ensured that I understood what was going on in lab, and I found the LPE much more manageable this semester in terms of time since it only had two questions.\r\n\r\nMy one suggestion for improvement would be to trim some of the labs that consistently run long. Lab 3 was particularly lengthy, and most students had difficulty finishing the tasks in time. When our labs are a bit shorter, we are less rushed and have more time to ask questions about the content. I've found that I walk away from lab with a deeper understanding of the material when the labs are shorter and give me more time to explore.",
                "Some of the topics were really interesting, but sometimes the labs didnt seem like they were budgeted for us to be able to finish on time.",
                "I really liked the format of the weekly lab lab notebooks + addendums rather than a full lab report",
                "- good TA involvement",
                "I wish that we could have a separate week dedicated to a practice lab practical exam like the first semester.",
                "Strengths: Sufficient amount of work for a 0.5 credit class. I enjoyed getting really close with my TA. The lab reports were graded fairly, and the class was graded fairly overall. \r\nWeakness: Some weeks were much longer and more unnecessary than others. Some of these tasks felt like I was merely following a list and not really applying physics knowledge. The exam at the end felt unnecessary. The class became far too bothersome at times.",
                "The course gave us exposure to a great variety of topics but the grading was very inconsistent across sections and I never received clear feedback. When I asked for an example of a correct version of the area on the report that I lost points on every single time I never got a response.",
                "very organized, really interesting labs especially those that relate to biology and medicine",

                "This class was very well organized.",
                "This class is alright. Its not too much work, but it fits well with the physics lecture.",
                "Strengths: TA's are really strong and always willing to help out. The course is super organized and well facilitated toward student learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lab exam should go back to a 3 lab format.",
                "Strengths: This class overlaps well with what we are learning in physics 181. Sometimes the material here really supplemented it. I think all the instructors are very devoted\r\n\r\nweakness: this class is definitely more tedious that than physics 165L. I thought this one was less intuitive.",
                "The experiments are often pretty cool, but I think they can be a little repetitive, so might be good to have more variety.",
                "The instructors were great. The labs were sometimes a bit long and the section time (8:20 AM) was quite early.",
                "I always felt like there was someone around to answer my questions. A weakness of this course was the lab practical. It was hard to study for and not something one would need to be able to do outside of the class.",
                "The structure is logical and expectations are clear. The labs are fun and I have had a great experience with the TAs both semesters. My one complaint is that significant weight is placed on the final lab practical, which is comprised of only two questions, and stumbling on either of them can dramatically affect your final standing in the course.",
                "Strengths: Great opportunity to test the knowledge learned in physics lecture to the test. Heightened skills of individuality.\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Really good set up of a course!",
                "The course was organized very well. The course was taught pretty well I do not have recommendations for how to improve the course.",

                "The course is well organized and the teaching crew are clearly passionate about what they do.\r\nHowever, the lab reports can sometimes be busy work that do not really help with my understanding of the content.",
                "Weakness- sometimes the lab went over the assigned time and we would have to finish outside of class with the online materials",
                "Strengths  the labs were interesting and engaging. Quizzes were fair and really just intended to make sure that students completed the full reading. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses  lab handouts were often posted after the original Friday deadline which gave students with Monday and Tuesday more of a time crunch when preparing for lab.",

                "The lab was well taught and gave a good mix between material that you could answer on your own and material that you need to ask to understand deeper. The feedback they give on each lab report is helpful to learn where you need to improve for later.",
                "Strengths: Application of scientific technology and lab setup\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lab reports were sometimes very long and could be more concise.",

                "The lab notebooks took a long time to write",
                "Strengths: There are some gems in these labs, especially if you're someone who's not a physics or engineering major but still are interested in using practical skills to explore physics concepts. I appreciated how it wasn't an overwhelming amount of work after the labs.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The labs especially towards the latter half of the semester could be shorter. Additionally, I wish there was more of an experimental design aspect rather than basically answering questions on a lab sheet.",
                "NA",
                "The professors were definitely the highlight of the course as well as its organization",
                "There are no strengths. The experiments are poorly designed and often excruciatingly boring and redundant. The teaching team is not good at explaining concepts, and often get in the way of your experiments. The lab handouts are dense, inconsistent, confusing, and often intentionally misleading. There's absolutely no consistency when it comes to grading; they don't provide clear feedback/rubrics and expectations vary wildly between sections. You are expected to already know and understand the physics concepts related to the lab when you show up, and the experiments themselves teach you nothing, making the whole experience a waste of time if you already took physics lecture and very frustrating if you haven't. This lab was by far the worst part of my week every week, and writing the reports afterwards was a boring, repetitive, and tedious waste of a few hours. Enrolling in this course had an enormous negative impact on my mental health, and the fact that it is a pre-med requirement baffles and angers me to no end. I honestly believe that this course needs a complete redesign. The only positive thing I can think to say  is that Prof Barrett was very helpful when it came to rescheduling sections for students who were sick.",
                "The labs were sometimes really long, and a bit overwhelming to understand.",

I think one thing that could be improved is the lab practical as it would have been really helpful to have had a practice lab practical before taking the real one. Many of the challenges that arose during the exam where due to issues with technology, which would have been nice to iron out beforehand.",

                "The marking scheme for lab reports needs to be standardized across TAs as the quality level varies across them.\r\n\r\nLab handouts should be more structured in terms of theory, then methods, then questions.",
                "the labs were really fun and I learnt a lot, the only thing was that many times we ran over the time; they are just too long and it's super tiring after a long day of classes",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Focuses more on what you do in the lab instead of the after-lab writing. \r\n- Well-organized, lab directions are clear and instructors have notes from where students had difficulty with the same lab activities in previous semesters.\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- In terms of content, the lab was about a week ahead of my lecture. This meant that I often had to learn some complicated physics concepts on the fly while completing the lab, then reconcile that with my physics professor's lecture later. I was missing a lot of the fundamental pre-understanding that would've made the labs a lot easier to complete intuitively.",
                "PHYS 166L is a pretty manageable course. It may feel a bit mundane at times but I personally felt it was better than 165L since it didn't dabble over too many topics.",
                "I think a way to improve this class would have been to give more chances to practice for the lab practical. I think the lab practical was more fair than 165 though.",
                "I cannot think of any way this course could be improved. All of the experiments were very interesting and provided very practical knowledge of physical concepts.",
                "This class weighs the lab practical too heavily relative to the rest of the reports. It feels like the entire semester grade rests on how you perform in 1.5 hours of lab.",
                "The strengths of this course were the clarity with which concepts were presented in the lab handouts, by the instructors and in the quizzes. The weaknesses of this course were the number of complex concepts that were presented in a singular lab, the length of the labs(they often required me to work quickly without fully understanding concepts or leave part unfinished), and how this course did not entirely match up with material learned in 181(at times we learned concepts in lab first and I had difficulty understanding as I had not yet been exposed to them in class).",
                "Strengths - reasonable workload\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - experiments were tedious, practical was unpleasant",
                "The course is very well organized and the TAs are very helpful during the course. The course was also very accommodating when I contracted COVID.",
                "It was good",
                "Very organized, very well thought-out lab experiments, I can't think of a single weakness",
                "I think that the experiments were interesting. I think that there could maybe be a little more lecture and better practice for lpe.",
                "The strengths of this course are the labs themselves however many of them required many excessive steps that were unnecessary and caused it to be very difficult to finish the lab in the allotted time.",
                "Could spend more time covering with making complex circuits using a breadboard.",
                "Clearer grading scheme would have been appreciated. Also, sometimes, labs did not match up with the content in PHYS 181. This meant we were learning topics for the first time while trying to demonstrate them, which was difficult.",
                "The final exam should be a written one or should not exist at all. Your grade is basically determined solely by the practical, essentially undermining all the work you put in throughout the semester. Practical exam should not exist. Period."

                "Yes. This class is one of the easiest you will ever take at Yale. Lab reports took me an average of 30-45 minutes, maximum 1 hour, and you can usually finish the lab in about 2 hours if you work efficiently. Pre-lab preparation is a quick skim of the handout + taking the quiz (15 minutes maybe). Honestly, everyone in here is a first year mechanical engineering student or a sophomore/junior pre med student, but I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a gut science DR.",
                "Yes, if you need it",
                "Yes, it's a very manageable lab class with great professors and TAs. Not too much workload per week and a positive overall atmosphere!",
                "Yes, even if not premed, it doesn't require too much scientific background and the online resources and material can be used to learn any physics that is not directly taught",
                "Yes, it is a required lab for Mechanical Engineering major, and was well taught and structured.",
                "I would only recommend this course to anyone taking PHYS 181, as it is a nice way to gain more exposure to the concepts that will be taught in lecture. Other than that, this class can get a little boring at times.",

                "I would only recommend this course if you have to take it, or if you have already previously learned E&M.",
                "If you're curious about physics or need to do a lab, take this course! It's relatively easy (and much more reasonable) compared to other labs, and teaches the material well. Most of the labs are actually pretty fun, and the workload is light and the same each week.",
                "i would never tell someone to take physics unless they had to, that would be cruel. But the course was fine, it is just the principle of things.",

The physics lab courses supplement the lectures very well, andfrom my experienceit is much easier to understand the course material from a tactile vs. purely auditory/visual perspective. The workload is very manageable, many of the labs can be finished in under 3 hours, the experiments are genuinely interesting, and the teaching team is wonderful.",

                "It is a good introduction into electricity and magnetism. In terms of labs, it definitely is one of the easier ones. The TFs really help with facilitating learning so even if you aren't the best at lab work, the TFs are great and willing to help",

                "I would recommend this course if you need it for your major, or if you are really into physics concerning circuits and light. The professors are really good and explain the lab / background very well, so the lab reports are better to understand.",

The workload is super reasonable and most of the TAs are awesome to work with. The course is organized really well, and you will get a good grade as long as you put in the minimum required work.",
                "Yes, the lab and lab reports every week are the correct amount of work for a 0.5 credit",

                "I would only recommend this course to students who need to take physics lab. It was not so bad that I would urge people to take it with caution, but it doesn't seem as useful to someone who isn't required to take physics and physics lab.",

                "Yes, it was super useful when taking it with physics as sometimes this explained the concept before we got to it in lecture.",
                "Yes! This is much better than the 206 lab which is way more work.",
                "Absolutely, it is a very good course to bring theory of physics to real life and allows for first-hand practice.",

                "Yes, this is a very easy lab. The lab reports are really short and for grading purposes, they mostly focus on your lab notebook (ie., they care more about what you did in the lab compared to what you wrote afterward). If you have to take a lab, based on what I've heard about the 200/260 level labs, this one is a significantly lower-pressure, but still fulfilling, one.",
                "If you have to take it you have to take it. I am not sure if 205L-206L is a better alternative, since the workload for that sequence is intense in comparison. If you took 165L, then you'll be used to the pacing and flow of 166L so you should be good to go.",

                "You are likely only taking this class because you need it for a major or for premed. If so good luck. Treat the entire semester as prep for the lab practical. There are ALOT of terms and concepts covered, but you should have a really firm grasp on them and why you are doing what you are doing in each procedure. Otherwise the practical will not go well.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is looking to further expand their understanding of topics covered in Physics 181.",
                "If you need it",
                "Yes, you'll probably have to take it for your major or for pre-med requirements, but it was a good experience overall.",
                "It was good expectation of a lab course",
                "Yes, most definitely",
