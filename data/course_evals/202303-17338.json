                "Strengths: Professor Torres is a huge strength. This class simply couldn't exist without him. His care, his insights, his connections to great speakers. Everything about the class is truly top notch. This is one of those rare classes where you're like wow, this class is truly exceptionally well taught. The readings are useful and not TOO long. The weekly discussion posts are perfect (they make me do the reading, but they're not hard and they're engaging). And the projects are useful for personal and career growth.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would put the final topic check-in back into the syllabus. I wish I settled on a topic for the final earlier.",
                "excellent course, no weaknesses",
                "Strengths: hearing directly from the practitioners (e.g., LPs, VCs, founders) was a highlight of the course; comprehensive and insightful readings; engaging activities and assignments with clear, reasonable expectations at all times. Weaknesses: sometimes, the \"hype\" felt a bit artificial (e.g., talking of \r\n\"alumni\" or \"cohorts\"), or at least bloated for the relative newness of the course at Yale College and minimal interaction with people/resources outside of the course in the given semester. Building that network for tangible results, without some of the fluff, would be great, and I appreciate Professor Torres's work on developing that on our campus!",
                "I really enjoyed the guest speakers & the opportunity to hear from a number of VCs with a wide variety of investment experiences and strategies. Sometimes, I found that the course focused on more niche/granular parts of the industry (like fundraising types), but in general I loved the format of the course and all of the readings and assignments were super interesting.",
                "Strengths: Prof Torres is incredibly available and puts his students first. Always willing to mentor everyone and take us on incredible field trips and create a community among his students\r\nWeaknesses: At first I thought the course lacked VC finance but in the end I do not think adding more finance would be necessary or appropriate. I would swap out the climate week"

HOWEVER< only take it if you're interested in VC. If you are not interested, don't take it. But if you're curious about VC, totally take it. You'll learn a ton from Professor Torres and your classmates.",
