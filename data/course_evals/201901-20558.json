    "Learned about painting, practice, and thinking.",
    "I learned a lot about how to read the complex language of psychoanalysis. Also, students taught each other a lot about the different materials they used to make their art.",
    "This course really helped me step out of my comfort zone when it came to my art. I stepped away from all my preconceptions of what are should be and how I should make it and it was very liberating. It also helped me talk about art. Distance myself from it but also make it extremely personal.",
    "This course changed my perspective on abstract art, how to think about art, and how to get closer to what I'm truly interested in. You dive deep into abstract art in an academic sense and also learn a lot about contemporary art history.",
    "improved painting skills, greater knowledge about the history and theory of abstraction, and a greater understanding of abstraction as a practice",
    "The readings propelled my interest in abstraction and an understanding of myself as an artist. So lucky to have been in this class."

   "comments": [
    "The only problem is the four hour class, its simply to long. Other than that, Molly is inspiring and the class is student driven. The readings are exciting and the assignments helpful and based in exploration.",
    "The strength of this course is the immense freedom we were given and supportive community that formed over the course of the semester. If there was a little more accountability before midterm and final critiques, either through assignments due by a specific day or a brief weekly show and tell (no more than like 3 mins each hard stop), then I think this class would remove the only small bit of stress it carried.",
    "I think my only frustrations with this course stemmed from my own work and my ability instead of a reflection of the class. Sometimes the ratio of work time to discussion was disproportionate so there was always a last minute scramble before critiques. But the discussions were very engaging and challenging and would meander into really intriguing territories that I never would have considered without this class. It pushed me to really consider materials and experimentation and making many mistakes along the way. For the teacher the process and thoughts were much more important than presenting perfect completed works.",
    "Amazing discussions and prompts; great critiques",
    "amazing class!!!! if you really want to explore abstraction in your practice i highly highly recommend. the course is very unstructured so you can really do whatever you want, which for some people works well and for others it may not. the course really requires you to be self motivated and generative and molly expects that you already have an active studio practice. you really do get out of the class what you put into it! molly also assigns readings, which are always amazing, but that on top of producing works can be pretty intense. maybe not the best class for a casual painter but if you really care about painting then you should definitely take this class!!"

    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class. Although the time commitment can be overbearing at times and the majority of time we are not making but discussing the art, it was very fulfilling and really focuses on who you are as an artist instead of relative to others.",
    "Yes, I would take this course if you want to gain a great understanding of abstract art\/art in general; also helps you get closer to your own voice",
    "if you really want to explore abstraction in your practice i highly highly recommend. the course is very unstructured so you can really do whatever you want, which for some people works well and for others it may not. the course really requires you to be self motivated and generative and molly expects that you already have an active studio practice. molly also assigns readings, which are always amazing, but that on top of producing works can be pretty intense. maybe not the best class for a casual painter but if you really care about painting then you should definitely take this class!!"
