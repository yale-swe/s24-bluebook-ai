                "I learned how to write musical theater songs both lyrics-first and to music set by a composer. I learned how to map out a musical and the different types of songs in a musical. I also learned so much from both Michael and the guests about the professional side of musical theater development.",
                "I developed greater creative insight in my writing. I learned about the importance of rhyme in writing lyrics (full rhymes to land jokes, for example), and I especially enjoyed learning about how \"dummy lyrics\" (as termed in class) can help us communicate rhythms when working with a collaborator."

                "Michael Korie was a great professor. Very nice and accommodating. Gave great feedback. \r\nTo note: As an undergrad, I didn't really know what my grade was the entire semester. However, I think this is just how the class works because the professor gives in-depth feedback the entire semester about each assignment. Just try your best and it will be fine.",
                "The course gives lots of chances to try writing lyrics and has a lot of workshop\/feedback time. I think this works better with fewer people because it ended dup that each song only had 5 minutes to present and get feedback so we didn't always get to go super deep. I think that we maybe could've had longer feedback for each song, and had fewer songs we presented. I think it also would've been useful to have more distinct technical instructions on certain topics like misaccents.",
                "Strengths: Michael's feedback is a big strength of the course. I received incredibly insightful feedback on each assignment. The guests were also a major strength of the course. It was such an incredible opportunity to share our work with professionals in the industry and also learn from their experiences. The course was also incredibly organized. Michael was great about sending emails\/announcement to clarify upcoming assignments and dates. I also loved the final assignments that allowed us to work on original music for our own musicals and the opportunity to have them performed at the Shen Concert at the end of the semester. \r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths of this class were getting to work with professionals in the theater industry, collaboration, and getting feedback all if not most classes on my work. Weaknesses of this class were only having one time to showcase our work for our friends and the other Shen classes."

                "Absolutely. If you have an interest in lyrics and musical theater, you totally should take the course. The professor is accommodating to all prior experience levels.",
                "Take it if youre interested in the craft of writing lyrics, learning more about musical theater, and\/or hearing some really cool stories from Prof. Korie about the ins and outs of the industry!",
                "If you're interested in any aspect of writing for musicals, absolutely. If you're just looking for a songwriting class, I'm not sure if this will be for you.",
                "I would definitely recommend if you're interested in musical theater or writing musicals. I went into this course having never written a song before and it has greatly improved my skill set. I feel more comfortable writing songs and finding hooks. Plus, the exposure to incredible professionals from the musical theater industry is unparalleled. I learned so much from their experiences as well as Michael's own experience. Definitely take this class if you get in!",
                "Yes I would because it is a great introduction to writing lyrics in a positive, collaborative environment. Also, as a \"veteran\" lyric writer, I still learned plenty of new information and got feedback from professionals, such as guests from the Dramatist's Guild."
