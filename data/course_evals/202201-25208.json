            "comments": [
                "Strengths: My professors/TFs were absolutely incredible. They kept discussion lively and were a blast to engage with. The syllabus was also very impressive, with the at once specific and varies eco-critical theme. There was quite a bit of reading, but always flexibility when it came to what you actually needed to get done for each class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there had been more of a focus on actually teaching how to compare. I liked what we did in this class, but I had never written a com lit essay and when the midterm essay came around I felt rather thrown into it without much prep. The most I learned about actual essay writing skills was from office hours, not from the class itself, which is fine but maybe not appropriate for a class that is supposed to build the foundational skills of comparative literature. In general though, this wasn't much of an issue and I learned simply from experience.",
                "Strengths: the syllabus is amazing! It does a pretty good job of balancing important, famous texts with relevant but more marginal texts. It has a really diverse list of literature, from nonfiction to science fiction to children's fiction to art. Compared to other lit courses I've taken, this course is unafraid to be a little unconventional, and it's fantastic. Especially after taking other required CompLit classes which weren't as well-organized, I loved that this class has a strong and unique thematic focus which brings all of the texts together. The assignments in this course are also well-done, especially the journal, which I learned a lot from. Another strength of the course for me was the professors (it's really cool to have multiple, coming from different language departments) and the class community. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were a few points in the course where the syllabus felt overloaded -- we were trying to cover a lot of texts at once, and even though they were short, things got a little muddled and there wasn't enough time to dig into anything in particular. I think it might have made sense to reorganize one of those weeks and replace it with a short novel or something like that.",
                "This course was a welcoming environment and introduced me to a lot of new texts.\r\nHowever, sometimes the seminar size made it hard for everyone to contribute at times.",
                "I think that each of the instructors of this course were really wonderful to work with. They are particularly gifted individuals who always have interesting things to say in discussions. However, I think the class was just too short to deal with the material, and class discussions not often substantial, at least for my taste. It behoves a class like this to probably cut the syllabus in halfit would be best to only do a small amount of material each week and delve more deeply into it. I took a class in the autumn semester that covered a lot of novels (six or seven long, major English novels) that felt more detailed in what it got out of the texts than we did (and ours were shorter), and we met for the same amount of instruction time, though for two hours once a week. That's no knock against the instructors, but I do feel we had a bit too much \"going on\" some of the time.",
                "This course was an excellent introduction to ecological literature and I was never bored! The syllabus was wide-ranging and ambitious but well-organized, and I thought it worked well!",
                "I thought the focus on ecocriticism was smart, since it grounded the course in a particular set of ideas. The readings were interesting (and interestingly connected). Discussion sometimes went a bit off the rails, but the professors were good at refocusing students' attention on the texts and issues at hand.",
                "One thing that could be improved would be not having laptops in the classroom or making efforts to minimize their presence, as they meaningfully detract from the classroom experience and stifle conversation and interaction. This could be effectively done by asking students to buy a course packet with readings which supplement the books, and reimbursing students if it's an obstacle for them financially (or just buying the packets for students). And if that means slightly fewer pages get assigned over the course of the semester because of the cost/feasibility of printing, that's fine -- the worth of readings is not determined by their length. Sitting in a classroom surrounded by students on their laptops is for me very frustrating and makes me struggle to feel that I am in an environment of learning.",

                "Yes yes yes, and crazily enough, not just for people trying to do the comp lit major. The coursetable ratings and reviews for this class were abysmal when I signed up for it, and I expected an unfulfilling slog, but that is not what I got. I think that with the change in professor(s) (this is the first time this course has had Jane and Abigail) came a much more foundational change to the course as a whole. There's a good amount of reading, but you can always cut back on what you actually do based on your circumstances. Otherwise, the class is fun, engaging, and most of all not that stressful. I recommend.",
                "Yes! This was a great class to take for CompLit but also just in general. I didn't think I would be as interested in an environmental lens until I took this course. While not every text resonated with me, overall I'm so glad that this course introduced me to new ways of thinking about literature.",
                "Yes, this is a good course to determine whether you should major in comparative literature. You get a taste of what the field looks like. I only wish it was recommended for students to take earlier in their undergraduate career (first year possibly!) so that they can learn more about what comparative literature actually entails.",
                "Yeswell, it's always different depending on who teaches it. I would definitely recommend other courses taught by (any combination of) Jane Tylus, Abigail Fields, and Zo Burgard. Comparative skills are important things to hone and I think this class still taught me a lot about that.",
                "Absolutely! Especially if its being taught by the same instructors, because the syllabus was so engaging.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this course to a potential literature major, since it's required! Otherwise, I think the decision to take the course should probably depend on the professor(s) and on the \"angle\" of comparison that the course takes in any given semester.",
                "This is a requirement for CompLit so yes if you're in CompLit lol. If you're not, take it based on the syllabus and instructors because it seems to vary a lot. Specifically Spring 2023 syllabus looks amazing.",
                "Yes; this is an excellent take on a foundational skill of comparison. Great readings about important stuff, but plenty of escapist fiction as well."
