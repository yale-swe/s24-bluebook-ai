A weakness would be that the canvas page was a bit difficult to navigate with assignments and discussion posts not lining up. Sometimes it was unclear when readings were due\/ assigned.",
                "Strengths: The professor selected very good readings\/films\/lectures for us to watch. We also had good discussions; I like how the professor put us into breakout rooms to discuss topics with smaller groups. \r\nWeaknesses: It would have been nice to get some more guidance on the papers. It was definitely useful and relevant to discuss COVID-19, but the class might have been more engaging if we had discussed more public health issues\/topics.",

Additionally, the course focuses on a broad range of topics that are surprisingly linked to public health, which keeps things interesting as things don't get too redundant.",
                "The course had a good format consisting of discussions after individual reading of material in most classes. In some classes the professor jumped in and lectures and in others we had a guest speaker. The only suggestion I have is that I wish that the professor lectured more in class as I found that method the most captivating and I grasped the most when he did that."

The structure of the class was very similar most of the time go into breakout rooms, discuss, reconvene in the larger group. It could've been more engaging if we switched up the structure a bit.",
