            "comments": [
                "The course is well organized, all of the psets are listed from the get-go, and the labs were not overly terrible. The professor did not always explain things very well, but the undergrads helping teach were very useful. Also, the use of gradescope for this course was difficult since the due dates were often incorrect, assignments were inconsistently labeled, and the way labs were handled meant that you needed to leave about a fifth of the assignments blank.",
                "Seemed like the schedule was rough. We never really finished going through the topics and class and a lot of learning had to either be caught up on for psets or for the labs. The labs were very strong, generally helping us gain a more fluid understanding of how circuit elements worked. However, working in groups often leaves the stragglers behind, as they become reliant on their partners, leaving them unprepared for the Lab Practical Exam.",
                "Strengths: I think interesting content material, labs are fun. You only need to write a lab report on 3 of the 5-6 labs you do which is a positive. Weaknesses: Lectures weren't that helpful for several reasons and many students seemed to struggle with the simple electronics concepts for a large portion of the course. Also, it is nice from a grade point of view, but there isn't really ever feedback on your writing (which is confusing for a writing class).",
                "I enjoy the course and think it is taught well. What should be improved is adding an additional 0.5 credits because of the lenghty lab requirement.",
                "There's a too much material spread too thinly throughout the course; you'll get one or two specific examples in class (they're just read off the slides) which often do not prepare you for the pset questions, which in turn don't prepare you for the exam questions; the content disconnect felt enormous between the lectures/psets/tests. More examples focusing on one topic that's actually gone over in class (rather than just being quickly read off a slide) could help. Things take forever to get graded as well. \r\nThe workload level is actually pretty good, much better than previous semesters; office hours tended to be helpful too, and the prof is quick with help outside of class.",
                "The labs were okay, some took forever but others were fine. Homework was manageable. Lecture slides were great. Lectures were awful.\r\nMain way this course can be improved is actual feedback on homework and labs instead of taking off points for no reason.",
                "Mostly, it would have been nice to have other external material and examples outside of the textbook used for this class, which I felt often didn't explain examples thoroughly and was often difficult to read, and lecture slides were sometimes similarly dense so that it was easy to get lost when looking back at them.",
                "Strengths: ULA's, Kevin Ryan and Labs.\r\nWeaknesses: TFs, lots of material in a short time, grading unclear at times",
                "Strengths: good slides for reviewing. Lots of handouts and resources. Overall a great intro experience. Plus all exams are lenient and open-book/notes/answer/anything but the internet!\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the weekly psets (literally 5 questions that take like 1 hour) don't cover the lecture material, and they appear in exams :(",
                "I think this course had several office hours which was helpful. The professors office hours were also helpful. I enjoyed the labs. I think the lectures are dense and there are a lot of subtle points that are difficult to grasp in the slideshow format. I think I wouldve preferred a whiteboard style lecture with maybe the circuit diagrams projected instead of the current style. Lectures in general were difficult to follow and we would skip over the examples that had a lot of math which I wish we would have gone over.",
                "The lecture videos were so helpful in this course, as were the labs and pre labs. The grading and feedback of the course could have been better as it was hard to understand how to improve when none of the problem sets or labs were graded until months later.",
                "Strengths\r\n- I liked the addition of the lab practical\r\n- Good accompanying textbook\r\n- Lectures had a good amount of worked example problems incorporated into them\r\n- The lecture notes and videos were very helpful resources to review before exams\r\n- Very well designed curriculum for us to learn a breadth of electrical engineering topics in our introductory class\r\n- I appreciated the succinct material delivery\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- Given that this class is a writing credit for engineers, I think it should teach students how to write a formal lab report. They didn't seem to care much about our formatting but I think they should. At the beginning of the course, one lecture or half of a lecture should be spent teaching us proper formatting and it should be a part of the grading rubric; even a template might work. Now, I make it to other lab classes expected to know how to do this because I've taken a writing credit engineering class and that is not the case\r\n- The lectures were mostly just reading off of slides which can make to difficult to stay engaged - personally, I learn best when a professor is writing out and actively solving problems on the board\r\n- Discontinuity between the difficulty of the homework problems and exams - homeworks were much easier than the exams so it was rather difficult to properly prepare yourself for the exam",
                "I did quite enjoy the topics covered and the sequence that they were covered in, as skills learned from one unit typically could be used in the next. However, I do feel like the homework assignments were always a week too early, where I would spend a long time reading the book and figuring out how to solve the problem, then the next class we would cover how to solve those types of problems during the class.",
                "weaknesses:\r\n- the TAs. They are not helpful. Some did not know how to answer p-set questions... Once I stayed an hour and more watching a TA tryiong to figure out a p-set problems. not even in labs or in homeworks did they give any good feedback.\r\n\r\nstrengths:\r\n- good intro material",
                "The course's diversity of assignments is excellent. It allows you to learn a great deal and not be overtly penalized for every mistake you make in the course. Both lectures and lab give you the opportunity to learn about these topics with ample chances to practice calculations. The lectures were also great, and Dr. Han is an excellent professor. The tests were also very fair and practicing in the textbook helps prepare well for them.",
                "The lectures were a bit confusing and long-winded for some of the topics but the labs generally seemed well organized and constructed",
                "This course was not taught well. The lectures did not include a lot of examples, which made completing the homework very difficult. With the combination of the lab sections with a normal lecture class, the workload was very high. \r\n\r\nI found that there was more assistance available for work I did not understand in lab rather than for the lecture homework.",
                "Lectures were boring and tests were very hard",
                "Strengths: Broad range of information that is essential for deeper learning in the field of electrical engineering. Hands-on experience with breadboards and other pieces of equipment in circuit analysis.",
                "Strengths are that the labs are cool sometimes. Weaknesses are that the content is not taught super well, the exams are not very representative of the things we learn, and the content is not interesting.",
                "Strengths: Lectures recorded so are available for reference later, content at an appropriate level for a 200 class.\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were not delivered in the most optimal manner-- overall, while the content was fine, things were often partially or incompletely explained. For example, a term would be used quite often without ever having been formally defined. The labs were generally better although those in earlier sections mentioned that some had unintuitive instructions as well.",
                "The two best parts of the course were Kevin Ryan and the peer tutor Abrar Sheikh. These two have been some of THE MOST helpful people in all my time at Yale in helping me understand the course material. \r\n\r\nIn most of my classes at Yale, the lectures are too fast and office hours have too many people. I ask questions with great difficulty because it's very slow getting help in a crowded office hours session, and in class it's even more intimidating to stop the entire lecture and ask for everyone to wait until you understand everything. Even when I ask questions I often get confusing answers, or I end up saying things make enough sense when they don't because I blame myself for not understanding things. This happens a lot when TAs say \"you covered this in class, right?\" I think the intent when they say that is to get a better understanding of what we have learned in class, but it actually makes students feel like they are at fault for not understanding something that was covered in class. Students then feel pressured to pretend they have a better understanding of the material than they actually do, and they don't get the help they need. \r\n\r\nI think it's a shame that Kevin is not more involved with teaching this course because no one has ever explained electronics to me in a better way. I didn't even know who he was for most of the semester because I don't think he was ever formally introduced to the class, but after meeting him in my lab section I started asking him more questions. Kevin doesn't just explain how to get the answer to a problem; he gives you some background on how each circuit component works and why the problems we are solving are useful. He NEVER rushes students (which is so important because Yale students are always panicking that they don't have enough time) and adjusts his teaching to their pace. Another amazing thing is that he stops and asks students to explain what they understand so he gets feedback on our progress and makes sure we understand a concept before moving on. He is extremely encouraging and never makes you feel bad about not knowing something (which unintentionally happens a lot with other instructors/TAs). It's also so so helpful that he stays with you until you understand a concept because you don't waste any energy worrying that you won't figure it out in time and have to go another week in confusion (this is something I think a lot of students fear, and it often gets in the way of being able to learn). Kevin prioritizes student learning over his own usual work hours (he stayed late until around 6 pm one day to help me and some friends review for the final) and I am so so grateful. I owe my improvement in my final exam grade from a 53 on the midterm to an 84 on the final to just a few hours getting help from Kevin. \r\n\r\nThe other person that made my learning in this class possible was the peer tutor Abrar, for similar reasons. I was so impressed that Abrar remembered me and my name after meeting me just once, and every time a student walked into his office hours he would personally greet them and check in with how they were doing in the class. This way he made sure everyone in the office hours was actually getting help in the most time efficient way. Like Kevin, Abrar adjusted his pace to the student and never made anyone feel bad for not understanding something. A lot of TAs have been very kind and knowledgeable, but what makes Abrar unique is how he managed to efficiently give everyone individual help, even when there were a lot of students present.",
                "The labs were very helpful and the content was well organized. However, I wish the pace of the course was a bit slower, especially for the sinusoidal analysis parts which were a bit hard to follow.",
                "the lectures were not taught very clearly and often the content was not finished during classtime",
                "Strengths: good lecture slides that we could view before/after class, Professor Han/Kevin/TAs were kind, interesting material, homework was usually 4-5 problems from the book (not crazy intensive like some more theoretical STEM classes), lab was cool to actually use some of the things we read about, lab prof/TA were really flexible and had an open session on Fridays for extra practice. \r\nWeaknesses: class material moved very quickly, pre-lab handouts/lab report expectations were sometimes a little unclear (especially for the final lab), it would be nice to see answer keys for the homeworks so we can see how to do the problems that we didn't understand, maybe the intro lab session could give us a more guided intro to circuit building.",
                "The labs are pretty well-run and well-explained. I think the lecture portion of this class could be organized a little better, as I ended up learning a lot of the material from the textbook because the slides and the in-class explanations didn't make that much sense.",
                "The class is very friendly to introductory students. It does not cover very advanced concepts and you don't need really any advanced math or physics knowledge which is nice. \r\n\r\nHowever, the textbook for the class is not very helpful. The notation is inconsistent, the explanations are unhelpful, and the structure of the textbook is confusing. I would recommend finding your own book to go along with this course.",
                "The course overall was well organized, but the lectures were often difficult to follow since examples were glossed over, and occasionally the homeworks did not match up well with the material that had been taught. The labs were designed well, but I would have liked to get more feedback on the earlier labs to better understand what was expected from the lab reports.",
                "Strengths: I really liked the lab component of this class. It was really cool to get to apply the concepts wed been learning to real life, and to actually build circuits. The labs were very well-run.\r\nWeaknesses: I thought that the lectures were relatively hard to follow, partly because Prof. Han sometimes went through examples very quickly, and I didnt think he was particularly good at explaining things in general. I also thought the problem sets were quite short: four relatively short problems each, which was barely enough to cover the content wed learned.",
                "Open up submissions for assignments earlier, and give pre-labs out more than just one day prior to the deadline",
                "Many of the topics were taught in a confusing manner, even if they were simple or difficult concepts.",
                "This course was fairly scattered, mainly because it was trying to be too many things. It is trying to be a lab and a writing course and a lecture, all while only being a single credit. It is hard to learn anything in great depth as a result. The saving grace of this class was Kevin Ryan, who taught me the majority of the content in a clear, simple, kind manner. He deserves more recognition for all the hard work that he puts into this class and truly cares about the students learning and understanding.",

                "It's required so yes. Otherwise, I would take it with another professor if that is ever a possibility.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn about circuits, you will learn about circuits. The ULAs were great, but the TFs made it clear that they do not want to be there and do not want to teach you (mine would hide from us during labs).",
                "Heck ya. Free writing credit. You just do lab reports it's so free... they don't check grammar or content, just data. Also very good intro / required for EE majors/enthusiasts.",
                "Yes, the course was very engaging and laid a solid foundation for electrical engineering.",
                "This class would be a good tester for if you think you are interested in electrical engineering but want to make sure. It's also a lot less writing than I expected, given that its a writing credit so it was a pretty convenient way to get a writing credit. Overall, I recommend it",
                "If you are a STEM student, easy writing credit",
                "Yes, I would recommend it if you are interested in electronics. I took AP Physics 2 when I was in high school and learned the basics of circuits, but it definitely wasn't as much as this course covered. I do feel like my more mathematical background helped me succeed through this course, and recommend to make sure to do the readings and walk through the examples carefully, since classtime is just 50 minutes twice a week and isn't sufficient to just rely on class to understand everything.",
                "Yes, this class was a great introduction to electrical engineering. The workload is very manageable, and you are given ample opportunities to learn with the smaller problem sets each week. The grading is very fair and clear, specifically in the context of the lab assignments. It is also a good opportunity to gain more hands-on experience in the lab portion of the class. The office hours are very helpful.",
                "Only if you are really interested in some of the fundamental EE concepts",
                "No, unless your an electrical engineer run",
                "I would recommend it to someone looking to get into electrical engineering. It can take up a good chunk of time and may be a large commitment for someone who is interested in the topic but would not go any further than the intro class.",
                "Not unless you need it for a major requirement.",
                "If you really are genuinely interested then take this class.",
                "If you're taking this for the writing credit like I did, think carefully about what you're doing. I got more or less what I expected: a STEM course with very little writing (and all of it in three fact-based lab reports), and a reasonably low level of difficulty for those with a solid mathematical foundation and willingness to put in a bit of work. That being said, my moderate interest in learning about circuitry was not quite enough to keep me happy throughout a poorly-taught and sometimes-frustrating course, and there were a few times when I regretted not just taking a writing gut instead. Overall, I definitely got what I came for and it may be the right choice for some people, but I'd just advise other non-EENG people to be sure this is what you want before committing to it.",
                "I would be hesitant to recommend this course because it is very challenging if you have no background in electronics, despite being an intro course. If it weren't a requirement for my major I probably wouldn't have taken it.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course, but you should have taken a previous E&M physics class and calculus before hand.",
                "This class is for you if you (a) need it as a prereq or major requirement or (b) want a rigorous introduction to electrical theory. If you're a CS major and just want a writing credit that is inside your wheelhouse, do not take this! It's a workload comparable to 323, if you need a writing credit just take a real writing class.",
                "if you are really interested in electronics with prior background or is a major requirement.",
                "Yes, I think it was a solid intro course. The homework wasn't too intensive, the lab was pretty good and the TA/lab professor were helpful, Professor Han's lecture notes were good and nice to have before/after class, everyone was very flexible and willing to help.",
                "This class is a requirement for loads of other engineering classes, and for good reason; it does a decent job explaining the basics of electronics and circuits in both a theoretical sense and an experimental way. The workload of this class isn't too bad; however, the lectures don't do a great job of explaining the material, so it does require you reading the textbook and going over the slides several times out of class to fully understand the content.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are looking for a writing credit and/or are interested in learning more about simple circuit analysis. The lab for the course makes the workload greater than most 1 credit courses, but you do learn a lot.",
                "Probably not. On the one hand, the labs were nice, I liked the content (lots of circuit analysis), and it was relatively low-workload and not too difficult. On the other hand, I thought Prof. Han to be a relatively poor lecturer, and despite attending class every day, I found myself learning much of the content from the textbook while doing the homework; multiple friends said it was the same for them. If youre hoping to improve your scientific writing, this isnt the class for youdespite being a writing credit, I received zero feedback on my writing.",
                "Yes if Jung Han is teaching it, and also if you have some prior knowledge on circuits (simple ideas on current-voltage relationships in resistors, capacitors and inductors). Otherwise the workload might be rather large since there is also a writing component to this class.",
                "No, I think this class should only be taken by Electrical Engineering majors. The material for me personally was too rooted in more advanced electrical engineering I did not think I needed as a Mechanical Engineer.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless it is required.",
                "Yes, if majoring wanting to learn foundations of circuit analysis and design."
