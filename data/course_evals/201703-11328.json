    "This class gives a very detailed description of medieval relations between Muslims, Jews, and Christians, which helps one understand how these three religions have interacted throughout history.",
    "Original research with medieval primary sources",
    "Going into the course, I thought what I learned would not be relevant today - I was just getting requirements out of the way. I was wrong. I learned about the origins of the Abrahamic religions, which I did not know at all. I also learned about how attitudes towards other groups were formed, which carries into today. I also learned how to write the longest paper I ever have.",
    "I think this class really helped me develop my analytical skills, particularly when looking at sources in a time period that might be relatively unfamiliar to me. Professor Marcus was incredibly helpful in guiding us in discussion to take our analysis to the next level.",
    "The ability to write an article-length paper about a highly interesting topic. Good introduction to the relationships among some of the world's most influential religions.",
    "This class is fine. If you don't know a lot about Jewish, Muslim, or Christian laws and customs, it'll probably be confusing. Marcus is alright. He's kind and enthusiastic, but rambles and entire seminar. It's a seminar in name only- there's never any discussion.",
    "I learned a lot about what Jews, Christians, and Muslims thought about one another in medieval Europe. I learned about their customs and beliefs, where they intersected and where they differed.",
    "I learned how to write and read a lot efficiently."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This was my first seminar, and I love the small, intimate setting. I wish there had been a bit more background information included in the readings because many times I had no idea what the source was when I began reading it.",
    "I think the course was organized really well - by theme. I think a seminar depends on who is in it for good discussion and ours lacked that. I don't think it was the fault of the professor at all, though.",
    "I think this class' biggest strength is the professor. Professor Marcus has an unparalleled mastery of this field and learning from him was a unique and invaluable opportunity. Only having essentially one grade put a lot of pressure on the final paper, but I think it was a good experience having to produce a quality paper of that length (20-25).",
    "This course is a nice investigation in to the relationship of Jews, Christians, and Muslims in the medieval period. The downside was that there was often too much lecturing, and not enough discussion\/analysis of primary sources. Also, although it was nice that there were few assignments (only weekly readings and the final paper), that meant that there were few opportunities for feedback.",
    "Professor Marcus will teach you a lot about the subject, but it is difficult to understand how to handle the  scope of the paper assignment until toward the end of the semester.",
    "It's a seminar in name only- there's never any discussion.",
    "The strengths are the selected readings and Professor Marcus knowledge of the subject. Discussion in class could be improved to facilitate more debate between students. Also, there should be more deadlines for the final paper: for instance, 3 weeks before the paper is due you should have to turn in a 7-8 page draft."

   "comments": [
    "I think this is a great course if you are at all interested in religion and the relations between different religious groups. I found the material to be fascinating.",
    "Definitely take it!",
    "I would recommend it. I think learning about the beginning of three of the world's most followed religions is important in understand relations between the groups today. It also helped me develop my writing.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Really cool opportunity to learn about an unfamiliar time period.",
    "This course was an interesting overview of relationships between the three religious communities in the medieval period. I would reccommend this course to anyone looking for a somewhat interesting course with little work (only the final paper, and readings)",
    "If you want to develop important writing skills and engage a very intelligent professor in a seminar, then I would recommend this course. Of course, I like studying religion so that biases my answer.",
    "There are better history classes. Unless you're passionate about the subject, look elsewhere.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who is at all interested in the subject.",
    "Yes, but be prepared to write a 20+ page research paper."
