    "General history of photography.",
    "I gained so much insight into how to look at photographs and not only place them into a time and era but to analyze the subject matter itself in a very thoughtful way.",
    "I learned a lot about the development of photography across time in this course. It gives a good overview of the technologies available to photographers as well as the different photographic\/aesthetic movements.",
    "This course introduced me to the major photographers and photography movements within French, British, and American photography from the 1840s to the 1980s. I also learned how to talk and write about photographs and was exposed to key works of photography theory.",
    "I developed a richer and more in-depth survey knowledge about the history of photography in Europe and the US."

   "comments": [
    "Could have been taught as a seminar due to low enrollment. Professor Armstrong is outstanding in section but weak in lecture.",
    "Strengths: I loved how the lectures consisted of solely photos, with Professor Armstrong giving an in-depth analysis of each one.  The classes wer very engaging in that respect and it was not just reading text from a screen which I liked a lot.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't like studying for the two tests, specifically having to memorize the specific years for all the hundreds of photos we looked at in lctur",
    "A strength of the course is just the breadth of knowledge it covers, but in doing so it is incredibly hard to study for the course because the only materials available are powerpoints with relevant photographs and image lists.",
    "The historical trajectory of the course is plotted well and allowed me to understand how the group of photographers that we discussed each week built from the previous week's photographers. I also appreciated how section was organized around the week's assigned readings.",
    "The organization of class materials made studying unnecessarily complicated. The slides could've had the ID's on them or any identifying information. You had to have three separate materials to study a single photograph.",
    "I wish the sections could have been longer. Like all surveys, it is difficult to fit everything you want into a course. The sections helped to fill out the theoretical background to the classes by going over our readings, but they always felt too short."

   "comments": [
    "No",
    "Maybe, if they were interested in photography.",
    "For someone who has a deep interest in photography and wants a comprehensive view of how the art medium grew and developed, this course is perfect  for him or her.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone only if they were incredibly passionate about photography or wanted to learn about some cool photos to flex on their friends. I think it would be a great elective to credit-d, but it was rather challenging as an academic course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in photography or art history more generally. I do feel that I've acquired a good sense for the history of photography and for some of the major issues within photography theory. Given its clear historical plotting, the course does, however, become rather predictable. While my knowledge about photography grew every week, I didn't necessarily feel that some aspect of it had been illuminated or transformed. Nonetheless, the course is a solid introduction to photography.",
