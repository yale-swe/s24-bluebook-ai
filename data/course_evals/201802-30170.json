    "This course taught me about naked eye astronomy, its history, and its cultural context, as well as how modern astronomers and historians discovered which auspicious alignments mattered to past civilizations.",
    "I learned about the scientific underpinnings of classical astronomy, Western cosmology, and non-Western cosmology. The class had a substantial amount of historical and cultural content, but at root, it's a science class. I loved that combination.",
    "I developed an understanding of basic astronomy and it's cultural impacts on ancient civilizations.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about the intersection of culture and astronomy. Aside from the technical skills and historical facts I learned from the course including understanding celestial coordinates and ancient cultural relationships with the naked-eye sky, it broadened my perspective on human life. It's incredibly humbling to learn about astronomy, and as a beginner, I want to keep learning about it throughout my life especially to gain perspective.",
    "gained a solid foundation in basic naked-eye astronomy; also learned about the intersection of culture and astronomy"

   "comments": [
    "I felt like I learned a lot and now understand more about the cosmos. Some aspects, though, should have been covered in more depth - the mathematical and conceptual parts in particular, like azimuth, altitude, right ascension, and declination.",
    "Strengths: The class is very well taught. The pacing of the curriculum is just right: challenging but manageable. The content is fascinating.\r\nWeaknesses: The non-Western cosmology unit was rather short. I realize that there's only so much content one can cover in 5 weeks, but I thought the Western vs. non-Western balance could be more equitable.",
    "This course is very interesting. The lecture videos are interesting and the online discussion is engaging and enjoyable to take part in.",
    "Strength is that its very well-organized and access to class material is seamless. Another strength is that you can tell PRofessor Faison is extremely curious and passionate about the material so that inspires students to engage with the material. Weakness may be that the pace of the class was very fast so it was hard to dive very deep into one area, but that's just the way it goes during the summer..",
    "strengths: videos very helpful, readings were good\r\nweaknesses: some readings felt not that necessary"

   "comments": [
    "YES, If you want to learn about space with an historical twist.",
    "Absolutely! This class is at once scientific, philosophical, and cultural. It's a fascinating intersection, and it's FUN! I honestly chose this class on a whim, but I am so grateful I ended up here. I am leaving with a much deeper appreciation for the beauty of the sky; it's been a five weeks very well spent.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone but especially to non-science majors.",
    "Yes, the combination of the benefits of learning this subject and the effectiveness of Professor Faison prompts me to recommend this course.",
    "take it. cool course"
