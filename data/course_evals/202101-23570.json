                "This course was a perfect blend between a substantive philosophy course and a form of intellectual-historiographical research. As many of the Pre-Socratics exist in fragmentary form, much of the course was reckoning with interpretative debates to understand what exactly it was that these philosophers were trying to say, such as whether Parmenides was a substance monist, a predicative monist, or meant something else entirely. At the same time, this course was still a philosophy course, and forced us to reckon with how convincing we found these Pre-Socratic arguments. In the end, I found the Pre-Socratics to be incredibly enjoyable to study, as they tend to wrestle with the most fundamental questions of how to do philosophy, without the baggage of the many years of history that follow them.",

Reading and writing about the likes of Heraclitus, Parmenides, and Empedocles under the guidance Professor Inwood opened up many rich questions that will follow me throughout my life. Professor Inwood's feedback on my writing and the discussions we had together have made me a better thinker."

                "This course primarily broke down into thirds, with the focus of the study on Heraclitus, Parmenides, and Empedocles. This course was structured at an excellent pace, which allowed us to explore multiple angles of the interpretative debates surrounding each of these philosophers. I would consider wanting to spend more time with the \"minor\" Pre-Socratic philosophers, who were also fascinating, or more time with the reception of the Pre-Socratics in Plato or Aristotle; however, doing so would likely sacrifice the depth and pace which makes this course so excellent.",
                "Strengths: robust syllabus surveying a wide expanse of scholarship, original primary texts, and intimate section size.",
                "Overall, I think the course was structured well. I do feel like there could have been more assigned (and/or optional) secondary source readings and engagement. Typically, there were two or three secondary sources assigned. I would have liked to have seen more like five secondary sources for each weekly seminar--perhaps three/four required readings and one/two recommended readings. I feel like I have a *basic* familiarity with what kinds of secondary literature is out there, but not a secure grasp. In this respect especially, this class was less challenging than other 400-level seminars I've taken.",
                "This course is very strong. The readings were well-paced, and I really enjoyed the material. Some of the secondary articles assigned are a bit obscure, but Professor Inwood is a very clear speaker and does a good job explaining the articles in class. I would recommend, perhaps, that he cut down on the required articles towards the end of the course. But other than that, it was great! We learned a lot, Professor Inwood is a great teacher and gives good feedback on essays.",
                "This course had many strengths, such as a well led discussion, engaging reading, good feedback on papers, a long paper which allowed you to think deeply about one thinker, and at its core deeply fascinating thinkers.\r\n\r\nThe one suggestion I have for the course is to require peoples presentations to be slightly shorter because soemtimes they ran a bit long."

Two hours on zoom is a very long time though, but I doubt it would be a problem if this course is taught in person. I was also very grateful that Professor Inwood set aside time to meet with us all individually over zoom throughout the semester to discuss the class and our papers."

                "This course explores the landscape of ancient Greek philosophy before Socrates. The ideas of the pre-Socratics are endlessly inventive, intriguing, and ultimately inspirational. How people from so long ago came to discover so many incredible ideas in such innovative ways constantly amazes me. If you are interested in the ancient Greeks, you should definitely take this course. Any understanding of Aristotle and especially Plato is incomplete without this background. Otherwise, this course deals heavily with metaphysics, interpretation, and historical thought. If you are interested in those fields, I highly recommend.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in both the history of philosophy and learning the difficult questions which arise in doing the history of philosophy, or in the most fundamental questions of philosophy which this course forces the students to consider. It was an excellent balance between straight philosophy, intellectual historiography, and something which could be called archaeology, all of which contribute to the core questions of the course of how to understand philosophers with few extant works and with unorthodox means of expression (e.g., maxims, poems, paradoxes, allegories).",
                "Yes! The Presocratics are a very rich but under appreciated field in the study of philosophy--if you enjoy classics, ancient philosophy, Plato, or Aristotle, you will find a home in this class.",
                "I would indeed. Although the course wasn't particularly challenging, Prof. Inwood is excellent, and knowledge of the Presocratics is highly valuable for understanding the history and problems of philosophy.",
                "Absolutely! Every philosophy major, or person interested in philosophy, should take this course. Presocratic philosophy so often gets overlooked in philosophy departments but there is such a wealth of interesting ideas there! And Professor Inwood is the best person to help you explore those treasures.",
                "Yes I would! If it's offered again, definitely take it. There's almost nowhere else you'll get to study Pre Socratic philosophy in this much detail and with an instructor as well established as Professor Inwood.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in classical philosophy...or the history of ideas...or just curious about the human condition then this class is for you.  There is a serious workload, but if you care it is worth it."
