Its funny, Wyrtzen assigned chapters from his books as well, and he writes exactly like how he teaches. Vomiting facts onto the page with no emphasis on anything.",

                "Lecture is very weak. Lecture is not engaging and is organized by Powerpoint slides that are mostly text and don't have enough information on them to keep the attendees up to speed with the lecture. Lecture should focus more on concrete information. I also enjoyed when the Professor would talk about current events or his personal experience. \r\n\r\nThe readings are interesting.",
                "Strengths: got a relatively un-biased perspective on the Middle East, and Prof. Wyrtzen is a great lecturer. Weaknesses: the exams didn't test my knowledge of the content very well because of the cheat sheet we could bring - you could copy directly from the cheat sheet without needing to know anything.",
                "The lecture was not as engaging as I had hoped.",
                "strengths: this class did help me learn more about the region and work through biases I'd internalized about the MENA region. The social media project was a cool and innovative exercise\r\nweaknesses: This class required very little critical thought and engagement, which I found disappointing in a class about such a contentious topic. Most writing prompts focused more on summarizing readings than making actual arguments.",
                "Oftentimes because of how much material the course covered, it felt as though we were hopping through time and space with no way point. This could be remedied by providing clear, recurrent themes throughout the course that better help us to put the content into perspective.",
                "Really thorough and interesting course, but A LOT of info. Also, prof Wyrtzen often released assignments late which could be a bit frustrating.",
                "Strengths: comprehensive lecture slides, good TA, low workload, interesting material. Weaknesses: easy to skip lecture, professor was not engaging, some of the assignments were pure memorization and busy work, no feedback on assignments. Overall, this course had so much potential but I was disappointed by its poor organization.",
                "Not necessarily a strength or weakness, but it was always pretty easy to get by without doing the readings.",
                "This course is a very broad survey, which means that you cover a lot of material. This is definitely a strength given that it is Yale's only Middle Eastern course offered at the moment. However, students must be prepared to process a lot of material and move quickly through the centuries.",
                "Its fine and you know what youre getting into but I feel like I didnt really learn that much",
                "I wish the course was a little more streamlined and delved deeper into a selected number of topics.",
                "This class was totally disorganized. More than half the class stopped showing up to lecture. Three-quarters of the people who were at lecture were doing other work. It was a complete joke. I hated it. I think the best soluion would be to get rid of this class and do not have Wyrtzen teach it anymore.",
                "I really enjoyed having the mini essays and the readings. The lectures were sometimes long",
                "As far as survey courses go, I felt like this class was very interesting and fairly thorough. As with any survey course there was only so deep that the class could go, but I felt pretty satisfied with the overview that I got. It did have to go at a fairly rapid pace to accomplish this, but I think that was a fair tradeoff, although I know other people found it more frustrating. I did feel, though, like I didn't get as much out of the discussion section as I would have hoped, so for me it was mostly the lecture that kept me engaged.",
                "More interesting and engaging lectures. I felt disengaged for a majority of the lectures, as the professor would go on tangents about personal stories or use unnecessary high vocabulary to communicate a simple topic.  However, the section in the class is why I really love this course! My TA was extremely intelligent, always open to help in any way, and genuinely wanted his students to succeed."

While I learned a lot, I didn't feel especially challenged or required to think critically about the region. Ultimately, I was left thinking that I could have learned almost everything taught in the course by myself on the internet.",
                "If you haven't learned much about broader Middle East history, sure! It is at the end of a day an intro course, so if you have previous experience in the subject perhaps this isn't the course for you. This semester, the class at points felt disorganized in regard to assignments (i.e. prompts distributed later than was ideal, final take-home exam turning into a 10-12 page guided paper with about a week and a half's notice), but I would chalk that up to this being the first time it was offered, and thus the kinks had to be worked out and material fine-tuned. Overall, Professor Wyrtzen's lectures were informative and enjoyable, and the TAs were good as well. Don't regret taking the class!",

                "Yes! Great introductory class that everyone should take to learn about very important history.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to someone who needs a history gut. Workload was really light and easy to do well on the assignments, but if you actually want to learn more about the Middle East there are probably better classes with more engaging professors.",
                "Yes, it is a good introductory history class and is manageable even if you end up not interested in the subject.",
                "This is a great course to get a broad sense of Middle Eastern history and better understand the current state of the region. I would recommend this to any History major as well as any Yale student who is interested in learning more about non-Western history.",
                "Its fine if youre interested in middle eastern history. I didnt get as much out of it as I wished going in but I also didnt do the readings so cant complain. Very easy lecture class",
                "Yes, the lecture style was simple, assignments were straight to the point.",
                "Yes! I think everyone should learn a little more about Middle East, and this course provided a perfect survey into historical contexts and contemporary politics.",
                "Yes. Especially if you know nothing about the region.",
                "NO, absolutely not. This course was terrible. And everyone agrees it was terrible. Professor Wyrtzen is a bad teacher and is also not particularly friendly. He did not want to be there. IN FACT, he made multiple snide comments about his OWN CLASS being boring and how we all probably wanted to leave the room, how he's almost through the content, how he knows it's boring...WTF!! The James Gelvin book did a great job explaining the concepts, which Wyrtzen would then recap, but poorly. Lectures were the most BORING things ever. It was a massive slide deck of endless bullets of straight facts, full of typos and errors. Wyrtzen never told us what to focus on or what was important. We basically sludged country by country in the Middle East, covering 1500 years of history in one semester. I didn't think someone could make such a fascinating and complex topic so dull and uninteresting. On top of that, the assigments were pretty bizarre and random and we received zero feedback. Literally, nothing. This class should never be offered again.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I probably got an A in this course. This feedback is coming from someone who cares about learning and wants to take advantage of their limited time at Yale. And this was a totally upsetting waste.",
                "Yes! It was a great class to learn more about the Middle East.",
                "If you go into this class looking for and expecting a survey, then I highly recommend it. I feel like I have enough of a basis now in Middle Eastern history (which I had pretty much none of before) to delve further into things that interest me. If you're looking for depth, though, this won't be it.",
                "Yes! It was a very low-stress introductory history class (although this depends on the section leader). I learned a lot and had fun with all the projects that were assigned."
