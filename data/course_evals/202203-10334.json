                "I gained much more knowledge of certain grammatical structures, as well as idiomatic expressions. Also, it was fun to learn more in depth about select cities in the Germanic speaking countries.",

                "The strength of this class came from the student side in that we all got along very well and helped each other. The course itself was not enjoyable. I felt attacked every single day and never was made to feel so unintelligent by a classroom environment ever. The range of work differed a lot- some night we had nothing and other nights we were completely overloaded. It made it all very difficult to manage and I was stressed out in class every single day.",
                "Strengths -- Thorough exposure to a range of content. The textbook and online homework assignments were good and were reflective of the work we learned in formal instruction. Workload was consistent throughout the weeks and was a good amount of work spread fairly per day. Asynchronous work was good.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- Most of in-class instruction was verbal, not so much conversation or immediate usage of the language. I think it would be better to doing more verbal exercises or free speaking, rather than scripted conversations or written exercises. These exercises were good for on the tests but were not so practical for mastery of the language.",
                "I liked that it was a small class and we got to practice speaking a lot. I suppose we could have received a little bit more grammar instruction.",
                "The strengths of this course were the reinforcements of grammar and idiomatic expressions through assignments and in class speaking. However, I think vocabulary is something that should be taught, rather than just memorizing lists for tests.",
                "Great class",
                "Strengths are many assignments that work on different structures of the language and weakness would be unequal participation. The professor usually chooses who speaks and it usually felt like she'd consistently pick the better students instead of challenging he ones that could use some more work. Also, the professor would only go over things once. Even if it was obvious that the class had no clue what was going on."

                "No, I would not. I personally had such a bad experience and lost all my desire to learn the German language. If a student is interested in taking German, I would suggest they only take it through L3.",
                "Yes, went above expectations of German 4, but also was more similar to the three lower required levels. I think it was a great section but sometimes felt a little too elementary.",
                "Yes, it's quite a bit of work, but we'll worth it as I feel it improved my German a lot.",
                "Absolutely! Not only did I learn a lot but the professor also fostered a very positive learning environment, so much so that I looked forward to going to class every day.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this because it is a helpful reinforcement of the basis foundations of the language. Also, by being forced to do many assignments and exercises in your language, you will gradually improve in your accuracy and effectiveness in communicating ideas in German.",
                "Definitely! If you want to learn German you need to take this class",
                "I would recommend to anyone who enjoys German language and culture."
