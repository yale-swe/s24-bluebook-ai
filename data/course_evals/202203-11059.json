            "comments": [
                "Strengths -  A large breadth of human diseases were covered in this course, providing me and other students a stronger understanding on how they were identified and the translational impact of basic science in the development of new therapeutics against these diseases.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The final term paper requires the student to identify a human disease of interest and (i) provide an in-depth characterization of the disease and (ii) propose further investigation on such disease. While such an assignment is extremely beneficial to improving the scientific writing ability of students, it may be challenging for students to come up with completely novel approaches to better understand a specific human disease. Additionally, the course does not focus on experimental design--rather it focuses on mechanistic discoveries and therapies for human diseases--making it difficult for students to think of methods to interrogate diseases via hypothesis-driven experiments. Perhaps, some emphasis on experimental design would benefit students taking this course when it comes to writing the final term paper. \r\n\r\nOne additional weakness is the group participation during the weekly in-class assignments. Some weeks, I could tell my group members did not read (or read very poorly) the assigned material. This made it difficult to have thorough discussions when crafting responses to the questions. I am not sure what kind of changes would be necessary to be certain all student thoroughly read the material before each Wednesday.",
                "Strengths: low workload, essentially no work between Wed - Mon, good vibe in the classroom, definitely to be taken after MB&B300/301, variety of professors was interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: questions sometimes too hard, too many papers to read in 2 days, little to no guidance given for midterm and final papers",
                "The strength is the lecturer series format since it ensures an expert in each field is lecturing on it. It is especially nice when a researcher who was pivotal to the discovery of a certain topic gives a lecture on it, such as with Professors Steitz and Schatz.",
                "The strengths of this course were the variety of weekly lectures and papers to read. It would have been helpful for the weekly papers to have been posted a bit earlier to have enough time to read the review papers before Monday class. Additionally, it would have been nice to choose partners for the paper discussion a few more times throughout the semester.",
                "Not much info was given about quizzes and what the next class would be like during class and the syllabus was slightly unclear, so at times, it would be difficult to predict exactly what class would be like and how to prepare for it.",
                "I appreciate the wide range of topics listed, but I feel like if we spent two weeks on each topic instead of one I would feel better equipped to go in depth and better understand the scientific principles",
                "Strengths: really engaging material and really relevant for any biochemistry student who is doing research to see the potential applications, a lot of guidance on all assignments from TFs, group discussion questions were really thought-provoking and pushed me to think about scientific papers in ways I had not before, met a lot of faculty members and learned about a wide range of fields in biochemistry, large variety of diseases and mechanisms of pathogenesis \r\n\r\nLess of a weakness and more of a warning for any students considering taking the course: workload is a little hard to adapt to at first since you're required to read in-depth on 3-5 papers each week, but I think everyone finds their own ways to balance that amount of reading within the first few weeks so don't get discouraged at first!"

                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another MB&B student (or MCDB student) who is highly interested in the molecular mechanisms of human diseases. I would especially recommend this course to future physician-scientists (pre-MD or pre-MD/PhD students) who plan on pursuing careers in basic science to address unmet clinical challenges.",
                "Sure, it is an okay elective",
                "Definitely! One of the best MBB courses there is. TAs and Professors are very helpful and knowledgeable!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to enter academia or medicine, as it provides a lot of the data analysis skills that will be essential in the future.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about the intersection of research and medicine. The weekly questions were challenging yet very interesting to think through with classmates.",
                "Yes, we are so lucky to have this course taught by the leading scientists at Yale about their own discoveries! It's amazing to hear from so many important and accomplished professors and have them teach this undergraduate course.",
                "Yes, interesting material and good instruction. However, the weekly quizzes could be a bit stressful",
                "I think this is one of my favorite biochemistry courses I've taken at Yale, so I would definitely recommend this course to any MB&B student! That being said, there is a huge emphasis on scientific reading, writing, and experimental thinking in this course, so if these aren't areas you're interested in improving your skills, this course may be more overwhelming. I think this course really challenged me to evaluate scientific data and experiments to see if they really are convincing, and even expand beyond the bounds of the original paper to face slightly different conditions or to tackle some of the still unanswered questions. This course also really helped me to realize how much I appreciate the beauty of scientific rationale and logic. The mini-review and quizzes are pretty manageable, and while the proposal was a lot more involved, it is still doable and you get a lot of support from the TFs in the experimental design and writing process."
