I learned how to engage with subjects in out-of-the-box ways, remix visual and audio elements for interesting effects, and the strict COVID filming restrictions actually really helped to simulate the experience of working on a project with specific time/budget/artistic constraints. This course was also a fantastic opportunity to hone my technical skills with weekly production assignments, all culminating in a final project that really felt like a distillation of all the skills learned in class and assignments. Was also nice to have something new for my personal showreel!"

                "Strengths: Our teaching assistant/assistant prof was incredibly helpful and responsive in every way possible. This greatly complimented professor Steiner's thoughtful, calculated, and immensely supportive/uplifting teaching style. I was always given super super clear feedback and plenty of additional reading/watching to guide me in the right direction. The amount of personal attention each student receives in this class is absolutely stunning and truly to be commended. Prof Steiner also brought in many of her (very cool and talented) documentarian friends, including the director of a critically-acclaimed HBO documentary series, to give us personalised lectures and workshops throughout the term. This class offers a truly unique and enriching experienced, which helped shed light on documentary not only as an art form, but also as a career! The class was also full of incredibly talented and interesting students with their own stories and styles, and class time was devised so that much of the learning came from sharing each others' pieces and providing constructive commentary to one another. A truly collaborative atmosphere... this class rocks!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been nice to have clearer guidelines/check-ins on the QCQs (a weekly assignment where we we compose a quote, brief comment, and question on an assigned reading). I often wrote mine down in a notebook and brought them up in class without necessarily uploading them to the Box file. Some weeks, it wasn't even clear if we were meant to do them at all, and then at the end of the course they were expected to all be uploaded. It wasn't too much of an issue for me as I just copied them onto a doc, but since the guidelines were unusually a little foggy that could be an issue for students in the class going forward."

                "1000000%. It's a no-brainer if you are on the documentary track, but I would recommend it ESPECIALLY if you have even the slightest bit of interest in documentary. You don't have to be an accomplished film maker, or an art student, or an anthropology major to be able to fully engage with this class and take away all of its wonderful offerings. You will be encouraged to use whatever you have (iPhone, camera, anything) to engage with your surroundings in a totally new way. By the end of the class, you will have captured countless hidden stories, learned about your own ways of understanding things, and learned from real documentarians who are at the cutting edge of the industry (some of whom are really trying to push the envelope of the genre). Professor Steiner is also a complete gem, and will encourage you to really get to know and engage with your classmates. Be prepared to push yourself though: This course asks you to do a fair bit of editing and filming for weekly 2-3 min projects--you'll probably have to occasionally pump in a couple of hours at times when you really don't feel up to it, but it's definitely worth it. There's just so much to celebrate with this course."
