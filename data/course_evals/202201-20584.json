                "It was good to have open discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some students naturally had more comments than others, but the professor should make sure not to let them monopolize the conversation. This makes it much harder for other students to find a good time to jump in and participant. Also, students should not be asked to grade each other. It is unethical and puts students in a very awkward position. Finally, it would be helpful if there was some lecture in the beginning to make sure all students are on the same page and provide some foundation.",
                "I think the discussions can be more structured. I felt that sometimes we spent too much time on one topic and ended up not having time for other interesting things to talk about.",
                "Discussion was always lively, enjoyed learning from Julian and other students",
                "Strengths: course structure, discussion, assignments, everything(?)\r\nWeaknesses: only concern is that its a large seminar (~23) which makes it difficult for shy students to speak up. Maybe cap it at 18? Other than that no weaknesses!",
                "the course is a weekly seminar discussion that is often a very free-form and relaxed environment - it's cool to be part of an engaged discussion where the students just interact in their own ways with the material. Julian is a great conversation mediator, and each class often left me recognizing a lot of new ways of thinking about the material",
                "i think the biggest improvement would be making the discussions more accessible to all students, not just the higher level grad students. Maybe start the course by explaining\/elaborating more about the readings rather than going straight into further information that many may be unfamiliar with"

                "Yes! You do not need any background in Computer Science and will learn a lot.",
                "Certainly. This is a fantastic course. It pushes you to think critically about AI from different angles (psychology\/philosophy\/practice) while exposing you to a bunch of interesting literature that relates to it. The core assignments are manageable yet fulfilling: 1-1.5 page response every week, then a final paper (basically a much longer response) Honestly of the most engaging seminars out there.  No matter what your major is, you should take this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in the realms of AI, cognitive science, psychology, and neural networks! However, I would advise students interested more in the neuroscience side to be careful because some of the readings are definitely more technical\/psychological theory based than maybe anticipated. However, this was a wonderful refreshing course where both the students and professor are genuinely interested in the material, which leads for great seminar discussions",
