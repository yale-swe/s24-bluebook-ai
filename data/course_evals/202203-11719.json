                "I gained a lot of knowledge about the Amarna period of the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt. Coming in with no knowledge of ancient Egypt, I developed an understanding of general trends in Egyptian history, specifically political aspects, by studying a very narrow era in which these trends were bucked. I developed an appreciation for Egyptian art as a medium for expression and storytelling. More than anything, I learned about the religion of ancient Egypt before, during, and after Akhenaten's cultish adjustments.",
                "I went from zero to 90% understanding or knowledge of what happened in like a 40 yr period 3500 years ago which is pretty amazing. Developed an understanding of the religious, political, and familial dynamics surrounding the 18th dynasty and why it was ultimately struck from the record"

                "The material is by itself fascinating and engaging. This course presented it well in a way that allowed students to explore the many curiosities of the Amarna Period, focusing not just on its history but also on the art and architecture of the period. Projects gave students chances to learn more deeply about a specific person or diplomatic thread while classes gave a broader outline of the era. One slight issue with the projects was that presentation time often ran long and presentations bled into other class time. \r\nProfessors worked very well together and complemented each other's areas of expertise.",

The course was insightful for people studying Egypt and the Near East while remaining accessible for those unfamiliar with Egyptian history. Very engaging material, professors, and TF.",
                "Praise be the Aten! Under his great rays I fall to my knees seven times and seven times! If you are looking for a class to get a basic overview of Egyptian history, this may not be the class for you. The Age of Akhenaten covers one measly percent of ancient Egypt's 3000-year-plus history, but in great detail. That said, what I learned from that one percent gave me a newfound appreciation for Egypt as an ancient society. Exploration of the art, in particular, flipped my preconceived notions about Egypt on their head and really helped me understand the ancient Egyptians as, rather than a dusty shadow of a long-gone alien society, people just like you and me who happened to live in a different time. The lectures are engaging, Professor Darnell and Professor Moeller are a great team and are clearly extraordinarily knowledgeable, and the workload is completely manageable. Overall, this is a great class to take if you're interested in history and want to learn, with astonishing resolution, about an incredibly rich society.",
                "Yes absolutely. Profs Moeller and Darnell are incredible. Very manageable workload and super interesting information!",
                "Yes! Its a fantastic course, the professors make it extremely engaging.",
                "Yes, but only if they're a hardcore history nerd. Otherwise it might get into the weeds too much"
