                "I learned SO much, more than I can possibly quantify, about both the legal and theoretical landscape around sexual consent in the United States and how both have changed over time. Specifically, learned about how sexuality, gender identity, disability, and other categories can impact the meaning and experiences of sexual consent for different groups. Much of what I learned impacted my personal thinking and politics. I think my writing also improved in this course thanks to great feedback from the professor and TF!",

                "Amazing course! Really encourages critical thinking skills and changes\/challenges your opinions.",
                "The material each week is deeply fascinating, challenging, and rewarding to grapple with. Prof. Fischel is an amazing, insanely knowledgeable, and understanding instructor who is incredible at facilitating great class discussions and encouraging the conversations to reach deeper levels. His style of conducting seminars is excellent, and he creates an environment in which students can feel comfortable participating (which is not always the case in classes that deal with difficult, challenging topics). Genuinely cannot think of any weaknesses for this course.",
                "There was a wide variety of incredible readings that made me consider the issue of consent from many new perspectives. I liked how the syllabus included Yale's sexual misconduct policies, and the course material always felt extremely relevant and urgent. I also appreciated the inclusion of podcasts, TV show episodes, and articles, in addition to more traditional academic works. For the most part, the guest speakers were amazing, and I thought Professor Fischel was a gracious and thoughtful leader of discussions.",
                "I looked forward to this course every week because our discussions were so engaging, and every single piece of material was absolutely fascinating. There was a good deal of reading and writing, but it was all WORTH IT. My favorite course of the semester! If anything, there was so much amazing material to cover that the discussions sometimes felt a bit rushed, but again, worth it because I learned so much!",

                "It felt like there was little understanding, both in the syllabus and from the professor, about the difficulty of the pandemic. There was no break, extensions were unlikely, and the workload felt uncompromisingly heavy. Several of the readings could have and should have been cut.",
                "Prof. Fischel managed a seminar during COVID better than any other professor I have seen. Just to name a few of the ways in which the class excelled in responding to this format: encouraging student participation through the hand-raise function, briefly sharing slides to recap but not using Powerpoint throughout the whole class, having a brief break in the middle of class, and understanding that students might need to have their camera off at brief intervals. I would be much more excited about virtual semesters if all professors were both as adept and understanding as Prof. Fischel in adapting their teaching practices to the unique environment of the pandemic.",
                "Professor Fischel split the class into two groups and had one group responsible for making discussion posts each week. Whichever group was \"on\" that week was also expected to be prepared to answer any questions Professor Fischel asked, which gave the \"off\" group a bit of a breather.",
                "I think this course worked great in a virtual setting! It moved at a quick pace, so it was easy to stay engaged, and our conversations and guest speakers were amazing. Our homework included readings, podcasts, videos, and more, and this variety of types of media was much more engaging than if we had only been assigned readings.",

It is rare to find courses at Yale that are so thought-provoking, intellectually stimulating, impactful on one's worldview and life, and to top it all of taught by such a brilliant and kind instructor. Everyone can get something very meaningful out of this class, whether or not you are a WGSS major or have prior academic or advocacy background in the topics of this course.",
