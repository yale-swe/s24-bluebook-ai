Each class she would bring tea and snacks, and you could tell that each class session was meticulously planned to benefit our research and writing process. The small class size was great because we were able to get to know each others' projects throughout the semester. Freedom of topic choice was also great--you could truly choose anything to write about--and allowed students to enjoy what they were doing, since they personally chose topics. I enjoyed the space that she gave us with deadlines, trusting us to fill in the semester with work, but also that she was flexible when needed.",

                "Yes!! If you have the drive to complete an independent writing\/research project like this class asks of you, absolutely take this class even if you're not a film major! Our class had a wonderful variety of majors and interests, which worked really well because we all had very unique projects that we were able to learn from each other about. Camille is the perfect person to guide you through the process, and the deadlines are fairly hands-off--the class offers so many resources, but it's up to you to ask for help when you need it. Feedback on assignments was always quick, detailed, and actually helpful in improving my writing. I always looked forward to attending class each week.",

You learn so much from each class and theres always new surprises. You walk out of the course feeling more confident about yourself as a thinker, writer, and researcher.",
                "Absolutely, Camille spends so much time to create an inspirational environment for all of us writers. I am a big fan of the interdisciplinary nature of the course so I was able to learn how to create maps\/timelines\/charts, to interview, to explore the Movie Memory Archive, to synthesize human experiences, balancing quantitative and qualitative skills."
