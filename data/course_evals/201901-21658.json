    "You will learn about lots of fundamental machine learning topics and applications.",
    "Insight into cutting-edge machine learning techniques, really useful for anyone considering working with data career-wise",
    "I gained basic knowledge of statistical learning algorithms and learned how to apply R packages to run these algorithms on simple datasets.",
    "I learned about regression and classification models, generative vs discriminative models, stochastic gradient descent, shrinkage methods and sparsity, tree-based methods, language models, PCA, and some topics of Bayesian statistics. I learned the theory behind these models, as well as how to implement them in R.",
    "I learned some basic machine learning and improved my R coding.",
    "Machine learning",
    "Basic supervised learning and some NLP.",
    "I learned how to apply linear algebra. statistics, and data analysis concepts to solve machine learning problems.",
    "Learned a lot about statistics (had taken 0 S&DS classes before this class). Began to understand some of the intuition behind ML methods and how to think like a data scientist.",
    "Machine learning techniques",
    "Insights and intuition to classic machine learning techniques, practical data mining",
    "I learned several methods of machine learning from this class (starting with the basics--i.e. LDA, PCA, penalized regression, gradient descent, etc) and then moving onto more advanced topics such as word embeddings, topic modeling, and an introduction to recurrent neural networks. I learned the basic theory behind each method and implementation in R.",
    "Implementing different machine learning techniques in R. Linear classifier, ridge regression, LASSO, some language models.",
    "I got a good overview of different techniques in the field of machine learning and the theory behind the techniques.",
    "I got some intuition on the basic statistical learning, and can run a couple of linear\/non-linear regression and classification algorithms by my own. This is helpful to my research. Now I understand a bunch of jargons of machine learning and will be able to play with the built-in packages of something like random forest not only in R but also on other platforms. I understand the parameters, the architecture, and can evaluate the model myself.",
    "Learned many different methods for machine learning, such as random forests, decision trees, regressions, PCA, etc.",
    "The basic tools of Machine Learning and the different methods. Also, learnt what to keep in mind when choosing the optimal method.",
    "yes, but not theoretical way",
    "A good conceptual\/mathematical overview of a range of machine learning topics. A chance to implement those machine learning concepts. While we cover regression, trees, forests, boosting, topic models, word embeddings etc, you should be aware that we spend like  of a lecture on recurrent neural networks. The CS Deep Learning class is much more relevant to neural networks.",
    "I learned, not surprisingly, that the future\/present is in machine learning, but also that we have a long way to go until we can harness it in the best way possible. Given that there is limited understanding about the way that most ML algorithms work, and we are so willingly relying on \"big data\" to make decisions for us, I really hope more people care about really understanding what these algorithms do\/mean.",
    "Understanding a deeper level of handling data and developing neural networks and regression. This course also greatly enhances your R skills.",
    "Knowledge about and practice using different machine learning techniques",
    "I gained a much better understanding of various statistical techniques and concepts. As a CS major, I didn't learn much in the way of programming, but it was really cool to understand various fundamental statistical concepts. While a single course probably isn't enough to make me a Machine Learning guru, I feel more confident of being able to at least understand various ML approaches, and grok any concepts I see in the future.",
    "This course teaches you a lot of the fundamental theories in Machine Learning. Most high-profile techniques like deep learning are not covered. You learn the theories and their applications through intensive problem sets."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Derek Feng is a dedicated and patient instructor who truly wanted the class to learn. The lectures and problem sets were great, though the tests were tricky and required you to really know the material well and read the questions carefully.",
    "Derek can go a bit fast during lectures, although he does pause for questions. It can be hard to follow or comprehend some topics.\r\n\r\nThe homework assignments are reasonable and interesting.",
    "Strengths: interesting material, engaging psets, Derek was a very low-key and relaxed professor, peer tutor office hours were every day (!!) and always super helpful. \/\/ Weaknesses: this is hard material. no doubt. expect to spend between 10-20 hours on psets (there are 6-7 of them throughout the term) -- but you come out the other side a better programmer and a better statistician.",
    "Strengths: The course covers a wide range of basic knowledge of statistical learning algorithms.\r\nWeaknesses: The format of lectures are not very well organized. The course covers a lot of math proof and deduction, but these parts are not in the course materials.",
    "Strengths: the psets are well structured so that you are really learning how to implement the methods. There is enough guidance on the psets, though, that they are definitely doable. Also there is no final exam, just a midterm, and most of the grade is based on the psets which is nice since you put so much work into the psets.\r\nWeaknesses: this class teaches difficult material and the theory behind it was not always very clear. Also if you aren't good at coding in R, it is going to be really tough to learn the material and learn to code at the same time.",
    "The lecturer wasn't very good at keeping the class engaged and didn't really use the time in class effectively (e.g. class always started late, lots of fumbling with the projector, explaining notation, etc). We spent a lot of the class learning pretty old and outdated techniques, and I would have liked to spend more of the class learning more updated and standard material. We also spent a lot of time discussing and using word embeddings and language models, whereas I would have been more interested to learn about image detection and classification. Overall, it seems like the material taught in this class is lagging behind similar courses taught at peer institutions.",
    "The assignments were good.  The lectures not so much.",
    "Strength: introduced me to R\r\nWeakness: maybe more math background would be great",
    "Class was very well taught and information was useful.",
    "The course was not very well taught. I did not get alot out of the lectures. Nonetheless, the paets were interesting and I did improve my machine learning skills.",
    "Weaknesses: teacher (no tea no shade, just saying that the 2 lectures given by John Lafferty were a lot better than Derek Feng's, don't @ me though). Also the structure of the class was weird (no final, 6 psets which counted for 70% of the grade... lmfao). Lectures were not engaging.\r\n\r\nAlso, the TAs were sometimes flaky and would constantly change their weekly office hour times, also some TAs were just not knowledgeable",
    "This is a pretty well designed course to be honest. No complaints.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is the problem sets. They are all quite long, but you get tons of experience with real data sets and machine learning. The midterm was also MUCH more reasonable this semester since it focused on knowledge and understanding, rather than theory and math.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course is the instruction. In the first half of the semester, I could understand Professor Feng's lectures, but starting with PCA, everything stopped making sense. He did try to give us intuition for each of the machine learning techniques we learned, but I feel that the lectures could've been less confusing if he didn't throw around a bunch of equations that we ultimately didn't really need to know.",
    "I liked the selection of topics and feel like I have some more understanding of the key concepts in machine learning (ie trade-off between bias and variance, training error vs testing error, etc). However, I feel like this course occupied a strange place mathematically where it didn't go deep enough to give me a deep understanding of the theory behind the methods (ie this wasn't a mathematical machine learning class) and yet we still spent a long time going over the mathematical derivations in class.\r\n (but had too many topics to cover any one in depth). The mathematical problems on the problem sets were kept fairly simple (ie one step in a derivation) but didn't really increase my understanding. The midterm was kept much harder\/more theoretical and had fairly low grades overall (average a 47 out of 70) as we hadn't gone deeply enough in class or in the problem sets into the theory to get a true understanding. As for the problem sets, they were helpful in practical terms (ie getting acquainted with machine learning packages in R) yet we never discussed that coding in class (the class would be really hard for someone who hadn't coded in R before and relied on independently reading documentation on packages). So I would recommend this class further examining what it is (ie whether theoretical or applied) as currently it tries to do both but doesn't do either as well as they could. I also did find that while Derek was a really nice professor, his explanations were kind of difficult to understand and that he didn't have as many examples as he could have (ie he got halfway through an example in class, never finished it, and then the topic appeared on the midterm). His hints during office hours could also be slightly challenging to understand, and grading on problem sets was fairly slow (ie it took around a month to get the final two problem sets back). So I think the course could definitely have been better organized to maximize student understanding.",
    "The psets were challenging but interesting and I think more interactive coding in class or more interactive examples would have been helpful.",
    "The strength is in the problem sets - they are doable and teach you a lot about the methods being used. The weakness of the course is that it is in R. I feel like python would have been more useful and less frustrating.",
    "strength: homework assignments are customized for the purpose of practicing, which is helpful.\r\nweakness: the syllabus said the there would be an assignment every 10 days, however, it's actually 8 days. As one assignment in, the next one just comes out, which is too intensive for students like me who don't only need to take many courses but also have to do independent researches. The lecturer is fine, but the slides provided to the students are very confusing, making the content hard to understand. Actually, the ideas we've learned shouldn't be very challenging because every time I had a problem, I just turned to the book \"Introduction to statistical learning\" and got a very good understanding. However, the book doesn't cover all the things we talked in the class, which means for quite much of the time, we could only rely on the slides, and got very confused. This was not necessary and was a waste of time. Please make sure that the students are always provided with some good materials after class because the lectures are not enough and the slides are only setting up obstacles to understanding what we are learning. And the result is spending a lot of unnecessary time on pointless exploration.",
    "Lectures difficult to understand, could walk through more simple overview before diving into the complicated theory. Overall, well taught and good course though. Python psets would definitely be a plus.",
    "Strength is amount of HW, weakness is that professor is not really capable of teaching and time management",
    "The course was, in general, not that well organized or taught. Because of the broad range of topics covered, it felt like we didn't ever get to a full explanation of anything. Since the problem sets were mostly about implementing a machine learning topic, the class material wasn't that necessary to doing the problem sets. The exams\/quizes were very challenging and well written, but I wish the course had just followed a traditional structure: 1 or 2 midterms and a final exam. Instead, there was a single exam placed like 3 weeks before the end of the semester. This meant that we didn't need to learn the class material after the exams. Because of the difficulty in trying to do both the math and the implementation, I felt that we didn't really accomplish either very effectively. Maybe splitting the class into a concepts\/math course and a implementation course would be better for accomplishing the two goals.",
    "The topics are very interesting and relevant today. It would help if we stuck to the schedule, rather than us having to keep wondering when the psets would be released and due (since after the second pset, the dates would always be pushed back), and so that we can cover all the material including the last pset. Also would really appreciate having the deeper math\/derivations uploaded rather than only writing on the board, to help us focus on understanding during class and reviewing after class",
    "Work load is higher than normal, but Derek is a great instructor and he makes the class very interesting",
    "The course was very helpful to learn through lecture and R and have TAs and the professor to learn. The strengths are the extra notes and slides to expand on earlier skills required to catch up for the course. Then the course does a great job of crawl walk run with handling and analyzing data.",
    "Strengths: I liked the problem sets they were difficult and time-consuming, but I felt like I learned a lot from them. Lots of help hours offered from the TA and ULAs, which were super helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: I would've liked spending more time on the stuff in the second half of the course (text analysis) and to actually spend time with neural networks. It also would've been nice to incorporate using Python in the class (since that seems to be more of the industry standard) rather than exclusively using R.",
    "If you religiously do all the readings and go to class, you will become more familiar with various standard Machine Learning techniques which are a jumping point for the more state-of-the-art techniques in use in industry\/academia today. The problem sets are well designed and feature a nice mix of theory and practical implementations of the ideas we learnt in class.\r\n\r\nI felt that the lectures and accompanying slides were insufficient in helping me understand the concepts covered. I often had to reach back to the text book (which is excellent), but it did not cover any of the material we learnt in the second half of the course. It would be nice if we were assigned a text book that covered these concepts, or received handouts that more intuitively explained the things we learnt in class.  It would also be nice if we had a problem set on neural networks, since we only went through it in class. Lastly, as CS major I would prefer if the problem sets had been in Python rather than R, since that seems to be more widely used in industry.",
    "The course has great problem sets that really force you to understand what is going on and how to apply the theories you've learned. Professor Feng's lectures lacked conviction and often wandered, making them difficult to follow."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! The course provides any accessible introduction to challenging machine learning methods, if you have some background in programming, math, probability, and statistics.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to others. Although, if given the chance, I would recommend taking it with John Lafferty who teaches this class in Python.",
    "Absolutely. Hard but 100% worthwhile in an increasingly data-driven world and labor market. There are not many classes at Yale whose return on time and effort invested is so immediately tangible. Definitely take this class!!",
    "No, I do not recommend this course. The course needs to be better organized so that students can access enough supplementary materials and receive prompt feedback from instructors.",
    "I would if you are interested in machine learning and have a strong background in math and coding in R. This class isn't for the faint-hearted but it is really interesting and important if you put in the work.",
    "I would recommend this course if one is willing to put in the time on the assignments and problem sets. Going to class wasn't usually necessary to learn the course material, so most of my learning occurred during the time I put in during the assignment. I don't think many people enjoyed attending lecture anyway.",
    "If they can learn outside of lecture.",
    "Yes. Very useful",
    "Yes, its a great way to practice ML.",
    "I would recommend this course but I hope the teaching improves.",
    "Only in the Fall with John Lafferty",
    "Offers introduction to various machine learning techniques, but only two weeks on neural networks if thats what youre looking for. You will implement many of these techniques and have a strong foundation on a variety of methods and when the appropriate applications are. Biweekly psets and a midterm but no final. Make sure you study hard for that midterm since doing the psets and skipping lecture wont help you xD :3",
    "Depends. If you're interesting in machine learning and have a strong math and statistics background, take this class. You don't need the prereqs: I only took 238 and did well. However, Professor Feng's lectures can become a little hard to understand, but in the end, this isn't too bad as most of what he talks about isn't on the midterm.",
    "I feel mixed about recommending this course to another student in its current form. On the one hand, it's interesting and important content, and there aren't many other machine learning classes at Yale. On the other hand, I found Derek to be a confusing lecturer, the course to be slightly disorganized, and that we spent time on the theory but went over it too quickly for me to say that I personally have a deep theoretical\/conceptual understanding of any of these methods. I'm hoping that splitting this course into S&DS 355 and S&DS 365 next year helps to resolve some of those issues though (ie and that S&DS 355 goes over more of the details of the coding implementation while 365 slows down with the theory to the point where it's actually more understandable). However, you should be careful when shopping courses to ensure that is the case.",
    "If youre at all interested in machine learning this course is a good way to get a fundamental understanding of some important concepts.",
    "I do not recommend taking this course for a grade if you have not taken the pre-req classes. I was pretty lost in the math and R programming because I did not take the pre-req classes.",
    "To students who have a lot of time and intend to work on data analysis in the future, this course might be a choice.\r\nTo student who are busy and cannot set aside up to 30 hours per week for this class, I don't recommend this course.",
    "Definitely a helpful course, very informative and prepares you a lot for industry. Be ready for the work though.",
    "Because the topics are so inherently interesting \/ relevant, this course is was enjoyable. Because of disorganization, the execution of the course could have been improved significantly.",
    "Machine Learning is taking over our lives  take this course to understand what this might mean",
    "Yes, absolutely a must for anyone interesting in machine learning or developing R skills.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it! The problem sets are tough and take time, and the lectures are sometimes a little dry and confusing (and therefore needed to be reviewed a bunch of times). But I felt like as a result of that work I learned a lot about basic machine learning methods.",
    "As a CS major with only a high school stats background and no R experience, this was the class in which I worked the hardest, but also learnt the most this semester. If you're like me, definitely take it if you are interested in statistical techniques and are willing to put in the work. I daresay almost 50% of the class ended up taking it Credit\/D because the grades on the first quiz were brutal, but grading on the whole was pretty fair.\r\n\r\nIf you already have a significant stats background and experience programming in R, then the workload will be much lighter, though that also means you can delve deeper into the techniques we learn in class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if Lafferty is teaching. If Feng is teaching, it will not be nearly as insightful but if you are interested in the topic then it is worth the time because the homework was actually very rewarding."
