                "This class was a great writer's workshop: for the first half of the semester, we did writing exercises that allowed us to build our skills, and then apply them in the second half. It worked well, and I felt like I got a lot out of it. I wish, though, we had more time to discuss the readings. I think this class would work better if we had one day a week that was discussing the readings, and then one day of the week dedicated to student feedback (which, at the midsemester point, would flip to all student feedback).",
                "I think greater and earlier communication would be helpful in having a better idea about next steps and where we stand in the class grade-wise.",
                "One of the greatest strengths of this course was the supportive and fun classroom environment. I felt very safe to experiment in my writing and loved reading my classmates' incredible work. The workshop format was encouraging and always generated interesting discussion.",
                "Great assignments and class structure - challenging without being overwhelming to new writers.",
                "The reading list for this course is absolutely fantastic, and the writing prompts for each week gave me a ton of creative inspiration and freedom. I think the structure of the course could be changed a bit, since doing critiques every week was sort of tiring (though that was a huge part of the course that helped me grow as a writer).",

                "Yes!",
                "Yes. It was great to explore these questions about gender in a safe and supportive space, to be introduced to so many plays by trans and non-binary authors, and feel free to experiment with new ideas in my writing.",
                "Yes!! Safe space to grow and experiment as a writer",
                "yes! you will get such good feedback on writing, read really cool plays, and get to be a part of a special community of playwrites on campus",
                "Absolutely. Professor Kaufman is incredible, and every assigned reading and class discussion was interesting. I also improved my own writing significantly and had the chance to write a one-act play, which isn't something I ever thought I would be able to do.",
                "Absolutely! Nowhere else can you find a community of queer\/trans writers at college. This was a beautiful experience."
