                "This class was a great writer's workshop: for the first half of the semester, we did writing exercises that allowed us to build our skills, and then apply them in the second half. It worked well, and I felt like I got a lot out of it. I wish, though, we had more time to discuss the readings. I think this class would work better if we had one day a week that was discussing the readings, and then one day of the week dedicated to student feedback (which, at the midsemester point, would flip to all student feedback).",
                "I think greater and earlier communication would be helpful in having a better idea about next steps and where we stand in the class grade-wise.",
                "One of the greatest strengths of this course was the supportive and fun classroom environment. I felt very safe to experiment in my writing and loved reading my classmates' incredible work. The workshop format was encouraging and always generated interesting discussion.",
                "Great assignments and class structure - challenging without being overwhelming to new writers.",
                "The reading list for this course is absolutely fantastic, and the writing prompts for each week gave me a ton of creative inspiration and freedom. I think the structure of the course could be changed a bit, since doing critiques every week was sort of tiring (though that was a huge part of the course that helped me grow as a writer).",

                "Yes!! Safe space to grow and experiment as a writer",
