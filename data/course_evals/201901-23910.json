    "We learned how to play a variety of songs related to traditional gamelan and wayang performance. Learned a lot about various SE Asian performing arts, including history, tradition, and adaptations.",
    "I learned about the culture of wayang in Indonesia and its deep rooted tradition.",
    "Continuation of L1, this class was predominantly about wayang (shadow puppet theater) learning how to perform",
    "Cultural and historical background of Indonesia through the lens of the arts, as we simultaneously honed our skills on the instruments!",
    "I learned in depth about Wayang and its accompanying cultures and forms. I learned about a different part of the world that I have never been exposed to except in gamelan. I also learned how to be in tune with others and work together in a unique way in this ensemble.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about the culture of Indonesia, in particularly the art of gamelan and its importance. Playing a unique array of instruments was great and I was able to cultivate many relationships."

   "comments": [
    "Maho is so kind and patient, and she and Mas Dar are world leading scholars on the topic. The workload is low, the classroom environment is really positive, and people are always excited to come to class!",
    "The course does a very good job through hands-on music, readings, and videos to deepen our understanding. I do not think there are any flaws to this class.",
    "Great class with great balance of readings and practice. The beginning of the course was very heavy with videos to watch, and this was often too much.",
    "Nothing, perfect! Strength is the conversations on the readings we've done during our class time. It reinforces our deeper understandings of what we are doing and is a highlight of this class.",
    "This class is almost nothing but strengths. It is very fun and low work load but built in a way that you actually learn an incredible amount. It is low stress but enriching.",
    "Strengths - structured, organized, great teacher, learn alot \r\nweaknesses - not many, lot of time commitment so make sure you buy in."

   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this class-- possibly the best class I've taken at Yale and an amazing class to end senior year!",
    "Yes, you won't take another class like this. Take it even if you have never played an instrument before, because it is a fun challenge to learn how to play well within an ensemble.",
    "Yes because it gives you a view of a different culture than very few people ever learn about. There are less than ten universities that offer Indonesian and even less universities that offer gamelan or wayang. This class is crucial in a creating a cultured background for a liberal arts student.",
    "Absolutely take this class! Gamelan and wayang are such beautiful art forms and working with Maho and Mas Dar is such a privilege.",
    "Most definitely! Maho is the best teacher youll ever have!",
    "Yes! This course is amazing! You get to learn so much about the culture and music. The performance at the end is so fun and rewarding! If you can, absolutely take this class! Maho makes this such a wonderful experience",
    "Yes!!!!! Absolutely.",
    "Absolutely. If you have taken L1, why wouldn't you continue?",
    "YES ABSOLUTELY! I recommend the gamelan classes to everyone I know. I feel like they truly have been so enriching and a unique experience you cannot get anywhere but Yale.",
    "yessir",
    "Yes - great for students that want to try a music class and try new things out."
