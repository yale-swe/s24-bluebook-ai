                "I learned a lot about culture, art, and literature. This class is very much geared towards learning Spanish in the context of other things, not just directly vocab and grammar. It made it really interesting and engaging because I felt like I was learning important things beyond just how to say new words.",
                "I greatly improved my ability to speak, read, and write in Spanish by completing daily homework assignments and participating in class.",
                "I think one skill I developed intensively through this course is my spoken Spanish skills. Thanks to the class discussions, I am now able to quickly organize my thoughts on a given subject (such as a poem, a piece of art, or a video) and speak my opinion naturally and coherently.",
                "I learned not only key grammatical concepts but also how to think critically in Spanish, not just translate my thoughts from Spanish to English. We looked at art, poems, literature, and movies to draw inspiration and investigate key themes such as indigeneity, feminism, and race, as well as the intersection of identities.",
                "I think that after this course I learned spanish to a very fluent level though not perfect I can definitely communicate any thought that I would have in english in spanish. I am more confident in my ability to speak about profound themes and real world issues.",
                "Spanish, especially speaking Spanish",
                "I learned about the cultures within Spanish speaking countries through various texts while gaining fluency in the Spanish language.",
                "My spanish speaking, listening, auditory comprehension, and writing skills.",
                "I learned a lot about topics relating to Spanish and used Spanish speaking skills to learn these topics."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Very well organized, homework is reasonable (not too much every night)\r\nWeaknesses: Asynchronous days were annoying when we had to work with others. It was sometimes difficult to coordinate with others on Wednesdays, and this made it difficult to feel as if I was putting my best foot forward for some of the assignments. If we're going to be working in pairs or groups for async days, I would honestly just rather have class so its not a hassle to arrange. Otherwise, I think all async assignments should be individual because the point of these days is for us to not have class and be able to engage with spanish on our own time and at our own pace.",
                "The course requires regular, daily work and provides structure for students to follow, which helps with language acquisition.",
                "Strengths: Prof Glenski is a gem - she truly understands what it is like to learn a language and is always there to help. Her kind demeanor reduced anxiety about speaking in class, and she constantly provided feedback on each and every assignment, big or small. She always makes her criticism very positive and informative. In addition, she was extremely accommodating of the Covid situation and held a zoom option for students who were ill or in close contact.\r\nWeaknesses: The curriculum got repetitive after a while, and I felt that there was room for adding more engaging activities. I did not really get to know my peers, which is one of the perks I was looking forward to in a small language class. There was a strong focus on using jamboards, which made it difficult to actually improve on our fluency in speech.",
                "I really liked how this class was very open and discussion based because it made the course more maluable to the needs of the students. I also think that everything had great structure and I never felt underprepared for any assignment.",
                "I really love the organization of this class. It was great having full immersion and having to get comfortable speaking a lotI think my Spanish really improved through that. I liked the focus on art and movies and poetry. The workload was exactly what it should be: manageable but still challenging. I loved asych days mid-week getting a chance to chill out for a day. Only weakness is on asych days when we'd have to do group work and coordinate time to meet up (which usually ended up being 9:25 still).",
                "The strength of this class was how it allowed students to use Spanish in an analytical way. However, frequently as a class we could observe art from different cultures and engage in discussions on what we thought it meant for the culture despite us having little information about these cultures themselves. I think that it is important to ensure that when learning about Hispanic cultures and viewing their different art forms that we include more explanations of what the art means from the perspective of the people who created it. As a result, this course appeared more focused on analyzing art and texts instead of learning about its historical context. I feel that this structure of the course hindered my growth in expanding my usage of vocabulary and grammatical structure, and instead made me comfortable in using my prior knowledge of Spanish into art and film analysis in Spanish.  This class could be improved by having similar units focusing on one aspect of Hispanic culture, where we first learned information and background about the topic followed by applying that information to the forms of art and accompanying it with information about the artist and their inspiration. I think it would also be beneficial to review complex grammatical structures each unit, along with vocabulary that matches the unit so that students can use this along with the background information to analyze the texts with more cultural and grammatical accuracy.",
                "I found that the collaborative nature of many assignments and classwork was a strength of the course. I found it a weakness that sometimes the lessons\/lectures felt open-ended which made it hard to understand what message was supposed to be taken away. I think this could be improved by a more clear summary or review of the units. Another weakness of the course was that the course was heavily discussion focused. As a student with a weakness in contributing to class-wide discussions, it seemed hard to interject appropriately when I didn't feel comfortable or sure of myself.",
                "This course is good in that it doesnt rely heavily on teaching grammar and allows more flexibility and creativity. A weakness is some of the topics were very boring and didnt seem to relate to Spanish at all."

                "Yes. Very enjoyable class. Really feel like I learned a lot.",
                "If Prof Glenski is teaching, absolutely. You learn so much more than just a language from this course - you improve upon your critical thinking and analysis abilities for all different kinds of media. Although a language is a requirement at Yale, I found myself looking forward to this course as almost an elective every day. If youre willing to keep up with the small daily assignments and occasional large assessment, and are willing to make an effort to engage in class, this is the language course for you.",
                "Yes I would if they are interested in studying another language because it is a challenging and yet fast way to pick up on Spanish",
                "Yes!! This class is the reason I'm pursuing my certificate in Spanish.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who wanted or needed to continue to Spanish courses, especially if they had an interest in art and film analysis.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course because I found the subject matter very interesting, and the environment was generally very inclusive and encouraging for learning. I think my spanish improved the most over the course of the class when compared to any other time I learned spanish. I think the activities we did we're all helpful and useful for our spanish skills and didn't feel as redundant as when grammar is taught.",
                "Yes, it is great to fulfill language requirements."
