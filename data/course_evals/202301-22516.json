                "I enjoyed most of the readings and discussion sections but felt like there was far to much reading assigned on a weekly basis to go in depth into the material. Also some lectures were interesting and others had a lot of information that could have been conveyed in a more interesting manner. I liked the final project setup with the presentation and freedom to explore topics covered in class. \r\n\r\nIt was hard to get feedback on assignments for aspects to include in projects and writing and there were no grading standards posted. \r\n\r\nIn terms of grading, we have received feedback on only the project proposal worth 10%. We've submitted 60% worth of other assignments including the Not I, participation, discussion sections projects, presentation and haven't gotten grades back so ending finals period I have no idea what my grade is like in this course which is fairly frustrating, it would have been nice to get a mid semester or final week progress on how the grading was looking like as it made it impossible to see if the course should be taken on Credit D Fail basis or for a grade.",
                "loved it so informative",
                "The grading between TF's is not consistent; some grade much harsher than others. Also, there is very minimal instruction about the group project which is 40% of the grade. Everything in this class is just so vague; it makes it so hard to be successful or see improvement in yourself over the course of the semester.",
                "I think the lectures were very interesting, but the real strength came from the TA Alex. He ran such an engaging section and was clearly so knowledgeable and approachable. He really mentored the students and made sure everyone reached their full potential.\r\nI think the lack of guidance around what the assignments are meant to look like is a bit of a weakness. There was never a clear explanation of what the final product of assignments should look like because they were so open-ended and I found that unnecessarily challenging.",
                "Strengths: animated lectures, interesting topics",
                "The readings and discussion sections were not engaging at all, a lot of the content was just boring in general.",
                "The readings were really interesting, but lectures were sometimes chaotic",
                "This course thoughtfully integrates structured curriculum with a research project that gives students the chance to conduct independent study about a spatial infrastructure or episode that interests them.",
                "This class was great.",
                "Very abstract and hard to follow",
                "I thought the lectures were weird and it was tough to follow along",
                "The strength of this course lied with my TF, Alex Kim. Without his guidance through the complicated topics of our lectures and readings, this class would have had little to no learning value for me.",
                "The course is very open to explore any avenues that you find interesting through the essay and Pecha Kucha. The class gives you a good framework to think about a lot of issues. However, it does feels as if Keller Easterling is mostly reading her book through the lecture.",
                "Course had a lot of interesting content, but I thought it was slightly disorganized.",

                "Strengths: the readings are well chosen and interesting (sometimes far too long though)\r\nWeaknesses: lectures are extremely un-engaging and there is very little reason to be motivated to do any work. Consequently, you barely learn anything and leave very unfullfilled",
                "The lectures hop from example to example and expect you to draw foundational concepts from them instead of clearly walking you through a smaller number of examples, which might facilitate student learning. The readings were consistently fascinating, but the lectures were often very hard to follow. Discussion section was great and very necessary for student understanding/discussion. Expectations for the first assignment were extremely unclear (although I think everyone got an A on it)."

                "Yes, if a student is interested in a more relaxed, but still intellectually engaging class, this is a great fit!",
                "Yes, if you are interested in how the world works based on structural systems!",
                "It is a good class to fill a distributional requirement, there was not much work at all.  I would definitely recommend if someone is looking for a low commitment class.",

                "I would highly recommend that another student take Globalization Space during a future semester, even for students not studying architecture or global studies. It offers a global perspective on international policy, the flows of capital, and infrastructure development.",
                "Yes. This class is very abstract and difficult to completely follow, but its also engaging and challenges you to conceive of space organization differently.",
                "Yes, I think that the course does a good job of exposing one to a variety of different topics from geopolitics and case studies to more abstract theory. While sometimes the lectures can be confusing in how both broad and specific they are, I found the final group project to be a rewarding way of tying together the many ideas put forward in the class.",
                "Probably not. The class can be worthwhile if you are heavily engaged, but personally I found much of the material confusing and also uninteresting.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who has extra time on their hands/is looking for a 5th class and who is interested in global affairs. Otherwise, no.",
                "Absolutely! Keller is very kind and her lectures are definitely meant to be absorbed. It's easy to be skeptical and dismissive of her lecturing, but it's worth trying to appreciate what she is saying and why. I found the lectures and to a lesser extent the reading to be an interesting way of presenting the problems facing the world.",
                "I feel like it varies what people get out of it. Personally, I found it relatively interesting. A group project is a large component of the work required for the course which some people enjoy.",
                "Yes, but I would let them know you only get as much out of it as you give. If you truly do the reading and engage in meaningful conversation with your team and TF you will gain so much and the class will genuinely change your perspective about the forms and systems that surround us no matter where you are. I loved talking with my TF and built a genuine relationship with them, them alone made this class worth it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who enjoys architecture. This is not a gut.",
                "good class for gut and humanities credit",
                "Yes 100%",
                "I would not reccomend this course to another student. It was frustratingly ambigious. The lecture topics were unclear, the assignments were unclear, and what the course was trying to teach as a whole was unclear.",
                "No. I find it hard to write this because I don't dislike Keller. She is very smart and understands so much about her field. But to be as honest as I can be, you will learn next to nothing in this course. You will not be engaged. You will not want to go to lecture or pay attention when you are there because when Keller opens her mouth she might as well just be saying \"gabagool\" over and over again. You would probably learn more from \"gabagool\" to be honest. This course needs some serious reframing and restructuring to accomplish anything as a vessel for education because right now, it isn't.",
                "Not unless you have to take it. The readings are fantastic and the core idea is great, but the lectures are not well designed and are very hard to follow -- there are other classes that will do a better job teaching you to think critically about how power is embedded in infrastructure/geography. Sometimes the assignments (and lectures) felt like an exercise in academic-speak without anything meaningful behind them. Discussion section is fantastic and thought-provoking if you have a good TF, and the group project can be fun."
