                "I learned a lot about what digital platforms are and how they transform different corners of society from democracy to creativity to colonialism.",
                "I learned so much about digital platforms from a liberal arts perspective. I learned about digital platforms' and their history (eg: ARPANET), their economic markets, platform-dependency, governance structures (think content moderation, terms of services, etc.), digital labor (micro-work, gig economy, think Uber/Airbnb, etc.). \r\n\r\nI learned about a new academic space called \"platform studies.\"",
                "I learnt more about the non-technical aspects: from how their governed, how they grow, how they become infrastructures to support other platforms, and how they play a huge in different societal social aspects.",
                "Throughout the course, I was exposed to a wide range of topics about platform theory and the impact of platformization.\r\n\r\nOne of the key takeaways from the course was the importance of understanding the power dynamics at play in the platform economy. Platforms have the ability to shape the behavior of users, and this can have significant implications for society. For example, platforms can influence the way we consume information, the products we buy, and the services we use. As such, it is important to critically examine the role of platforms in shaping our lives.\r\n\r\nAnother important topic covered in the course was the impact of platformization on labor. Platforms have disrupted traditional employment models, and this has led to the emergence of the gig economy. While platforms have created new opportunities for workers, they have also raised concerns about job security, benefits, and fair compensation. The course explored these issues in depth, highlighting the need for policies that protect workers in the platform economy.\r\n\r\nThe course also examined the concept of switching costs and lock-in effects. Platforms often use strategies to make it difficult for users to switch to competing platforms. This can include creating network effects, where the value of the platform increases as more users join, or by using proprietary technology that is not compatible with other platforms. These strategies can create barriers to entry for competitors and limit user choice. The course explored the implications of these strategies and the need for policies that promote competition and user choice."

                "So so many strengths in almost every way. Of the very few weaknesses: class presentations were not engaging and usually consisted of a student rambling, so changing them would be a major improvement. Also, I'm not sure the degree to which students' interdisciplinary backgrounds were actually incorporated in class discussions. Would have loved to see people bring more perspectives, though I understand that is hard on the undergraduate level.",
                "Strengths: Julian was greatsuper well organized and supportive of students. I also appreciated the disciplinary diversity in the courseit touched on computer science, economics, political science and media studies in a way that was accessible to everyone. \r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of",
                "Strengths: relevant readings that are not from the ancient ages, simply amazing professor, and well-balanced course workload\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "It was a discussion based class; I liked how we had to write about a page writing response each week. It forces you to do the readings for the week, which is good. I think one thing to improve is having a set of things discussed during the week, because it's easy to feel like the material is all over the place at times. Additionally, I think there should be a restricted use of laptops in the class, as it distracts students from listening to other students submissions/presentations.",
                "Strengths: the prof is very knowledgeable on this field, and often will offer interesting insights related to the readings. Also, the topic of this class is very modern and relevant to current society, so you'll be learning about things that feel contemporary and impactful in the modern day.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: twice a week format was a bit frustrating because it broke up the readings.",
                "This course is perhaps one of the most relaxing and flexible course I've taken in the ethics, politics, and economics department. I really liked how flexible it was, specifically for its final project, where Professor Posada emphasized that students should do projects that they are personally invested in and can have takeaways for their future endeavors. The workload is very manageable if not light, with only once-a-week reading responses and two papers. The only possible improvement is making it a once-a-week seminar, which Professor Posada hinted he might do in our final weeks. Otherwise, an absolutely stellar class and Professor Posada did an amazing job for his first semester!"

                "Absolutely! This is an extremely well-organized class that manages to cover a wide breadth of topics in digital studies while also giving each topic a good amount of attention and detail. Professor Posada is wonderful at facilitating a seminar and it really felt like I got the \"Yale seminar experience\" from the discussions we had in class.",
                "Definitely! The variety of disciplines that we exploredcomputer science, economics, media studies, political scienceensured that everyone could contribute in their own way, and also learned a lot from their peers and their specialties. Julian is also great, so I recommend any opportunity to take a class with him.",
                "You should absolutely take this course! Professor Posada is an amazing instructor, and the course material is quite relevant to current events. This was definitely one of my favorite courses of all time at Yale.",

                "Definitely. If you're EP&E, poli sci, CS: it helps you understand the broader social issues surrounding platforms, tech, AI, etc",
                "Absolutely! The content covered in this class is super interesting and relevant to current times. Additionally, you'll get lots of great guidance and feedback on your writing, which often will be on topics that you find interesting. Overall, a great course for anyone interested in learning more about the impact digital platforms, datafication, etc. has on our lives.",
                "Absolutely. I can't recommend this course enough, especially if you are interested in computer science or ethics, politics, and economics. There are very few classes that sit at the intersection of tech and policy at Yale, and this class does it very well with a relaxing seminar environment that's conducive to thought and discussion.",
