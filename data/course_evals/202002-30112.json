    "I developed a doctrinal understanding to BoP, as well as the historical underpinnings of the theory. I gained a deeper understanding of the conflicts of the 20th century and how we can apply BoP, and our historical lessons learned, in order to forecast where we're going.",
    "Structural realist theory as applied to WWI, WWII, the Cold War, the Post-Cold War, the rise of China, etc. This course gives you a valuable set of skills to analyze international politics.",
    "I developed a general idea of world politics and how the balance of power can influence the way in which certain actions are taken by states. Based on how states view the balance of power and act on it, can determine whether these countries are able to make peaceful concessions or get into a great war.",
    "Knowledge about the concept of the Balance of Power and what can be causes why States don't just co-exist peacefully in our world. Nuclear weapons and their reasonings, many different schools of thoughts about topics related to the Balance of Power. Skills of writing thoughtful response papers and finding tangible arguments to criticize from readings.",
    "I learned about: The ways in which everything depends on the intentions of states and how to evaluate their intentions; the tension between peace and influence and; the great difficulty in managing transitions in the balance of power.",
    "I learned how to write effective, short papers. I received a toolkit through which I could view foreign affairs through a very important concept in IR (the balance of power).",
    "I learnt realist, constructivist angles of power dynamics in explaining international politics, discussed very interesting topics in what explains the previous wars",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about balance of power theory that I think will be very useful to me in my further study of IR and just as a citizen of the world.",
    "I gained the ability to critically understand the intricacies of relations between states and to evaluate why states take the actions that they do.",
    "I learned to see the international system in a different light. It was very interesting to learn about how the balance of power has shaped history and look at the role it will play in the future.",
    "Introduction to understanding considerations in international relations.",
    "Criticizing and analyzing important historical writings, understanding and reconciling several ideas and explanations of similar events and phenomena, observing history and politics at a structural, international and state level",
    "I learned better critical reading and concise writing skills.",
    "I gained knowledge about nuclear warfare, the history of world wars, core theories of international relations, and diplomacy.",
    "good intro to international relations, specifically realpolitik",
    "skills to analyze international affairs and current events",
    "Furthered my IR theory knowledge"

   "comments": [
    "The lecture format, readings, assignment papers, and discussions were fantastic. My only recommendation to improve the course would be for the Zoom sessions to be longer. I loved this course!",
    "Strengths: the simultaneous breadth and depth of the analysis of the theoretical and historical elements, the structure\/purpose of the assignments (I felt that being forced to argue against the position of the authors of the readings was quite helpful in truly understanding and processing the material), the perfect balance of lecturing vs seminar discussion. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- High quality lessons \r\n- Dealing with very complex and long issues in a short time  \r\n- Lessons were clear and comprehensive \r\n- Books and other academic material were very interesting and efficient in due to develop a worldwide prospective of global history \r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n- Not a lot of African and South Europe History\r\n- Discussions lessons to short ( 75 minutes are not enough to encourage an interesting discussion)",
    "Given the difficulties of the online format of the course, I felt that the structure of the course was generally pretty good however, sometimes the discussion would end up being between only certain students in the class and\/or would end up following a Q&A format.",
    "High level of expertise and engagement of the instructor, many interesting insights and laid out the theories well. It is a PoliSci class, so it has a very theoretical character at times. The advantage of the course is that many different people with different backgrounds contribute their perspectives, from which you can learn a lot.",
    "The course was originally formatted for an in-person class, but was moved online. However, the work of the professor and TAs to make sure that the course was functioning as best as it could over zoom was noted and the class seemed to operate smoothly.",
    "Strengths: Very knowledgeable and approachable professor. Received very good feedback on weekly response papers. Interesting lectures.\r\nWeaknesses: While the reading was normally fascinating, there were a few days when it was a chore to get through. This may not be the case for someone interested in WWI\/WWII.",
    "Excellent course as introduction to international politics, no weaknesses. Maybe discussion section with TAs and a smaller class size would foster more discussion instead of the Q&A format on class.",
    "The course is set up really well to be done in 5 weeks and Professor Monteiro is a phenomenal professor.\r\nI do think that the essays could have been more clear on what we were meant to be writing on but I think the TFs did a good job explaining where you went wrong on the assignments. \r\nAlso, something I noticed was that the class was almost half female but the discussions seemed very male dominated. I don't know if that was a product of being on Zoom and I think Professor Monteiro did a good job trying to get more people to speak up but it was just something that I noted and thought was important.",
    "It was an excellent course but increasing the use of breakout rooms would be beneficial.",
    "Too much time on military strategy and fighting, could have spent more time on the subjects covered at the end of the course that related more clearly to present issues.",
    "Strengths: facilitated open discussion, engaging and knowledgeable professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the Zoom format of the course did not coincide well with the traditional seminar structure, so it was at times hard to maintain an organized and active stream of communication",
    "Very strong in its format. Allowed for outside learning and class discussion.",
    "Strengths: Great feedback, professor, class discussions, and videos.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
    "Strengths: lectures, assigned readings\r\nWeakness: more discussion"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. This course provides a great understanding of the world since WWI and provides a valuable tool to understanding how power dynamics shape international relations.",
    "Absolutely. This course is very engaging and gives you a great starting point from which to understand and analyze international politics. Professor Monteiro is also an incredible professor in both lecture and seminar format (both were included in this course)",
    "Yes.",
    "This course is a good introduction to international relations and I would recommend this course to anyone who would like to get a better sense of current affairs in the world and understand some of the framework behind persisting international conflicts.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in political Science. As an intro course to political science or international relations, it may not be broad enough and I personally found myself feeling a little unprepared dealing with the many deep theories that all applied to this one narrow topic of the balance of power. The course gives you very useful knowledge about the world though, so I would recommend it to anyone with any major.",
    "Yes, the professor and TAs were al very knowledgable\/helpful and the engagement of the other students throughout the course created a conducive learning environment.",
    "Students interested in international relations\/foreign policy or taking a serious Political Science course should consider taking Balance of Power. Professor Monteiro is brilliant, kind, and interesting. The TAs were fantastic as well (TAs will likely change in the future, but I imagine Monteiro will always have good TAs).",
    "Definitely! Nuno is a fabulous professor, and this class is always fascinating whether you'd like to pursue more studies in intl politics or not.",
    "Yes! I am a PLSC major and I think this was a great class if you're in the major. It was very interesting both with past events and with potential outcomes for the future of the international community.",
    "Of course, I think it is important for students -- regardless of their intended major -- to take this class as it gives students the ability to critically understand how and why the world functions the way it does.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in the ways that history plays out and how political decisions are made. This course heavily exercises your analysis skills, which makes you a better thinker and learner.",
    "Yes. Very good overview and introduction to world  politics.",
    "I would because it is challenging, useful, and enjoyable.",
    "yes",
    "Yes"
