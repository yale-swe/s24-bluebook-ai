    "Strengths: It's pretty interesting, easy workload, and a great way to get HU credit. Professor is very knowledgeable about Ableton and you can learn a lot if you pay attention\r\nWeakness: kinda boring sometimes",
    "Strengths:\r\n-good introduction of ableton\/working with edm\r\n-not too fast for beginners\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-Too much time spent on history, should have more engagement with actually making EDM\r\n-projects given did not actually teach us how to make EDM from scratch (I understand this is difficult to do during the summer, but maybe students can create only a small section of a song)",
    "Lots of practical and fun learning. Discussion sections could have been more different from lectures.",
    "Well-paced, helpful to students that are not as familiar to music"

    "Yes!",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course--the workload is low and you do get a chance to get your feet wet. It's not fully immersive, and you don't learn how to produce EDM from scratch, but it teaches you the building blocks of Ableton Live in case you are interested in producing EDM.",
    "Yes! Lots of fun in a low-stress environment.",
    "YES!!!!!",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! It was very interesting! I had moments in which I would be scared of homework before even reading the assignment because of a lack of background but then I realized they were doable due to Dr.A's incredible job in teaching us!"
