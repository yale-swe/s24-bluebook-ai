   "comments": [
    "Basic painting ability",
    "I cannot emphasize how important this course was to my growth as a person. Yes, I learned how to paint, and I feel pretty good about that, but more than that, I learned to think differently about my body's ability to produce art and to think more broadly.",
    "You have a lot of freedom to paint with guidance of Molly and the TA its great.",
    "This course was mostly about mental exploration than technical skills.",
    "This class will teach you (as is advertised) the basics of painting [in oil]. But more importantly, you learn to see and interpret the world around you. I also personally learned to embrace my hand and begin to form a style of composition.",
    "This course is an introduction to figure ground, and different varieties of strokes. It is also an introduction to the vocabulary necessary to talk about painting and art in general.",
    "I developed a lot of confidence in myself as an artist and began to understand that there is no one way to paint or create a piece. I learned many basic painting techniques and also learned how to value the process of painting more with our master copy assignment.",
    "I learned how to see the world in a new way because of the way that this class encouraged me to paint.",
    "I developed a deeper way of thinking about an artwork's composition, color palette, and more.",
    "Gained an underdtanding of how to use oil paints",
    "I learned more than how to paint; I learned about how to be a person.",
    "I learned how to stretch canvas, participate in a critique, be critiqued, paint from life, and how to learn\/collaborate with other artists in the class, and how to use master artists to inspire my art.",
    "Patience! Some basic painting knowledge."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is very unorganized, so if youve never painted before, theres no structured introduction to materials and techniques.",
    "A strength is creative freedom if you want it. A weakness can also be the amount of freedom if you like structure. You really have so much time to do whatever art you want, especially towards the end, so you need to have image focus and drive.",
    "strength: freedom to explore\r\nweakness: teacher to student interaction",
    "Molly explained in the first week that her teaching style gave students lots of freedom to explore what their own process would be and provide us instruction about the basic processes of making canvases etc... This class is great for students who like this kind of freedom of exploration, but perhaps if you wish to learn exactly how to very specific techniques and learn through repetition another section may better suit you.",
    "A strength is that Molly gets to know everyone and their unique ways of making art. Also, the schedule she created was very thorough and allowed us to know what was expected of us with clarity. This isn't really a weakness per se, but I wish that we'd transitioned to making our own pieces and not following assignments earlier, but that might be because we pushed our first crit back a bit.",
    "Strengths: freedom and flexibility for students artwork. Really encourages students to find their own style. \r\nWeaknesses: a lot of structure at the beginning, but that was helpful in some ways",
    "A strength of this course was definitely receiving feedback during the critiques. It was interesting to hear what my compositions evoked for viewers. During critiques, the work of my peers also encouraged me to consider new concepts such as the electricity of color and speed. A weakness of the course, however, was the lack of clarity regarding assignments.",
    "This was the perfect painting course in my eyes: a one-of-a-kind, inspiring instructor and ample free space to explore the medium for yourself.",
    "Strengths were that we were given freedom, especially in the second half of the term, to pursue subjects that we were interested in and have our own spaces to make art. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses were that the syllabus didn't make it clear what the expectations were for the course. In the beginning, I had the impression I was under the impression that I was under strict deadlines to do many specific projects, but as the course progressed I learned that it was more flexible than it originally appeared, which I like with art. It would have been beneficial to not have been under false impressions. Additionally, it would have been helpful to have days be more structured. There were a couple days that we went outside to draw that were not planned very well, and felt like a waste of time.",
    "Strengths: fun course\r\nWeaknesses: I don't feel like I learned anything from being in the class that I could not have taught myself, which was disappointing. I also felt like there was not a very high standard set, everyone was always late, disorganized, etc., and this never seemed to be a problem."

   "comments": [
    "This course wont teach you how to paint or how to use the materials, but it will give you room to experiment and try it out, so it depends on what youre looking for.",
    "YES A MILLION TIMES!",
    "I would if you are motivated to push yourself to make your own art. This isnt for people who need a lot of guidance or will not have ideas of what they want to paint.",
    "Yes but only if this student is willing to be creative without much guidance.",
    "Yes! Take this class if you get the chance. You will so many visual thinking skills, meet great people, and learn to listen to your body.",
    "This class is great for students who like this kind of freedom of exploration, but perhaps if you wish to learn exactly how to very specific techniques and learn through repetition another section may better suit you.",
    "Yes! Although I already had experience with painting, I love that this class was open to everyone whether you had experience or not. I loved working alongside people who were advanced or not as much advanced as I am with painting and seeing different ways to make art. This was also very much a no pressure environment so there was no such thing as \"bad art\" per se. Crits were also really nice. Honestly, if you don't think you need or want an art class, you do, and this is a great place to start. With other classes often being really stressful for various reasons, this class was actually fun and gave my mind something relaxing to look forward to every week.",
    "Yes. It was welcoming to people of all skill levels and encouraged growth to all people who took the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it can function as both a creative and therapeutic outlet that also allows for meaningful introspection.",
    "YES: you must take this course with Molly. It will change your life.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially if the other student had experience making art prior. Since much of this class facilitates learning through process and trial and error, it is most beneficial to students with foundations in painting first.",
    "If you are passionate about painting or simply need an outlet to paint, take the class! If you are genuinely hoping to learn painting skills like \"how to paint ......\" this is not a good class for that."
