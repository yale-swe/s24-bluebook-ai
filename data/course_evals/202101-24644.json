                "I learned a ton about the American South and also got better at managing and digesting long reading assignments. Informal class presentations included some historiography, and I learned of some good archival collections.",
                "A deeper understanding of the craft of writing history was the most novel skill I took from this course.",
                "I learned a lot about History as a discipline of study. We read a lot of primary and secondary sources and practiced looking critically at them.",
                "First, I learned a lot about southern history. We read about (among other things) slavery immediately before and during the Revolutionary War, American expansion and Native dispossession in what is now the Deep South, enslaved Black womens resistance during slavery, secession in Virginia, politics in the Confederacy (particularly womens politics), Reconstruction and Redemption, reformism in the South during the Progressive Era and the rise of the New South, Black organizing in early twentieth-century Florida, communism and the early civil rights movement, segregation and violence, the civil rights movement and backlash in Mississippi, and twentieth-century Miami. It was really great that a lot of the readings engaged with topics, ideas, or perspectives that are often left out of mainstream discussions of each of the time periods that we looked at. It would be impossible to give a comprehensive survey of southern history in a single semester, so I appreciated that this class didn't attempt to do that. Instead, it focused on teaching us all something new by going beyond what you might expect.\r\n\r\nSecond, this class helped me learn how to critique academic books. It was structured so that we read a book (or excerpts from 2-3 books) and a journal article and/or primary source every week, and we always spent part of our class talking about the books as works of narrative writing and historical scholarship. This was super helpful because it gave us a sense of some of the current themes in southern historiography while also allowing us to discuss sources, narrative, perspective, what the authors chose to include/exclude, and other considerations that go into historical research and writing. This all helped me think more carefully about the ways in which historians' decisions about how to write up their research impact the analyses that they produce and present to the world as scholars.\r\n\r\nThis course also helped drive home for me that the South has always been an extremely dynamic place with vibrant and persistent traditions of resistance to oppressive rule. From our readings, it felt like there was has never been a period of southern history when that resistance died out. In addition, this class helped me think about the centrality of violence in so much of southern (and American) history. These feel like important insights to me, and I'm really glad that this class gave me the chance to discuss them with other students throughout the semester.",
                "I learned a lot about different parts of the South and the different aspects of Souther practices and culture throughout the couple centuries. This ranges from slavery, to Jim crow Practices, to getting more into the post 1960s era.",
                "Analyzing different areas and cultures of the American South, connecting themes across time periods from 1776 to the present, studying primary sources and including them in our writing",
                "New ways of thinking about how to write, research, and frame history, a new understanding of the South's role in the construction of American capitalism and conservatism",
                "Understanding of the south and how to view the south in history. Gain a strong foundation of southern history texts.",
                "The course gave an expansive overview of southern history. Southern history is often overlooked at Yale, so it was a great space to meet other students interested in the area. Given that the course covered over two centuries, Professor Shinn selected readings that highlighted the intricacies and complexities of the American south.",
                "Learned a lot more about the South's shameful history in this course than I ever did attending public school in the South. Learned about how slavery was indirectly written into the Constitution, how Black Southerners traced their organizing tradition to slaves' everyday resistance, and how racial inequities post-Jim Crow came to be."

                "I loved this course and Professor Shinn! Discussions were personal and interesting and really felt like they were guided by student engagement. The syllabus was great - a real diversity of places and methodologies. Definitely one of my favorite Yale classes. Reading load was every but not crazily so, and I feel like I got a lot out of even the readings I didn't finish.",
                "So many strengths! First, James Shinn was a huge strength. He did a fantastic job of choosing readings that exposed us to many different ways of writing and researching history, as well as different ways of interpreting various themes in southern history (such as regional variation, what counts as politics, violence, race and class as categories of analysis). He always did a great job guiding our class discussions, and I thought that he struck a good balance between students speaking and him providing additional context or interpretation when helpful. James is clearly someone who's very invested in teaching, and he was very thoughtful about trying to make this class as useful for us as possible; the writing assignments were adaptable to our own research interests within southern history, and he held weekly drop-in office hours where we could come by to talk about the readings or to talk through any of our assignments. I always thought that his feedback on my work was helpful and showed that he was interested in my writing. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I think that the course content was another great strength of this course. Southern history is super interesting, and the readings were engaging and always provided great material for class discussions. (I didnt like the Natalie Ring book that we read quite as much, but that's like one of out of fifteen books that we read at least part of.)\r\n\r\nThis is always up in the air, of course, but I also thought that the students in this class and our class dynamic were big strengths! People seemed really engaged in this class and always had really interesting stuff to say. I had fun with this class and looked forward to it every week!\r\n\r\nHonestly not sure of any weaknesses. The material was super interesting, we had great class discussions, the instructor was a fantastic teacher and accessibleall great things to look for in a seminar! I suppose that some weeks were geographically focused (i.e., we did a deep dive into secession in Virginia and we talked about the civil rights movement and backlash in Mississippi specifically), so that could be a strength or a weakness depending on your perspective. I thought this case study approach worked well for a seminar, but I could understand it leaving people wanting to learn more about other states. That may not necessarily be a bad thing, though!",
                "I thought Professor Shinn really has a strong grasp of Southern culture that helps drive the class along. His office hours are always helpful and he is very nice. All the readings were very interesting, however they are very long. I do think some less reading would be beneficial because sometimes there would be too much reading and people don't finish the readings and that sometimes is reflected in discussions being a little slow.",
                "Strengths: great professor, wide variety of Southern history, access to interesting primary resources\r\nWeaknesses: HEAVY reading load that can be a lot sometimes",
                "The best history class I've taken at Yale.",
                "The material is very interesting and Prof. Shinn is great at leading discussion. The readings were quite long and often discouraging because I knew I would not be able to finish. It might be helpful to have required chapters and then optional additional reading so that we know what discussion will focus on and can feel prepared while also having the option to go deeper.",
                "The course covered a lot of topics, geographic areas, and time periods; it was essentially a survey course. It would be useful if Yale offered more courses on the American south so that students can hone in on more specific topics, geographic areas, and time periods. This course definitely showed that the South is not a monolith, and I would've appreciated a semester just to focus on a handful of issues (like the history of contested voting rights in the south, the Appalachian region, Black leaders in the South since reconstruction, etc)",
                "Strengths: Nice professor and interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: TOO MUCH READING"

We were still able to have engaging class discussions, and the Zoom format also meant that James could easily show us maps or online resources for finding primary sources during some of our classes. James also held weekly office hours over Zoom, and that went well. In addition, James was good about providing extensions during especially stressful periods of the semester and about being flexible in order to make sure that we were getting what we needed out of the class.

                "Definitely!!! I took this as a second-semester senior, and now looking back on it all, I would say that this was one of my favorite classes at Yale. I learned a lot from the readings, the instructor, and my fellow students in the course, and I always thought that the material that we were talking about was interesting and important for people who are invested in understanding U.S. history. In particular, I thought this was an incredibly useful seminar for me as someone whos interested in History as an academic field and hoping to go to grad school. We talked a lot about different approaches to researching and writing history, and James gave us exposure to many contrasting examples through the readings that he assigned for the course. The writing assignments were also manageable and adaptable to our interests. We had a short primary source analysis, a short response paper to one weeks readings (you could pick which week to do out of the first six), and then a 15-20-page final paper. For the final paper, we could pick any topic that we wanted within southern history and James was super accessible if we wanted to talk through our ideas, outlines, or drafts. Overall, this was a really well-organized class with great content and people, and one of my favorites at Yale. I had a lot of fun with it, so I think that other students interested in southern history or interested in understanding American history more deeply would enjoy it too!  \r\n\r\nJust to say it one more time, James was a great instructor! Based on this class, Id recommend taking anything that he teaches. It was clear that he put a lot of thought into the way that he designed the course, and I think all of that paid off throughout the semester. Its always great to have a kind instructor who cares about students learning and offers useful feedback, and James was all of those things.",
                "Yes, its a really interesting course that teaches you alot about the South. If you live somewhere in the South, I especially recommend this course because it also gives you the opportunity to explore your home either with the final essay or one of the books we read, which is really interesting.",
                "YES I would!! Professor Shinn is an amazing professor who is always willing to help and a joy to have in class. The course covers everything from more traditional events like the Civil War, but also more niche topics such as the U.S.-Mexico border and Jim Crow in Miami. I think the topics were really interesting, but I do think there could be other histories that could have been included. We did not discuss much of the Indigenous history of the South and how those cultures heavily impacted Southern culture. I would have liked looking more into cases like Cherokee Nation v. Georgia or Gong Lum v. Rice to refute the misconception of the white/black binary in the South. More Asian, Indigenous, and Latine history would improve this course a lot, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.",
                "Yes. It will fundamentally change how you think about the field of history.",
                "Yes. Prof. Shinn really cares about this topic and the course will change your perspective on the South. Prof. Shinn made every effort to help us learn even in a remote environment.",
                "Yes; the South is often treated as a monolith in national discussions on race and politics, but this course presents a different narrative",
                "Yes, especially if you have a vested interest in the South. HOWEVER, BEWARE OF THE READING LOAD. Professor Shinn is nice and all, but he assigns SO MUCH READING, Like a whole book + a couple articles and primary sources EVERY WEEK. It's a lot."
