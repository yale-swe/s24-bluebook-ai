                "I certainly learned how to write with speed and to cut down on perfectionism.",
                "I know a good bit about political science, mostly in the American context, but most of my knowledge is very quantitative (e.g., I can cite a bunch of survey data almost from memory). H&P really pushed me to try and think about political theory through a less quantitative and more vibes-based (for lack of a better term) lens.",
                "I learned to analyze, clearly write about and discuss dense texts. I gained insight into different historical patterns and methods through our readings and discussions.",
                "I learned how to analyze and synthesize different accounts of history. There are distinct methods of storytelling and objectivity is never perfect, so it was interesting to investigate how different authors approach retelling events with their own style and biases. Im much more knowledgeable about the rise and fall of Rome now and the contributing factors to its success.",
                "Reading deeply in the historians surveyed in DS makes one question the very nature of history, and makes one appreciate different sorts of historical inquiry. Reading deeply in the political thinkers makes one realize how many ancient ideas concerning political organization are just as potent now as when they were composed. Writing multiple papers, with comments received on each, helps the student strengthen their close-reading skills, as well as their ability to form interesting questions and to write logically and lucidly.",
                "I think this course really helps you to think about history in a cumulative way--how thinkers have built off and differed from each other and what we can extract from this for our lives. For someone who didn't have a very rigorous education on ancient Greek and Roman history, it also provided a good foundation there for more detailed exploration.",
                "H&P is the least focused DS course, but in the best way possible! I was fascinated by the many, multifaceted applications and connections that I was able to find.",
                "I gained knowledge about some ancient history, different methods of portraying history (ie. myth-based, fact-based, great men), and early political theories. I improved my writing, my ability to draw connections between texts (and to other classes), and the skill of speaking articulately on the spot.",
                "The ability to analyze complex historical situations and recordings. To compare different authors and understand their respective biases, implications, and styles of approach to political thought. To discuss a variety of viewpoints with others in a group setting.",
                "This semester Ive acquired a greater familiarly with a few foundational texts and thinkers. Some were more history oriented and dealt primarily with the questions of how to narrate history (empiricism vs storytelling and mythologizing vs moralizing) and what its lessons are. Others focused more heavily on political science - what is the goal of human life? How can society be constructed in a way that ensures happiness? How to achieve long term stability through the right form of government and ruler? We tracked the development of ideas from the Greek era into the Roman era, then the Middle Ages and saw how they could be reconciled with rationalist religious frameworks. The same forms of governments and early seeds of social contract theory will remain relevant as we will explore their evolution in the modern era.\r\n \r\nSkills - internalizing a lot of material on short timelines in the realms of history and poli-sci; comparative analysis; discussion of texts in a seminar setting; group-work; writing skills."

            "comments": [
                "Professor Freedman is fantastic and really cares about teaching. The material, however, was somewhat dry, especially at the beginning of the semester.",
                "I don't really have any suggestions here, I think it was a wonderful course as is.",
                "Strengths: wonderful professor, very engaging discussions in a great and collaborative environment \r\nWeaknesses: the pace and volume of reading, but this is an inevitable part of DS",
                "The course covers too much material in too little time. The readings are long and dense, which makes them difficult to get through at times. It is almost impossible to complete all of them on top of the other readings for Directed Studies, and since these are the longest, I found that with my peers they were the ones that most often fell to the wayside. This is a shame because the material is extremely interesting, but we couldnt dive very deeply into the texts because we had to move on to the next quite rapidly. \r\n\r\nThere should be more clarity as to what constitutes a good H&P paper. Though it does vary by professor, examples successful essays would be very useful to have on hand. This would help de-mystify the style of writing that is necessary for a good paper and clarify the kind of shift in approach needed from writing high school-style essays.",
                "Some of the readings--Clouds, for instance--seemed a bit disconnected from the others. But on the whole, the course is marvelous. You'll read historical (Herodotus, Livy, Tacitus) and political (Plato, Aristotle) thought, both of which are wonderful and decidedly interconnected. You'll meet fascinating students, encounter fascinating ideas, and make fascinating discoveries, both about the texts you read and also about yourself.",
                "I think the main strength of this course is how you grow to appreciate the connections between ancient texts and how those relate to the modern world. There aren't any glaring weaknesses, but I think students sometimes struggled to retain the big ideas and events from the readings afterwards, and it might be good if the instructors could provide more supplementary materials to this effect, like summaries or themes that could then be compiled for each work. This could also be helped by earlier access to the finals study review documents.",
                "This course is truly interdisciplinary, but this apparent lack of thematic focus can sometimes make the DS reading-load feel extra heavy.",
                "The strengths of this course were the continuity of ideas, the way the texts built upon each other, the quality and engagement of my peers, and the fascinating ideas found in the texts. The weaknesses were the lack of connections to the modern world/politics, the speed with which we covered texts (at the expense of true understanding, at least in my experience), and some readings which I found challenging to the point of complete disengagement.",
                "I think that splitting off into smaller groups was helpful, but if it occurred too often it caused the class to feel a bit more rigid in the topics we were allowed to discuss compared to other DS courses. I enjoyed a closer talk with several of my peers which I think was highly rewarding, but sometimes it felt like it took away from the large group discussion or from discussing several different sections of the text. Perhaps splitting into smaller groups could either be done once a week or possibly on alternating weeks in the future so students can experience the rewards of both formats a little more equally.",
                "DS covers broad swaths of material - that's both its strength (scope) and weakness (depth). The format of both lectures and seminar discussions helps compensate for this.\r\nH&P, by design, focuses on history and poli-sci which means some students may gravitate towards particular texts. But, it also allows students to experience multiple perspectives from each era. Personally, I thought all the texts were interesting, the lectures great and the seminar discussions of my H&P section were a highlight."

                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are highly interested in the subject material and understanding the workings of Rome or exploring Greco-Roman historians theories for the best system of government. Otherwise, the readings can become tedious because they are so lengthy.",
                "Yes--DS is a wonderful survey of many aspects of the Western intellectual tradition; and it inspires such a marvelous sense of community. I met two of my three best friends in DS, and I can't imagine the first semester, both in an intellectual and in a personal sense, without the program.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in a specific vane of social science thought. It provides an excellent, intertextually-related overview of Greek, Roman, and medieval thinkers. However, if you are a STEM person and trying to decide on DS I think it is very important to consider if this is the right program for you. It takes up a lot of space in your course schedule, and I think it takes a lot of fortitude to stick with it if you are worried about other courses you could be taking.",
                "Definitely! DS is hard and at times can feel like a slog but has so far been infinitely rewarding.",
                "Yes - although I often struggled with feeling engaged in this class, I think it does have plenty to share and may be even more interesting to people excited about history.",
                "Yes, it was a great experience to have a seminar with Professor Freedman and be able to hear from him about a wide variety of texts. He also created a very welcoming classroom environment.",
                "Absolutely would! Professor Freedman was nothing short of amazing and DS itself includes incredibly interesting readings that I never would have been exposed to otherwise.",
                "DS is a lot of fun and very rewarding, if its your cup of tea and you're willing to put in the work. Its advantages are the fascinating and foundational ideas and thinkers you are exposed to, the community of peers, invigorating class discussions, access to professors and the reading, writing and analysis skills you hone.\r\nFor H&P - Prof. Freedman is an incredible instructor. He is highly knowledgeable, insightful, kind, witty and masterfully runs a dynamic class. His genuine love for teaching DS is evident and creates a warm class environment. Class discussions center on themes, comparison between the texts and cover the large amounts of reading fairly well. Beyond that, Prof. Freedman is deeply caring about his students and dedicates time also outside office hours to provide feedback to students before and after essays and to chat. That said, he is not an easy grader, and it may feel difficult to anticipate what he looks for in papers. His class was still the highlight of my semester and Id recommend it warmly."
