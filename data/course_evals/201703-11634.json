   "comments": [
    "Basic grammatical structures and introductory vocabulary. Particularly helpful that the teaching was adjusted to the fact that many students are Greek-Americans and do have some informal background in the language.",
    "I developed an understanding of phonetics of modern Greek and insight into Greek culture.",
    "After taking MGRK 110 with Professor Kaliambou, I have learned many new vocabulary words as well the ability to speak greek well at a basic level. It has been very interesting learning about Greek culture which is often incorporated into class.",
    "Conversational level Greek as well as introductory grammar (how to conjugate different verb groups, subjunctive, etc.)",
    "Language and culture were combined in the classroom to create an immersive learning environment that I loved.",
    "I learned the basics of Modern Greek, giving me building blocks on which to expand my knowledge of the language in the upcoming semesters. It was a fantastic introduction to both the culture of Greece and the language itself, which has me very excited for the next levels of the language. I also reinforced several studying habits to keep up with the vocabulary quizzes every week."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the course is well-paced and again well adjusted for students who already have some background. I actually liked the frequent assessments because they forced me to really learn each small unit, rather than gloss over everything. I would like some more emphasis on speaking, maybe with oral exams or individual feedback on pronunciation.",
    "I really loved this course and can only say good things about my classmates and instructor. My only criticism is that I did not like the textbook. (And this is not a criticism of the professor, who is lovely.) I believe in the immersion method, but I think that it's a horrible method for a written textbook. It does not make sense to have all of the exercise instructions from the first chapter be written in Greek. If I could read the instructions in Greek, I wouldn't have to learn Greek! It is baffling. The lack of many tables, grammar explanations, and particularly list of vocabulary in the textbook is appalling. If it were not for a teacher, it would not be possible to do the exercises, as the first introduction to the chapter vocab we get are as answers we are supposed to provide in exercises. Have a list of vocab, THEN have exercises! (What textbook doesn't have lists of vocabulary??) It also made it difficult to study, as there was no one place where we could go to study for quizzes, etc. If a textbook absolutely requires a teacher to be functional, then it is not a good textbook, in my opinion.",
    "Maria, the professor, is amazing but the textbook we use doesnt have lists of vocabulary which makes it harder for me to study.",
    "In the beginning, there is a slight learning curve because some of the students have had no experience while some students are heritage speakers; however, it easily overcome with effort and practice.",
    "Strength is by far Maria being the teacher. She is engaging, knowledgeable, and hilarious. Weaknesses could be that the course can have a pretty slow pace for a heritage speaker in the beginning, but it does pick up in the end.",
    "This course was masterfully taught.",
    "This course was very strong, and I appreciated the opportunities we had in class to discuss relevant topics that weren't necessarily in the original course plan. Allowing these conversations to grow gave me more insight into the nuances of Greek culture. I think that one more cumulative test during the regular year would have helped the general flow of the course."

   "comments": [
    "I would! I think the textbook is well-designed and the pace of the class is not too intense, but not too slow either.",
    "Absolutely. Modern Greek is a fantastic language, and the teacher here is wonderful.",
    "This is an absolutely wonderful course with an even more wonderful professor. Maria is engaged, enthusiastic, and truly committed to all of her students. You'll learn a tremendous amount without feeling the regular drag of most language courses. Maria will spend as much time with you as needed to ensure that you understand all of the material. She is also an incredible professor and mentor to Greek heritage students.\r\n\r\nCould not recommend more highly!",
    "Yes!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Kaliambou  is awesome and you learn a-lot.",
    "YES!!",
    "Absolutely. This course was an amazing learning experience.",
    "I would recommend this course to anybody interested in pursuing a language study outside of the usual norms, or somebody who has a particular interest in Greece."
