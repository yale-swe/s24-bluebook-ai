                "Strengths: Professor Fairdosi is a gem. He is an incredibly gifted teacher, and it is impossible not to leave class each week without completely understanding the issues that were discussed. His ability to communicate complex information in a digestible manner is commendable. He also is great at ensuring a fair workload, and giving feedback. It was impossible to leave class without a smile. Also his ability to facilitate discussion brings out the best in all of his students. The class is structured in a way that forces you to really engage and critically think about the theories that are being discussed, and the workload is manageable. It is impossible to not feel like an expert leaving the class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none, all Yale students should take a class with Professor Fairdosi",
                "Strength: Professor Fairdosi is a huge strength of this course. His lectures at the beginning of the class set up each discussion and provided extra background, clarifying the readings for the week. The questions he raised were thought-provoking, and the class size (only 7 people!) made for a refreshing classroom environment, facilitating learning from each other. Weaknesses: There were no weaknesses."

He's engaging, chooses interesting topics, and makes sure that we are in an environment where nothing is off the table and we were in a safe space.",
                "Yes, it is highly engaging and I came away with a lot more knowledge of the government than I had going in.",
                "100% even non Political science students should take a class with Professor Fairdosi. He is a phenomenal teacher, and the course is designed in a way that forces you to engage and learn so much (without causing burnout). I learned so much about representative democracy, and really saw my thoughts evolve over the semester. Also his ability to facilitate discussion brings out the best in all of his students.",
                "If you can get in and have any interest in participatory democracy, yes!!! It's a great higher level seminarwould especially recommend as a junior or senior.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in a preliminary analysis of participatory forms of democracy. Also, students with a love for United States history will enjoy this course; readings and discussions provide insight into why the United States relies on a representative system for governance and in so doing limits the ability of average citizens to possess political influence."
