                "Synthetic methods covered were very relavent and interesting. However, lectures were often unclear and not well structured.",
                "Strengths: Low workload and Newhouse is an interesting lecturer. Weaknesses: The lack of problem sets and assignments in this class ensured there was a low workload, but I did not learn much as there was no way to practice or internalize the material. Each lecture on a synthetic method covered a breadth of topics, but they were not covered very deeply. We frequently were not provided with examples of how a reaction\/catalyst\/approach could be applied, or reasoning for how to differentiate between different approaches that achieved similar products. Professor Newhouse also lectured as if the material was already understood, rather than providing insight on concepts or explaining them. There was also very little instruction provided for the one assignment in the class (a final presentation).",
                "Strengths: I think this course was taught in a really relaxed manner which made learning less stressful. Tim was a great prof in his ability to explain topics, and I think that there was a good sense of community among classmates. The final presentation was a great exercise in combing through lots of literature articles and present the most important topics.\r\nWeaknesses: There weren't any assignments during the semester, which was good for the workload, but a little harmful to my understanding of what we were learning. I think having the entire grade based upon the final presentation puts a lot of weight and stress on it towards the end.",
                "The course goes over reactions and how they work, I think its tough to make it any better. The course gets the job done.",
                "The course is pretty low-stakes at the moment and emphasizes chemical understanding and intuition. However, it could be improved by incorporating more opportunities for feedback to students (some problem sets or links to outside resources with relevant problems).",
                "Strengths: discussed some useful and interesting reactions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: was relatively disjointed in presentation. Would have been helpful to highlight more guiding principles of method design."

                "The class was interesting. However, I would take this class with Professor Ellman (if it is offered) if you want to comprehensively learn about this topic.",
                "I would recommend this course to students if they've taken the first part of synthetic methods with Jon Ellman. I think that this course was a more relaxed follow-up to the first part of synthetic methods. There were not really any assignments during the semester, which made for a light workload. The final presentation at the end is pretty easy, but you definitely have to put effort into it since it makes up your entire grade in the course. Tim devotes a lecture to NMR which is nice since Yale lacks an NMR course that is applicable for organic chemistry.",
                "Yes, it was a very low stakes course, no homework, just a group presentation at the end. You get a good bit of knowledge out without having to do a lot of outside work.",
                "Yes, I think it is especially helpful for students aiming to join synthesis groups."
