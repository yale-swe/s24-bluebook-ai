                "I learned a lot about the history of Latin American cinema and Latin American activism. There were also many opportunities to work on writing in Spanish.",
                "I learned all about the history of Latin American cinema, how to analyze scenes and technical approaches to movies, what goes into the production of movies, different styles of film such as documentaries, and about wars, genocides, and social issues that have taken place across the past 100 or so years in Latin American history.",
                "An amazing class to learn about Latin American cinema and culture. Course was a little bit disorganized but the instructor was very encouraging and had a lot of connections to other Latin American filmmakers.",
                "Not much",
                "I learned the basics about film techniques and various movements in Latin American cinema.",

                "Spanish culture, comprehension, and listening",
                "I learned new vocabulary for Spanish as it relates to film. I also generally got more experience and practice with the language, while learning about the culture and history of latin American countries.",
                "This class taught me a lot about the world and history of Latin American cinema and taught a lot about Latin American history that is hard to even get in history classes here.",
                "I refined my Spanish writing skills, reaffirmed my appreciation for art as a form of social protest, widened my understanding of Latin American uprisings\/human rights struggles, and noted the power of human emotion (whether in the form of musical expression, a documentary film or a fictional narrative) to prove the power of the collective. I realized nationalism and universal themes are less important than the day-to-day details and realities that a medium like film is able to reveal (and that those small differences connect us more than seemingly all-encompassing themes pretend to)."

            "comments": [
                "The selection of movies is great, and the guest speakers Prof. Tortora brings to the classroom are amazing. However, the students would benefit from a little bit of background information on the country and\/or issue talked about in the movies before watching them.",
                "The biggest weakness of the course was the way the work was spread out. A lot of assignments were thrown at us at the same time, for example we'd have to watch multiple movies in a week, write a reflection on them, a paper about a movie, a presentation, and a discussion post within a week, while other weeks we'd just have to watch a short movie or two. It would've been helpful also to have some feedback earlier in the year, but it was understandable given the circumstances. \r\nThe strength of the course was the huge variety of films we watched and the sheer number of filmmakers we met. I wish it could've been in person.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it encourages consistency in writing and speaking spanish on a daily basis in some capacity, if you spread your work out. The course is really well organized to improve your speaking, writing, listening and overall language abilities through movies, readings and presentations\/class activities. The course might be improved through slightly more feedback with grades, but the practice is consistent enough that you can see marked improvement in language abilities and you don't really need a grade to tell you that.",
                "It has a lot of films to watch which are not always feasible in the timeframe so you sometimes (often) are forced to pick which ones to watch and which one to read about.",
                "Although I think the content of this course was very interesting, the workload was incredibly difficult to keep up with, and as a result I didn't watch many of the films and therefore didn't get a lot out of it. Obviously that was to a certain degree on me, but I do think that the rate of films that we were being asked to keep up with was a little extreme, and it would probably have been a better class overall if we'd had more time to sit with each of them. There also frankly wasn't a lot of practice of spoken Spanish other than the oral presentation (of which each person did one), and I think I would have benefited a lot more from discussion in Spanish.",
                "Strength: incredible speakers, such a good array of course material\r\nWeaknesses: huge amount of film to watch each class, disorganized classss",
                "Strengths were discussion weaknesses were engagement",
                "Strengths of this course was that the workload wasn't too great so it was't very stressful, which allowed us to enjoy the material more. Weaknesses of the course were that there were a lot of movies to watch so at times it was hard to prioritize watching every single one. Also the course itself was at times very disorganized, and the canvas site was hard to navigate to find the things we were supposed to be doing. Their was almost an overload of resources so I didn't know which ones I should be focusing on.",
                "It was all very interesting material that I enjoyed, but maybe sending us into groups to talk more, just to practice Spanish, wouldve been helpful. I felt that the idea of presentations were great though.",
                "Strengths: selection of films, direct interaction\/discussion with phenomenal Latin American filmmakers, professor's passion for the subject\r\nWeaknesses: explanation of assignments, organization, greater class discussion of films themselves could be beneficial to developing our analysis skills in Spanish"

            "comments": [
                "Yes, it was transformative to me. I am much more interested in learning about Latin America now.",
                "I would only recommend it if you have the time and motivation to watch all the movies (30+ during the semester). Without taking the time to do so, the course loses a lot of its value. Otherwise, it was pretty chill.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in film who has never taken a film class, or people interested in really improving their Spanish speaking and listening abilities. I hadn't taken a spanish class in 1.5 years and after this course, my speaking is more fluent than it has ever been. This course is a great option if you are interested in Latin American social \/ political history but don't want to take another \"writing intensive\" course that's grammar focused. This course prioritizes thematic and technical understanding of Latin American cinema, and by virtue of this, you improve a lot in your language abilities along the way and learn so much about Latin American history, both past and up to current day, through films and documentaries. It's basically a film class just taught in Spanish, so you should be interested in analyzing a lot of scenes up close and want to improve your language skills. Not a gut but really rewarding class and Profesora Tortora is really caring, extremely knowledgeable, and helps you improve.",
                "No. I understand that this semester was tough for Professor Tortora but regardless it was very difficult to learn in such an unorganized and not very enthusiastic learning environment. It theoretically is a great class but, at least this semester, didn't facilitate my knowledge of spanish nor films and was sometimes a drag to attend.",
                "I would only recommend this class if the student in question is committed to watching all of the films. I thought that I would be, but it turned out to be a much heavier workload than I was prepared for, and so I ended up not watching most of them and therefore not getting a lot out of the class. It's definitely a situation where you will get out as much as you put in, and putting in effort turned out to be harder than I thought.",
                "If they are very interested in film, maybe. But if not, I think there are other courses that will improve your Spanish more.",
                "Yes!",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course to another student unless they were really interested in latin american film. At times this class was very tedious and to someone who wasn't majoring in spanish or latin american studies it was easy to prioritize my other classes and fall behind on work.",
                "Yes, this is a great course if you want to strengthen your Spanish or learn more about Latin American history and cinema",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It allowed me to appreciate Latin American artists, my Latin American identity and particularly Latin American filmmakers in a profound and sure to be long-lasting way."
