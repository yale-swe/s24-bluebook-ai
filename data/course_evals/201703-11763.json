    "Gained clarity in staging musical theater songs, practice working with actors, and exposure to professionals and opportunity in the musical theater industry.",
    "A greater understanding of how to approach singing a song, what to be mindful of when singing a song, and an increased comfort level of singing in front of other people",
    "Performance theory and practice, knowledge of the history of musical theater, professional theater-making skills.",
    "We discussed musical theatre in general as well as developing our performance skills, ourselves.",

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course is that Annette is very knowledgeable and that you definitely learn a lot about yourself as a performer by the end. Some weaknesses are no set instructions are given, so you kind of have to figure out how to approach a song on your own, which can be difficult. Also, if you don't have a strong background knowledge of music theory some of the readings can be kind of over your head. I also found the readings to be pretty dull overall because they were largely about the history of musicals rather than readings about performance.",
    "This is an incredible course in learning to make theater with one of the greatest professors at Yale. The course provides constant feedback on and development of your skills as a performer, and creates a sense of camaraderie among the students who take it.\r\n\r\nThe only way to improve the course that I can think of (and this is really nitpicking) is maybe to give guests a better sense of what the class looks like\/maybe give the students a better sense of what working with the guest will be like? But this is really nitpicky  this is a wonderful course and every experience attached to it was great.",
    "The course tended to get very long, but Annette is a wonderful teacher, and each student gets so much time to work specifically on their skills and to individualize their learning to themselves.  The course did tend to be a little bit stressful as there was a high amount of work and preparation needed each week."

    "Yes! Put in the work and you'll get lots out. Annette can sometimes seem tough, but she cares deeply about her students and is so committed to helping them learn.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely take this course! Annette is unbelievably good at what she does. If you're at all interested in being a better performer of music or of musical theater, this is the class for you.",
    "The class is stressful, but you will learn so much.  If you are willing to push yourself as a performer, take this course.",
