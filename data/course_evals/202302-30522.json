                "As a student who is interested in topics such as sociology and history, this course did such a wonderful job to keep me engaged in the topic of multiracial. the course made me challenge the concept of race from the beginning, and how fluid the concept actually is. Race is something that can be shaped depending on who has the power. Readings and discussions of Hawaii intrigued me the most, because of the unique society in Hawaii. With such large number of multiracial population, it was interesting to see how different Hawaiians approach race. At the same time, I learned that the idolization of Hawaii as a racial paradise carries a lot of flaws, including how Hawaii became the place of such diverse ethnicities. The main reason is colonization of Hawaii, which can never be ignored.",
                "By taking this course, I developed a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding multiracial identities and their intersections with power, privilege, and racism. Through close readings, discussions, and engagement with diverse perspectives, I honed my critical thinking and sociological analytic skills. The course encouraged me to reflect on my own identity and subjectivity, allowing me to better contextualize my experiences within broader discourses on race and inequality. I gained insights into the challenges multiracial individuals face in navigating social spaces and the role of media and popular culture in shaping perceptions. Overall, this course empowered me to analyze, agitate, and contribute to building a more inclusive and just society.",
                "I have numerous new insights that I got from this class. Most of them are related to interracial identity, blood quantum, one-drop rule, as well as many heartwrenching experiences faced by multiracial people."
