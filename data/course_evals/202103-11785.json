                "Better understanding of the interaction between the Islamic world and the Western European world, especially in regard to literature. Good feedback on writing.",
                "Learned a lot about the Middle Ages I didnt know before. Interesting",
                "I was able to develop various perspectives regarding the Medieval Ages. I was able to apply various religious and cultural perspectives to further understand the context of different literature and historical events.",

                "Knowledge of the medieval period and multiculturalism of the period.",

                "Gained an incredibly expanded understanding of the cultures, arts, literatures, religions, philosophies, and politics of the Middle Ages. Also in the context of how the Middle Ages are relevant to modern discourses.",
                "I learned about medieval literature and medieval cultures from around the world. I learned a lot about crusading and also how medieval ideas have bled into modern day ideas.",
                "Taking this class forced me to really fine tune my writing skills. Coming from a small high school in a poverty stricken area, I was never tasked with writing 8 page papers about an original thought or idea. Knowing how important the assignments were, I had to pull myself together and figure out how to turn my thoughts into a well constructed essay. The skills that Ive developed on my journey of writing these papers can fully be accredited to my need to pass this class.",
                "I learned introductory information about the Middle Ages, largely concerning religion. Most of the history had to do with the Crusades or with women during the Middle Ages. We read excerpts from several major texts during this period."

                "In general the course is pretty good.  It's not vey much work, which is nice but also doesn't force you to engage as hard with the material.  If you do the readings you'll be fine, and they aren't overwhelming.  The course is a cool idea and brings together different perspectives.  If you're a history buff, then much of the factual historical lecture may not be new to you, but the literature probably will be, as will some of the interesting historical narratives woven during lecture.  The midterm and final assignments offer creative options, which is nice and can be a fun way to engage with the material.",
                "The unique texts that I found in this as opposed to other Medieval courses were the Arabic texts, such as 1001 Nights and the background of Saladin. However, I failed to really grasp the \"multicultural\" aspect of the class because all of the texts still centered around the Mediterranean, and the degree of cultural variation studied was almost entirely Islamic vs Christian kingdoms (and an odd divergence into gender?). I found this disappointing because there is such a diversity of traditions within Europe - comparing Nordic scripts to Spanish poetry, for example - that was washed over, not to mention diversity within the Islamic world and the entire Asiatic and African experiences of the middle ages.",
                "Strengths - the Astonishing Women unit and the final lectures based on the movie; weaknesses: could've explored more of the \"multicultural\" perspective. At times, especially in the beginning of the course when we were discussing white supremacy, I felt that medieval studies was on the defensive about its association with right wing supremacist groups - which is fair, but I wished there were more moments where we could look at the \"multicultural\" scholar studying medieval literature too, to question how medieval studies as an academic field is predominantly generated by white European scholars",
                "I think sections could be slightly more structured and it might be interesting to conduct the course in a leminar fashion with a roundtable discussion.",
                "The first half of the course was extremely engaging and cohesive between lectures, the discussion section, and the readings. The second half felt less directed, especially as we moved away from lectures on historical backgrounds and explored non-traditional cultural \"readings\" (songs, artworks, etc.). I wish those non-traditional aspects would have been distributed more equally throughout the semester. The papers and reading responses were helpful in digging deeper into the works we studied.",
                "This course is absolutely amazing in the sense that the instructors truly care about the course and the material covered. Their enthusiasm is apparent as they teach and engage their students. My favorite part of the class was visiting Beinecke Library to see manuscripts.",
                "Its a pretty good class. Theres a lot of reading but the amount is inconsistent week to week which makes it hard to plan out your time.",
                "Strengths: \r\nProfessors: Marcel Elias literally adorable and Ardis Butterfield is a badass. \r\nPolitics: relevant takes on history-present day convergences, but also not being indoctrinating presentism. \r\nSupplemental stuff: great recommendations for supplemental readings without it being overwhelming\r\nTransmission of knowledge, treatment of literature: pretty darn decent. I'm constantly seeking classes\/teachers that will help Make Ideas Real, especially Past Ideas\/Past Realities. It's simple to do, but not easy. One success in this class is the focus on Artifact. E.g., visiting Beinecke and YUAG, and lectures focused with photos etc. Some professors, so knowledgeable about their field, don't really get that sometimes, reading non-contemporary literature is like being dropped into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and being expected to know the coordinates from the water temp. Historical context babyyy. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nI hate digitized readings so much and I just want to have short little readings that I can actually freaking finish. I don't really know why that is so impossible in every English class. Also, lmao, I genuinely thought this was a history department course for several weeks because I'm an idiotso I was sort of confused by all the literary readings for a little bit and then I realized what was up. I think this about every literature class, but: I could've used a timeline and a map for a syllabus, instead of a list. Smartie expert professors need to better realize how little some students know about their field, and just spoon-feed certain foundations of clarity. TIMELINES! MAPS! This is now a rant about syllabi formats. People need visual or pictorial or at least SIMPLE-textual versions of information in order to contextualize something as nebulous as literature. It doesn't solidify into object without this. However, as mentioned, seeing artifacts in the Beinecke is part of that real-ifying of literature.... and they really did a good job in my opinion, I just crave it in syllabus form.",
                "The alternating lecture format was very helpful and engaging.",
                "I enjoyed the level of discussion and commentary we would have during lecture and during section. I also enjoyed the wide array of subjects and sources covered throughout the course. No comments on improvements.",
                "One strength was the syllabus - the readings covered a huge amount of ground, but each week felt grounded in a particular theme. A weakness was that each week did not feel particularly connected to the one before or after.",
                "I thought that having both professors was an incredible advantage to the course. It was great to have access to insight from both of them in lecture, if one professor didn't know the answer to a question then usually the other would know and be able to provide a really thorough and thoughtful answer.",
                "The strengths of this course are that the lectures do a great job of elaborating on the weekly readings and putting them into context. I think it'd be more helpful if some historical context was given before we completed the readings rather than after.",
                "I think that this is a fine introductory course, especially for an English major hoping to fulfill the Medieval period requirement. But it's not very engaging or in depth. Part of the problem is the lecture format, which the professors struggle to make engaging. It's not really the fault of the material, which is pretty interesting, but just sort of a tendency to read straight from the slides. I think there's a reason that very few literature classes are taught in lecture format. Lectures discourage close engagement with the text, and discussion sections are never really fulfilling."

                "Yeah, its cool.",
                "I would not recommend this class to a student who is specifically interested in learning about multiculturalism in the middle ages. The course strives to understand how time and geography and gender shape perspective, and perhaps it does achieve this. However, I think students would be better served investigating the histories of individual cultures, such as a course dedicated to Arabic texts or African texts from the era, rather than this course which attempts to survey and fails to achieve depth in the medieval world.",
                "I think the professors do try really hard to make the Medieval Ages engaging, but it just wasn't it for me. I wish I had more background about the Ottoman empire integrated in the lectures too",
                "Yes. It has a pretty light workload compared to some of the writing credit classes I've heard about, though if you don't enjoy reading there will be a couple tough weeks for you (readings varied from 10 pages to 300, usually around 30-80 pages per week.). The readings and lectures are interesting, though occasionally disconnected.",
                "Yes! I would recommend this course to absolutely any student with really any degree of interest in the Middle Ages. I found that this course really allows you to choose how deeply you want to dive into each topic, and also lets you engage with whatever you personally find interesting!",
                "Sure if they have an interest in the Middle Ages",
                "Yea absolutely! An extremely fascinating and interesting course that truly explores the Middle Ages in depth with unique insights and outstanding professors.",
                "Yes, this is a good way to fill the Middle Ages requirement if youre an English major and non majors seemed to enjoy it too.",
                "Yeah. Depends what they want. I have no idea if this class would be as simple as it was for me if someone was actually doing all the readings and reading responses and stuff like that. For me, this was about absorbing perspective from the lectures, talking to the super-smart awesome professors on occasion, and having a lot of creative freedom and intensity poured into just two assignments: the midterm and final. I basically skipped everything else. If you do the class that way it's fun (but I haven't seen my grade so, lol, it might be kinda bad, I dunno). GO TO THE BEINECKE VISITS AND OTHER SPECIAL THINGIES!!! SO COOL!!!! GO TO THOSE IN EVERY CLASS, ACTUALLY!!!!\r\nThe TAs were chill, professors definitely chill at heart. Maybe someone would find it kinda boring if they're not tryna read Fierabras or middle english or watch that one bad movie. I kinda loved it but not in a consistent way.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, the range of topics we cover are still pertinent today and really opened my eyes to the true nature of intellectual and cultural exchange that occurred during the middle ages.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone looking to 'dip their toes' in Medieval literature, but I would warn them that many people are only taking this to satisfy a requirement for the english major and do not much put effort or enthusiasm into the class.",
                "Yes, definitely a good Medieval credit for the English major. Also could be a really awesome exposure to a writing\/literature course for someone coming from a history perspective.",
                "I would recommend this course. It was really enjoyable, especially in discussion section, to make sense of medieval ideas in a modern way.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student. It is definitely interesting and provides a close analysis of medieval literature. Its extremely interactive and the professors actually want to engage with their students, and thats exactly what students look for in classes. This was an awesome class and I would encourage other students to give it a shot.",
                "I took this course because the Medieval period requirement intimidated me. I didn't have any background at all in Medieval literature and was afraid that my sparse historical knowledge would disadvantage me in a regular seminar. That being said, unless you literally have no knowledge at all of the period and are a first year, I would not recommend this course."
