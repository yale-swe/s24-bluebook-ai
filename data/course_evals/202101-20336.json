However, I will say that this course helped me develop some writing skills, not just in the various essays, but also in the weekly discussion posts that forced me to synthesize the week's material into a short, strong argument. Also, while a minor aspect of the course, I found learning to use the citation software Zotero to be extremely useful.",

I came into the class thinking it would be rather technical and focused on the actual fuel types themselves and politics, but this course examines the importance of sociocultural changes with energy transitions. I've learned about key moments ranging from the dissolution of Standard Oil, to New Deal energy developments, to the rise of water power, to the decline of nuclear energy. I feel able to contribute to contemporary discussions of energy politics, as the concepts we cover such as Jevon's Paradox apply to many other topics of discussion.",

            "comments": [
                "classes were slightly unorganized, with little text on the slides (just images to just follow). classes often moved too quickly, and having the lectures not be recorded did not help studying at all. second half of class mostly focused on oil and renewable energy, but seemed to be repeating the same information/themes over and over again.",
                "I think the strengths of the course are that the syllabus is very well designed, it is a very thorough and comprehensive course, and it really helps teach writing skills and the whole research process. Additionally, this course draws people from a wide variety of backgrounds, making discussions particularly interesting. The only weakness I could see someone stating is the workload: there is a lot of reading, weekly writing, and both a final paper and a final exam. I will say though that none of the reading necessarily felt extraneous, and every piece of it was interesting. But it is something for prospective students to be aware of, particularly those looking for a lighter workload or not used to heavy reading.",
                "Strengths: The content is interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: leminar format, often felt like we would spend a lot of time on one thing and skim or skip over multiple decades",
                "I really liked the research element of the class and how Prof Sabin guided us through completing our own research for the final paper. The readings were also great. I would suggest more structure in the second half of the semester to help students make sense of the complex international relations surrounding the teaching units on oil.",
                "I honestly really enjoyed this course! Classes were just the right length to cover a lot of material, but not be too overwhelming. Although readings were sometimes long, I felt that they all provided meaningful insight into class topics. I found the primary sources we studied in class especially fascinating. Dr. Sabin is a really engaging lecturer, and discussion section was genuinely very fun and added to my engagement with the course. Plus, the guests he invited to class were super interesting!\r\nThe one aspect of this course that was a bit negative was the final -- for most of the semester, we were supposed to have a take-home essay that was a primary source analysis. But, about a week before the final, the professor changed it to a timed Canvas exam with many essays based on class content. This was quite a stressful change, but I'm not sure how relevant it would be when this course is no longer taught online.",
                "Strengths: learned a lot, tons of material to refer to, TFs were great\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes so much work and so much reading that to feel prepared for the course you'd need to be reading hundreds of pages a week.",
                "A lot of people dislike the leminar style but it's one of those things that in the end is better for you. While it might feel like it interrupts the flow of lecture, it forces you to engage with the ideas, and at least for me, that's a strength! Some would say this is the weakness though.",
                "The classes did not feel long enough to get a complete understanding of everything involved and would have greatly benefitted from being 90 minutes long.\r\n\r\nFor what it was, the course crammed a lot of information into 50 minutes and made it easily accessible.",
                "Incredibly thoughtful class construction and highly knowledgeable",
                "Strengths: super interesting, writing exercises helpful, teaching team was great, class and reading materials were all varied and insightful\r\nWeaknesses: not enough writing structure for the final essay (deadlines for pre-draft items weren't super useful)",
                "The break-out rooms gaurenteed a good level of participation and synthesis. I also liked talking to classmates because it made me more likely to raise my hand in lecture. Lecture sometimes ran over a few minutes, but overall the class was really good. I also really liked the sequence of preparation for our final research papers. I was very prepared well in advance.",
                "Strengths include the interesting & informative readings, Prof. Sabin and his amazing TF team, the engaging lecture slideshows, and the American Energy History website. One notable improvement could be recording the lectures and/or making the slideshows available on a lecture-by-lecture basis.",
                "Pretty good class overall, there were a lot of breakout discussions which were nice for discussing concepts together. The content is interesting even if you're not invested in history or energy history. It's also a light WR only like 2 proper essays and weekly reading responses that are participation-based. Prof. Sabin does go through content quickly, but slides are shared before the midterm essay and the final exam.",
                "I think this course was great! I would have loved a bit more of instruction on the process for writing final papers, as I had never written a major paper like this before and felt a like I was flying by the seat of my pants at times.",
                "I loved how this course had breakout rooms.  I thought that it nicely wove in the readings into the lecture through this format.",
                "I liked the fact that we looked at culture, technology, government, and social movements as a whole. I think section discussions could be more reflective of the examination materials."

It definitely helped me feel more comfortable in class and was a good way to get to know the people in my class. However, Professor Sabin often demanded that students turn on their cameras and would cold-call people often. These practices were very stress inducing, and I often was unable to turn on my camera due to my poor wifi connection.",
                "Breakout rooms were good. Thank gooddess for our student tech assistant, though. Without Meggie it would have been a zoom disaster.",

This class isn't overwhelmingly difficult, and I got a lot out of it (historical knowledge, writing/reading skills, perspective on my prospective career in energy).",
                "Work was a bit much. Not only did we have detailed discussion posts every week, but we were also expected to complete several writing assignments  including a beefy final paper  ON TOP OF a final exam. My other classes in the History department have chosen one or the other. The material was very interesting so I'm not too upset by this, though.",
                "I definitely would recommend this course! Certainly not a light workload though. Incredibly interesting.",
                "Absolutely. I can't count the amount of times I've drawn on material from this course in my discussions about sustainability, clean energy politics, government interventions, etc. The professor is amazing and very friendly, and the TF's were among the most passionate I've had so far.",
                "Yes- it's a great writing credit where you'll learn a lot. It's also a great mix of students from different majors and grade levels.",
                "The content of the course is very interesting and if you are a STEM major or just looking for a writing credit this is definitely a good option. I wouldn't say that it is an easy workload. There were definitely some weeks that we had long readings or longer assignments like weeks when we had papers due. But it is still a manageable workload and again the content of the class is super interesting which makes it worth it.",
                "Yes, it's a great way to learn about the history of energy and a lot of interconnected topics. It really gives a sense of how interconnected different aspects of history are.",

                "Absolutely. It's a super interesting class and decent writing practice.",

                "Yes - this course will provide you with useful skills and insight all the while being an engaging and enjoyable experience. Prof. Sabin is great and the TFs were incredible too. The reading materials are very engaging and the coursework is not too difficult. Would especially recommend for those majoring in EVST.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class. It is incredibly well-taught and organized. I got some of the best feedback on my writing ever and learned so much. Highly recommend.",
                "Yeah, it's a pretty good class, I wouldn't say it's a 'WOW' class but a pretty good WR and gives you space for discussion if you have a lecture heavy semester. I also had fun writing the research paper and the TFs are all amazing.",
                "Yes!!! I worked my butt off in the course and it was absolutely worth it because Professor Sabin and all the TAs made sure that we got so much out of this course. I came into this class with absolutely dread, but it surpassed all my expectations. It has been my favorite class at Yale so far, and it has not only changed my perception of energy, but it truly changed how I view America as a nation.",
