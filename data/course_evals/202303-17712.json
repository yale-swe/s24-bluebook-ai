                "The course served as a great introduction to Italian literature. It helps improve your reading and writing in the language with assignments for each class carefully related to the material. As a big fan of Dante's Divine Comedy, the course was really enjoyable as roughly 3 weeks went through his work.",
                "This course was incredibly fascinating. We read a wide range of literature and were able to study and assess it closely. I learned how to analyze texts better and gained a wider appreciation for Italian works.",
                "Improved on Italian reading skills and analysis of literature and literary techniques",
                "I got a broad overview of Italian Literature up to the Renaissance, and learned about how the Italian language itself developed. I also improved my ability to write critically in Italian."

                "Strengths: very good prof in Simona Lorenzini, the class had a real community atmosphere even for the people who didn't do Siena the summer before.  I doubt you can get a much better course in the span of a semester.  The assignment pace was relaxed but enough to ensure we understood the readings and the concepts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it's not a high workload class at all -- I think we could have been assigned more readings honestly, and I think the course should start with Dante to give us more time to get an in-depth treatment of the seminal works.  Kind of feels like a survey class in its current state (which is fine).",
                "The professor is incredible and the content is fun and interesting regardless of whether it lies in a \"major-related\" interest.",
                "The course's format in which students present each week on a topic gives a great opportunity to improve oral skills in the language, connect with your classmates. The general format is very relaxed; I loved the freedom for the final project and the periodical reflections. Moreover, Simona makes sure everyone is involved and is very interested in each student's ideas as an expert in the class' material.",
                "This course is incredible because Simona is the best professor ever. She is such an incredible teacher, human being, and spokesperson. Yale is so incredibly lucky to have her.",
                "Strengths: Simona is a great, enthusiastic professor who really knows her stuff. The material is also really thoughtfully selected (most important and interesting excerpts of western canon works of Italian authors). No glaring weaknesses other than the fact that this stuff is really hard to read in Italian.",
                "The course was a well structured overview of the topic at hand, I would have appreciated if more in class materials were made available on canvas after lessons."

                "Assuming you're an L5 Italian level student yes.  It provides important cultural history along with literary history for those interested in Italy and it's a fun time.  My recommendation would be slightly more qualified for a student who isn't interested in literature itself and is taking it for the \"italian\" -- it is still a rewarding experience but struggling through old italian while trying to glean deeper meanings is a challenge!",
                "Yes I would!",
                "If they're at L5 in Italian, absolutely. Moreover, I always tell people in lower levels of the language to continue to fluency so that they can take classes like this. If you want to experience high-level Italian at Yale, improve your command of the language, and read fascinating texts, I'd 100% consider this course.",
                "Yes!! This course is so fascinating and the classroom setting made it fun and engaging to learn about the texts. Simona is also an incredible professor.",
                "Absolutely. Its a chill L5 Italian course with a great instructor and the course gives you an introduction to some incredibly important works in the western tradition.",
                "Absolutely.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who feels comfortable with Italian in an academically conversational context."
