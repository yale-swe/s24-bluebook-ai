            "comments": [
                "I think that the course does a good job of introducing students to some canonical poetic texts and spending enough time on them to be able to engage more thoroughly than just the service-level. Almost all of the texts are written by white men, so I would have loved to have more diverse texts generally. Our professor did a good job of trying to pair the old texts with modern, more diverse adaptations, but that can only go so far when the foundation is what it is.",
                "Strengths: small number of texts allows for focus and deep-diving on particular authors and poetic forms\r\nWeaknesses: No clear focus for discussion among hundreds of lines of reading each week; when discussion questions were offered, they did not tend to align with student interests such that discussion fizzled and died\r\nStudents seemingly expected to have a detailed knowledge of poetic genre conventions and devices if not historical knowledge of the context/symbols involved. This class is intended as an introduction to poetics, but we were not given the tools necessary to learn those forms.",
                "I like the structure of the course (Chaucer Shakespeare Milton)\r\nI liked Professor Elias' additions (e.g., some modern adaptations, some other works like the Sultan of Babylon)",
                "I think I learnt lots of important things over this course, however sometimes found the concepts being discussed a little overwhelming. I would have appreciated more opportunity to delve deeper into individual moments.",
                "I think this was a very well done course, but I wish Professor Elias's explanations of the cultural background of the texts had visual backdrops as it was very hard to follow just him talking along with some textual pages. Also I think some of the leading questions he posed each class were a little too complex and when the graduate students came to teach I found myself digesting the text much more wholly.",
                "I would caution anyone who lacks prior knowledge of English poetry to take this class. Despite being a foundational course, it is not introductory and will not guide you through the material very accessibly. It is a great selection of course materials, though."

            "comments": [
                "Of the foundational courses, I do think that this one is a bit weaker. I would be much more interested in a course that had more of a diverse authorship, as I do know that there are many works from that time by women and authors of color. This is again no fault of the professor, but considering it is a lot of reading and very writing intensive it does make it harder to engage when the works aren't as engaging and tend to have the same themes of love, religion, and misogyny that can be a lot to read over and over again.",
                "No, I would not recommend this course as it stands. The origins of 125 as a \"necessary\" course on canonical poets does not gel with the goals of modern English majors, especially as an introductory course where we are looking for a skill-based course to develop analytical and writing techniques which we can carry into more specific topic seminars later in the major. On the specific level of this section, the class did not set out with clear goals or expectations, such that while students may have completed all of the readings and exercises, we did not know how to engage with the text at the level/on the topics that the instructor wished us to, resulting in dissonance and disengagement during class discussions.",
                "Yes, depending on the teacher. I think Professor Elias made what could have been a boring compulsory course challenging and interesting.",
                "I would for those pursuing an English major or extremely interested in the texts and close reading",
                "Yes, I think it was strongly challenging.",
                "I would not unless you are an English major trying to concentrate in these particular materials. It was otherwise just too challenging to read the materials, learn to digest and dissect them, and then create a compelling argument in an essay."
