                "Professor M is a gem and the class was engaged in the texts which made the discussions vibrant. This class has a lot of reading and writing for a foundational requirement, but the content was one of my favorites.",
                "The syllabus for this class is really strong and Professor Mukhopadhyay is very smart and very thoughtful when it comes to engagement with each of the texts. A simultaneous strength and weakness of the course is that the Professor always has a strict agenda for discussion! For most of the semester, I found this served us well because the Professor anticipated the most urgent parts of the text very keenly and often took cues from reading responses (due before class). A small portion of the time it felt a bit forced and that some organic discussion prompted by students directly would have been more fufilling. One thing to consider with this course, though I did love it very much, is that no theoretical or historical work/piece of literature is included in the beginning of the syllabus that works to ground the class in a common understanding of colonialism. So as the text we read traverse different colonial histories across the British empire, discussions and discussion posts sprout from individual understandings and exposures to what empire is and how it functioned.",
                "This was a super engaging class. I felt like class discussions were always focused, productive and well structured. My peers were all very insightful and seemed to care about the material. Additionally, most of the texts we read were engaging and enjoyable reads, and contributed to my broader understanding of postcolonial literature. One thing to note is that the class does move very quickly, so it felt like we wouldn't get to touch on everything that could have been discussed with each text.",
                "Professor Mukhopadhyay really does care. She's funny and insightful. She's the strength. Her insights and syllabus are awesome. No weaknesses,,, just take.",
                "All the texts are great. Prof is great. The class environment could be greatly improved. It may have just been because we had a large class size, but there were 3-4 people who dominated the conversation, leaving little room for other people to jump in and share their own ideas. Also, more time to learn about each other, even just doing names a few more times after the last class could have created a more comfortable climate in the classroom.",
                "Strengths: very discussion and collaboration based, open to wide perspectives and ideas, diverse reading list (both by region and genre!)\r\nWeaknesses: at times it felt like we never built on peoples points before moving on to the next",
                "Our professor was so engaging, welcoming, and led discussions super well!! She strikes the perfect balance between letting us discuss the text among ourselves and guiding us towards more complex ideas / things we hadn't touched on yet. I felt like I came away from every seminar with a strong grasp of the main ideas of the books we discussed, how different texts related to each other in the realm of postcolonial literature, and a lot of finer, more interesting details in the text. There are no weaknesses.",
                "No weaknesses! This was the best English class I have taken at Yale and I would take it again and again if I could :)"

                "Yes, specifically with Prof. Mukhopadhyay. her specific syllabus is amazing and she's such an excellent prof who really knows how to engage everyone in a seminar and facilitate a rich discussion",
                "Yes! English majors take this as a foundational, especially with Professor M! She truly cares about her students and I learned so much in this class about archives and how to talk about post-colonial literature. It might be more work and reading heavy than the others, but the content was so worth it if taught by a great professor!",
                "I would definitely recommend! Expanding understandings of English literature to include the former colonies of the British empire and the mechanisms of language (both as colonial hegemony and discursive liberation) is really important and the text included in the syllabus made that task fun. I think this course is disruptive to the English major and how the major has historically been so I also recommend this especially for English majors looking to fulfill foundational credits.",
                "Yes! It is a really engaging, interesting and enjoyable. The pieces of postcolonial literature we read were genuinely meaningful to my overall learning, and class discussions and papers provide a great opportunity for strengthening your analytical skills. Professor Mukhopadhyay is excellent. She is kind and genuinely cares about the course and the students. She facilitates class discussions very successfully and makes the overall experience very intellectually rigorous.",
                "Yes. Not my favorite class, but definitely broadened my worldview in a beneficial way.",
                "Yes! Great way to widen your perspective and read things you may never have considered. Learned a lot about the world both from the books and the archive.",
                "100% YES. It is so worthwhile. You'll learn so much about postcolonial literature under Prof Mukhopadhyay's wonderful guidance, and you'll meet so many cool people with similar interests. The English major is so centered on the Western canon but it's so important to read and write about English literature in non-Western areas.",
