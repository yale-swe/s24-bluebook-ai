                "I learned so much about interesting social and political phenomena in Japan, particularly in a comparison to other developed nations. I also became familliar with a lot of research methods used in political science and became better at reading research in the field.",
                "This course was a great introductory survey of Japanese politics and society. I learnt to build a foundation about Japan's political system and pressing social questions. I also found the final paper and colloquium to be very helpful to better my academic writing.",
                "I gained a better understanding of how to view both politics and society but other topics.",
                "I learned to look at Japanese politics and society critically.",
                "I learned the basics of Japanese politics, contemporary social issues, some modern history, and relevant themes in Japanese culture. I also learned how to read academic articles and create my own Political Science research paper.",
                "I've learned an incredible amount of information regarding Japan's political system, history, and the complexity of the problems it faces today. Learning about the internal structures of Japan's governing body as well as its relations with zaibatsu, military, citizens, and grassroots organizations opened my eyes to how difficult problem resolution really is and how delicate the balance Japan sustains really is. In addition to general knowledge about the country and its people, I also feel like I have gained considerable insight into how to read papers in a more comprehensive, digestive, and enjoyable manner."

            "comments": [
                "This course was well organized by topic. I think it would be improved by more in-class debate, because for each of the issues we discussed there were multiple interpretations and perspectives offered by scholars in the field and it would have been a good exercise to attempt to defend or refute some of them.",
                "Strengths: \r\ncovers many topics, so everyone will find something that interests them; the discussions allow students to engage at the level that suits them \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nthe discussions were a bit too focused on the specifics of the readings; the readings were oftentimes very specific and could be balanced with readings that would give a bigger picture of that week's topic",
                "This was an incredible course. I wish we had 15 minutes more per class.",
                "Every class was organized and the lectures and readings helped me gain a foundation on the material which was expanded on when we started discussing.",
                "Strengths: Dr. McClean was very knowledgeable about current scholarship on Japan and answered student questions well; the course was well-structured and devoted attention to as many relevant aspects of something as broad as \"Japanese Politics and Society\" as possible; the students were engaged. \r\nWeaknesses: I feel like the academic articles were not a great introduction to some topics, as many presupposed serious knowledge of the concepts discussed, so perhaps a cut-and-dry textbook introduction would have been good as the foundational reading; the discussions sometimes felt stilted, because we were often talking to the professor rather than with each other (again, this felt like the product of our lack of knowledge).",
                "I greatly enjoyed the course and thought the papers we read were great and that class discussion was also productively and smoothly led by Professor McClean. I think what made this course particularly meaningful was that my fellow classmates were incredibly insightful and had lots of related experiences to share during discussions. Without them, I think there is a possibility that the discussions could have felt more stale and just recitations of what the papers said. I liked that our weekly response tasks specifically asked us to not summarize the text but instead critically analyze it instead."

It is great to build a foundational understanding of Japan as it will serve future studies of international/East Asian politics. The professor structured the lead-up to the final paper in the course very well, and the paper is a great opportunity to explore a topic of your choosing in great detail.",
                "I would recommend this course a hundred times over!! Incredible superb!",
                "Very interesting class and the professor is great, would recommend",
                "Yes! This course will teach you a lot about Japanese politics and society. The course is really what you make of itif you want to put in a lot of time and effort, you will learn a lot. It is also a good class to learn more about political science research and what modern political scientists do.",
                "I really liked this course and would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in learning about Japan or digging deep into one country's political, economic, and social spheres from a political scientist's perspective."
