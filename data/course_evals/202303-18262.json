It also revealed a satisfying explanation for how signaling pathways lead to on, off switches in gene expression at the cellular level.",
                "Decent exposure to modeling various dynamic biological systems with differential equations.",
                "This is a course that genuinely built new knowledge from the ground up. I learned to code in Matlab and how to model enzymatic reactions, positive/negative autoregulation, signal cascades, etc. through differential equation. Many of the concepts we learned could also be easily applied towards other concepts relating to the dynamic nature of biology.\r\n\r\nFrom my friend who took the grad class and cannot review this course: Diff eq, Michaelis menten kinetics, mat lab coding, being stressed out",

                "Matlab is a large focus for all of the problem sets and exercises, however, it is not talked about at all in class, only the concepts we apply in Matlab. Even small notes about the interesting syntax in Matlab would be very helpful, rather than relying on the Internet for learning the language.",
                "I really enjoyed doing the paper presentations as it allowed us to directly interact with research relevant to the concepts taught in class. The problem sets were interesting to do but definitely took a long time. The switch in professors teaching the course half-way through the semester changed the format of the questions on the problem sets. Since professor Emonet wrote the final exam, it seemed like none of the material covered in the second half of the semester appeared on the exam.",
                "Strengths: interrstjng/engaging content; good balance of coding and math; wide array of systems covered.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: classes were poorly structured/organized; seemed like we were just listening to each profs stream of consciousness as they raced through various systems without ever properly explaining the assumptions/context/techniques used for each",
                "Strengths: Very interesting material, I liked the format of following papers, notes were very useful to reference. If you have prior CODING experience and are very familiar with calculus, you will really enjoy the content.\r\nWeaknesses: I think the class could have been structured a lot better by focusing LESS on the derivations for equations and MORE on the beauty of these concepts in lecture. It would have been much easier to have the students simply read about the mathematical techniques applied in arriving at the differential equations we learned instead of confusing (and frankly boring) the students through hours of chalkboard writing to derive equations. We already have to practice deriving them anyways in the PSETS, and the lectures are not necessarily more mathematically comprehensive than the notes are. As someone who has a lot of trouble paying attention, I was able to reach the same level of understanding as my classmates, if not more, through simply reading through and writing down the derivations myself. I also found that I was able to enjoy the class more because I was more focused on how the mathematical concepts could be applied in creative ways instead of on the math itself. I strongly recommend putting \"prior coding experience\" as one of the prerequisites or, at the very least, recommendation for students taking this course. The grading system is fine, although I feel like it could be more reliable specifically for students to reference about their paper presentations.\r\n\r\nFrom my friend who took the grad class and cannot review this course: \r\nstrengths: interesting material. gustavo is the absolute best. He was extremely supportive and responsive. \r\nweaknesses: poor execution. No online resources, no textbook, only notes (handwritten by the profs in cryptic handwriting), lack of sufficient prerequisites, ambiguous expectations, inability to keep Canvas organized",
                "strengths: great professors, really enjoyed Professor Emonet's lectures, the material was relevant and exciting, problem sets were great reinforcements of the material, and TA sessions were very helpful",
                "The strengths of the course include emphasis on teaching, discussion sections and examples studied. There were not many weaknesses, but a small one was organization, where the requirements for uploading responses to paper presentations was not very clear. The course was very well taught and covered interesting topics.",
                "Overall, the course is strong. It is well-taught, manageable, relevant, and fun. The course structure is well balanced and all the homework and the exam clearly relate to the material.",
                "Lectures, notes, exercises, and in-class codings were very helpful for preparing for the problem sets in this course. Additionally, the professors and teaching fellows were very accessible for receiving help and feedback. Sometimes it was difficult to follow along when long mathematical derivations would take place on the board, and it would be easy to get lost and lose track of the main concepts that we were trying to learn when this would occur.",
                "I would request the instructors to please record the classes.  The notes the professor would post after the classes were basically scribbles, so it would be impossible to know what happened in the class unless you were present.  Missing just one class would, therefore, make me feel far behind the others, making it harder to understand what is going on in the future classes."

                "Good course if you have a strong background in math, biochemistry, and matlab.",
                "If you are considering a career in computational biology, I strongly suggest this course as a stepping stone towards that goal. While many computational \"data analysis\" classes focus on statistical and empirical data, this course introduces you to combining theory with experimentation. I took this course at the same time as biochemistry (MB&B 300) and the understanding I received from this course elucidated many concepts of enzyme kinetics that biochemistry did not have the depth to teach. \r\n\r\nFrom my friend who took the grad class and cannot review this course: The most disorganized and confusing class I have taken at Yale. I would not have survived with the TAs thank god for Lam and Gustavo especially. The Canvas page was hard to navigate with resources being posted between assignments and a random pages section. The expectation for Matlab programming put people with no programming experience at adisadvantage. The course lists math 115 as the prerequisite but I dont think that the math would come intuitively for those who have no experience in differential equations. There was an initial emphasis on focusing on ideas over derivations, but most of the PSETs and the take home final capitalized on deriving equations. The professors would post notes that were difficult to read and sometimes not even post them. Moreover, because this field is niche, there are no online resources to turn to either. The redeeming quality of this class was the low workload and theTAs. I would not recommend this class for those who dont have a strong computation/programming background. The biochemical aspect of it was fine. Overall, Im glad that I took it because it was really interesting to learn but super inaccessible.",
                "Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in biology. It's a great way to approach familiar/relevant biological problems with a more mathematical lens. You also get to learn some programming skills on MATLAB and get familiar with current science related to the class material.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. The course offers a great introduction to quantitative modeling of biology. It is taught well and the workload is reasonable.",
                "Absolutely! I think this class does well to lay an important foundation that can be useful going forward!"
