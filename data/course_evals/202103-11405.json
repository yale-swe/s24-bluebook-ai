                "A deeper understanding of the contemporary state of German politics, German civil discourse, and current events in Germany.",
                "My German improved significantly, and the class was not too hard. The 9am meeting time was early, but Liese was considerate and always ended on time. Liese came highly prepared to each class with loads of fun activities. I highly recommend taking a class with Liese.",
                "General knowledge about migrant workers, refugees and black individuals in Germany. Lots of media and film\/documentaries used, which was an engaging way to learn the material. Also read a book - had to read a chapter and do an oral for each lesson. Grammar topics alongside the content.",
                "My German vocabulary and grammar improved, as did my awareness of the main contemporary discussions\/issues in German culture. I became more comfortable speaking, reading, writing, and listening to German. I also made friends with whom I hope to speak more with in German, even now that the class is over. It was very exciting to read my first German book!",

                "a strong foundation in writing and speaking German, as well as learning more about modern German issues",

                "It is a fantastic course that offers students the opportunity to immerse themselves in contemporary German culture. I am not aware of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: L5-German class, great professor, low workload \r\nWeakness: 9am",
                "Homework for every lesson was sometimes tedious. Otherwise met my expectations for furthering my knowledge and abilities in German.",
                "This course was wonderful - there was a nice mixture of different kinds of tasks (speaking, reading, writing) spread nicely over the semester, so that I never felt too stressed or overwhelmed, and was consistently excited about improving my German.",
                "I thought the selection of media (movies, book, articles) was both interesting and appropriately challenging. I also liked how there were opportunities to collaborate with peers in the classroom, for example in games or 'small talk', and I thought the creative writing task was a lot of fun. \r\n\r\nAlthough speaking is of course an important part of language learning, I don't think the speaking tasks themselves were very helpful. It felt very unnatural (and almost impossible) to talk fluently without notes for 2 minutes, a task I would probably struggle with in English. Maybe making students answer questions instead of just summarize could help these feel more conversation-like. I also think it might have been useful to reinforce some of the grammar points within homework tasks \/ short quizzes as opposed to solely in the classroom.",
                "It was very heavy on exercise sheets and assigned twice-weekly homework with one day between classes, which I felt was odd for a one-credit post-L5 course.",
                "Strengths: Expectations and instructions were clear, and the class was very organized. Liese is also a very kind professor. \r\nWeaknesses: I felt this course focused too much on the refugee crisis in Germanynot that this itself is a bad thing, but I think the name of the course is a bit misleading. I wish we had been able to talk about more than what felt like only 2 social issues in contemporary Germany: refugees and racism in Germany. I think we could've studied this a bit more from an interdisciplinary lens as well.",
                "I thought it was great that we covered current topics in Germany",
                "Liese is definitely a big plus. Before the semester started I was planning to drop GMAN 152. After the first class I realized that if I attend this class in the mornings then my days would brighten up and I would have a more enjoyable semester. She is always energetic, enthusiastic, friendly, knowledgeable and genuine. Apart from Liese, the material is well-structured. Geflchtet was very relevant and its level of German was adequate -- required effort but didn't kill you. Documentaries + films were also very relevant. Grammar worksheets were carefully made. Students were supportive of each other -- I would say people were focused on learning and collaboration.\r\nOne suggestion: While studying German grammar it is very helpful to have flowcharts. The German department can prepare flowcharts for each grammar topic. For example, for \"Indirekte Rede\", it can include questions like \"who says this?\", \"when is this being said?\", \"is the verb a Modalverb?\". Flowcharts make it more systematic and add a visual aspect that aids the memory. Otherwise it is easy to get lost in a folder of worksheets or in lecture slides. The flowcharts we receive can gradually form an even bigger flowchart.",
                "Focus is very heavy on grammar especially in speaking rather than practical conversation skills and comprehension. Course description is also too vague, just being \"Contemporary Germany\" with focus on major issues."

Although we spent most of our class time reading or discussing, there was still a constant emphasis on grammar and vocabulary. The reading material was manageable and engaging and the activities in lessons were very varied.",
                "Yesnot terribly difficult, but still challenging enough and engaging enough to be fulfilling as part of your schedule.",
                "Yes, this is a very good L5 language course. The class was a natural progression from L4.",
                "Yes! This course helped my German reading and writing a lot",
                "If you are looking for a German course that doesn't feel like a middle school language class where you just follow a book, and you are not incredibly good in German, then this class would be a good fit. Students in this class were not especially good in German, but they were all willing to learn and interested in the material. The work-fun balance in the class was well done. I liked that we read an actual book in German."
