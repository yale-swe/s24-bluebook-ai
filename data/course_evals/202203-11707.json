                "I learned theories of justice, power, and ethics that shaped our society and how gender and sexuality interact with these theories.",
                "I learned about gender, Justice, power, and institutions and the way that each subject matter affects our daily lives.",
                "Understand of many political issues impacting Women, and those in the LGBTQ+ community. You learn a lot about philosophical views on justice and power as well.",
                "My main takeaway from this class was thinking about life in a different way. There were many questions posed in lecture that related to everyday conversations, media, and readings for other classes. It created a new mode of thinking about various populations of people and how society treats them. It was also interesting to think about how even our own thoughts are biased by societal rules and concepts of power.",
                "Learned a lot about gender and sexuality, how society shapes genders and people.",
                "I learned a LOT not just about the content but about how a class should make you feel. I didn't feel stressed at all, I just felt excited to complete the readings and the assignments because the grading system was built to ensure low stress and maximal creative license. I felt like I could learn as much or as little as I wanted and it was up to me to put the work in. I liked this because I got to feel that intrinsic motivation to learn and it was a healthy stress free challenge. Great content, super fun lectures, loved it all around.",
                "Broad overview of topics in gender and power studies-- good intro course",
                "Political philosophies, theories of gender/sexuality, power studies",
                "A larger knowledge of some political philosophy and gender theory",
                "I got a basic overview of the theory of gender, justice, power and institutions and how these theories provide a lens to understand modern events.",
                "The course was highly valuable in terms of learning how to adapt the knowledge we learnt to our surroundings in todays society. We consistently looked at very relevant topics and how to use the tools we learnt in class to analyse these issues.",
                "This was my first WGSS class at Yale. I learned to interpret and intertwine philosophers historical theories with contemporary movements and ideas.",
                "In this course, I gained a wide exposure to a variety of authors who have theorized around the course's titular terms (gender, justice, power, institutions).  This course felt like a WGSS and WGSS-related political theory survey.  I think the most helpful thing I gained from this course was exposure to new authors, theories, and ways of thinking, especially relating to gender and sexuality.",
                "I learned to think critically about the various systems that govern our world. I also gained a critical knowledge on many relevant political issues, and also how to approach them through various lenses to see where the titular terms of the course applied.",
                "I learned to analyze a variety of feminist literature from the lenses of various theorists, Foucault, Marx, etc. I also learned to think critically about systemic inequality and its roots.",
                "Learned so much about feminism, gender, bathrooms, prisons, and more.",
                "I learned how to decipher legal theory and apply it to current political debates.",
                "An insight into the systems of inequality and injustice that shape the structures that make up our world. This is knowledge I will continue to think about in my everyday life and further studies at Yale.",
                "I learned some new philosophical concepts and some new feminist theory.",
                "I enjoyed learning about how threads of gender, justice, and power are woven into institutions, e.g. universities. I've taken a WGSS class before, but this one was particularly illuminating  my favorite topics were political philosophies of justice, intersectionality, and bathrooms.",
                "I developed knowledge and insights into the ways gender, justice, and power interact with various institutions in our society today, as they have throughout history, to give them meaning and impact the lives of people everywhere.",
                "Axises that power operates through, looking at issues from a broader perspective that includes one's identities, theories of justice and modes of thought!",
                "You learn basic movements across feminist and prison legislation. \r\nYou learn basic vocabulary.",
                "I have always been really interested in WGSS, and this course really allowed me to dive into that. I had known of Butler's theory of gender as performative prior to the course, but learned so much more about it, as well as other fundamentals of gender theory. We looked at movements throughout recent years, while also discussing future possibilities (such as different bathroom orientations). I thought our conversation about consent was really valuable, and exploring the intersections between our titular terms (gender, justice, power, institutions) was super interesting. Beyond that, the assignments are all different and don't feel repetitive, which I appreciated.",
                "This class is a great introduction to Gender Studies! I dont recommend it for anyone who isnt a beginner, but it does a really good job of introducing people to the more basic concepts through interesting examples and assignments.",
                "I learned a lot about the different definitions of power and gender",

                "current debates surrounding gender, lots of the fundamental arguments and debates surrounding power/sex/gender/etc along with their philosophical underpinnings, historical context for present",
                "The course is a broad survey of topics in Gender Studies, Ethics, and Politics. We read texts from news articles to dense, philosophical papers. We learned how to apply the concepts we were learning about to practical situations like sporting events and technology developments."

            "comments": [
                "The class was super insightful and covered a large variety of topics. At times it felt that the class was moving a little slowly and I would have preferred to learn more information/ go deeper into certain topics.",
                "Strength include how engaging the professor is, and the assignments are interesting as well. Weaknesses include sections that arent very helpful.",
                "The readings could be dense, too dense at times. I would recommend reducing the amount of readings because of how dense it was. I think also the lectures could be a but aloof, and not very structured.",
                "One of the strengths of this class was how much information was presented in lecture and through readings. You got out of the course what you put in, meaning that the more you paid attention and the more reading you did, the more you learned in general. One of the weaknesses was that a decent amount of class time was put into review instead of covering new topics referring to that day's readings.",
                "The course was taught very well, however too much lecture time was reviewing the previous lecture.",
                "Maybe some more reading responses. I would have loved to dive further into these readings on my own, not just in lecture! Maybe have us ask more questions on the reading or submit short reading responses every few reading assignments. Something not too intense to reduce stress but something that we can also make intense if we want to really dive into the reading.",
                "Interesting lectures and engaging discussion sections",
                "strength- professor fischel and the TFs are so nice and accommodating. they are also so passionate about what were learning. weakness- the lectures are kind of all over the place so its really easy for theories and concepts to go right over your head",
                "Strengths: interesting subjects, well organized, lectures are easy to follow; midterm and final exams were manageable and well structured\r\nImprovements: readings were very philosophy-heavy for a course that was not listed as a philosophy course or that warned of philosophy ahead of time, readings were also occasionally extremely long and abstract/hard to follow",
                "The readings weren't all super relevant to the lectures/they weren't discussed in class or section sometimes.",
                "Lectures were clear and informative. Section was well-planned. Sometimes certain readings were overlooked/not discussed thoroughly when it was hard to understand them.",
                "Strength: Amazing and interesting topics, fun readings, great professor.",
                "Strengths: Emphasis was on learning material and the course material was super interesting and topical.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not too much emphasis on locating overlap between concepts. Topics seemed pretty isolated from one another.",
                "This course touches the surface of a lot of topics but never really dove deeply into any of them.  This is a strength and a weakness, depending on what a student is looking for.  There are not that many assignments (really only one written assignment relating to the course materials).  I wish I had gotten more feedback on my learning throughout the semester and there were more opportunities for critically thinking about the readings instead of just understanding and regurgitating authors' arguments.",
                "Although I appreciate Professor Fischels very understanding and gentle attitude towards the pop quizzes, I think the discussions sections would be enhanced if the pop quizzes were a little tougher, i.e. encouraging people to read closely.",
                "Strengths of this class include the media with which the class engages. The literature was fascinating and invited complex thought and discussion. Also, the discussion sections with Yaprak Yildirim, a Teaching Fellow, significantly boosted my understanding of class material. \r\n\r\nThis course could be improved through more focus on the theorists through which we analyze class material. For example, I entered the class with little understanding of Foucault's work and, as a result, was often confused when we extended his theories into other topics.",
                "Strengths: Great lectures and great teaching fellows, a good variety of source types and content, interesting assignments, cool guest speakers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found the units on the syllabus to be divided kind of weirdly. Rather than approaching each of the titular terms (gender, Justice, power, and institutions) as its own unit, Id recommend approaching them all together before diving into specific topics like bathrooms, incarceration, etc.",
                "No complaints. Amazing structure. Loved the course.",
                "This course has a lot of long, dense readings that are not always applicable to the lectures; however, the content of the actual lectures and discussion sections is easy to follow and has a good amount of depth.",
                "Very interesting and engaging lectures.",
                "Strengths - the content, variation in the type of assessments to make sure students could show their strengths.",
                "This class heavily focuses on learning over memorizing, giving students the opportunity to connect with the information on a different level. This class has sections that relied on current events, which I found very helpful in keeping me invested in the class. If the class focuses on these same events for years to come however, it will likely turn into a weakness.",
                "I really liked the instructor, readings, and assignments.",
                "Strengths  Amazing TFs, challenging material but made accessible through excellent instruction, really enjoyed the course's assignments\r\nWeaknesses  None...",
                "Strengths - insightful, interesting, conversational\r\nWeaknesses - a bit disorganized, lectures felt rushed",
                "Strengths: Relatively light readings (and if they are long they tend to be interesting to read), grading is not tough, lectures are great, and the content overall is interesting and engaging. Weaknesses: If anything, just that sometimes we spent too much time on recap of what we learned last time.",
                "Strengths: the structure of the course is clear, it does not promise to be more than a survey course, it is well-organized, it is an easy A\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it is possible to never attend a lecture or do a reading and get an A, it is terribly boring and allocates as much time each class reviewing the class before as it does teaching new material, it is such a survey that you could get as much out of a NYT article, or even a broads article, as the actual course",
                "I really enjoyed the variety of material covered, as well as the structure of this course. Professor Fischel was also a really great lecturer, and I found myself constantly losing track of time in class. I think we could have spent last time reviewing during the beginning of class and more time covering some of the readings, but that is the only weakness I can think of.",
                "The lectures are interesting and accessible. I love how prof Fischel uses more advanced terms and defines them in lecture. Section is definitely a weak point. It was so sad that we didnt get to discuss what the professor talked about in lecture. It was kind of just the TA quizzing us and writing stuff on the board.",
                "I think that the lectures were hard to follow at times because the lecturer went really fast and used complex language. I think the way he tied the concepts to pop culture/present day was effective though.",
                "This class is awesome, but drags a bit in the first half. You have to get through a lot of theory before the fun analysis starts, and I wish it was a little more evenly distributed. It's very worth it though!",
                "strengths: relevant, compelling material \r\nweakness: US focused; would appreciate a nod to international contexts",
                "The lectures and sections are very strong on an individual level. I felt like the largest weakness of the course was that its scope was a little too wide. The result was that I ended up feeling a bit scattered and I wasn't able to retain much of the material. I would have liked to spend more time on fewer topics."

The assignments were very self-directed, so you could make of the class what you wanted out of it. There was ample opportunity for students to direct the learning of the course through assignments, sections, and feedback.",

                "Yes! Highly recommend for those wanting an intro survey course",
                "YES!! Take this course, also very good for STEM people that are trying to get distr. credits or just want an intro class to wgss/poli sci",
                "Yes, but only if you have a good background in political philosophy already as this was a large part of the course and made it somewhat confusing. Prof. Fischel is a great lecturer and is good at presenting both sides of an argument even when he only believes one of them",
                "Yes, the class was interesting and engaging",
                "YES! This course changed the way I thought about many everyday things we take for granted and gave me a toolbox to consider how theory provides a lens to understand all the institutions we live in and under.",
                "Yes, Joe is awesome and keeps you very engaged in the topics.",
                "Absolutely! The topics were interesting and I think most people will find at least something that interests them. The professor is great and truly cares about the course, and the workload is fairly low, meaning that this is a great fifth credit. Trust me, you'll love this class!",
                "I would recommend this course to someone looking to learn about the topics of gender, justice, power, and/or institutions in a low stress environment.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student looking to gain exposure to WGSS-related theory.  I really enjoyed the readings in this course.  However, there were virtually no opportunities to improve my writing abilities throughout the semester which was something I hoped to do.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course. I learned a ton of new perspectives that broadened my view of our political structures.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning to think critically about inequality. This course expanded my mind and the ways in which I view injustice and its causes throughout daily life.",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed this course and found the lectures very engaging. You definitely get out what you put in, but the readings were always super interesting and the workload is very manageable.",
                "Yes! Its a good survey course for anyone interested in gender and politics. This course, or something like it, should definitely be required for political science majors. If youre a junior or senior and have taken similar classes already, then this class might feel a bit repetitive for you - but its perfect for younger students or anyone whos new to this content.",
                "Yes. Absolutely.",

                "Yes! This course is very interesting and provides important knowledge about the structures of inequality and injustice in our world.",
                "This class is a great WGSS course for those interested in sampling that department. The information is very applicable and it's a lecture course, which is often the better type of class to take when you're just feeling things out.",
                "Yes, I learned a lot without feeling a lot of pressure about how I was doing in the class.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students, especially those looking to dip their toes into political science and WGSS.",

                "NO!\r\nUnfortunately this class is both a gut and does not try to be anything more than a gut. I took it for a social science credit and was so disengaged within the first month. The lectures are based mostly around questions, which is good, but the questions do not even attempt to answer anything. It is just like 50 minutes of rambling on various topics within broad themes.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student!! It is a great way to have important conversations about gender. Anyone interested in gender studies or political science or philosophy would really enjoy this. Professor Fischel goes out of the way to make sure the environment isn't too stressful which makes it a great space to thoughtfully engage with questions about gender and our political institutions.",
                "Yes, if they havent taken a gender studies class before.",
                "I did not feel intellectually challenged and inspired to use the theoretical material from this class for my other classes/to build my understandings of other concepts. It is not that the material was not intellectual, it was just hard material to engage with at times so I did not feel like I was really learning from it.  There were a few readings that were really interesting though!",

                "Yes, in the class you not only learn about gender/justice/power/institutions but you learn about a lot of the critical debates and stances surrounding these issues",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone seeking a general overview in political science or WGSS subjects. It was a great course for me to take as a STEM major who was looking for an interesting, engaging course that isn't too time-consuming."
