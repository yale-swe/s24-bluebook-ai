                "Strengths:\r\n- I really enjoyed the discussion format. Out of all the classes I've taken at Yale, this class incorporated student engagement and thought the most. Really enjoyed the experience and kept me immersed.\r\n- Strong, informative PPTs and class organization in general\r\n- Professor extremely knowledgeable and gave in-depth feedback",
                "Strengths: I like how it focused primarily on TFQ but expanded out to Spensers other works at the end of the class; the weekly discussion posts were helpful in keeping track of where we were in the text and covering a variety of topics; I really liked how our discussions were always based on the discussion posts because it meant that at least one person was always interested by the question which kept the discussion lively\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the reading load was very high, but Im not sure how this could be helped because TFQ is so long.",
                "The teaching was rather uninspired. Professor Sarpong clearly knows a lot about the material and time period but she never really shared that with us. It was just long block quotes from other scholars and our own meandering questions that were read aloud. I would suggest taking a different course for Renaissance credit.",
                "I feel that the discussion question and answer felt sort of stilted, and it made each class mechanical.\r\n\r\nProfessor Sarpong has great knowledge about Spenser, canonical and newer approaches to his writings.",
                "The strength of this course was its small seminar format. With our thorough reading responses due each week, we had the ability to guide the class discussions to suit our interests within the text! Dr. Sarpong also always assembled excellent PowerPoint that very astutely anticipated much of the questions\/confusion the class would have with the text. Regarding weaknesses, the seminar format was always the same, which got a bit tedious as the semester went on."

                "Yes -- if and only if the idea of really investing yourself in the Faerie Queene is interesting and exciting to you. It is an incredibly rewarding text to invest yourself in (and surprisingly funny and fascinating and readable) but it is a very long and difficult book, and it is basically the entire class. The reading is heavy throughout, but the additional workload is relatively light until the last few weeks, which are consumed with the final paper. The paper was a challenge that I hadn't really anticipated, but one I ended up loving -- made me feel much more connected to the text, and ready and excited to write my thesis even though my thesis is not about anything remotely similar to the Faerie Queene.",
                "Yes! The information is fascinating, and it's presented very well. You will learn a lot and have fun too!",
                "I would cautiously recommend this course. It was very niche but what I found great about it was that it was as much a history course as an English course, which was super interesting to me.",
                "I would not. Felt disrespectful to the material.",
                "I took this class as a Renaissance credit, and found it to be satisfactory. I personally wouldnt take another Elizabethan era class again, since my interests lie elsewhere, but this was a great intro course.",
                "I would recommend this course! It is very fulfilling to conquer such a massive work like The Faerie Queene, and it was exciting to become so deeply engaged with a famous work."
