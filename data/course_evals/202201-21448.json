Weaknesses: I found the actual writing process to be rather difficult - if we could have submitted drafts or had some way to get feedback on our work from her, that would have been great.",
                "Amazing course! Strengths: great professor who led the discussion well. Great classmates who gave really insightful comments.  Incredible reading list. Weaknesses: none that I can think of.",
                "Being a foundational English course, I think this class is a good introduction to the major. The readings are accessible and cover an array of traditions.",
                "The biggest weakness of the course was the assignment to analyze a report. It wasn't instructive to linger so long over such a small portion of the course, and I would have learned more if this assignment either had another option or were completely different. I also would have benefited from more support from my professor during the writing/analyzing process.",
                "The strengths for this course was the professor. The books were also amazing.",
                "Strengths Prof Mukhopadhyay is very engaging and leads great discussions; the selection of books is great\r\nWeaknesses sometimes I would have liked a little more guidance for what the expectations were for certain assignments like the Coetzee Report response",
                "Though the scope of the course was wide, covering novels from all over the world, our discussions were consistently specific and productive. Our conversations challenged me to question the form of postcolonial english classes and consider the literary techniques/value of each novel we read. In every class, almost every student got the chance to contribute, making the discussions very inclusive and engaging.",
                "I honestly don't have much to add. I thought it was well-organized, the workload was reasonable, and our discussions were very productive and interesting.",
                "Great discussions, really enjoyed the book selection in the syllabus.\r\n\r\nWhile the discussions were engaging and insightful, I wish there had been a bit more camaraderie in the class - I think people should be encouraged to engage more in discourse with each other as opposed to separate back-and-forth interactions with the instructor."

It is critical to examine the role of colonialism in the Anglophone world and how postcolonial experiences have been shaped by the English language. This class is one of the only classes in the English department where you can read things written by POC!",
                "100%! This course was incredible.  Every single novel was genuinely one that I would read in my free time-- they were all so interesting.  The professor was great and she led the discussion really well.  I was one of only 2 STEM majors in the class, and I felt intimidated to take this course at first, but there was no need to worry and I learned a lot from my classmates' comments while growing more comfortable to share my own.  There is a lot of reading in this course but it was very enjoyable for me-- I could just sit down with a cup of tea and read while I took a break from my STEM work.  The assignments weren't too bad and the grading seemed fair.",
                "I would recommend taking this class with Prof M; I like her approach to teaching. I would also recommend this class even if you are not an English major; I think it's a good balance of being accessible but still being intellectually engaging.",
                "Yes. It is interesting, instructive, and engaging.",
                "Yes. If youre an English major, its a requirement but world lit is really important.",
                "Yes! The course covers some really great literature and Prof Mukhopadhyay is wonderful!",
                "Yes! I also would encourage English majors not to shy away from taking this class before ENGL 125/126/127. I think 128 offers a useful framework for considering the way the English major at Yale and the English literary canon are constructed.",
                "Yes! I think it's very important to start thinking about books not just for what they're about but why they exist and how, especially in a postcolonial context. This course was eye-opening in many ways in comparison to the typical literature course and I think it's well prepared me for future courses in English as well as other subjects.",
                "Yes! Even if you're not an English major, this is a great way to engage with postcolonial literature, and the discussions are always interesting.",
                "Yes! Highly recommend. This class helped me open my worldview and read some great literature!"
