Only in the last week in conversation with one professor we found out that some seminars took place.\r\n\r\nWe receive newsletters from other engineering departments regarding their seminars, but not our own.\r\n\r\nFeedback for the whole academic year: During the first few weeks in Fall, we did not know what this course entailed and showed up several times, only finding an empty room. Later, we received information about when the seminars were happening, but this information stopped coming after winter break, so we thought it was not happening.",
