                "I learned to read essays critically with an eye for stylistic decisions the author made that makes their essay effective. I learned to apply these strategies to my own writing, as well as generally improved my prose by making it more precise.",
                "I learned how to write a variety of non-fiction essays that I was previously uncomfortable writing.",
                "How to improve your writing, how to approach new texts, what goes through an authors mind when they write a story, how to identify and replicate what we see in others work",
                "I learnt how to read and analyse essays from some of the most accomplished nonfiction writers in a new light. I became a better writer by writing 5 essays over the course of the term with a draft for each one, along with personalised feedback from Prof Green.",
                "I learned how to structure an essay and how to use weaving and anecdotal ledes to enhance my stories.",
                "How to write various types of essays such that other people might want to read them. In particular, an understanding of structure in writing, as well as some technical skills (conciseness mostly).\r\nThere is also an idea of what writing is, and how to go about pursuing it, which I did not get from high school (a skill, not a talent, with structural and technical aspects you can learn to improve) (also it's fun, sometimes).",
                "I think my biggest takeaway from this course is that I became a more confident writer. I also learned how to improve my writing and more about the editing process. We focused a lot on the structure and prose of an effective essay. I now can more deeply analyze essays and was exposed to fantastic examples of essay writing."

                "Strengths: the format allowed me to learn a variety of essay styles, and you write a lot so you improve quickly\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none, except I wish we could have spent more time on each unit, which is not really possible though",
                "Strenghts: of course, the structure of ENGL 120, with five essays, the first four being revised individually with the prof, is a ver successful structure that allows a lot of growth as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt this course was a little too focused on reading other great essays without a clear understanding of what we were supposed to learn from them. I would recommend structuring each unit with specific goals for student learning in mind, like: narrative, structure, and characterization for unit 1, etc.",
                "Strengths: the structure of the course makes it less overwhelming. There are a fair amount of readings for each class but all are concise enough to be interesting and engaging. Workshopping is a highlight of this course - both the test of having your own work shared and giving feedback on others. Weaknesses - none!",
                "Strengths of the course include prof Green and his insights, the small group setting which encourages participation and peer feedback, and the one on one feedback sessions with the instructor.",
                "The course is well structured and stands the test of time. I wish Professor Green wasnt so busy so he could dedicate more time to the course. He is too stressed.",
                "Strengths: gives an opportunity to write a wide variety of essays and receive feedback from an instructor who is also a professional writer. I felt that my writing really improved over the course of the class. The class is also very well-structured, for me at least. The class was split into five units, each with a different style of essay (argument, profile, humor). Within each unit, there were two weeks to write a draft (or one week of break, and then one week to write, depending on how you cut it), after which we submitted a draft for comments. We then had a week to edit into a final draft. The process of writing and editing, of making my essay as good as I could make it and then making it better, was really helpful.\r\nAlso, the essays selected for readings vary widely and are always interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class discussion was interesting but sometimes not very focused. This was generally fine, people had good comments, and Professor Green had good advice, but at times I might have preferred more specific questions for discussion than 'what did you think?'. That said, I did enjoy the discussions, and while my notes aren't very organized, I think they will be useful to me in my future writing.\r\n\r\nThe deadlines for the class ended up being fairly flexible. While I appreciated this, I think it may also have compromised the class a little by stretching and compressing the 'write-edit-break' cycle.",
                "The biggest strength was the editing process built into the schedule of the class. This allows for so much individual growth as a writer. i also think it allows for one-on-one connections to be made with the professor. I also think the allocation of time to simply the analyzation good essays and learning from example is another strength of this course."

                "Yes 100%. I have suggested this to many of my friends - English majors and STEM majors alike. That said, I couldnt imagine taking ENG 120 with any other professor. Derek Green is a dynamic professor who cares deeply about his students.",
                "Yes, everyone should want to become a better writer, and anyone who takes this course will become a better writer.",
                "Yes, but only for students who are not good writers. Students who like writing and are already good at it should just write in their own time or take higher level courses.",
                "Yes! Wonderful introduction to essay writing (and creative writing in general, even). I would add the caveat, though, that it may be helpful to be excited, or curious, about writing. You write and revise a 1200 word essay every three weeks. That is a lot of writing (not back-breaking, but significant), and it could feel onerous if you don't want to do it.",
                "If there was one class I could recommend at Yale, it would be this one. I learned so much about myself as a writer and truly feel like I learned and improved so much."
