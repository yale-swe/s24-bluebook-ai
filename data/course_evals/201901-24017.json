    "This course exposed me to new ideas, techniques and people. It opened my eyes to the realities of working in conflict areas.",
    "I learned so much from this class. Janine's guest speakers (and obviously, Janine herself) have so much wisdom to share. I learned about the practical concerns and considerations that go into on-the-ground journalism, what it takes to make a documentary, how to talk to refugees and vulnerable\/traumatized people, and so much more.",
    "In this course you will learn about a multitude of topics essential to war reporting. In this course we covered how to interview victims, guard against PTSD as reporters, balance being an unbiased, non-partisan reporter with caring about human suffering during war, and much more. The course will help you become a better, more balanced, and thoughtful writer.",
    "This course is a gives you great exposure to all kinds of careers in conflict zones. Janine brings in wonderful guests who have a range of experiences that are very interesting a wonderful resources if you are interested in working in conflict.",
    "The guest speakers brought in tended to be relevant experts, and gave interesting talks."

    "Best course I've taken at yale.",
    "The course schedule was not always clearly laid out and updated, so sometimes the readings did not align with the subject matter of that week's class. Other than that, the course was wonderful; great guest speakers, a wonderful professor, and a wonderful coordinator (Shanavian).",
    "Strengths:\r\n- Guest lecturers are highly accomplished and experts in the field. My favorite was a war photographer who shared amazing stories from the field and opened up with us personally about his life and how he deals with trauma in war.\r\n- Janine is a great teacher and one of the most accomplished war reporters\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- At times, the course was a bit disorganized. Janine sometime cancelled office hours. Shanavian, our TF, did not come to class one day when Janine was out of town and we had a guest lecturer. We waited a while for her, unsure if we could start discussions which was a bit awkward.",
    "The classes are incredibly interesting, however, the structure of the course is not very clear. The final paper and presentation make up the majority of the work for the class but you are given little guidance on the criteria for both.",
    "More teaching could happen through the eyes of the professor specifically, rather than as many guest lecturers as were present. This would allow us to build on some material more acutely than changing topics every week. Though, personally, I did like the mixing up."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this course was amazing. The professor was incredible and the work was interesting.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class. If you are interested in war journalism, modern warfare, the refugee crisis, trauma, or the work of organizations like  the UN\/EU and NGOs, definitely try to get into this class. Janine is phenomenal and you will learn so much. You will learn from the experiences of your fellow students as well, and meet some of the most interesting people in a fascinating line of work.",
    "I would recommend this course. The workload is not too much and the guest lecturers are fantastic. Janine is a gem of a teacher too. In terms of work, we had to write three blog posts over the semester and a final project at the end. I was fortunate enough to have great peers who worked on fascinating final projects, interviewing veterans, refugees, and people from NGO's.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in conflict regions and potentially having a career working in a conflict zone. The guests who speak to the class are incredible and give you unparalleled insight into working in war. Janine is an amazing jouranlist with a unique insight and experience that you probably can't get in any other course. However, be prepared for minimal personal interactions with the Professor and unclear criteria for the final paper in the class.",
    "I would for someone who was interested in the theory of conflict journalism. Although aside from our final project, I felt as though there could have been more hands-on in terms of trying to develop some practical skills. I understand this is tough - Yale isn't a conflict zone, but I suppose if a more experience-based component could be added, it would add a great deal of value to the course."
