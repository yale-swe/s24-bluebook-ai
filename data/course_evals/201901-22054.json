    "We learned about open and closed sets, subsets that are dense in a set, perfect sets, the middle third Cantor set and the fat Cantor set, the Vitali set, the Borel set, the notion of an algebra and a sigma algebra and of a monotone class. We defined an outer measure and a Lebesgue measure. We also defined continuous functions, measurable sets and functions and studied the approximation of a measurable function through simple functions and step functions. We also studied the concepts of a Banach space and of a Hilbert space. W also looked at the concept of differentiable functions, the Vitali covering lemma and maximal functions.",
    "Notions of metrics, metric spaces, measures (Lebesgue), integration and some derivation. High level-wise I gained more of an understanding of basic analytic ideas like approximations than were presented in 230\/231. A pretty standard math course in that you learn a lot and do a lot for problem sets.",
    "Learned the basics of real analysis.",
    "This course is a primer on measure theory and integration. (Hee Oh's curriculum did not cover Fourier series, which I didn't mind, but most other professors who teach this class do include that.)",
    "Some topology (open, closed, compactness, metric spaces), some measure theory, Lebesgue measure, Lebesgue integral. Really improved my quantitative skills and ability to read and understand mathematics.",
    "Knowledge of Real Analysis",
    "Mathematical maturity",
    "A short review of convergence, continuity, compactness etc. from Math 230\/300\/301. Measures. Lebesgue integral. Differentiation.",
    "I learned about the fundamentals of real analysis and measure theory.",
    "The course covers relevant topics in real analysis, focusing mainly on the Lebesgue measure and related concepts.",
    "I learned the basics of real analysis and the techniques used in proofs in this subject.",
    "I learned a lot about analysis and analysis proofs.",
    "I learned Real Analysis (and a lot of it). I further built proof writing skills. I came to realize that I cannot do all of my psets alone (too late). I was challenged greatly and also realized that I cannot skip classes in hard math courses.",
    "Learned a lot about proof based logic",
    "I learned about measures and Lebesgue integration, which I found to be really interesting! I also familiarized myself with the type of thinking required in analysis by learning proofs in class and coming up with my own through the problem sets. However, the proofs presented in class often focused on the technical details rather than the bigger picture, which sometimes obstructed the mathematical intuition behind them.",
    "Understanding of metric spaces, open\/closed sets, compact and complete spaces, measure theory, outer measures, Lebesgue measure, the Lebesgue integral, Littlewood's Principles, limit theorems for integrals, Lp spaces, Banach and Hilbert spaces, differentiation and fundamental theorem of calculus.\r\n\r\nFacility with proofs. Much better understanding of what advanced mathematics is all about.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This was a great class. Prof. Oh put a lot of effort in class to explain the concepts thoroughly and connect them to previous concepts.",
    "Prof. Oh is one of the most clear and communicative professors I have had at Yale. Her precision made learning and asking questions effortless. After almost every class you can leave knowing that you have learned something.\r\n\r\nFew weaknesses. The only thing I would have liked better was if we discussed the expanse of Real Analysis and what exactly it means.",
    "Strengths: The content was interesting and Hee Oh was a very engaging professor. The homework was challenging but of manageable length. The grading of homework and exams was fair. I loved the class overall.\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been nice to have practice problems ahead of exams.",
    "Strengths: Material flows in a logical, clear, way. Instructor is really good, solid, and structured. Problem sets really drill the material, exams are fair and feasible. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None really, perhaps assigning a problem set over spring break was rough, and having them due before both midterms was also inconvenient.",
    "Strengths: great lecturer, challenging and rewarding material, fair exams, not too bad p-sets, great material (though not for everyone!)\r\nWeaknesses: the material could at times feel a bit dry (real analysis is not as sexy as other maths but I personally found it really fun)",
    "Grading for psets could be clearer.",
    "It was very well taught and the material was fascinating!",
    "It moved at a good pace and covered interesting content. However, the problem set difficulty was somewhat inconsistent, proofs done in class often got very confusing due to errors made (and corrected), and I felt that the grade depended far too much on tests, which were also of inconsistent difficulty and often too time-restricted.",
    "I thought it was a lot of fun, the subject was interesting and proofs were cool. I think having a bit more planning on some proofs wouldve been helpful, at times we got lost as a class.",
    "The course covered a lot of very difficult material. Prof Oh did a reasonably good job, but a large portion of class time was devoted to long and heavily involved proofs which she went through at just too fast of a pace for me to follow them as well as I wanted, but took long enough that it impacted the time we could spend on problems and questions. The homework was useful and very challenging, but I wish there had been more problems and some at a lower level. I also wish more class time had been spent on examples; they were always very helpful in building intuition with this very foreign subject material and I often wanted more.",
    "It is a well taught class--does not assume any prior knowledge but does get harder every session.",
    "I think that the lectures were generally well-organized and delivered in a manner that was clear and easy to follow. However, I wish that the course was slightly restructured. I appreciated how we did a systematic and thorough treatment of measures at the beginning of the course, but the second half of the course jumped between various topics such as L^p spaces, differentiation, and Hausdorff without going too much in depth into any of them. I think it would be better if we focused more on one or two of these topics (or even Fourier series, which was included in the syllabus but hardly mentioned in class) rather than jumping around. I also think that the problem sets could have been better organized, with more moderately challenging problems rather than problems at the extreme ends of the difficulty spectrum.",
    "#1 most important strength was quality of teaching. I also liked the textbook, I thought the psets were challenging but not too challenging, and the tests were overall fair and enjoyable too.",
    "Its a well taught math course",
    "The course covered a good breadth and depth of materials and homework was generally good for reinforcing concepts; grading was fair. A weakness would probably be the textbook, which I didn't find very helpful as I don't think it added much to my class notes.",
    "I think there is not much room for improvement. The class is very well taught."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend MATH 305 to students who have taken MATH 300.",
    "Real Analysis teaches fundamental ideas in mathematics that are used in even Algebra and because of this, this class is a must take for Math majors. Additionally if you are a student interested in mathematics, this course is also introductory enough to facilitate a passion for math. Also if Prof. Oh is teaching this, definitely take it with her if you can.",
    "It is a math core.",
    "Highly recommend! Real analysis is an extremely beautiful subject (don't listen to people who say otherwise). And Hee Oh is an awesome professor - a great teacher and a lovable person. Take it with her if she teaches it again!",
    "Yes, I had just taken 250 with Stefan, who basically turned vector analysis into bits and parts of real analysis, so I was prepared. Felt very intimidated at first, at the pace the professor was going and how it seemed most of the class was following, but with enough work and persistence, you'll be able to follow along for most of it. Really shows how beautiful (and rigorous) math is. The construction of the Lebesgue measure and integral are very interesting and eye opening.",
    "I personally loved the course. I would recommend the student shop it and see if they like the lecturing style and the material. Although we took it with Hee Oh, who is amazing, I've heard other professors who've taught this in the past have been terrible. I took this concurrently with 231do not do that unless you are very well prepared, as it can be quite overwhelming to be thrust into an upper level math class like that, especially since 231 is technically a pre-requisite. However, you definitely don't have to take 301 in order to take this class. At least with Hee Oh, everything was defined from first principles and as someone with no background in the material I still did really well. \r\n\r\nOverall, fantastic class, but quite hard, and perhaps not a subject that everyone will relate to.",
    "Hee Oh is AMAZING. If you have the opportunity to take it with her, do capitalize on the opportunity!",
    "I would love to recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about real analysis. And Professor Hee Oh is amazing!",
    "I would, although I would warn them that the tests are extremely important to the grade and somewhat inconsistent in terms of content and time restriction.",
    "Yes, I thought it was interesting and a fun foray into analysis and measure theory.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a student who has never taken an analysis course, at least not with this teacher. I had a rough semester in general with some health concerns which of course made the ordeal much harder for me, but I found the class very difficult and wished I had waited longer to take it or had taken 301.\r\nIf a student is confident they have a strong background and will have a network of friends in the class for support and problem sets, then this class would be a challenging but rewarding experience.",
    "I absolutely recommend it if you are interested in proof-baser math",
    "Absolutely. Really I'd recommend anything with Professor Oh. I came in not having taken any kind of calculus or analysis for three years and I enjoyed it so much I wish I had been studying this all along. This is the kind of class that makes me proud and glad to be a math major. Perfect mix of rigor and intuition in the material. We covered a lot -- my list of theorems and definitions from this semester has 113 entries -- but everything built logically on what came before so it never felt like we were jumping around or moving too fast.",
    "For students in math this is a great course to improve your proof skills bc Professor Oh walks you through her problem solving process step by step in class.",
    "Yes. Course is well taught overall, lectures pretty clear. Good introduction to topics\/techniques in real analysis.",
    "This seems like a fairly standard real analysis course and it's well organized\/taught so I'd recommend it to anyone that's interested in the topic.",
    "Very good class. Take it for sure if Professor Hee Oh is teaching it. But I believe it requires some experience in analysis.",
    "Absolutely not. Professor Oh is not an engaging instructor and neither does she seem to keen on helping students learn and grasp concepts. Questions and doubts seemed unwelcome. The class is not organized, there are no practice problems or support structures to facilitate improvement. There are much better classes to take or other professors who could create a better classroom experience."
