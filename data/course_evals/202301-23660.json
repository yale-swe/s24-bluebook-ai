                "Culture",
                "The course offered a vibrant learning environment that encouraged active application of skills within a supportive community. Under the guidance of an exceptional professor, the classroom thrived with an emphasis on honing our speaking abilities and exploring Spanish through diverse multimedia resources. By centering the curriculum around social issues, the class provided an exceptional platform for students to engage deeply with distinctive content and materials."

                "I appreciated the variety of approaches (movies, readings of essays, learning about art exhibitions, understanding different cultures in Latin America) and the discussions in class. I would have liked more formal teaching of the grammar, especially to introduce big concepts (like the subjunctive).",
                "Working in small groups was a strength as well as work on asynchronous class days. Sometimes it was difficult to work with people outside of class if we hadn't already had time in class.",
                "The structure of the course was really amazing. I enjoyed every class and the topics as mentioned before were engaging and appealing. The asynchronous class on Wednesday provided an opportunity to consolidate learning at your own pace. As a comment, I felt that these were better when we were working in groups - if the asynchronous structure wasn't kept, then perhaps an opportunity to come to class and work in groups would be good (this aspect of the class should definitely be kept).",
                "Strengths: Professor Sanchez!",
                "Jamboards are much better alternative to worksheets and are less overwhelming/stressful. Sometimes out of class responsibilites/homework could be more clear. \r\n\r\nI appreciated the independent nature of class conversation and how it taught me to insert myself into the conversation much more often.",
                "I wish we did more relevant things",
                "The class had several notable strengths that contributed to its effectiveness. One of these strengths was its high level of organization and structure, which provided students with clear expectations regarding classroom work, assignments, and overall course requirements. This allowed us to approach each week with a solid understanding of what to expect. Moreover, the instructor's unique and admirable teaching philosophy added great value to the course. Her approach ignited excitement and appreciation among students, making the learning experience both engaging and meaningful.\r\n\r\nHowever, a weakness arose from the hierarchical structure of the Spanish department, which sometimes hindered the instructor's ability to implement certain teaching methods or approaches she deemed valuable. While she may have wanted to deviate from the established norms, the department's cohesive framework limited her options. This restriction might have posed challenges in fully realizing her vision for the course."

                "Certainly--excellent course that forces students to improve their Spanish by attending/participating in class every day.",
                "yes, if you want to get credit for a language",
                "Absolutely! The Spanish learning experience at Yale demands dedication, but professors like Noelia truly make it a rewarding journey. Throughout the semester, I had the privilege of dedicating a significant portion of my time to enhancing my Spanish skills and developing strategies to further expand my knowledge. The course deviated from a narrow focus on vocabulary and grammar, instead offering ample opportunities for cultural exploration and enrichment by delving into the diverse cultures and people of Spanish-speaking countries. This shift allowed for a more holistic and immersive learning experience that went beyond language mechanics."
