The personal identity discussions were, in my opinion, more lively than our discussions on perception and sight and the related material.",
                "The reading list is really great, the course is well-run, and the material in-class is covered extensively.\r\nA general problem with philosophy seminars is that graduate students tend to (over)run the class. Although less true of this one, I still did feel like certain students dominated the conversation, and it was a bit harder to participate.",
                "Strength - the readings were great, and the topics are very interesting. Feedback on papers was incredibly detailed and thoughtful.\r\nWeakness - the class conversation was pretty uneven. Almost 75% of the class never said a single word. I think the professors could have made more effort to make the environment more inclusive of everyone.",
                "This was a really intellectually demanding and interesting course, and both profs have been incredibly attentive, generous and thorough. I did feel sometimes the conversation in seminar was dominated by a few people -- a challenge that can be hard to overcome when the readings can be quite daunting at times.",
