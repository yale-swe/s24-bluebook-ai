    "really just feels like it's teaching us how to emulate what has already been done--would love some more freedom and guidance in our own composition rather than being forced to recreate pieces of music under very specific rules.",
    "The class is great but class time is largely devoted to critiques which could be done outside of class time.",

    "The course is great!! Frequent assignments forced you to keep up with the work."

    "I mean, if you're really into classical music, then sure, but it has not helped my music outside of the classroom.",
    "If you want to learn how to compose music, this is a great class to take.",
    "Absolutely take it if you're interested in music and have a bit of background!",
    "This is a very good class for those who want experience in arranging\/composing music. It's not too difficult and is a worthwhile experience for those who enjoy music theory.",
    "It's a great class! You get to learn many concepts of music theory that make you a better performer or music appreciator and learn composition. You also get great feedback on that composition."
