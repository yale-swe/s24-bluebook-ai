                "Strengths: The discussion format really aids in keeping the class engaging. There is a lot of clear feedback given in your writing and, for the most part, the readings are pretty interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the deadlines are a bit rushed as we did have to write 4 longer essays and 1 short one.",
                "Strengths: Prof Saraceni is really sweet and cares about all of her students; she checked in on everyone at the start of every class which was nice. She also has a ton of energy and even though our class was only at 11:35am, it helped lift my spirits a bit to keep going through the day. The essays in the personal essay, humor, and cultural criticism units were pretty good for the most part. Breakout rooms were fun and gave me a chance to bond (albeit virtually) with other members in the class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Essays in the place and portrait units were painful to get through (not in an emotionally satisfying way though moreso just a boring omg this thing is like 15 pages long way). All we did in class was talk about the essays and not really practice how to improve our own writing? Like I felt like I was just kind of writing the essays blindly each unit. And I know I'm a strong writer so I didn't go in expecting this course to be ~life-changing~ or anything but I wish I was able to see a more tangible increase in my writing quality. I was really not pleased with the conditions for the place or portrait essays either. My displeasure was mainly a consequence of COVID, but whereas it was physically limiting with the place essay (there were very few places on campus that I was allowed to visit and even less so that I felt comfortable visiting for a long period of time), it was unreasonably binding for the portrait essay (we couldn't interview fellow yalies, romantic partners (which?? is not something I feel like many students would even consider??), or immediate family members and in the age of COVID, that meant basically everyone wrote about their grandparents or a childhood friend).",
                "In the beginning of the course, we focused mainly on the beginnings of essays, but with midterm feedback we started assessing the entire essays holistically. The asynchronous meetups with other students were also helpful."

It is fun and engaging and it allows for plenty of creativity even though you are technically writing nonfiction. There is a lot of feedback given between your rough draft and final drafts and the workshops were great.",

If you want a relatively chill writing class (chill in the sense that the class environment is chill, there's still a considerable amount of writing) and know you're already a strong writer, then yes, this is the class for you. If you don't want to do a lot of writing throughout the semester, this probably isn't the class for you.",
