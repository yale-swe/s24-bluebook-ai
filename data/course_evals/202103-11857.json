                "A detailed understanding of Newtonian mechanics. While the first half of the course was more or less entirely review from AP Physics C Mechanics (though done in a faster, more fun way), the second half had lots of brand new material, like planetary orbits, a rigorous treatment of rotational motion, damped oscillators, and special relativity. Also taught widely applicable physics problem solving skillsfor example, doing dimensional analysis or looking at limiting cases as sanity checks.",

                "Weakness: We spent too much time on galilean transformations (4 lectures??), leaving less time for cooler topics like oscillations and special relativity. Also people left after the first couple of lectures and the pace picked up after that, so I think having a placement test to correctly place students into the appropriate classes might do everyone some good.",
                "It is impressively deep enough already. But I guess going even deeper into the general concepts would add to the fun of it.",
                "The problem sets can be challenging, but are not unnecessarily long or difficult. The course provides a deep understanding of mechanics. Prof. Girvin was excellent. He knows the material inside and out, and he is great at tying together seemingly unrelated concepts. He is engaging and very receptive to questions.",
                "I loved that the lectures were recorded so that you if you had to miss a day of class you could still keep up with the material.",
                "Strengths: Engaging lectures! Problem set questions were fun, not rote. Great organizationmaterials posted promptly to Canvas, recordings of lectures, and a truly astounding number of office hours and peer tutor hours, basically every day of the week.\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "The course was very well designed and covered a lot of interesting materials.",
                "The course is very good at introducing concepts and showing you where they come from. The psets for the course, however, felt like they relied on tricks more than anything and often left me feeling that I hadnt really learned all that much.",
                "The course is very challenging and will help you think like a physicist. The lectures move pretty fast and are oftentimes very math heavy.",
                "The material is so interesting and the course really focuses on understanding over memorizing. You learn how to do really difficult problems in the psets, and really strengthen your computational skills, but you're encouraged to work with others so you really have a safety net if you don't understand what's going on. The midterms are taken individually but they're significantly easier than the psets, so you end up learning a ton without the amount of stress you'd normally have about the exams.",
                "Strengths \r\n- Interesting lecture material\r\n- Fair exams\r\n- Peer tutor hours / pset support",
                "This is an introductory sequence course, so it has some limitations. That said, I think it did an excellent job of keeping the material engaging. Professor Girvin knew that the concepts were difficult, and made sure all our questions were answered. Office hours, with both Prof. Girvin and ULAs, were accessible and helped me understand the material. PSets were difficult, but collaboration was encouraged, and the exams seemed fair. Special relativity was an interesting way to end the course.\r\n\r\nWe didn't learn as many problem solving techniques in class- it focused mainly on conceptual understanding and derivations. This meant that the book proved pretty key for some of the more difficult problems. The inclusion of some differential equations was also difficult, but I don't know if it would be possible to avoid them.",
                "Strengths: textbook, prof girvin's lectures were phenomenal\r\nWeaknesses: psets were pretty easy relative to the final, so that was an unpleasant surprise. To prepare for the final perhaps they could be slightly harder.",
                "The only weakness I can think of is that grades on homework assignments were slightly inflated, so we didn't get as much feedback as I'd hoped. As for strengths, the lecturers were very well-paced, interesting, and covered everything on the homeworks and tests.",
                "Strengths were the psets and the lectures.",
                "Professor Girvin gives interesting, well-paced lectures. The problem sets can be difficult, but they are very doable with lecture recordings, textbook example problems, office hours, and peer collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe only improvement I can think of is that I wish more textbook reading had been assigned--I often found it easy to accidentally skip over it or to not know where to look in the textbook for a certain topic.",
                "This course spent a lot of time on some subjects and therefore had to rush at the end - it was useful to get that deep dive into many of the ideas like angular momentum, but I would have liked a bit more time spent on harmonic oscillators and relativity. Over all though it was a very informative course and I feel like I grasped everything I had a mathematical background in.",
                "The professor was a good lecturer and his notes, example problems, and explanations made the material clear. The course might be improved with more resources to support instruction including derivation recaps and possibly short lecture recaps.",
                "Fun problem sets, exams are not bad interesting topics",
                "I think the strengths would be the fact that the lectures were extremely interesting and the problem sets were clear and honestly pretty fun. The tests were very doable and I think that the grading in the course as a whole was quite fair. A weakness of the course could be that the problem set questions were more difficult than the exam questions, but I don't think this was a significant weakness.",
                "More practice problems done in class, practice tests would be very helpful",
                "Strengths: Good, hard problems in psets, great instructor (i.e. Professor Girvin), interesting content, camaraderie among classmates, great peer tutors\r\nWeaknesses: If you lack a strong physics foundation, this course may prove to be quite challenging",
                "Lectures are just proofs, but we never really needed to know these proofs. Girvin's proofs were hard to understand, and I'd get lost very quickly every class, eventually leading me to stop going to class. Wish we did actual problem solving.",
                "The problem sets really help to consolidate the concepts. There are many resources like the TF's and the peer tutors that can help you get the psets done, so in the end you always end up learning something.",
                "Strengths: The professor was very knowledgeable. Many lectures were clear and useful. The problem sets were a challenge, but peer tutors were available to help (and they did a great job) and the problem sets really did help students learn the concepts.\r\nWeaknesses: for assignments, it was sometimes unclear what reading needed to be done. Early on, a couple of the lectures were hard to follow. A couple of topics were not covered in the lectures. More practice problems would have been helpful.",
                "Teaches physics, engaging, about the right level of difficulty. It was nice to have lectures recorded, since I sometimes would not understand material immediately, and so found it useful to go back and re-watch."

                "I took A'level physics and this felt like a pretty chill class. If you have confidence in mechanics (e.g. have touched on utilising calculus in solving kinematics questions), I suggest skipping this and going straight to 410.",
                "If you really love  physics and are tired of just numbers getting plugged into equations, take this course to derive the marvelous equations yourself.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone in a STEM major interested in Physics, especially if it is with Prof. Girvin.",
                "Yes, definitely. Though the material was hard, I feel like I learned much more than just the physics material. I learned valuable problem solving skills and I learned how to develop intuition about the physical concepts. This was one of my first college courses and I felt like it displayed exactly what is different about college and high school; it placed more emphases on the type of learning than on the material itself, and I feel like I learned a new way to think.",
                "If you're even slightly considering this course, go for it! I'd absolutely recommend this course to anyone who took an AP physics class in high school (or equivalent), as well as who has exposure to the ideas of multivariable calculusyou don't a super deep knowledge of multi, but having to pick it all up during this class would be tough.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who has a good physics and math background, finds physics very exciting and wants to continue exploring it. This is also a very good course to help you decide of whether you want to continue pursuing physics or not.",
                "Only if you are committed to pursuing physics and putting time into thoroughly understanding the material and this is hopefully your third pass of mechanics (after algebra-based and single variable calculus-based physics). It is quite easy to scrape by with a surface level understanding of the material but then it will be almost impossible to get started with and understand how to do the very difficult problems in the KK textbook (which the class mostly uses) as well as the difficult questions on the PSETs. The questions often felt like doing physics olympiad questions where I had no idea how to get started and had to resort to looking at the answer key for KK, going to office hours, or just guessing. This class will be mostly derivation-based and thus how to solve problems will need to be mostly picked up from struggling through PSETs or prior knowledge. There were 2 midterms and a final (each worth 25%) that were not as hard as the PSETs. In my opinion, the first half of the class was quite tame but after the midterm (and drop deadline), it ramped up a lot with angular momentum, harmonic oscillators, and relativity.",
                "I think this course would be good for someone who wants to make sure they have the basics down, but it does feel like it is designed for people who have mostly done the material already. I havent taken higher level courses, so I dont know how skippable this review is.",
                "Yes, it will help you think like a physicist and solve challenging problems effectively.",
                "Yes. The material is hard but it's so interesting, and the exams are very forgiving. There were multiple moments when I was questioning everything I knew about the universe.",
                "Yes, but only if adequately prepared",
                "I would, if they've taken AP Physics Mechanics (or an equivalent) and have exposure to basic multivariable calculus. I wouldn't consider my background in physics particularly strong, but I was able to do fairly well in the course and grasp some of the more difficult concepts. The derivations deepened my understanding of both physics and multivariable calculus. Girvin was a joy to learn from.",
                "Yes. If you wanna learn physics intro.",
                "Yes! I enjoyed the class a lot, Dr. Girvin was fantastic, and I learned a lot, despite having taken AP Physics C. I got significantly better with specific concepts because they were explained very well in class, and the homeworks over-prepared me for the tests, so the class wasn't stressful, and I could just focus on learning the physics.",
                "Yes, if youre very well prepared in math and physics and want to deeply dive into these topics at the highest possible level. Be prepared for and interested in LONG derivations - expect class to consist of those, not learning how to do whats on the pset.",
                "Yes, I would recommend if a student was really well-trained in physics.",
                "Take this course if you can! The small size of the class makes it easy to form a community, and Professor Girvin is wonderful. Going in, I had taken Calculus AB in high school and I had (poorly) taught myself multivariable calculus afterward. Learning how to do line and surface integrals in the class required a little extra work during those weeks, but largely I felt that my math preparation was fine. The homework was difficult but doable (especially if you go to office hours!) and the exams felt very fair. If you like physics, then you'll like this class.",
                "If you really want a deep dive into physics, go for it. It ends up not being that bad grade-wise, so even if you find yourself confused, it probably wont tear down your GPA. If you dont feel like taking this, though, my understanding is that 200 is just as helpful in the physics track as 260, so its not necessary.",
                "If you have a significantly strong background in physics and an intense desire to learn it at a deeper level, the course may be an option for you. For me, I enjoyed physics in high school but likely wouldve gained a better conceptual understanding from a lower level course.",
                "Great course, would definitely recommend",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was really exciting to learn about special relativity and other advanced physics concepts. The lectures were very interesting, and I enjoyed taking on the trickier problems on the psets.",
                "I would only recommend this course to prospective physics majors. A very intensive class that doesnt suit those just wanting to learn about physics bc they are interested.",
                "The skill level of the students who take this class is incredibly high. For a student such as myself who perhaps wasn't as up to par, you have to put in effort outside of class to self-study and review the material. However, I felt it was incredibly rewarding, albeit incredibly stressful come exam time. I'd recommend taking this course if you're up to the challenge.",
                "No, unless you have a seriously good background in physics (I personally don't think AP Physics C cuts it) or you love proving equations/formulae. I wanted to build my problem-solving abilities and was quite disappointed.",
                "Yes. If you have good intuition and a good math background, but haven't taken AP Physics C, do not be scared. On another note, I heard that 410 was a gut in fall 2021, and that its topics were not much different than 260. I also heard some physics majors complain that had they known 410 was a gut, they would have tried to jump straight to 410 without taking 260-261.",
                "I would only recommend this course to a student with lots of experience with physics and problem solving who is interested in challenging themself further. You can get a lot out of this class; however, without a strong background it would feel as if you were being thrown into the deep end at the beginning of the course, as it assumes lots of knowledge.",
                "Yes, as long as you are interested in physics. It will be helpful to have taken calc and high school physics (you can take the course without previous physics but it'll be tough). This class also tends to attract like-minded people, which can be nice."
