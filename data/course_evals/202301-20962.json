            "comments": [
                "STRENGTHS: Pre-lab videos and instruction sheets were very useful. Teaching staff and professor were all very helpful in land and while writing reports. The workshops were very helpful for explaining some of the analytical techniques necessary for writing the reports. Very well-organized. WEAKNESSES: The fact that most of the lab reports were two-in-one meant that they became very big projects (10+ pages, 12+ hours of work) that built up very easily. It was also strange to sometimes be writing a lab report for a lab I did almost a month prior. My suggestion would be to break it up so each lab corresponds to one smaller lab report.",
                "The strengths of this course were organization and teaching, as well as fostering student collaborations through sharing of class data. I cannot think of any weaknesses of the course or how the course could be improved!",
                "I wish we were provided with rubrics for our reports prior to submitting. I often felt that I was being graded on expectations that were not clearly communicated to me. \r\nI think that this course would benefit from the addition of more comprehensive and in depth explanation of the statistical analysis that we are expected to use. That being said, I understand that this course has a fairly limited amount of time for the work that must be done.",
                "The course is well-structured. However, I think some of the experiments conducted are trivial.",
                "Weaknesses: the grading on many of the lab reports was kind of ridiculous. Students weren't given a rubric, different TAs preferred different things (for example, some would take off points if your graph had gridlines and some wouldn't care), students were graded for significant figures for every number reported but the significant figures for things like stock solution concentrations weren't reliable, and points were taken off repeatedly for the dumbest little thingsfor example, a friend had a point taken off every single time (for a total of >10 points) that she abbreviated \"seconds\" as \"sec\" instead of \"s,\" even though both of these abbreviations are frequently used in science. I had points taken off because the TA thought my X-axis label was slightly too far from the axis. \r\n\r\nThis entire grading scheme fostered an almost paranoid environment, and TA office hours were reduced to students spending the entire time asking hyper-specific questions about things like significant figures to maximize their grade. It was annoying for the students, who were forced to waste valuable time and energy stressing about whether a stock concentration of 0.1 molar meant that all other calculated values could only have 1 significant figure, and it was annoying for the TAs, who wasted their expertise trying to answer questions about the grading scheme and rubric that they didn't have the answers to. \r\n\r\nFinally, I thought it was ridiculous to require students to copy the lab procedure by hand into their notebook before each lab (and to forbid them from printing it out). I don't know of any real lab that requires their postdocs / grad students to do this, so it seems unnecessary and wasteful to have undergrads do it in a teaching lab. \r\n\r\nStrengths: the expectations for the lab quizzes were reasonable, and the experiments themselves were well-designed for learning various techniques and concepts in chemistry.",
                "Labs were okay but the grading was wack. Teaching fellows were very inconsistent when grading. I went to two different office hours and each person led me to extremely different answers.",
                "Very enjoyable and engaging in-person lab procedures. Sometimes the labs ran much longer than hoped for, but that's the nature of lab work.",
                "Lab reports are pretty tough to complete, a definite increase in workload from chem 134L. A lot more finicky about formatting data as well.",
                "Strengths: labs were well-organized, helped reinforce content from CHEM 165 lecture, Dr. Cooper was always very kind and helpful, TA's were great in terms of explaining content and helping with lab methods.\r\nWeaknesses: lab reports were extremely tedious, stressful, and graded very harshly. Extremely challenging to predict expectations for the lab reports (e.g. exactly what to include on graphs in order to receive full credit). In general, labs were more about following specific instructions than \"thinking like a scientist.\" Lab reports did not do much to solidify material; rather, they were a test of how well you know sig fig rules and how much patience you have for data entry/rote Excel work.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Cooper's short and concise pre-lab lectures prepared us well to go into the lab and answer the pre-lab quizzes. I enjoyed the few workshops as they allowed us more time to work on our lab reports and ask for assistance if needed. Those workshops were also helpful in learning to use and analyze our data in Excel efficiently. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it would be nice if prelab quizzes were graded towards completion instead of accuracy and if the answers were posted after submitting them. Certain lab reports were very long and had me wishing this course was a writing credit. Those individual labs could've been shortened or at least spread out to lessen the workload. Sometimes the TAs answers were confusing, and sometimes they would give different answers to Dr. Cooper. Sometimes the lab report feedback would be very nit-picky or varied levels of strictness depending on the TA grading the report.",
                "The labs are fairly simple and engaging, and the reports allowed me to improve my science writing skills.",
                "The in-lab experiments are pretty fun, depending on the week, but the lab reports are a LOT of work.",
                "Great hands-on learning experiences. Lab reports were very long and I think I would have preferred to do one shorter lab report for each experiment rather than a really long one for two. Regardless, I learned a lot about the scientific process and really appreciated the weeks that we had work sessions/workshop.",
                "The strength of this course is that the TAs and professor are all open to any questions you may have during the duration of the lab and if any questions arise for the lab report. In addition, it is supplemented with pre-lab lectures and has a lot of application to what you may learn in general chemistry. Weaknesses include how much time the lab reports take; however, if you plan your time wisely it shouldn't be too daunting.",
                "Strengths was the clarity in which the labs were taught and the ease in which they could be done. Weaknesses the lenght of the lab reports they often had repeating questions.",
                "I liked the course but I think the lab reports were a little lengthy for the 0.5 credit. I also felt like each teaching Fellow graded the lab reports differently, so that was sometimes hard to improve from one lab report to the next because one TA would take off for one thing but a different TA wouldn't.",
                "The class felt manageable and the workshops were very helpful in providing guidance for lap reports and spacing out due dates.",
                "The strength was that the protocols were very detailed.\r\nThe weakness is that the lab reports are chunked in a way that can be overwhelming, consisting of a lot of graphs. The pre-lecture video also does not give great context on how to actually perform the experiment physically in the lab.",
                "The grading is all over the place and efforts to standardize fail. The grading is extremely pedantic and nit picky.",
                "I believe there was some variation in how TAs graded lab reports. There were just so many things that TA's were instructed to look out for when grading, that sometimes they failed to caution their students while the students or instructed the students incorrectly on how to prepare a section of the reports; this was especially true of graphs. However, the head professor and TAs were generally very helpful and patient: I appreciated the workshops and found them to be one of the beneficial experiences in this course.",
                "Lots of busywork. Tons of busywork. The lab reports take far too long, and they aren't anything like actual lab reports that are in published papers.",
                "Strength - Dr. Cooper! Great instructor\r\nWeakness - videos should also demonstrate lab procedure!",
                "One of the weaknesses of this course was that the lab reports were often on two experiments. I would have definitely prepared to write one lab report per experiment because the mega lab reports were very very stressful!! Having to write one report per experiment would have kept me on track. Another weakness was the lack of standardization of grading. I definitely think that some TAs were more flexible graders than ever. It's unfair that some people would get points deducted on certain issues because of their grader, while some graders were more flexible and therefore didn't deduct points.",
                "This course effectively covered a wide range of experiments relating to general chemistry.",
                "I would appreciate more in-person office hour opportunities to review lab reports in a collaborative environment.",
                "The strength of this course was Prof. Cooper who genuinely wanted to help his students and was always willing to help students and answer their questions. The pre-lab quizzes were great and helpful in preparing for the lab period. The weaknesses of this course were the Teaching Fellows who were not knowledgeable about the course content and demonstrated little desire to help the students succeed. The 15-page lab reports were unnecessarily long, convoluted, and tedious. Also, the rubrics were not posted ahead of time, leading students to lose points in arbitrary areas. Additionally, the grading of the lab reports varied greatly between the Teaching Fellows.",
                "Strengths: very organized, guidance from TAs, students could develop their own ways of documenting purpose and procedure without running it by section TA, lab reports allowed more room for error and feedback/learning. There was also a good system in place to reduce subjectivity and bias in grading of reports, as well as continuous TA office hours throughout the week\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None in particular",
                "Lacking a rubric for the lab reports was a grave weakness. Oftentimes I would get points off for things that other TAs did not or explicitly state to do otherwise. To have a lack of guidance and standard grading was frustrating and led to long hours spent over lab reports that I felt were unnecessary or could have been shortened with a rubric. \r\nThe actual experiments and pre lab videos were well done though.",
                "Strengths: The labs were usually 1-2 hours, rather than the allotted 4 hours which was favorable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The grading is not standardized whatsoever. Some TAs will grade with little attention to detail, while others will pay attention to every single dot you put on your graph. This was very annoying and needs to be fixed for future classes.",
                "A weakness of the class is that for a 0.5 credit course the workload is pretty immense. The lab reports take a lot of time. I thought, however, that the lab reports were intensive while also being reasonable in terms of difficulty. Though they were time-intensive, the work wasn't ever mind-numbingly hard; it was mainly mind-numbingly tedious. One thing that bothered me throughout the course was the reflection questions. We were provided very little detail on how to answer the reflection questions which made them unnecessarily challenging to complete. If we were given example responses at the beginning of the course, or a more detailed rubric/prompt on how to answer each reflection question, the conceptual takeaways from the course would be improved drastically along with conserving the energy and time it took to answer the poorly worded reflection questions.",
                "Strengths: TFs were very helpful during labs and office hours. If I needed help, there was always someone I could go to (especially for lab reports). \r\nWeaknesses: I wish the lab reports were split so the reports weren't super dense. Also, sometimes the instructions in the lab manual were not clear",
                "This class was a little confusing at times but was generally taught well.",
                "I wish the lab reports were slightly shorter and more manageable.",
                "The variety and quality of the experiments were a big strength of this course. They touched on major concepts and demonstrated them well. The lab reports were fair and accurately reflected the experiments that were conducted. The organization of the course and data analysis workshops was greatly helpful. The major weakness of this course is the grading. There seems to be a great deal of inconsistency among TAs.",
                "I do not have anything negative to say about this course. The work is spread out very evenly through the semester and explained well as long as you attend workshops. Dr. Cooper is also very accomodating and willing to work with you through any issues you may be facing whether that is helping you make up a missed lab or answering some final questions about the lap report you have been struggling with for a while.",
                "Not many strengths. The weaknesses of this course were how incredibly difficult this class was in terms of grading. Extremely harsh. Taking point off because a graph is not visibly large enough for viewing pleasure is entirely subjective and is not stable grounds to warrant deductions. I really did struggle with the grading of this course.",
                "Strengths: definitely the TFs office hours and the workshops.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I personally prefer to have weekly rather than biweekly reports.",
                "Strengths: TAs and professor Copper are always helpful and opened to questions.\r\nWeaknesses: lab report grading",
                "Strengths- the lab reports were very straight forward and the lab manuals were very understandable.\r\nWeaknesses- the late policy was not helpful.",
                "I think the experiments were well thought out, and I appreciated that we almost always had a workshop before the lab reports were due. Both Dr. Cooper and the TFs were very kind and helpful. They were always there to answer questions and provide tips for the lab. However, I think a major weakness of this course is both the instructions and grading for the lab reports. The directions and rubrics for the lab reports supply some information, but not enough. Many required elements of the lab report are not included in the instructions or rubric, making it difficult to succeed in the course. For example, the graph formatting is done differently than in 134L but is only briefly described until after the lab reports are handed back and points are taken off for improper formatting. The data tables provided to us often have the wrong significant figures or are missing units, so it is up to us to double check any information given to us because otherwise we will be penalized. I only fully learned what was expected out of a lab report when I received my grade for it, along with point deductions for doing something incorrectly even though it was never specified in the instructions. As a result, the lab reports were unnecessarily frustrating and time-consuming. Had the lab report instructions and grading rubrics been clearer, it would have been far more equitable and students would have had a better chance of success in the course.",
                "I feel like some of the labs were very redundant and made course load very heavy.",
                "The course was well-organized and reasonably paced.",
                "The TAs are really helpful when you need help and the videos before class as well.",
                "The experiments are very well setup and fleshed out, but the lab reports are extremely lengthy. However, you are given plenty of time to approach them.",
                "This was a great course.",
                "The lab reports were a bit lengthy, and the grading was inconsistent and harsh.",
                "The labs were very interesting and efficient.  The graphs on the lab reports were very difficult and the lab reports took very large amounts of times.",
                "The strengths of this course are the connections between CHEM 165 and the weekly laboratories. The occasional workshops are also helpful for students to better understand the statistical perspectives and requirements of the lab reports. \r\n\r\nThe lab report grading standards could be improved to ensure fairness among the grading.",
                "The strengths of the course are that it fits the expectation of what a chemistry lab course would be and the experiments done every week are interesting and manageable. The weakness of the course is that the lab reports are often long and require a substantial amount of time outside of the lab to complete.",
                "Grading was all over the place. One week we were told to do one thing in our lab reports and then the next week we got points taken off for doing the same thing",
                "A weakness of this course was that grading for reports was done by different people each time and so points were deducted each time for new reasons and so grading was very inconsistent.",
                "The lab reports were quite lengthy in nature. Additionally, statistical analysis for the data wasn't taught as thoroughly as it should've. Additionally, the grading of the lab reports was quite unfair at times and overly subjective. TFs would take off a significant amount of points for a small error. All of the experiments require a partner, so it is important that you sit by a good partner. Otherwise, you will be stuck dealing with someone that isn't very responsive all semester.",
                "Lab reports did not emphasize understanding but meticulousness. TAs could have been very harsh or very easy. Inconsistent grading",
                "Way too much work for a 0.5 credit.",
                "good course overall.  lab reports are very long",
                "The course teaches basic chemical experiments concisely and shows how to justify conclusions with data well. The prelab lectures were very helpful before coming to lab. However, I felt like the feedback could be a bit more clear for lab reports.",
                "Strengths: broad curriculum with various laboratory techniques, pre-class guidance through recorded videos, highly-interactive, lab-reports allow for exposure to properly present scientific methods and conclusions. \r\nAreas for Improvement: in the future it may be helpful to have a more standardized rubric among teaching assistants, as they would sometimes give contradicting information among various lab reports, making it difficult for students to consistently apply feedback.",
                "Amazing professor! Concepts were very interesting.",
                "I would say that some strengths of this course are that the experiments were pretty engaging and the TFs overall were helpful. Additionally, I feel that this course taught me to apply my chemistry and think critically about the data that my classmates and I measured experimentally. However, I would say that a weakness was the distribution of the workload. For a half-credit course, there was an extremely large workload that was not very evenly spread throughout the semester. I would definitely day that one big weakness of this course is that the grading of lab reports was very subjective and heavily dependent on which TA was grading you report. Additionally, while the TFs were generally quite helpful and certainly tried their best, they sometimes provided conflicting information when explaining questions or detailing expectations for lab reports. I understand that they don't know exactly how lab reports will be graded before they're given a rubric, but it was sometimes frustrating when the TFs' different \"guesses\" at what was correct/required was conflicting with each other.",
                "labs were very very long this semester",
                "n/a",
                "Strengths: amazing Professor, lots of resources for students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: more office hours for lab reports",
                "The TAs need to improve their communication because the answers to questions stduents give is not answered correctly or is answered differently by one TA and other",
                "Strengths - the prelab videos correspond to the prelab quizzes \r\n\r\nWeakness - the workshops for lab reports are often two weeks after you did one of the experiments, so its hard to retain information. The lab reports are so long since they combine two experiments.",
                "There were no particular weaknesses that I can think of. I think it was a good, standard introductory lab course that taught us the basics.",
                "The course aligned very well with General Chemistry II, which helped me understand the content greatly.",
                "I think the course is fairly straight forward Dr. Coopers lectures and lab guides made procedure in class easy to follow and perform. I think we were also given ample time to complete the lab reports.",
                "Too much work for half a credit",
                "This course was good in practical aspects such as the actual lab. However, the lab reports were very long and graded unequally across the class.",
                "na",
                "Very poor instructions/expectations. Every TA had different requirements for the lab reports, which made it very hard to understand what the expectations were.",
                "Some of the lab reports seemed a little lengthy and I feel like some portions could have been taken out to ensure a more effective learning process. One strength was the reflection and postlab questions truly helped me learn.",
                "I thought lab reports were ambiguously graded and offered little concrete guidance in how to actually write a lab report. \r\n\r\nExperiments were fine.",
                "This course didnt teach material well it only tried to teach how to follow instructions. It was a good lesson in patience.",
                "Strengths: Labs are very beneficial to comprehension of lecture material and generally not too long (1.5-2 hours). TFs are very helpful and patient.\r\nWeaknesses: Lab reports are very tedious, long, dull, and not efficient at promoting learning (mostly busywork). Expectations for lab reports (ie. sig figs, captions) are not made clear by the professor, though TFs did a great job fixing this. Grading standards are inconsistent beween TFs (though fair for most lab reports).",
                "The strengths of this class were that it prepared you pretty well for future lab experiences. The weaknesses of this course were the way the lab reports were grading and the help we could receive. The grading system this semester was anonymous and randomized, but it seemed like different TFs would take off more points on the lab reports than other TFs for the same mistakes. It was hard to tell how to improve these mistakes when some classmates were not getting points off for very similar answers. When we went to TFs for help during office hours, sometimes they did not know how the reports would be graded so it was hard for them to answer our questions. I understand that they were instructed to not check answers as thoroughly as last semester, but I don't think that this made a difference in how much I was able to learn versus when we could get more help. Overall, I think there were some improvements to the fairness of the grading system this semester, but it could still be improved further.",
                "I found the lab reports to be very long and difficult. I would say that I spent more time working on lab reports for this class than on work for any of my other classes and think that to that regard this class should be worth more than half a credit.",
                "Overall, I think this course is a solid foundation for anyone who does not have much lab experience or is planning to work in a chemistry laboratory in the future. I think the strengths of the course were the lab reports themselves, as they required us to think critically about what we were doing. For me, I think the grading was a bit difficult to understand--there were some graders who told me to do things that other graders marked me down for, which was hard to figure out.",
                "Very engaging but some assignments felt unnecessarily long.",
                "While the four hour period I quite difficult to schedule, I deemed it necessary. As for ways this course can be improved, I have no recommendations.",
                "Strength: I learned how to analyze my data, and critically review the data I have gathered. I also learned how to gather data such as electrophoresis or titrations, which I would have learned within the classroom with a textbook. Doing experimental techniques by hand is fundamental to further understanding class content. After the titration experiment, for example, I had an epiphany on how to calculate the pH at different titration points.\r\nWeakness: At times, I felt that the TFs did not understand the class content as it is not within their field, so sometimes it was difficult to understand how to write the lab report.",
                "Strengths: the labs were interesting and reasonably timed. The workshops on using excel were helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Office hours are hard to get to especially if you have a lab early in the week. Weekend OHs would be immensely helpful. The lab reports are incredibly long, dense, and the rubric is very nitpicky in terms of grading. A tough combo when office hours are only on Zoom and its difficult to get a word in edgewise.",
                "The strengths of the course was that the procedures were easy to follow and the experiments were not too difficult to carry out. However, one big big weakness in this course is the fact that all the students are left oblivious to how each question was graded and that the professor expected us to think like how a teaching fellow would think when answering a question. Another big weakness was that grading was very very inconsistent given that each of my reports were graded by different teaching fellows. Some took points off for little things while another teaching fellow would say to those exact little things okay thats fine. Some teaching fellows graded very harshly and some nicely that it gave me great confusion on what specifically the grader was looking for.",
                "strengths: dr. cooper is very engaged and helpful during lab, also very understanding and flexible with due dates. his workshops were engaging and helpful for completing the lab reports. also the experiments were fun and interesting\r\nweaknesses: lab reports took way too much time, workload was too much for a half credit class. I spent about 10-13 hours on each lab report, which is way too much. also the TA's graded the reports too harshly and took off a lot of points for small errors. there was a high amount of variability in grades based on which TA graded the report, as some TAs were very lenient and didn't take off many points while some took off a lot of points, so this created an unfair situation in which your grade on the reports depended largely on which TA graded it.",
                "Strengths: Pre-lab lectures and quizzes felt fair, helpful, and well-organized; new data analysis/excel techniques were taught clearly and effectively, TAs were helpful and ready to answer questions in the lab, and Dr. Cooper's workshops were clear and helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is not necessarily a weakness, but it is important to note that this course is much more demanding and involved than in General Chemistry Lab I. Lab reports are much more time consuming and technical, and the workload for this half-credit course exceeded that for many of my regular courses. That said, such intensity did greatly improve my data analysis skills and my in-lab experimentation skills.",
                "The strength is that I learned a lot and it can be improved by having more opportunities for students to know how to complete lab reports.",
                "I love the lab class.",
                "The labs themselves are actually enjoyable if you enjoy being in a laboratory setting. If you are friendly with your benchmates and are interested in labwork, then the long, once-a-week lab can feel like less of a chore. I think this also gives you a good opportunity to develop your writing skills in the context of lab reports. The prelab videos are much shorter than in the first half of the course, which is such a plus. However, the workload is quite high; you spend 3 hours on a lab and then like at least five times that amount actually writing the report. The rubrics for the lab were also pretty unclear. Even though all the points and requirements are spelled out, the TAs follow them pretty inconsistently, so your grade on a lab depends a lot on who grades it. Some of the TAs are unnecessarily harsh.",
                "A big strength of this course is how it mirrors the curriculum of CHEM 165, which helped me on both ends. The lab course acted as a refresher on the concepts I learned in the lecture, and the lecture prepped me for the experiments we would do. I also think a strength of this course comes from the professor and the TFs. Dr. Cooper was extremely understanding when it came to balancing the lab reports with my other coursework, and the teaching fellows were a big help inside and outside of lab. Dr Cooper's workshops were also helpful, a great environment to ask questions, and motivated me to start on the lab report early.\r\n\r\nA weakness is the lab reports themselves. I feel like they were so much work that I always was extremely stressed every time one was due. I know I could have just started earlier, but it's difficult to prioritize the lab report when I had other classwork due sooner. I would rather have shorter assignments with more due dates. Also, there was no clear rubric, so the expectations for how the lab reports should be were often unclear, which was difficult when very small details would get penalized.",
                "The strengths of this course are the experiments in relation to the lessons being taught in class as the same time. They were usually moving at around the same pace to all of my take aways from Gen Chem were reinforced and deepened my understanding. Even in the bio lab internship I'm at right now, many of the lessons are applicable."

                "Definitely not \"worth it\" for a half-credit course, but it's necessary for a lot of majors, so it's worth taking. Higher workload than my 1.5 credit language course. Aside from the high workload it's pretty interesting.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking to follow a premedical track as this course helped me gain experience working with a classmate to complete labs.

                "Only if required for your major or pre-med. I had a better time in this lab than in CHEM 134L because everyone started the semester with more comfort with lab procedures, but the lab reports were more tedious and stressful in this course.",

As a student who wanted to take lab chemistry classes at Yale to learn basic lab techniques, I felt that CHEM 134L was sufficient. I do not feel that CHEM136L greatly improved my lab skills. For me, the main takeaway was the ability to statistically analyze experimental data to construct a 95% confidence interval, a skill that can be learned in an introductory statistics class. Overall, I found the class to be more of a source of stress and frustration than of fun and excitement. If you do take it, do not procrastinate on the lab reports (easier said than done), write down all the concentrations of lab materials, and make two copies of the experimental data.",

                "Yes, I would just make them aware of the length of some lab reports and recommend they start early",
                "No. This is a half credit that is more work than necessary, and largely busy work  there was very little I felt that I learned. I am glad I am done.",
                "Absolutely not.",
                "No because it was very frustrating",
                "If you expect to be spending more time in a lab, yes. This is a great course to learn the basics, especially since the TFs are so helpful. It also makes some topics in CHEM 165 and 167 clearer.",
                "Yes, it fulfills a lab requirement and the content matches what you are learning in general chemistry if both classes are taken concurrently.",
                "If they have never been in a STEM laboratory and would like to be in one in the future, I think this is a good introduction to developing the mindset needed to be in such an environment, as well as the analytical and graphical skills. It is a very good supplement to CHEM 165, and it actually helped me understand a lot of the material being covered in that class. However, the experiments are a bit disjointed and do not flow together.",
                "Yes I would I feel that it is an important course to take to get a better foundational understanding of general chemistry concepts.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It further develops lab skills in a forgiving environment and ensures you understand titrations.",
                "I would perhaps recommend this course to students interested in learning chemistry-related techniques or who have to due to prerequisites. However, I have felt that the workload of my gen chem lab classes is greater than my normal one-credit classes. The lab reports can be tedious.",
                "It was interesting but a TON of work. A good supplement to chem 165 but be prepared to spend a lot of your time on this class.",
                "i would only recommend it if you are very interested in chemistry or if you need it as a prereq. its workload does not reflect that it's only worth a half credit, and the lab reports take way too long. only if you need to",
                "No I would not because the workload is not worth the lessons learned.",
                "Yes, lab is so hands-on and a great learning experience.",
                "If it was required.",
                "I think if you are taking the lecture course, it is a supplement worth taking. However, I think it requires a lot of planning around the lab report deadlines if you are taking it alongside other hard classes. Definitely would only take if you are really committed to chemistry."
