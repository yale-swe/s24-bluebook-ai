                "This class offers a great overview of the Aeneid, situating the poem in its historical and political context and drawing out the finer points its literary style. I really appreciated the secondary scholarship articles, which exemplified the process of undertaking a very thorough and refined analysis of the text.  The pace was brisk but manageable, and the extra section meeting was very helpful for catching up on the Latin we didn't get to in class or continuing a discussion about one of the more complicated passages.",
                "I wish there was more time for discussion in both lecture and discussion section - the five quizzes ended up consuming many days of discussion on books of the Aeneid, which was unfortunate, and class time was often spent dwelling on minute translation problems or having the professor do most of the speaking on the text. The course also would have benefitted if there were another dedicated bridge Latin class this semester because the level of understanding of Latin grammar could differ sometimes greatly between students. The course could also have gone at a faster pace (reading more lines per class) especially by the end of the semester.",
                "I wish we spent more time discussing the passages rather than translating them in class.",
                "Amazing course! Not much to say in recommendation except maybe talking a bit more about the secondary sources in section",
                "Strengths: lots of communication, the insight Professor Freudenberg gives is incredible, I felt much better about analyzing Latin by the end\r\nWeakness: most of the class is spent translating which wasn't my favorite but pretty common in latin"

However, if youre a rising first-year, I would make sure that you feel confident in your grammar/vocabulary skills before taking this class. It was pretty intimidating taking the class alongside grad students, DS people, etc.",

Professor Freudenburg teaches with such passion and obvious love of the text, and the Aeneid always has more to give even to the most seasoned readers. Strongly recommend anyone with some experience in translating Latin poetry to try it out when it's next offered",
