                "Survey of the anglo-American poetic tradition. Particular focus on Keats, Tennyson, Dickinson, Hardy, and Frost. Also covered Wordsworth, Shelley, Coleridge, Browning, Whitman, Meredith.",

Learned how to close read poetry so critically and incisively it felt like I just learned how to read for the first time. You will learn so much about language and poetry just from watching Professor Bromwich parse a poem.",
                "The course covered a range of 19th- and 20th-century poetry and poetic criticism.",

                "The course is conducted in a way such that engagement really depends on the students. The weekly readings are a guideline for how many, which poems to read, and how in depth they should be read. Extra relevant poems and essays are provided in the course material, but one can absolutely get away with reading less/skimming. This is both the strength and weakness of the course. The course has a flexible workload and students can choose to really focus on certain poets depending on interest, on the other hand it is easy to do the bare minimum instead of taking time to read and think through every poem  before class which makes the seminar  interesting and valuable.",
                "David Bromwich and quality of seminar discussion. Readings are great, but can often feel disconnected from session to session.",
                "Strengths: professor Bromwich is so fantastic, entertaining, intelligent, etc. His ability to quote from the letters of poets off the top of his head made each class a truly unique experience. I thought this class really functioned as an ideal Yale seminar should: substantial amounts of lecturing from the professor that genuinely left me with a useful understanding of each poet, but not so much lecturing that it overpowered the class or prevented class discussion. The readings are so good and the discussion was always interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think having more structured assignemtsn would make completing the work easier; I didn't love the vagueness of the midterm journal assignment and the final paper (which was sorta up to your discretion) and would have preferred an actual prompt or at least more clear parameters.",
                "Great syllabus, great conversations. Just a perfect classic English class.",
                "The readings for this course were great, and Professor Bromwich is a fantastic seminar leader. If you can form your thoughts/opinions on the readings before class, you'll get more out of it.",
                "I can't recall any weaknesses. The strengths included the professor's prowess in literary analysis and ability to guide discussions.",
                "Strengths: class discussions were really interesting and everyone was engaging.  Weaknesses: Perhaps too many readings per week -- though the professor let us know which ones we were most likely to cover in class.",
                "The poetry was beautiful! That's the best part of the course. You read many of the greatest poets -- and you get to see how they influenced one another. You come away with a much fuller appreciation for poetry and how poets develop their style as they mature."

                "Definitely. David Bromwich is quite brilliant, and he takes effort to make comments and edits to your papers. If you are interested at all in the humanities, a class with him is a must take.",
                "Definitely! The readings are great (and very manageable) and Professor Bromwich is a professor you need to take a class with at Yale. This was the class I looked forward to attending the most, and I always left class feeling rejuvenated / as if I had taken away something valuable.",
                "Absolutely. Taking a class with Professor Bromwich will revolutionize the way you read. You will appreciate poetry and language profoundly more. The authors you read are foundational and valuable reading for their significant in intellectual history, but Bromwich will also leave you with many treasures of life lessons from beautiful interpretations.",
                "Yes. Professor Bromwich is a world-class critic of poetry, and the poems on the syllabus are great.",
                "I would. I think it offers a great foundation for those interested in the humanities and the professor is genuinely one of the best professors I have ever had.",
                "Absolutely! If you love poetry -- or think that you could grow to love poetry if exposed to brilliant poems -- this is a good course for you. The discussions were exciting and engaging. Professor Bromwich has a lot of wisdom to offer, and he guides the discussions clearly."
