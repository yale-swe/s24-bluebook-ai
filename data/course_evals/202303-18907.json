            "comments": [
                "STRENGTHS: Prof. Steinacker, written notes on Canvas for each class + video recordings, office hours, *the teaching fellows!*, study halls, exams were reasonable difficulty, test corrections on the midterms. WEAKNESSES: psets are long and more difficult than the exams (hard to do without office hours/peers)",
                "She sucks. Prof does not teach well. Rushed through a lot of content and assumes prior knowledge even though it is an intro course.",
                "The psets were really long but they taught a lot of the concepts well. I think that some of the questions were just mean though, where if you missed something small you would get it completely wrong.",
                "she is confusing and a little bit all over the place",
                "Challenging but engaging for those willing to put in the hard work.",
                "It is a well-made course but I will say that I spent a lot more time in office hours than I did doing anything else. I think one think that could be improved is posting the lecture videos for the whole semester at the beginning so that you can manage your time better and maybe work a little bit ahead when time allows.",
                "This course is so well taught!",
                "Strengths: Great teacher, large lecture environment. Office hours are great, TAs are super helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture style gets repetitive at times",
                "I honestly thought it was great. The professor is amazing and the TAs and all the resources are amazing, and while the homework problems are difficult, there are not that many of them every week and they can be worked through in office hours with a little effort.",
                "As a student who had never taken physics before, it would be helpful if concepts were explained as if I had never heard of them, especially force and momentum, because it felt as if I were expected to have at least a little experience beforehand. Also, it could be made clearer how concepts were related to each other and why they were taught in the specific order, especially when we got to orbits.",
                "Strengths: really good psets which really teach you and make sure you understand what's going on. TAs are the best - chill and helpful. Material is taught at a good pace and in a sensible order. Professor Steinacker is really nice and understanding and really shows her enthusiasm for science\r\nWeaknesses: I often found myself getting lost during the lecture or getting hung up on specific points that Professor Steinacker didn't elaborate on",
                "The professor is very engaging and posts lecture notes as well as videos. This is a very well designed course and I see no necessary changes.",
                "I think that the strengths of this course are both how well the topics are taught in connection with one another as well as the pace of the course. The fast pace requires that you understand the material, but each topic fluidly ties into the next which well-facilitated my understanding of the material.",
                "Strengths: Professor Steinacker- she is an excellent lecturer and extremely dedicated to helping her students succeed in this course; problem sets were difficult but provided a rigorous practice for the exams and building a physics intuition; test corrections were helpful in alleviating quite a bit of the stress of exams; lots of help from office hours for the students, no one should be doing poorly in this class provided you make use of all the resources at your disposal Weaknesses: While the homework was very helpful, it often felt more like we were doing algebra rather than learning physic, such that I think a more symbolic approach would be better for students looking to do well on the exams; know that the course is hard but I thoroughly enjoyed it but phys 170 may be better for premeds less interested in the engineering side; phys 200 would probably be better for a student who has already taken AP Physics C if they would prefer not to do the same things again",
                "Strengths: Professor Steinacker is the huge strength of this class. She is genuine and kind. Her lectures are engaging and funny and teach the material really well. She holds so many office hours and is so willing to help. The class policies are great also, the test corrections and exam curve. There are also study halls almost every evening staffed by TAs. This class was enjoyable and set up for me to succeed. I loved it.\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Professor Steinacker is wonderful! Very engaging. Great in class demonstrations. Wants to get to know her students. Funny and kind. Incredibly generous with curving the midterms so you are almost guaranteed to be set up going into the final with an A or A-.",
                "Strengths: well-organized teaching, emphasis on student-based learning and working with classmates, and thorough explanation of difficult concepts.\r\nWeaknesses: very fast paced especially for students with no previous physics background.",
                "Loved the professor and grading scheme was very clear. LOTS of office hours and TA help sessions and it really feels like she wants you to succeed. You don't feel pitted against your classmates and the physics demonstrations she did in class were a lot of fun. Kept me coming to every single lecture.",
                "This course is well taught. Dr. Steinacker has a deep understanding of the material and is a very engaging/encouraging professor. One way that this course could be improved is to provide more in class practice to check that the students are following along with the lecture. It could also be helpful if, before doing an examples in lecture, the professor stated why this problem was being done and the objective of the problem. Sometimes it was unclear if a problem was being done for a derivation of an equation or if it was an example of a type of problem we might need to solve on a problem set. Stating something like \"now we will do this practice problem because it is a helpful demonstration of the energy method. In this problem, we are given ___, ____, and ____ and we are hoping to solve for _____.\" would be helpful to orient the students before diving in.",
                "The strengths of this course are the professor and peer tutors. Professor Steinacker is an incredible professor who is engaging both during lectures and office hours. Her lectures include working through problems, class participation, and demonstrations. During office hours, she is always willing to support students alongside the peer tutors who are great supports! \r\n\r\nThe ability to revise midterm exams is also a strength of this course. Such a process allows students to learn from their mistakes and grasp a further understanding of the material.",
                "Weakness: Intensive workload. You HAVE to be at office hours almost daily to receive full points on the homeworks\r\nStrengths: The amount of teaching staff willing to help and the flexibility in support. I never felt alone in the course. The community building in office hours is also amazing.",
                "The strengths of this course are that there was a lot of office hours support for homework and that the grading on homework and tests was fair. The biggest weakness is that lecture is very confusing and we are not given the problems that the professor is solving on the board. She is solving a problem that we don't know what the question is so we are confused until we get to the answer, and even then it can be confusing."

                "Yes. Difficult but worth it. Prof. Steinacker is wonderful and the academic support system is fantastic. Test corrections help too. I also shopped 200 and I can say 180 is better because of the legendary Prof. Steinacker <3 and the grading system. Only take 200/260 if you're a physics major.",
                "Absolutely not. Horrible professor.",
                "Yes, if required. Mechanics is pretty boring to me though.",
                "Yes, as long as they like physics.",
                "I would take it if you need it, it is not a bad course. If you are especially good at physics this could just be a good credit because the grading scale is nice. Steinacker is a good teacher and she makes the class so that if you put in the time and effort you will get the grade.",
                "If you need the class for your major, yes.",
                "Most definitely! It was a pleasure to have learned so much from Professor Steinacker who is committed to creating an interactive and engaging learning environment.",
                "Absolutely if you need it for major.",
                "This is a prerequisite so I would not recommend it unless you absolutely have to.",
                "Yes, I think it's so great if you need to learn physics.",
                "Yes, but definitely go to office hours or make a study group for the psets.",
                "If you do not have a strong background in calc-based physics, I absolutely recommend this course. I had heard that this course was incredibly difficult and grueling, but I did not find that to be the case. The lectures are very easy to follow and stay engaged in, and are directly related to the homework problems. While the problem sets can be occasionally challenging, there are office hours every weekday for hours to ensure that everyone can make it and have their questions answered. Additionally, the challenge of the problem sets ensured a deep understanding of the concepts presented, making the exams much easier, as the questions were less in-depth.",
                "If you want to learn intro physics in a positive environment, this is the course for you. I don't think you have to be a physics major (I went into the course thinking I would major in the humanities) to enjoy this course, but you definitely have to be committed. The workload and challenge of this course is much too high if you just want a science credit.",
                "Absolutely, this is a highly engaging physics class. I would not however recommend this for someone who doesn't need to take it for their major or other requirements.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to an introductory physics, engineering, or applied sciences student at Yale College.",
                "Absolutely, any student that is interested in engineering or a non-physics science should definitely consider this course (200/260 may be better depending on your prior experience though, but shop both if you think you are on the fence). This course is time-consuming and requires a pretty consistently high workload but I don't think the problem sets were as bad s some people say that they are. In any case, taking a course with Professor Steinacker is a wonderful experience on its own, and for all the difficulties that intro physics may bring for some people, the amount of resources at a student's disposal means that no one should doing poorly in this class. This is a class that I think could be interesting \"for fun\" if you C/D/F or take it during a lighter semester, but there were only a handful of people doing so",
                "Absolutely! I recommend this class to everyone! Professor Steinacker is amazing. She is a fantastic lecturer and an amazing person. The support available for this class is tremendous. There are office hours with Professor Steinacker and TAs and ULAs almost every afternoon and study halls nearly every evening. You really feel like the focus is on learning the material. There are test corrections. If you are deciding between 170 and this class, you might want to consider that everyone in 170 is a premed who is very focused on their gpa and that was not the case in 180. I think our curve is a lot better. This class is amazing, mostly because of professor Steinacker. I could go on about it all day.",
                "Yes I would. Professor Steinacker made this class.",
                "Yes! Physics 180 is an amazing course both for students who need to take it for their majors, and those looking for enrichment in physics. You are well-supported by Prof. Steinacker and teaching staff. A thorough and gratifying course.",
                "Yes. 180 tends to scare people especially premeds but I found that the class was set up well and the grading scheme was clear and fair.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Most students take this class because it is a pre-requisite for other classes/majors, but it is very interesting and can be taken for fun.",
                "Yes I would strongly recommend this course to another student interested in taking physics. The course is very well organized and has many avenues to receive support. There are nearly five hours of office hours / study halls most days, which is incredible.",
                "I would say this course was difficult but I appreciated it so much in the end. It was worth the work I put in. I feel like I learned so much, and the professor wanted that for me."
