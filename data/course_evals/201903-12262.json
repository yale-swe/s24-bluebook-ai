   "comments": [
    "Readings, course load, flexibility and allowed scope of final project, and prof's knowledge on subject material are major strengths. Weaknesses are that we didn't really form a class community during class time. Seminar time could be made a bit more interactive, and also it would have been lovely to hear\/see everyone's final project if at all possible. That said, I appreciated that we got to really learn from Professor Renaud each seminar meeting from his own insights and comments on readings. He didn't just leave it all on the table for us fully, which can sometimes be frustrating in seminars.",
    "Renaud is amazing! He guides seminar discussion around a structured outline, so the discussion doesnt wander. One of the best seminars Ive ever been in as far as discussion.",
    "Awesome class with an awesome professor. Good balance of lecture and seminar."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! Good humanities credit and super well organized.",
    "Yes! You'll get to focus on really interesting ideas that make you think rigorously about the role of intellectuals in the world and decide for yourself what an intellectual can and should be. Also, the class is not stressful but you learn a lot and I really loved taking on my final project. I think if you take it, you'll really appreciate how Professor Renaud is open to different formats beyond an essay for the final. You can tell he wants students to feel in control of their learning and encourages them to be creative. In this class, professor Renaud is on your side as you learn and go through the weeks. Not out to get you or embarrass anyone if we didn't get to all the reading, either. Rather, he picks up where we fell short. There's an extreme compassion, confidence, cool, and care for students' holistic learning that is required for that. A refreshing experience with an awesome teacher. If the topic intrigues you, go for it.",
    "Definitely, if interested in history, philosophy, or social theory."
