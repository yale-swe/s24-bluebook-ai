                "Strengths: definitive daily schedule, activities to engage all parts of Spanish learning\r\nWeaknesses: lack of ELC options later in the semester, lack of consistency in activities across sections (ex. one section had to memorize a script for a given project while another section didnt have to memorize for the same project)",
                "The strict grading was certainly a weakness and the variation of grading across teachers. But quality and interest of assignments and topics was great",
                "Strengths: This course finally moves away from the textbook about a little more than halfway through the course, which is great. It also doesn't really focus on the textbook anyway, using Spanish-language world media to do most of the content bearing. The media was also pretty diverse, though I have some criticisms.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Like any of the Spanish courses there's just so much work. Even with the asynchronous day it can be difficult because you always feel burnout. The book you read at the end (El relato de naufrago) is kind of boring, especially considering the author (G.G. Marquez) is actually very good. The department is also not very accommodating with missing days, which is disappointing considering the emphasis in class seems to revolve around writing as opposed to speaking, which is useful in the academic world but not where most of the use will be for the majority of people in the course, which is speaking.",
                "The topics and larger assignments were engaging and felt more real than other language assignments Ive had. \r\n\r\nSupersite assignments were relatively an annoyance and there is likely a better method to learn the material because everyone is just trying to go through the supersite as fast as possible (people even find answers online unfortunately).",
                "Strengths: experience based learning, interesting topics and conversations, collaborative environment\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: assignments were sometimes tedious and felt like busy work",
                "It was a good Spanish course, with interesting material",
                "strengths: pushed for more participation, included a variety of projects; weakness: although workload was generally consistent, there were some weeks that were totally overwhelming because of an extra project on top of normally assigned homework"

                "Yes; I started the year not participating much, but I was encouraged to talk more and it really helped my Spanish speaking skills."
