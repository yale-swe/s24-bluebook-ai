Learned how to apply analytical concepts to actual research rather than more basic Psets. Learned SPSS coding. Was also good practice to read research and review papers each week to analyze them for discussion. For the final project: how to apply those statistical methods and write a research paper about it.",

                "so strong! great readings, assignments, lectures and discussions. No weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: Prof Cannon and our TA Jessie! Both were very flexible with meeting one on one at office hours. Prof. Cannon also brought donuts at the very last week of class and that was a huge plus. The content is difficult if you don't have much stats exposure, but you quickly get the hang of it after the difficult lab reports and then applying those concepts into your final paper.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lab reports can get quite confusing especially if you have no idea how to run or analyze data from SPSS, but it got much better once our TA started releasing rubrics so we know what to expect, and also because Jessie/Prof Cannon were super supportive and available meeting during OH. The final paper really sucked the life out of me (it took so long to write and finalize it), but I was just so proud of everything I had accomplished and learned towards the end, that it was really worth it.",
                "Overall great course and I appreciated the half lecture / half discussion format. I would have appreciated some more text / slides for the discussion portion, especially in early weeks. Good balance of types of work and the course was streamlined and accessible. Having posted rubrics for labs and later assignments was also super helpful. Weekly quizzes were great to consolidate knowledge at low stakes",
                "The class was very informative, and I really enjoyed the content. I do think that there could be some more time for a break or more opportunities for interaction during the lecture portion of the class",
                "The seminar style of this course made it really engaging and enjoyable. The small group prompted a lot of conversation and questions on class concepts, and we were able to collaborate on many parts of the final project which presented its own practical challenges and opportunities. The weekly quizzes were fair and made the grade breakdown manageable and ensured preparation for each class. Lab assignments and discussion papers provided opportunities to gain new skills and explore academic papers. The work distribution was very even and approachable, leading up to the final paper which combined a lot of the concepts and tools utilized for other assignments. I don't know how this course could be improved, it was really a great experience.",
                "Strengths: Challenging, but had different methods of evaluation, which was lovely (quizzes, discussion responses, reading, discussion, group project, presentation). No tests was super helpful for my learning. I liked the topic and the discussion.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, lectures were belabored upon to an unnecessary degree. Still, they were helpful for quizzes. We were also thrown into labs without much support, which was challenging, but I am glad I met with Jessie (the TF) to understand how to do the problems and get all my points. We could also have had a more nuanced discussion of what psychosis actually is. People just came to a consensus and then just kept agreeing.",

                "Great course to extend Psych background and apply more empirical statistics knowledge. Writing the final paper was especially good practice before working on the thesis, in particular how to structure Intro, Methods, and to present full findings. Dr. Cannon is so knowledgeable and still creates a welcoming environment and encourages students to learn about the subject he is an expert in.",
                "Yes. I feel like I learned a lot, and Professor Cannon really was passionate and knowledgeable about the topic.",

I always looked forward to class. The content is fascinating and the perspective provided by Professor Cannon made me significantly more excited and confident about research. Definitely a great course and a wonderful opportunity for psych and neuroscience students.",
                "Yes, it is the only course in PSYC that has taught me skills related to my thesis outside of PSYC 200, which was challenging things like how to structure a cohort study, how to evaluate cohort study findings, the best and worst structures for cohort studies, etc.",
