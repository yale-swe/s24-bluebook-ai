We also evaluated a lot of primary sources in the course, and I feel that I've gained skills in reading primary source material."

Our weekly discussion sections and the materials we read for them were very beneficial and a major strength of the course. Likewise, the lectures were effective and informative. As far as a weakness, while nothing stands out, I feel that the two shorter papers assigned in the course did not service the development of writing skills needed for other courses. A single, longer research paper may have been more beneficial."

                "I would recommend the course to another student, especially to a history major. The course, unlike purely American, European, or South American history courses, puts the regions in context and conversation together. The relationship between European and especially British and American history is studied extensively and a student would gain a lot of understanding of the relationship from this course. The course was weighted fairly between papers, section participation, midterm, and final. No one assignment would make or break a grade. The lectures were interesting and well-delivered."
