    "A good solid foundation of basic chem",
    "Basic introduction to general chemistry -- similar to AP Chemistry in high school. Mostly the same topics but more in-depth than AP Chemistry. Cover topics starting from the most basic building blocks (i.e. atoms, protons, neutrons, elections) all the way to thermochemistry, lewis structures, gases, solutions, stoichiometry, molecular structures, inter\/intramolecular forces, etc.",
    "I learned some basic chemistry.",
    "General Chemistry I and II introduces the fundamentals of chemistry with emphasis on scientific problem-solving skills. Students learn chemical principles, and apply these scientific principles to solve qualitative and quantitative problems.\r\n\r\nI especially learned how to synthesize problem solving skills from multiple chapter when solving word problems or complex problems on the exams. Learning how to put it all together rather than just answering questions per chapter.",
    "This course helped refresh, reinforce, and expand upon basic chemistry knowledge.",
    "Basic knowledge of chemistry, stoichiometry, atomic theory, chemical structures, solutions.",
    "I got a good understanding of chemical properties that help explain some of the things I see in everyday life.",
    "General knowledge of chemistry",
    "A deeper understanding of how the world functions (chemically, of course).",
    "Solid foundation in general chemistry. I feel more confident in my abilities now, and am eager to continue my learning in the chemistry sequence.",
    "I learned the general basic concepts within chemistry starting from atomic level, periodic trends, acid\/base, etc"

   "comments": [
    "Minimal interaction with classmates. After the first week it was customary to have video off even in discussion section, which eventually lead to the TA running through examples with only minimal interaction with the students. I think that discussion section should have mandatory videos on to have some semblance of an interactive face to face class. It would also help the TA a lot, bc talking to an empty void with almost no responses is NOT enjoyable",
    "Online format -- honestly, this was not bad! Great benefit was being able to go back and review lectures and watch videos of class again if I didn't remember how to solve something.\r\n\r\nOnly weakness was not being in person, but Prof. Cooper made it a great class!",
    "Put it at a time where west coasters dont have to get up at 6am. That made it hard to learn.",
    "Dr. Cooper is very organized and teaches the course well. Help is provided if you ask for it.",
    "Strengths - TopHat interactive format was very engaging and the immediate feedback was very helpful; lots of opportunities for \"free\" points (answering reading questions, group quizzes, etc)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - lots of material to cover in only 5 weeks. i feel that even 6 weeks would have helped the pace of the course",
    "Given the online circumstances of the course, I thought it was very well run and organized.",
    "The course builds on what you learn in the beginning, so it reinforces topics you already learned which leads to greater mastery over the subject.",
    "Great online adaptation",
    "Strengths:\r\nGreat professor, very engaging and helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nOnline",
    "Too much content in such a short amount of time. Lectures felt exhausting because it was really long and every day plus discussion sections",
    "Strength was course organization - Prof Cooper is keeps the course organized and communicates information well so that you always know what to expect. \r\nWeakness- Sometimes explanations for concepts will not be explained fully or to the extent to which necessary in order to answer Exam questions which as frustrating."

    "Yep. If you dislike gen chem like me, getting it over with during a 5 week session as opposed to a full semester is well worth it",
    "Yes! I took AP Chemistry in high school, and this was fairly similar in terms of concepts, but it was a great experience to review. If you want exposure to more basic chemistry, I would highly recommend! Also, TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR COOPER IF YOU CAN!!! HE IS SUCH A GOOD PROFESSOR! He's genuinely such a nice professor, really approachable and friendly, and he really cares about making sure people understand concepts. Also, he's a very fair grader, and he's very fair in terms of his expectations. He doesn't expect you to know\/memorize unnecessary things. Rather, he wants you to understand concepts and why\/how things work. Overall, this is a great class with Prof. Cooper. P.S. I'm saying this as a non-STEM major who was quite nervous about taking STEM classes at Yale. I have to say, even as a non-STEM major, I loved this class! Also, I'm a rising senior, so I've been through a lot of classes at Yale, and I gotta say that this was a really good one :)",
    "Yeah good intro chem class.",
    "I recommend this course to those that have not taken AP chemistry.",
    "Yes! Dr. Cooper is a great lecturer and really cares about the material and his students. He wants everyone to succeed and his teaching style makes the class both engaging and easy to understand. If you take it during the summer though you HAVE to stay on top of the work. This means you have to work on chemistry EVERY DAY because if you miss even one day, you will be incredibly behind and it's hard to make up. (I tried to do that and struggled a lot).",
    "Yes. Taking chemistry in a summer condensed version in addition to a remote learning setting is far from ideal but again, given the circumstances was very well run and easy to follow. I would recommend having some form of chemistry experience in the past, although I had only taken honors chemistry in the 10th grade and that was enough of a base to learn from. I don't think an IB\/AP level chemistry course is necessary to be prepared for this course.",
    "Yes! This was a good course the foundations of chemistry. The class wasn't too rushed or fast paced, so would be a good recommended science credit.",
    "Yes this class gives you a basic understanding of chemistry that is really good to know.",
    "Yes",
    "Definitely! This course is an excellent introduction into the field of chemistry and helps develop important skills for other courses beyond it",
    "Yes! It's a great way to learn chem.",
    "Yes, good course with a helpful instructor and TA.",
    "Requirement for most stem majors"
