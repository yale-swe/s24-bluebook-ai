                "I learned how to think more scientifically about the structure and usage of language in our everyday lives. I think a specific skill that I developed would be the ability to distinguish between different parts of phrases such as phonemes vs morphemes.",
                "Lots of introductory knowledge about linguistics. Unfortunately doesn't go very in-depth because there is so much to cover, but definitely a good survey. Gives both knowledge and skills--you will know more but also be able to put that to use and solve problems. Thinking about language also necessarily changes the way you think about the mind and the way you think in general.",
                "This is a truly lovely intro course. Prof Bowern is really wonderful, kind, and unbelievably knowledgeable. So you get all sorts of interesting insights to every topic and opportunities to dig deeper into things that peak your interest",
                "I learned all about the discipline of linguistics! Linguistics has a variety of subfields, and this course offers an introductory look at all of them. We learned a bit about writing systems, morphology, syntax, typology, semantics, pragmatics, language disorders, language change, historical linguistics, language endangerment, language origins, language acquisition, machine translation, phonology, and phonetics. As a prospective linguistics major, I was considering skipping this introductory course and jumping straight into other linguistics classes, but I feel like taking this course was a really great idea. It not only cemented my love for linguistics but allowed me to really figure out what specific sub-disciplines I was interested in. I feel like I would've been more afraid of semantics and pragmatics, for instance, had I not taken this courseI'm now planning to take both later on. Skill-wise, this course taught me to do everything from draw syntax trees, identify IPA consonants and vowels, perform morphological tests on sentences, analyze phonological data, and generally have fun with language.",
                "A lot about grammar and features that all languages share. I find myself saying \"in my linguistics class we talked about...\" quite often in daily conversation, which is weird but cool. You learn a decent amount without having to put in a ton of work (though there is certainly work in this class!).",
                "I learned more about the field of linguistics and how to apply the skills learned in class to real world data.",
                "This class was amazing as an introduction to linguistics even for those who do not plan to pursue a linguistics related major",
                "A great introduction to the topic of linguistics, dipping into a variety of linguistic subjects, like phonetics and phonology, syntax, semantics, historical linguistics, machine learning, language acquisition, et cetera. As someone looking into a linguistics major, it solidified my decision to follow that path. The course also strengthened my problem-solving skills--the PSETs require you to make assumptions based on a set of data, like solving a puzzle.",
                "Other ways of looking how language is produced: specifically regarding like the IPA chart with fricatives (manners and places of articulation); found my interest in the specific parts of linguistics, more specifically regarding the history, syntax, morphology, and writing system; has definitely helped me feel much more \"knowledgeable\" about everything language :)",
                "I am honestly not sure I retained anything from this class other than a handful of scattered terminology. I think during the class we touched on morphology, phonetics, phonology, and semantics. Again, these are just words to me at this point.",
                "Super super brief overviews of various branches of linguistics, but lowkey everything happened so quickly and so much vocab was dropped I really don't think I've retained much of it after taking the final.",

                "I learned to examine patterns within language, both in English and others I didn't think I would understand, as well as dismantle preconceived judgements regarding language use and the types of people who use them in different ways. I also learned how to understand the International Phonetic Alphabet, which I found interesting and useful for learning other languages.",

                "With this course you get a broad introduction to linguistics. I feel like none of the specific topics were explored in thorough depth, but with the amount of information we cover that would be impossible to achieve. This course is a lot of definition and concept memorization, but the Psets are all practice applying this knowledge. Coming out of this class, you are definitely able to analyze a data set of language in multiple ways.",

I learned to do basic classifications semantically and syntactically. I also gained at least a brief overview of almost everything liguistics-related.",

As it is now, the class can be a bit slow, and the material, at times, can be repetitive.",
                "I enjoyed the content of the lectures! The section was engaging and helpful.",
                "I think a strength would be the weekly Psets that allowed students to out information learned the week prior in to practice immediately. One weakness would be the structure of the course/lectures themselves as well as the sections. I found the overall structuring of lectures to be somewhat hard to follow and discussions in section did not seem to provide much clarity to convulsions of lecture.",
                "Strengths: the assignments and larger projects structured the class well. Weaknesses: lectures were not really engaging.",
                "Strengths: generous, fair, and consistent grading. Interesting material. Smart and approachable professor. Organized class materials. Easy but relevant assignments that are focused on learning not on difficulty.\r\nWeaknesses: could go deeper about many interesting subjects, but this is obviously hard in a survey.",
                "Really nice breadth of topics! Prof Bowern is the real magic of it because of her thoughtful presentation. The psets are honestly kind of fun !",
                "Some of the linguistics skills we learned were cool! But this course did not always feel the most engaging, given that most lectures were dry and just based off slides, and section was optional and would go really slow as well. The psets were not so fun to do because they took a while and a lot of times nit-picky points were taken off, even though I didn't feel like I was learning much through many of the questions.",
                "This is a really great course. It's main strength is the fact that it offers such a comprehensive overview of linguisticsI really appreciated this, and I feel like I learned a ton. Despite being a relatively large lecture, Professor Bowern really made it quite easy for students to stay engaged in the material. There were a lot of opportunities to ask clarifying questions about the weekly PSets and learn fun new information about languages. The Slack channel really helped. I don't know if this course had any major weaknesses, except maybe its length? The classes were an 1 hour 15 minutes long, and even though I love linguistics a lot, I still found myself starting to zone out during like the last ten minutes. I don't know if that can really be helped though, as we kind of had a lot of really fascinating material to cover and often ended up cutting stuff out, which saddened me a little bit.",
                "Strengths: You get to learn about a lot of topics in linguistics. There is A LOT of course content, which made studying for the final quite overwhelming, especially since there were no other test assessments during the semester. Prof Bowern is fair, understandable, supportive, passionate, and knowledgeable. Lectures were also recorded, which was great for schedule flexibility and ever-changing health guidelines.\r\nWeaknesses: I found the lectures to be round-about and a little bit hard to follow. I think it would help if the lecture slides had more concrete information and conversational bullet points. For example, a clear \"here is a term and here is the definition and here are examples\" would be nice. I also found that Prof Bowern often went off on tangents and went ahead of the lecture slides. And so when they did get to the lecture slide, they had to restate and resay what they had already said. They clearly have a lot of knowledge - and often get ahead of themselves in explaining it. It made the lectures hard to follow and made it unclear what was important for class and what was bonus knowledge.",
                "please be more CLEAR. I get that linguistics as a whole is very vague, with exceptions everywhere, but every problem set felt like it needed clarification, and points were taken off for unnecessary reasons. Some topics (arguments vs adjuncts, trees) felt rushed / not explored well, but maybe that's the nature of an intro class.\r\n\r\nCourse material is a LOT - please consider final paper or open-note final exam for future iterations of this class\r\n\r\nOtherwise else, Claire is really phenomenal and a great professor. Jeremy really shines here as a TF - try to get him if you can, he's exceptionally awesome",
                "The lectures were very detailed and informative. There was an ample amount of help available, and the Professor is very passionate about what she teaches.",
                "This class covered a lot of material in the best possible way",
                "The PSETs were extremely helpful and feedback was clear; I always knew the reasons for my scoring. The lectures were also very engaging and Professor Bowern is passionate about her work, which made the class way more exciting. It's difficult to think of improvements, really. The way the class is structured made it very easy for my questions to be answered, so I never felt lost.",
                "Weaknesses: linguistics is a topic that could be SO interesting and this class completely killed my interest (and my friends' interest) in it with an overload of vocabulary. We breezed through all the subcategories (morphology, typology, phonology, etc.) with maybe two lectures for each, and then promptly forgot about them because she never referenced them again. Lectures were not engaging because we were literally reading from slides, and section (which was optional) was normally incredibly unhelpful. I went to one of the review sessions right before the final and the people in there were at once the most confused and the least interested I have ever seen in a class at Yale. Lastly, the organization of the content was super counterintuitive. The only strengths: 1) the midterm was a project on a language of choice, which was kinda interesting and 2) if you're somehow forced to take this course, Jeremy the TF is the only redeeming factor. Do not do section with Mindy.",
                "The content and problem sets were very engaging",
                "Strengths: Problem sets were actually really fun to do. The material was really interesting to me. Professor Bowern is clearly super knowledgeable. The midterm project was fun. Weaknesses: Section felt kind of useless, and didn't really enhance my learning at all.",
                "While I feel a bit neutral about the course, I found the use of PollEv to be a little inconvenient as it would sometimes malfunction or be confusingly inaccessible at certain times. However, I did appreciate having the Slack channel to look over questions from other students, ask a few of my own, and to stay updated on announcements about class.",
                "Strengths: Lectures were easy to follow and engaging, lectures published online,\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some questions on the final exam (the conlang question) were mentioned very briefly in the lectures/slides",
                "I thought the problem sets were quite good in general except for an occasional lack of clarity in phrasing. \r\nOften lectures would cover exactly the same material as in readings, making them fairly redundant and uninteresting.",
                "The lecture format made it not as interesting of a class, but discussion section helped with this.",
                "I enjoyed this course and found the material very interesting. No major complaints.",
                "The organization of this course is great. The main topics are clearly laid out and the PowerPoints used in lecture are helpful. The best thing about this course are the psets. I feel like the psets are very fair and a great and interesting way to apply what you have learned. I think this course could be improved if the discussion sections were more structured.",
                "I liked the whole setup of the class and the emphasis on the importance of the problem sets.",
                "Every week was clearly structured and the P-sets are designed to deepen understanding and have you engage thoughtfully with the material. The lectures themselves can be somewhat monotonous so drink a coffee before!",
                "Strengths: Between the content-heavy lectures, the example/application based sections, and the primarily independent p-sets, this class had a very nice balance. I never spent too much time on this class, so I it never caused me much stress. The midterm was also a nice contrast compared to typical Yale midterms. Researching a language and presenting your findings based on class-content was very interesting and fun! Weaknesses: There was a ton of content during lecture. I appreciated the polleverywhere.com activities, but I wish that there had been a lot more so that there was more interaction.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-Very interesting content and enjoyed the breadth of topics covered\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-Would have more practice problems with solutions available for students (e.g., releasing parts of the textbook solution answer key)",
                "Strengths - really enjoyed the focus on machine learning and NPLs, Great lectures, awesome to have all the recordings up for review.\r\nImprovement: lecture slides could be a bit easier to follow on their own (more information in the notes section perhaps?)",
                "Strengths: There were a lot of options for office hours. Sections were slightly structured but left time for questions. We covered a lot of topics and really introduced the subject in a way that showed how versatile it was. Slides were posted for each lecture, making it easy to follow along. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think sections should have been slightly longer, like one full hour. I really wish we had talked more about options for linguistics majors in different careers. I also wish we spent a bit longer talking about language disorders. The professor could have been slightly more engaging in lectures.",
                "strengths: the lectures were well taught and easy to follow. Prof. Bowern made lectures interesting and was very receptive to answering questions. The weekly assignments and the midterm and final were very fair assignments testing what we had been taught and were not too overwhelming. You learn a lot of interesting material about a relatively specific field. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: I found some of the material and assignments a little bit tedious at times, but that might have been because I was not as interested in the particulars of phonology for example. I might have preferred a little bit more time spent on the psycholinguistics portion, but that is probably just my own personal interest. \r\n\r\nOverall I found the class quite enjoyable and I learned a lot",
                "Very well organized and good sections. No weaknesses, maybe a lectures got a bit slow sometimes",
                "The courses assignments seemed quite appropriate. I think that it could have been more engaging at times.",
                "The course was well structured and super accessible!\r\n\r\nOne small weakness was that the PollEverywhere lecture participation questions were pretty glitchy/hard to use--but I understand this is going to be remedied in future semesters.",
                "felt  a little overly technical and detached at times, but maybe that is the nature of the course itself",
                "I loved the insights of Professor Bowern and how many office hours there were. I cannot think of a downside to the class.",
                "Strengths: a vast number of topics where I walked away feeling like I had a good grasp of linguistics\r\n\r\nWeakness: some of the class would be taken over by a question and a long response",
                "I wish that the sections were more interactive.",
                "Strengths: light workload (usually just a 2-3 hr pset each week), clear lectures, accessible prof/TFs willing to answer questions/help with psets throughout the week, all class materials available on canvas (lecture recordings, readings, section handouts)\r\nWeaknesses: None? can be easy to fall behind on reading though as it's not always needed to complete psets"

                "If the student is certain that they are interested in linguistics definitely. If they are unsure, I would recommend they think about what they want to gain from this class. It is very much a wide ranging, covering the bases style of class, and everything you learn in lecture is not always conceptually applied.",
                "Not at all unless it's required for your major. I think I just have a lot of beef with linguistics as a field.",
                "I would only recommend this course if it was required for a major.",
                "Yes--it's interesting, a light amount of work, generously graded, and fun.",
                "Yes if Prof Bowern is teaching it!! She treats students like actual human beings and gives so many opportunities to dig deeper into the material if you want.",
                "If you really love linguistics, then yes. There were some interesting lectures but to me it felt more efficient to learn through the pre-recorded lectures at 2x speed. I wish the class would be more interactive.",
                "TAKE THIS COURSE!!! LINGUISTICS IS AWESOME!! Ok, maybe I'm a bit biased. I am a linguistics major. But even if you've never heard of linguistics, even if you don't like learning languages (note: you don't have to know a ton of languages to do linguistics. You really don't), even if you're just in it for the social science credit, take this course. Language is really fascinating, and Professor Bowern does a really excellent job making the material interesting and engaging. The PSets aren't a huge time commitment. I honestly kind of started to look forward to them, because they felt a bit like fun puzzles and gave me an opportunity to apply what I was learning in class. The midterm project is really quite fun as well: you get to do a deep dive into the structure of a language of your choosing. And the final...well the final ended up being online, but I feel like even that would've been enjoyable had it been in-person. Overall though, I felt really supported by my TF and by the professor, and I'm super excited to take more linguistics classes next semester.",
                "I would not recommend this course. It was more work than it seems on CourseTable and it was quite literally learning grammar for every language. I was more interested in the sociopolitical implications of language and how language is used. This is NOT the focus of this course. This course is much more technical - as if preparing for academic linguistics instead of just \"for-fun\" linguistics. If you are interested in linguistics based on how people use language, take another linguistics class.",
                "No - material is hard, final exam is extremely challenging. Take if there is no final exam",
                "I would recommend this class if you have a vague interest in linguistics. It is not a very high workload, and you can gain a lot from lectures. This is an introductory class, so it covers a wide berth of topics. While there will likely be some units you dont find very interesting, there will also be many that are very enjoyable.",
                "I would recommend to any student in Yale college to take this class",
                "Absolutely. If you're considering linguistics, whether as a major or just as something that interests you, you should take this class (especially if Professor Bowern is teaching it). It's a good overview, the workload always felt manageable, even alongside busier classes, and (from my experience) the atmosphere is very friendly and inviting.",
                "Oh god no. \r\n\r\nThat being said, this class was not particularly difficult so if you want to hate yourself but get an easy A, by all means, go for it.  but be warned.",
                "The road to hell is paved with good intentions.",
                "Yes! It's very interesting, even for non-majors, as long as you're interested in language.",
                "Yes, it is a good introduction to a very interesting field of study.",
                "For those with some interest in linguistics, definitely. It isn't a huge amount of work, and you will learn a lot!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. While some might believe linguistics is a way of overthinking about language, there are a lot of interesting subtleties and patterns to be found with a closer look. More generally, it's both interesting and helpful to debunk certain myths about language use and users as you progress through the course (i.e. prescriptive grammars and folk linguistics).",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this course to prospective linguistics or cognitive science majors.",
                "No, I think i would have jumped directly into syntax or phonetics if I were to do it again. I was somewhat familiar with some of the basics of linguistics and I think my time might have been spent in one of those classes.",
                "Yes, if they would like to see what exactly entails linguistics.",
                "Yes, anyone interested in learning more about human communication will benefit from taking an introductory course in linguistics.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I took this course purely out of curiosity for the subject and I was not disappointed. The psets are fun but also challenging, so I recommend forming a study group. The workload is not heavy and you get to do your own research for the midterm project which was a rewarding challenge.",
                "Yes. It was nice to learn about something that I use every day.",
                "Yes but probably only if you are interested in majoring in cognitive science or linguistics.",
                "It's always a good idea to take a class that you would normally never take, especially when it comes to satisfying distributional requirements. This class was a really interesting intro course to linguistics, and because it covered so much, you truly end up getting an appreciation for the science of language. Whether you're a ling major or not, it's perfect for a basic intro course.",
                "Yes! Fantastic course that I've already recommended to many peers.",
                "Anyone remotely interested in languages or linguistics would enjoy this course - it covers a range of topics and is sure to have something for everyone.",
                "I would recommend this course to anybody interested in learning new language facts or considering the major. I think it really gave a good overview to a lot of interesting topics and opened my eyes to new ways of thinking. However, the first couple weeks were pretty dry as we were talking about things that aren't necessarily new and interesting (a lot of it was assigning rules to things we already knew intuitively). If you already know a bit about linguistics and are looking for courses slightly more specialized, this might not be the course for you. It is, however, one of a couple courses that are required for a lot of higher level ones (as in, you can take LING 110 or one of the other intro ones).",
                "If you have never taken a linguistics class before and are looking for a good introduction to the field I think this is a really great class to take. I had never done anything related to linguistics, but I was vaguely interested in it and wanted to try it out. I found this class quite enjoyable and feel like I learned a lot.",
                "if you like linguistics yes",
                "I would if they were interested in linguistics. Otherwise it is not the most engaging but it is still worth taking for a little bit of knowledge.",
                "Yes! Would definitely recommend to any students curious about linguistics/how language works and is looking for an accessible intro to the topic.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students. I thought that the material was well explained, relatively easy to follow, and learning was well-supported by all (professor and teaching fellows made themselves extremely available for assistance with any and all questions -- the classroom slack channel was an especially nice supplemental part of the course, providing students with an additional way to quickly ask and get responses on problem sets, etc.)",
                "not unless you know you're going to major in this or if you're curious. just so technical",
                "I would! It would a great way for a non linguistic major to dip their toe into the field.",
                "Maybe, it was a great class but would often get quickly off-topic and I would get confused about what was important or not.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in linguistics, it is very low-stress and a great introduction to all aspects of linguistics, covering all questions I had previously.",
                "Of course! Especially if you have never considered studying linguistics before - I hadn't. Even if you're not a linguistics major, you'll likely find one of the topics interesting enough to take a few higher-level classes in. The class covers a new linguistics sub-discipline each week (syntax, semantics, morphology, phonology, phonetics, etc.) but also relates linguistics to computation, psychology, cognitive science, philosophy, sociology - something for every kind of student"
