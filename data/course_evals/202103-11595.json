                "Strengths: Collaborative classroom environment, encouraging atmosphere, teaching style from the professor, everything!",
                "It presented phonological and grammatical rules in a progression that made a lot of sense. Our teacher was patient and helpful. \r\nSometimes I wish we learned more informal ways of speaking so that it would be easier to understand everyday Korean speech, but I understand that it may make more sense to learn the more proper forms first.",
                "I believe the course can be improved if the textbook correlated more with the curriculum. That or the textbook should only be used for its dialogues as lesson examples.",
                "Strengths: loved the curriculum + variety of learning and testing methods, workload was very good (for the most part). Teaching and development of section camaraderie was excellent. Providing a more clear overview of all assignments in the syllabus and giving homework deadlines a little further in advance would be appreciated (e.g. oral presentations, especially those in groups)."

Unless you actively practice with peers and/or consume Korean media throughout the semester, you won't have long-term usage of the language.",
