Some more interesting lectures on Congress' war-making powers and budget allocations came later in the semester. I found the section part of the course to be the most engaging, where we discussed our perspectives on the current functioning of Congress and potential systematic changes.",

This class certainly helps develop a more realistic understanding of what motivates legislators.",

                "I learned a great deal more about the inner-workings of Congress.  While we certainly did learn the standard civics class stuff like how a bill becomes a law, we also discussed how committees worked and  the role of the Senate majority leader.  We learned a lot about how Congress really works and how it, at times, doesn't worked.  We learned about campaign finance and the various pressures which influence a Congressperson.  We also learned about the relationship between the Legislative branch and the other two branches, from both a practical and theoretical perspective, with a lot of attention payed to the Founders and their intentions.   I essentially learned about Congress, its history and changes, and how its rules and procedures have affected the Legislative branch as an institution."

                "Strength - Professor Fairdosi is an engaging lecturer and section was helpful\r\nWeakness - n\/a",
                "Strengths: great discussion during section that guided us to question both the intentions of the Founders as well as the structure of the legislature as it stands today; highly manageable workload; ability to choose your own topic for term essay\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were posted at random times which made it difficult to know what to have prepared for discussion in section",
                "Strengths: very interesting content; active section discussion \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not much engagement with the instructor",
                "Professor Fairdosi's lectures were incredibly insightful and straightforward. This class provides a very fundamental view of Congress, so it requires absolutely no prior knowledge to understand the content. By far the biggest strength was how the material was presented to allow everyone to grasp the content. Professor Fairdosi is an absolute delight, and his attitude towards his class is unmatched. One of the weaknesses of the class was that some lectures were not as organized because Professor Fairdosi used a very basic outline for his lectures. However, because of the virtual format, much of the disorganization seemed to be caused by Professor Fairdosi's anticipation of the questions students might have, which was very helpful.",
                "Strengths: wide range of topics relating to Congress. Weaknesses: I wish there were more structure and feedback in the course.",
                "Strengths: The course is super chill and I never had to stress about it. Amir's teaching style is very clear, simple, and concise. He's also really generous with grading and giving extensions. \r\nWeaknesses: The course felt disorganized. Lecture videos weren't uploaded consistently and sometimes communication in terms of assignment clarifications was poor. I think the course could benefit from adding a Piazza forum.",
                "This course could benefit from more live interactions, assuming this model of learning continues. As it stands, the method of uploading recorded lectures and then discussing them in section prevents any sort of coherence across all sections.",
                "The course is absolutely fascinating and has really great content. Teachers are excellent, but the lectures could have more visual aids.",
                "The lecture content was organized and easy to follow. The readings and DOLS book was extremely helpful for finding more information and Professor Fairdosi's lectures were enjoyable to watch. One possible improvement could be to have live lectures with recordings available to rewatch later it may make it easier to stay engaged during a remote class. However, the recorded format did work well and it was easy to ask any follow up questions during section.",
                "Strengths\r\n-->Learn a lot about how Congress really works\r\n-->Learn about all of Congress' faults as well as possible solutions to these issues\r\n-->Gain a deeper understanding of the political process as a whole, since Congress plays a fundamental role as the branch which actually writes laws, controls the funding of the other two branches, and controls the deployment of the military through the War Powers Clause\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-->N\/A"

                "Yes, but it is perhaps more introductory information that one would be expecting. The discussions in section, midterm prompts, and paper topic (of your choice) all were intellectually interesting and made the course a lot better.",
                "Yes. Very interesting content for anyone interested in U.S. government. Prior knowledge is not assumed.",
                "Absolutely! If you are even remotely interested in how Congress works, without the insane workload of most poli sci courses, take this course! Professor Fairdosi is extremely engaging and provides a fundamental view of the legislative branch that allows you to truly understand what motivates legislators. There is absolutely no sugar coating in this class and it provides a very blunt understanding of how one approaches their work in Congress, and what drives the institution.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in taking a survey course on Congress. However, if there are any specific areas in Congress you're interested in, I would recommend finding a seminar that goes more in-depth.",

                "Yes I really loved that it was a course highly focused on delivering knowledge to students and engagement with content. I always enjoyed section and the lectures taught me so much I did not previously know, but are crucial to understanding the functions of the US government!",
                "Certainly!  Even if the student isn't particularly interested in politics, this course offers a very important introduction to how Congress actually works.  Seeing how Congress is an incredibly important institution in our Federal government, someone who doesn't know anything about politics will learn enough to at least understand how our government works by the time they're done with this class if not develop a strong interest in politics.  For Political Science students, this class will be a very interesting and deep dive into Congress as an institution which plays an integral role in our government and is a real mover-and-shaker with regards to national public policy and which affects the other two branches deeply."
