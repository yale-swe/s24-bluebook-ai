    "This is probably my favorite class I've taken at Yale and I am a Senior! I learned so much about art history from such a passionate and charismatic professor. In addition, sections in the YUAG and the YCBA were fantastic with a knowledgable and well-prepared TA.",
    "I learned about various European artists from 1250 up to 2017. Additionally, I understood the strong tie that art has with history.",
    "I learned all about how western art evolved over many centuries, from medieval Christian works to modern sculpture and abstract expressionism. I can identify where art is from and in which time period it was made, and understand the skills and trademarks of some of the world's most influential artists.",
    "I was stunned about how much I learned in this course, given that I took AP Art History in high school. I gained immense knowledge on works I had never studied, as well as a deeper understanding of works I had previously studied. I improved my essay writing skills--notably visual analysis. Professor Barringer also does a great job of providing different perspectives when analyzing art. I learned how to pick up on underlying racial, social, or feminist commentary in works that aren't blatantly political. I feel much more confident going into upper-level art history courses after this course.",
    "Knowledge of art history - major movements, artists, periods, styles, etc. \r\nHow to write about art",
    "This was the first Art History course I had ever taken, and coming out of it there's a chance I may include it in a double major. It's a fast moving course going all the way from the end of the 13th century all the way to the present, but the lectures do a great job of emphasizing the most important aspects of each time period and the key works of art. The focus on how each of the art movements and time periods connect and weave into each other is also very interesting.",
    "I learned how to look at art; how to compare one piece of art to another; how to follow art through time and space; and how to simultaneously be admiring and critical of individual artists and works.",
    "A greater appreciation of art and a deeper understanding of the forces that shaped art history. We also gained the tools of visual analysis that makes going to museums a lot more interesting.",
    "This class has been a transforming experience for me. I learned to appreciate art. My mind will never ever be empty in front of am artwork.",
    "I learned how to think about and learn from art.",
    "This was a course that I describe to others as \"enriching\". The things you learn are not necessary for really anything, but they are essential for having an appreciation of art and Western culture and history, which enriches your life and enhances everyday experiences by being able to understand the art we see around us everyday.",
    "I developed a good grounding in the history of Western art, and I developed skills in writing about, researching, and looking at\/talking about art.",
    "This was the first ever course I'd taken in Art History. I learned so much about how to approach artwork, as well as how to analyze it in its historical context. I found the content very engaging and exciting. I am very enthusiastic about taking further courses in art history.",
    "To appreciate art!",
    "I learned how to analyze a piece of art beyond a cursory glance and understand how it fits into its historical context. I also learned how to form these thoughts into essays.",
    "I learned how to do visual analysis and incorporate research materials in a longer, thesis-driven paper. \r\nEspecially when it came to 20th-century modernism\/post-modernism, I discovered that works don't really exist in isolation or without historical context. I was surprised how even the most outlandish pieces of art, like DuChamp's Fountain for example, belong to movements and take part in a fascinating dialogue about society and the meaning of art.",
    "A pretty comprehensive overview of Western art",
    "This course provided an excellent overview of art history, detailing most of the major movements from the Renaissance until the modern day. The assignments taught how to write about and appreciate artistic works on an academic level, and it placed major works and movements within their historic contexts.",
    "Ability to understand (surface level) art from every influential art movement from the Renaissance to now. Extremely useful information, absolutely FANTASTIC course!!!!!!!",
    "I feel as though I can now walk into a museum and stand in front of any artwork and actively analyze it and try and understand the meaning behind the artist's interpretation. It's an incredibly valuable skill that I'm grateful to now possess. Furthermore, I feel as though I have a greater understanding and genuine appreciation of how art has progressed, evolved, and grown over time.",
    "I learned how to better appreciate, analyze, and understand art of many different eras.",
    "This course was amazing! I learned so much more about art than I ever thought possible, from technique and use of color to artistic movements and cultural inspirations. I found myself walking around afterwards and thinking about these things when seeing art in my day to day life. I also learned a lot about the cultural importance of art and artists and how it has shaped the world.",
    "Just like its title says, this course really does teach a broad overview of Western art. It covers a lot of material while also teaching the basics of speaking\/writing about art. Totally manageable for someone who knows nothing about art, though.",
    "Having no background in art history, I gained an entirely new perspective on art. This class is a must take for people hoping to better understand the history of art, and to become better viewers of art.",
    "This course taught me how to analyze art, in a visual, historical, and political manner. Because of this course, I approach artistic works with a deeper appreciation as well as knowledge of what to look for and how to understand certain concepts.",
    "Develops skills in how to look at art with technique and context in mind",
    "Basic knowledge on how to analyze and critique art.",
    "I gained a broad overview of the history of art, the changes throughout time, and many different notable artists. I also learned how to analyze a painting or work of art more critically, and I'm now able to appreciate art in museums more fully.",
    "This is an amazing overview of Art History. It covers a huge range but you learn so much. The best class I've taken.",
    "I learned SO MUCH in this class. Wow. It covers a comprehensive history of western art, and Prof. Barringer is very deliberate in including relevant non-western influences as well. I was already familiar with a large number of the artists we covered since Im an obsessive museum-goer, but I completely underestimated how much I would gain from taking a formal class on them. You get a sense of historical narrative and art development, as well as specific insight into artistic movements and artists. I really feel that I have never had a class where I learned as much as I did in HSAR 115.",
    "This is the classic intro art history class from Renaissance to contemporary art. We learned how to evaluate pieces of art visually and historically.",
    "Go to analyze a work of art and appreciate art in its beauty and technique and appreciate the artists point of view as well as learn how the context of history had such a dramatic effect on art",
    "This class is a great opportunity to learn a little bit about how to talk about art. With a heavy focus on Europe, but quick forays into other parts of the world, this class discusses art history trends from about the 1400s to the present. The class, particularly towards the second half, discusses some of the racial, social and gendered aspects of art history.",
    "A deeper appreciation for renaissance art and a greater capability of analyzing art.",
    "A basic knowledge of art from the Renaissance to the present.",
    "I learned how to make connection between art of different styles and historical periods and to discuss, write about, and memorize art.",
    "This course did a great job in covering all major artwork in the Western world from the Renaissance on. From realism to abstract expressionism, you cover all the major art movements in the last few hundred years. I now actually understand what I am looking at when I go to art museums. The lectures are amazing and with the amazing art galleries at Yale, it was the the overall the best course I've taken here so far.",
    "Definitely improved abstract thinking \r\nDefinitely learned about art periods and styles",
    "I developed a greater understanding of fine art, and gained the skills necessary to properly appreciate art.",
    "Absolutely loved this class. The discussion also made it even better.",
    "Survey of artistic movements, historical movements and specific artists\/paintings from Renaissance-present. Art in its social context."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are the content, professors, and TAs. The one weakness I would say is that Professor Barringer always went over time. I love the content and would love more art, but it is difficult when you have other classes and things to get to. If they extended the time to maybe an hour and 15 minute lecture twice a week, this could help fit in all the material.",
    "Strengths: lectures, discussion sections in the art gallery, slides\r\nWeaknesses: too much memorization for exams",
    "The professor was extremely engaging and had a great sense of humor! This made the material much more fun to learn.",
    "A great strength of the class is the section. The class takes advantage of the availability of Yale's huge collection of art. In the section, we are able to see art in real life, including some of the ones we discuss in lecture. Students engage directly with the class material itself.",
    "Strengths: Insightful professor, fascinating lectures, well-rounded (encompasses a wide variety of art and artists), organized, inspiring. The weekly discussion sections in the YUAG or the Center for British Art were absolutely incredible. Seeing the works\/artists discussed in lecture first-hand is a rare opportunity given to us by Yale's incredible resources. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Felt like deadline between the last two papers was too close together. I was in a major time crunch to do my research for the 10-page paper.",
    "Despite the large size of the class, they actually managed to create a good learning environment. I think this had a lot to do with sections in the Yale Art Gallery which are very engaging with about 8 students. It is the time when you really get to use the knowledge you have learned in lecture and put it into practice. The lectures were very interesting as well - Tim Barringer is a wonderful lecturer and always adds in fun and engaging comments, stories, and tidbits.",
    "Intro art history is great. The lectures are engaging; section was a truly once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; and, while stressful, the papers were a neat way to dive deeply into specific artists and works of art. The only weaknesses I would identify are that a) the class is hard to Credit\/D effectively (I still felt as though I put a lot of time and effort in!) and b) section quality varied wildly from what I have heard from classmates.",
    "The class is amazing! Prof Barringer is clearly deeply knowledgable and passionate about the subject, which really brings the artwork alive and makes lectures incredibly fascinating and engaging. Section helped a lot with building up our skills of visual analysis. \r\nThe final was kinda of annoying when we had to remember all the dates of 40+ artworks, but it wasn't too bad.",
    "The strength is definitely the sections in YUAG and YCBA. I look forward to them every week.",
    "Incredible lecturer, good survey course",
    "I loved the lectures and sections I don't think it could be made much better!",
    "The course is arranged well. I like that the papers get progressively longer and are worth more. I also think the standard memorization requirements for the exams are good.",
    "The strengths of this course are Professor Barringer's amazing lectures and the fact that sections happen in the Yale Art Gallery, so you can look at and engage with actual art. The only weakness I can think of is that the work could have been spread out a bit more evenly over the semester: there was very little work at the beginning and then a lot at the end, including both a final paper and a final exam.",
    "While the work requirements during the semester were quite a lot, with the exception of readings, I found the sheer volume of content covered and assessable on the examinations to be overwhelming. This is largely because of the period of historical content covered in the course.",
    "Biggest strength is its section in the YUAG. Getting to interpret works in front of us is so helpful to gaining the practical skills of the class. As far as the lecture goes, I think we all know Professor Barringer is the strength. He is such an interesting lecturer and manages to distill up to a century of art in one 50-minute lecture with clarity, depth and humor.",
    "I feel so lucky to have taken this course at Yale with the resources of the YUAG and the YCBA. Section trips to the galleries complimented lecture beautifully and made learning much more personal\/hands-on. \r\nI think lecture and section compliment each other wonderfully. \r\nI also like how with the papers we started with a simple visual analysis and worked to 10-page, 6-source, 3-work research paper.",
    "Barringer is a fantastic lecturer, but it's easy to just not pay attention in class",
    "The lecture and the corresponding sections in the YUAG were both insightful and engaging. Professor Barringer did an exceptional job budgeting his time for an otherwise daunting amount of material.",
    "There is no way it can be improved. I truly believe this is the most incredible class at Yale.",
    "The strengths of this course is the infectious and passionate professor and teaching assistants. The weekly sections to analyze pieces in the art galleries is also another strength of the course. The weaknesses of the course include the pieces and needed information for taking  the midterm and final. Knowing all of this information is a bit overwhelming at times.",
    "I thought that the primary strength of this course was Prof. Barringer. He was funny, engaging, passionate, and opinionated, all of which made the course extremely engaging. The eras surveyed were also extremely interesting, as was the end of the course when we began examining more contemporary artists, some of whom are still active today. My only complaint was that it took place in the YUAG, where the seats had no desks and the lighting was very dim, but that was resolved once it was moved to the YCBA.",
    "Section is fantastic, only at Yale could we have this opportunity. Lectures are all fantastic.",
    "I think the course is very well taught and is easy to follow. The organization of having work names of slides on a separate sheet of paper greatly helped with note taking. The course did feel a bit rushed at times, however. This could be improved through either allotting it a longer time-slot or covering less works during each lecture.",
    "Professor Barringer's lectures were amazing: clear, engaging, and always interesting.",
    "I liked how our sections were in the Yale art gallery, it was a really good way to engage with the works beyond looking at slides. I also liked that the class brought in numerous artists and works from different backgrounds and disciplines that aren't always covered in courses. However, I think often there was too much material in both the lectures and section so it got rushed through and the finer points were missed (and we got out late). I also think a lot of the assignments- the last two papers and the final, were clustered a little close together at the end of the year which was a lot of work and difficult.",
    "Strengths: Lecture is absolutely fabulousbest Ive ever had. Section is INCREDIBLE because the TAs are all wonderful and enthusiastic and get everyone involved, regardless of their background with art. Plus theyre in YUAG, so you get to see art in person. Exams are entirely fair and doable. Essays were genuinely enjoyable to research and write. Class is very well organized.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I genuinely cant think of any.",
    "Strengths - Prof. Barringer is a phenomenal lecturer and Anabelle was a fantastic TA. It's rare to find a course that has such great lectures and sections (we looked at works in the YUAG), but this class had both. It was a wonderful and productive learning experience.\r\nWeaknesses - Since we walked around YUAG all section, I feel like we didn't really learn how to write an art history paper. I would have appreciated one class where we talked about that for people who aren't majoring in art history.",
    "Going to the art museum itself every section was a high, the lectures were entertaining and so was the professor",
    "Overall, the class is great. Lecture is an opportunity to hear about some of the trends in art history and section is an opportunity to learn how to discuss art yourself. My two criticisms would be that Professor Barringer speaks so quickly and flies through the art such that it can sometimes be hard to follow. If he focused on a few pieces and discussed them more in-depth, rather than using several works to make a single point, students might be able to enjoy the art more. That said it's not a make or break problem for the class. My other criticism is that it's not even clear that buying the book is necessary to understand or do well in the class.",
    "Generally a very strong course!",
    "The course was great overall, although I didn't feel like there was a good way to access course materials outside of class. Reviewing a powerpoint, for example, was not really possible unless you had very good notes of your own.",
    "Incredible lectures, very easy to maintain focus an interest, enjoyable topics.",
    "The art galleries at Yale are an invaluable resource and sections are great.",
    "Strengths:\r\n\r\n- prof was amazing \r\n- loved that we could use the YUAG\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- none; i was pretty happy with everything",
    "The course provides a great overview of the history of Western Art, but sometimes gets too slowed down because the lectures get too ambitious. The course could definitely be improved by planning out lectures further in advance, as changes were made to lectures as close as the day before they were presented.",
    "Lectures and sections are both great. I'm really gad we got to actually go look at art since it added a lot to the course. \r\n\r\nA lot of memorization for exams (sometimes memorizing dates felt a little trivial) and a fair bit of work. Also very bottom heavy. There's very little work before midterms and a lot after."

    "Absolutely. If you at all are interested in art, or maybe could be, take it!!! You will love it.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Amazing material and phenomenal professor!",
    "Absolutely a must-take course. I took this as a \"bucket list\" class, and I'm so glad I did. Professor Barringer is incredibly engaging and makes the art accessible. Going to section in the YUAG and YCBA is such an awesome way to take advantage of New Haven's amazing resources. I've learned so much and have a newfound appreciation for art and architecture globally.",
    "Yes. Class is a good way to introduce yourself to art.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The workload is very manageable, and the lecture is very relaxing and interesting. The section is a great way to learn about the art, and even feels like a study break since it is in the museum. The TAs are great at interacting with students and offer great insight into the history of the works in the YUAG and YCBA.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to anyone and everyone. I'm not exaggerating when I say this course changed my life. Professor Barringer is incredibly knowledgable about the works he discusses. He is so clearly dedicated to the study of art history and is inspired to share it with his students. The unique insights he made captured my curiosity and inspired me to more closely analyse art through its socio-historical context.",
    "Yes! Awesome to have a great class that brings together people across majors and grade levels",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any Yale student. Even if you aren't a humanities major or you don't know anything about art, you should definitely take this class - you may find a new interest you didn't even know you had. It isn't a gut - the midterm and final are challenging with a lot of material to remember and there are three essays throughout the semester - but the class is very engaging and rewarding.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone remotely interested in the history of art! When else will you have the chance to listen to the lectures of a famous art historian and analyze original works  in section with a knowledgeable graduate student?",
    "Yes!! Such a good overview of Art History. Fascinating lectures. I left always engaged. Professor Barringer is articulate; he has an incredible capacity to distill information. A useful course for life.",
    "YES! EVERYONE should take this class before they graduate if they remotely like art\/think paintings are pretty\/etc. You gain a much deeper appreciation of art and you'll be able to look at artwork more critically. Prof. Barringer is an incredibly engaging and funny lecturer and going to class is always a lot of fun. The class offers a pretty good survey of western art spanning several centuries. It is very eurocentric, but the professor tries to include artwork by women and people of color. \r\nThe textbook wasn't very helpful. I didn't do the readings and ended up doing fine just by paying attention in class + going to section. Start early on the paper and ask the TA for advice, and it'll be fine. A lot of people take the class Credit\/D\/Fail, and I did too. But in the end I should have switched it, because I'll probably end up getting a decent grade; however, it depends a lot on TA, as some are definitely easier graders than others. Bottom line is: take the class, you won't regret it.",
    "This class is amazing. Tim Barringer is an incredible lecturer, and the assignements and tests are very doable but really make you think. This class made me regret not taking art history before my senior year - take it early and don't make my mistake!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. TAKE IT IF YOU'RE EVEN REMOTELY INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE NEXT TIME YOU FIND YOURSELF IN MET. Take it if you did DS  this class recalls a lot of idea taught in DS. Take it if you are into European history, this class surprising taught me a lot about the history. Take it if you don't want to miss the BEST CLASS AT YALE.",
    "Yes absolutely. I found it interesting and engaging and although the work load was high my TA helped me through it. I don't think there are many lecturers who are better than Professor Barringer.",
    "Barringer is a superstar take this class if you need a break from STEM heavy courseload.",
    "Definitely. Barringer is outstanding. I took the course Credit\/D, but ended up doing pretty well on most of the assignments. It's not too tough to do well if you go to lecture, section, and put time in on the essays.",
    "Great class, fun sections in the galleries and Barringer is incredible. Must take.",
    "Yes, if you have the space and have some appreciation for art take this course and have have your knowledge enhanced and your life enriched!",
    "Definitely! It is a great survey course, and Barringer's lectures are interesting and entertaining. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in art history in any capacity.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in art or art history.",
    "Yes - even if you are not a History of Art major, this course is good for learning about art and garnering a new respect for the field.",
    "Yes! This course is so great for letting you appreciate art without putting in too much work.",
    "Yep, take this class! I had high expectations for this class and somehow it still managed to exceed them. Combine an interesting subject matter with a great lecturer, amazing TAs and the YUAG's resources and you have an excellent course.",
    "Definitely!! You really get to take advantage of Yale's art collection in section. Lecture was never dull. Totally transforms the museum-going experience, for life!",
    "If you are at Yale, you absolutely have to take this course. Professor Barringer is a phenomenal lecturer, and the presented material will lead you to understand and appreciate artistic expression on a deeper level. Exploring the YUAG and the Yale Center for British Art in section is just a bonus. Yale has a world-class art collection; take this course and take advantage of it!!",
    "YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS COURSE BEFORE YOU GRADUATE! It is absolutely fantastic. Professor Barringer is beyond brilliant, extremely engaging as a lecturer, and incredibly knowledgeable about every aspect of what he talks about. I cannot emphasize enough what an incredibly useful, thought-provoking, intellectually engaging, and fun class this is. It is one of those Yale courses that you absolutely cannot miss. I would recommend taking it for cr\/d if you aren't good at writing.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! I have never felt the need to all-caps a statement in a review until now. As a senior going into second semester, I can confidently say this is in the top 5 classes I have ever taken at Yale. Prof. Barringer is a superb lecturer, captivating the audience and bringing everyone on a journey through the history of art, peppered with jokes and musical interludes. He'll also have you drawing ties between works hundreds of years apart, understanding the ways in which race, class, and gender have been portrayed in painting and critically analyze works to bring about a deeper meaning. You get to spend an hour each week in either the YUAG or the YCBA, two incredible museums that Yale students often take for granted. You'll start to realize how well the curators have done in amassing both a sizable and valuable collection. It's such a treat to have section in a museum, and Barringer makes you want to come to class each time. When I had to miss one lecture due to a thesis conflict, I was genuinely sad that I wasn't able to go. This course will change the way you look at art, and give you a newfound appreciation for museums. If you're worried about the workload, start the class Credit D! I cannot stress enough how worth it this class is. Take it and you will not regret your decision!",
    "EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE!!! Tim Berringer is perhaps the greatest lecturer I have had at Yale, and every single class is completely fascinating. This is material that will honestly be applicable to your life every single time you go to an art museum. Just an incredible class.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who wants to better appreciate art and learn about the history of the eras.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone even remotely interested in art, because this class will certainly spark it! I also think that the content it extremely culturally important and good to know as an educated person.",
    "Yes, possibly my favorite class I've taken so far.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Lectures were fun and almost calming and the workload is totally manageable. Sections were also super enjoyable.",
    "This course is a must-take. It is unique to Yale in its YUAG-section format, but the skills and perspective you acquire will serve you well throughout your life.",
    "Yes, this course is incredibly fascinating and engaging. I believe it's hugely valuable to have a baseline understanding of how Western art has evolved, and since this course is so much fun, I recommend this course to everyone who is even slightly interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the artistic world.",
    "This is an amazing class that I would recommend to any student, whatever her major is. Professor Barringer's lectures are clear and engaging, and the fact that section was in the YUAG and the YCBA was such a great part of the class.",
    "Yes! Absolutely!",
    "Yes, Barringer is a great lecturer and although it is a fair amount of work, the class is worth the time overall.",
    "I would because I found this course very interesting as a science student who didn't know much about art. It was very engaging and interesting, and gave me a broad overview of the subject.",
    "This is a must take course with Professor Barringer. He is a god amongst men. Absolutely incredible lecturer. You learn so much from him about the history of art.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. Im a senior and this is without a doubt the BEST class Ive taken at Yale. Sit in on the first real lecture and see what I meanProf. Barringer is a legend. I enrolled rather last minute because I needed a class and I love art and my only regret is that I didnt take this class sooner. 10\/10 would take again.",
    "YES!! If you even have any interest in understanding the art you see in museums, take this court. This is something you get to have and use for the rest of your life.
