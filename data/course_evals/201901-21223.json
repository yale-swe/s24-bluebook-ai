   "comments": [
    "The most valuable skill I learned in this course was probably teamwork. A lot of the technical skills we exercised throughout the semester weren't really anything new.",
    "This course is the second half of the mech e capstone project. The semester is dedicated to fully building, experimenting, and presenting your project. This course is very time intensive, and is extremely hands-on in designing and building.",
    "Good question. More than last semester. I guess do your project early and feel blessed that you never have to deal with professor Dollar ever again for Capstone. Also Nick is the greatest thing to happen to Yale.",
    "Working in a team, building things with little to no instruction",
    "Engineering",
    "navigating unclear instructions, guessing what our superiors think about us in the absence of feedback, struggling with group dynamics\r\nif you get paired up with a team that does very little then ur screwed\r\noh and we learned how to apply engineering principles to design and manufacturing parts",
    "I learned about the design process and how to effectively present my work.",
    "Definitely more than in the fall. The course this semester worked much better to facilitate my learning, teaching me organisational skills and practical skills too.",
    "This was the first project based class besides 487 that I have taken so it was great experience to work with a team on a hands on project.",
    "I learned about stupid bureaucratic rubbish and that people mostly care about looks rather than substance."

   "comments": [
    "This course was good in that it allows seniors in mechanical engineering to work on a project with sufficient scope to feel like a real engineering project, however, the project topics were of little interest to many of the students and the solutions didn't feel like they had very immediate real world applications.",
    "Humongous improvement over 1st semester.  The weekly 1 on 1s were much more coherent and helpful then the panel from 1st semester.  Deliverables were fewer and more useful.  Still would shift more emphasis from deliverables to actual progress however.",
    "This course was fantastic. I think I learned more in this course from actually designing and building a system than I did in most of the mechanical engineering classes offered in the department. However, this course should be worth MUCH more than 0.5 credits. I feel like I have been robbed. I spent at least 20+ hours on this project per week at a minimum, so this course should be worth 1.5 or 2 credits to make it fair for all mech e students.",
    "More clear deadlines as Booth was starting to do. The lectures could be more releavant as well. Generally needs to be more organized with less cooks in the kitchen.",
    "Really bad organization and communication, things felt like a waste of time sometimes, bad projects",
    "It was good.",
    "This course is extremely heavy in terms of work load, a fact that is not reflected by its half-credit weight. The instructor was enthusiastic but also unwilling to take in any feedback for students. Although I did learn a ton about designing for manufacturing and got better at machining, supporting faculty like Glenn, Kevin and Nick and our TA were the driving force behind the improvement.",
    "Was much better second semester",
    "This semester of the course was much better than the previous semester. In the future, more design help by the instructors in the first semester would have saved some frustration and effort in the second semester.",
    "Oh my God this class was an anxiety and stress inducing train wreck most of the time because it felt so unorganized and inconsistent",
    "Lots of weaknesses. Mostly centered on the first semester. Very poor leadership from the lecturers, and a clear lack of preparation from the staff caused the course to get off on a rocky start. Furthermore, the restrictive topic of conservation engineering was a huge blow to everyone involve. These issues were reduced in the second semester. Having each team work directly with a TA or instructor helped move things along nicely. Though, the course still remained very restrictive forcing students into a particular design path even if their project didn't call for it.",
    "this course should absolutely be a full credit",
    "The structure of this course was way better than 487.",
    "Things that are necessary for an actual good version of the class that were weaknesses: Getting actual clients, having real advisers, getting better feedback, better team composition, organization of course materials"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they are a senior ABET mechanical engineer.",
    "This course made many concrete improvements based on a very unified student feedback from 1st semester.  An extreme amount of work, but really what you make of it.  If you're not ABET I would still probably recommend medical device design or whatever, but maybe this course will continue to improve.",
    "I highly recommend this project to other student. This is the most practical, hands-on course in the mechanical engineering major and you will learn the ins and outs of real engineering.",
    "Absolutely not. If required to take this course under the same conditions (i.e. with Dollar, Booth and the same schedule\/deliverables) I would recommend switching to the BS12 or switching majors entirely.\r\n\r\nI came into the year excited and energized to tackle an end-to-end mechanical design project. I thought, as one would, that we would tackle interesting and engaging topics, get invested into our projects, and come away with a final product we could highlight in our portfolios and resumes. Instead, we were assigned uninteresting and downright idiotic topics under the \"Conservation Technology\" umbrella. Now, I would have been fine with being assigned a project if we were clearly solving a valuable and interesting topic - this was anything and everything but. The teaching staff's counterargument was that this scenario mimics the real world. Now, perhaps I'm naive, but I'm pretty sure engineering firms don't commit resources to projects with no path-to-market whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe instructors demanded quite a lot from us. Unfortunately, they found themselves working with unambitious, disinterested and apathetic students who hated their projects from the start, because the topics were simply moronic.",
    "Nope I had to take it :(",
    "You gotta do it",
    "I don't think you have a choice. If you're ABET mechanical engineering, be prepared for a year of hardship and unlimited input only to receive a disproportionately shitty grade. And guess what, nobody will be there for you.",
    "This course is for ABET mechanical engineers. If you are deciding between ABET and not based on this course, take the course.",
    "No. Not at all. This course still needs considerable reform to make it worthwhile. I think students should strongly consider dropping ABET if this course remains as it is. This course could be greatly improved in students were allowed to work on topics of interest, also if the teams were put together based on interest that would help greatly too. The teams were put together on self reported aptitude, which was a clear recipe for disaster.",
    "I think the only people allowed to take this course are mechanical engineering seniors.",
    "Terrible class taught by a terrible professor who lacks in professionalism, leadership, expertise, and empathy but expects all of these out of you, plus all of your time."
