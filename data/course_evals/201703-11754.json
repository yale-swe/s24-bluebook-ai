   "comments": [
    "Ear training, harmonic dictation, singing -- all in single and compound meter. Tons of fun!",
    "Sight-reading and sight-singing, rhythmic and harmonic dictation, duple and compound meters, major and minor scales, intervals",
    "My sight-singing skills improved greatly. I feel a lot more comfortable singing in minor modes and in solfege. I also made great progress in harmonic dictation and feel a lot more confident with picking out a bass line.",
    "The ability to audiate and take dictations of music.",
    "This course serves as a basic musicianship class. Sight reading, chord progressions, harmonic dictation and analysis, and many other things are stressed throughout the semester.",
    "Took it for performance credit. Very basic theory didn't learn much.",
    "This course is just as it is described, very straightforward. My ear got slightly better both in terms of melodic dictation and rhythmic dictation. I especially benefitted from the long period we spent practicing 6\/8 time.",
    "Greater facility with solfege syllables, a better understanding of the aural side of fundamental chord theory (as well as chord theory concepts applied to piano playing), and a higher degree of comfort with sight-singing.",
    "Though my sight singing abilities have stayed relatively the same, my aural dictation and analysis has increased greatly.",
    "I learned how to sing music from sheet music, how to cite-sing, basic piano skills, how to write out music and rhythms from dictations, and how to hear and identify chord qualities. Because I listen to music and sing for fun, I was able to integrate these skills into my life, which has been very enjoyable.",
    "This course teaches you to hear and understand music better, to sight-read\/sing, to recognize chord qualities, etc.",
    "Working with solfege, singing frequently, and getting very, very familiar with scales."

   "comments": [
    "Can't think of any weaknesses. Dr. Adam is fantastic and is one of the best instructors I've had during my time at Yale. His class was tremendous fun.",
    "The in-class practice and feedback was the most valuable part of the class. After every harmonic dictation, Nate asked students about what they heard and took us through the dictation measure-by-measure. He talked through all our mistakes and misunderstandings, showing us the right way of hearing things.\r\n\r\nNate, however, often announced dictation quizzes the class before we had them, and we often moved on to new concepts before the class really understood them. Formal office hours outside of the department's general 218\/219 tutoring would have made the class easier and more productive.",
    "A weakness of this course is that there is no textbook or handouts given out. I think I would have been able to understand some of the material had there been more uniformity in this matter. Most learning is done verbally.",
    "I still don't fully understand the point of the keyboard section. Goals were not made clear between sessions (the workload ranged dramatically from week to week) and while I enjoyed it, I could not articulate the exact skills I gained.",
    "This course was well-organized and information was presented clearly. Expectations on assignments and exams were explained thoroughly. Student input regarding the fairness of assessments was taken into account. In general, I felt that more material could have been covered over the course of the semester - it often seemed that we spent more time on each topic than was really necessary. Additionally, a greater number of practice resources (particularly for harmonic dictations) would have been helpful.",
    "The course is v chill, especially with Nate. You do exactly what you expect from this class, and have a good time doing it.",
    "I really like the extensive in class singing exercises as a way of learning and practicing skills and concepts.",
    "The course is only half a credit but teaches you a lot while being a fun, interactive class. The activities were varied, we sang scales, chord progressions, did rhythmic and harmonic dictations, had keyboard labs...",
    "The structure of the regular class lends to enjoyment, with us starting our Tuesdays and Thursdays with some scales and singing pieces. The piano lab, however, was a nightmare; even in the beginner section it caters very much to people who are musical by a very classical definition (i.e. how well can you play chords from memory), and the instructor didn't give us any more feedback than something along the lines of \"you need to do better.\""

   "comments": [
    "100% -- not only do you get to participate and learn in every classroom setting. You also get time in pairs with the professor working on your keyboard skills.",
    "Yes, if you want to improve your sight-reading and dictation skills. Essential for any serious musician.",
    "If you want to get better at solfege and sight-singing, take this class. If you don't have a reason to learn the material besides the grade (higher music classes, being a better musician), then it might not be worth it.",
    "For sure, this course has a low workload and will definitely help you improve your musicianship skills.",
    "Good for practicing the reading and writing of music, and for hearing some gossip about the Western canon and whatever composers your instructor happens to like.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. I benefited most from the piano lab portion of the course, gaining skills at the keyboard that helped me better conceptualize and aurally cement the information I learned in class. For any musician without extensive prior knowledge of the keyboard, this course was definitely worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend this to another student because it was so incredibly rewarding to take the class.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course, it's only half a credit so there isn't really any homework, it's fun, interactive and teaches you a lot. It's all hearing and singing and learning how to recognize chord qualities, and the singing is very low-key and mostly as a group.",
    "If you know that you're good at hearing music and singing it back, and have had the privilege to play piano before, then yes, take it."
