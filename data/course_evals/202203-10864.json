I learned how to challenge myself through the material I chose to write about and that was a very enriching experience. \r\n\r\nThe discussions we had in class also helped me develop my active listening skills and my classmates helped me gain a deeper understanding of the material we covered.",
                "I learned how to analyze books of varying material and approach in a way that better developed my understanding of literature. I also gained a greater understanding of what is expected of an essay at Yale and was able to work through the writing process not only with my professor but with my peers in a constructive and safe environment.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The freedom that comes with picking 2/3 essay topics for yourself. Prof. B's continued and open guidance. The seminar style. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some readings felt a bit like non sequiturs, but that's probably just because we weren't able to get to the root of them as a class. The range of readings was great though.",
                "Strengths: some excellent books (such as Maxwell's Demon), class-led discussions that led to fruitful ideas, individual feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: reading was rather heavy per night (but that shouldn't necessarily be changed, just something to keep in mind)",
                "A strength of this course is that everyone in it is invested and brings unique insights into the class conversations. The professor is very good at helping us along while also letting us take the lead in where we want the discussion to go. I'm not entirely sure how to fix this, but because we address such conceptually difficult topics in the course, if you are unable to attend a class and therefore by extension participate in the discussion of that material, it is hard to understand what is going on in the novel which causes problems down the road.",
                "The course was open to a lot of engaging discussion, but there was not a lot of direct instruction. It would have been helpful to have a bit more comprehensive instruction, on essay writing techniques or close reading techniques for example.",
                "Professor Bilsky's style of instruction greatly aided my experience in this course. I appreciated her ability to let students lead the conversation and learn from one another, providing clarity when needed but not dominating the conversation. My ability to learn from my peers in this course was unlike any other I have taken. \r\n\r\nI also appreciated the massive amounts of assistance I received personally from Professor Bilsky during office hours. I was able to receive assistance throughout all stages of essay preparation. After submission, papers were promptly returned with ample analysis and a private meeting with nearly half an hour of personalized feedback. This greatly helped my adjustment into college level writing.",
                "The professor was very helpful in the writing process by spelling it out and being effective with the time we met during office hours."

I love to read and had a blast pushing myself out of my comfort zone through viewpoints different from my own and techniques in literature I had never approached. If you are not fond of looking further into what you read and just enjoy reading casually then I do not believe this course is for you.",
