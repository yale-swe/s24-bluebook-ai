                "Small seminar-style class was very nice, and made the class feel engaging. Class slides were very relevant to homework assignments and never felt rushed. Overall strengths: small class, very friendly and engaging teacher who would leave feedback on almost every assignment, welcoming environment. Weaknesses: rarely, assignment guidelines and due dates were unclear, and had to be addressed via email or class announcements",
                "I really liked the community that we built as a class. It was very nice to be in a community with other Chinese heritage speakers. I liked how the classes were not too lecture-like. However, I believe that sometimes there was not enough time in class to finish everything we wanted to cover, and class often went over time.",
                "You learn a lot of new words and your vocab expands a lot, but because the class moves so fast, I didn't feel like my writing or reading skill improved by that much.",
                "Strengths - the pace of the course and the textbook\r\nImprove - more in class grammar and speaking practice. The inherent nature of zoom made it difficult to do speaking practice, but I really enjoyed doing typing practices to learn new grammar structures.",
                "Strengths: assignments were all designed so that we had an easier time in a remote setting and the professor was clear on the instructions and grading standard. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes there were too many different assignments to get through for one day, but then again the professor is lenient if you contact her about an extension",
                "There was a lot of good in-class discussion. Engaging activities and a wide variety of projects.",
                "This class was sooooo amazing. Best class I've taken so far, Professor Xu is amazing!",
                "Strengths: Xu Laoshi is wonderful and does a great job trying to make the class interesting for everyone and genuinely cares about the progress and troubles of each student. She really creates such a friendly environment for the whole class, and even though the class took place virtually this semester, I still felt like I had connected and gotten to know both her and my classmates.",
                "Strengths: Xu Laoshi, textbook, feedback on essays was very detailed. Weaknesses: grades are kind of confusing",
                "This course is good at introducing new Chinese vocabulary at a good pace, and allowing students to practice using those words. I don't think my skills of handwriting Chinese characters from memory have improved much, but given the virtual format of classes this semester it was likely not very possible to do that. I also think that more lessons about Chinese culture and history would be appreciated."

                "Probably the most engaging Zoom class I had this semester. Clas was engaging as everyone would turn their videos on. The in class quizzes were easy and fun, and were done via private message with the teacher. Exams were all online on Canvas, and taken during class time, and the format was nice.",
                "I was able to virtually engage as the instructor asked the class many questions in class and selected students to answer questions randomly, which maintained homogenous participation among the whole class. I think the main thing that could be improved was the online discussion boards because often times students just replied once to a discussion thread and never engaged with it again. I think instead of starting so many discussion threads, we should all engage in once main thread and all build our comments off of eachother.",
                "The typing grammar practice was very helpful. I believe that it was hard to do speaking practice because of Zoom and class stayed generally quiet. I wish there was a way to speak more in class. I also wish we had more handwriting practice.",
                "I thought that making the students take the test while being on a zoom call was inconvenient, not to mention Zoom itself can take up bandwidth and slow internet down for those who already have slow internet. I felt self-conscious while being on a zoom call while taking the test. However, other than that, I felt that the course did a great job at adapting, especially for a language class that usually relies so much on participation.",
                "In-person discussions were engaging and fun.",
                "Communication via email was very effective, also it was cool that the powerpoints we created could be shared via share screen.",

                "Zoom format worked well when the teacher was presenting material, but didn't allow much opportunity in the way of student-to-student interaction, which is to be expected I guess.",
                "Engagement during classes was very good for the virtual formatXu Laoshi would make sure each student spoke at least once during each class. The final project, a dubbing project over a film, was also somewhat unintuitive in design but the end products were all very entertaining and fun to watch."
