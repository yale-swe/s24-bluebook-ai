The quizzes were meant to be \"check-ins\" if you read the textbook chapter and watched lecture, but they pulled very small details and you had 12 minutes for 10 questions. They were open note but you ran out of time pretty much every single time because you were searching through your notes so much. The exams were also open note, but there were so many free response questions (with required sourcing) that you would barely finish. The grading is fair in the end, but the exams\/quizzes create unnecessary stress.",
                "Strengths: assignments are easy to understand and lectures are interesting.",
                "This course was structured very well, and the material was taught very clearly. The lectures were very engaging, and the videos scattered throughout were always very fun to watch!",
                "Strengths: learned a lot of lessons not only about our relationship but about us human (think personality, social interactions, attachment styles); tests and the final project is fair and interesting since we get to apply what we learned to a real context\r\nWeaknesses: the first half of the lab assignments in my opinion wasn't particularly helpful, so maybe we can get rid of it and spend more time working on our project? Also I think the course could be organized a bit better since we don't follow the chapters outlined by the textbook and jump back and forth a bit too much.",

                "Strength: Dr. Hirsch is an absolute gem. Take this course with her. I was never once tired during lecture and she was so energizing",
                "Strengths: Course material is SO engaging. Professor Hirsch prefaced the class with the fact that it is not a self-help course, but I think we all learned something about ourselves through the course! The assignments were all incredibly manageable, practical, and fun. Professor Hirsch is also such a cool and down-to-earth professor!\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "This course could benefit by having more discussion during lass, but is strong in that lectures really enhance what is learned from the reading.",
                "it was really nice to understand how we work",
                "The subject matter is very interesting and engaging, and from the assignments to the final project, the work never seems tedious or boring. There was not much participation in class between students, but I think this was partially due to the virtual setting.",
                "This is overall a strong course. First order of business: IT IS NOT A GUT! There are many quizzes and labs which means every week I was refreshing my knowledge and learning new things. I didn't mind the workload, but people shopping who think the course will be an easy A are misled.\r\n\r\nA strength is the professor and TA, who were engaging, generous and understanding. I enjoyed the assignments (the video game assignment was pretty fun, for a final project, and not too much work). The labs were a bit exhausting and the quizzes could be stressful, but that's just a product of online school more than it was a product of the course itself.\r\n\r\nI learned so much!! That's a huge strength. I got into an ~intimate relationship~ this semester and the class totally helped me. Take the course to learn about yourself and others, and how to be in relationships with them. Taking relationships courses can decrease the chance of divorce down the line! (that was in the textbook)\r\n\r\nOne weakness I might identify is that it wasn't always obvious why the slides fit under the specific heading for the day, or how they fit together (this was more of a problem in some units than others). I guess this is because the professor was stringing together different bits of research and had to connect them somehow, but I guess sometimes I just felt like we jumped around in a way that wasn't always coherently connected. But I understand why and it didn't really impact my experience in the class..",
                "Very interesting. Engaging. One of the best classes I've taken.\r\nWeakness is that sometimes the homework felt like busy work.",

                "This class was great leading to personal insights. It includes a lot of cool studies, data, and short very entertaining videos. I really appreciated the \"class lists\" that we'd come up with for \"ways to keep the excitement alive,\" or \"how to build stronger relationships\", or other topics, and Professor Hirsch shared them with the class. The class could be made more interactive like it was at the beginning by promoting the use of the chat function while highlighting that specific questions should be sent to the TA.",
                "Strengths: professor Hirsch. Weaknesses: none.",
                "Very well organized class. The emphasis on learning the content and enjoying the class by reducing the amount of significantly stressful assignments made the class very welcoming and easy to digest.",
                "Lots of busy work when it came to the quizzes and assignments in my opinion, but otherwise the lectures are really engaging! The course is really well organized and its clear shes very passionate about the topic. The prof is an amazing person",
                "Content is very relatable, bi-weekly quizzes helped revise content, good student engagement",
                "strength: super fun and engaging. \r\nweakness: the quiz format was a little stressful bc of the time constraint.",
                "Strengths: the materials (both lectures and readings) are applicable to everyone's life and very interesting; the lab assignments help you learn how to effectively read psych research papers and teach you how to approach conducting a research yourself; the video game assignment is really creative and fun to do; Prof. Hirsch is a delightful and cool person\r\nWeaknesses: the lecture does move at a relatively slow pace, and the midterms felt really rushed (due to the time it took to find references from slides)",
                "I liked the material of this course but I feel that the assignments could be changed to reflect the style of the course more. I would suggest more interactive assignments to practice engaging with the material in our everyday lives, rather than just regular assignments",
                "There are no sections.",
                "Overall, I believe that the course was taught very well. One thing that could be improved is implementing more breakout rooms for engagement purposes.",
                "Professor Hirsch was caring, attentive, and very engaged. The course was well-organized, and I always knew what we were learning about and why. The professor also did a great job of integrating mid-semester feedback into the course and including more break out rooms to make it feel more personal. \r\nAs for improvements, the labs did feel repetitive and I did not always feel like I was learning much from them besides perhaps a bit about psychological literature. Perhaps these could be changed or alternated occasionally for other assignments.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-Relevance and applicability of material: What you'll learn in this course is applicable to everyone, in a plethora of social contexts. Professor Hirsch also covered the influence of COVID upon relationships, which further emphasized the value and relevance of the material to navigating society.\r\n-Accessibility: This course was my first venture into psychology. However, the material was taught in a comprehensive AND comprehendible manner. It was easy to follow along in lectures. \r\n-Professor Hirsch and TA Zach Silver: The two were a phenomenal duo! Dr. Hirsch's lectures were engaging and informative. Her passion for the subject was clear to see throughout each lecture, and I was constantly impressed by the clarity and articulation of the material. TA Zach provided very constructive feedback on assignments, and facilitated questions during lectures. Overall, that teamwork ensured a smooth-running and well organized class for the whole semester.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-One minute qualm: there was less interaction with peers than I would have liked. Although this aspect of the class improved following mid-semester feedback, I would have enjoyed more polls, breakout rooms, etc. for a more engaging discussion.",
                "Prof. Hirsch hosted an awesome course and I imagine it would have been even better in person. The cut offs for grading were a bit harsh but were given early on so I guess it is fair. Overall, great, great, great course. Great with pacing, lectures, and assignments."

I think the class was conducted really well.",
                "I think Professor Hirsch did an excellent job adapting the course to the pandemic. She made quizzes open-book, she made the midterm and final less stressful by taking out multiple-choice, she made recorded lectures available, and she had regular office hours. No improvements necessary!",
                "office hours were a great way to ask questions",
                "The course itself was great, and Professor Hirsch's enthusiasm each lecture made the virtual aspects not an issue. The only weakness was that students did not communicate much between one another and attempts to increase participation felt a little forced\/awkward.",
                "Professor Hirsch was very understanding, giving us grace days and having office hours. She replied to my emails promptly and was very supportive. She's a great professor!",
                "Having the lectures recorded and open note exams were very helpful.",
                "The flexibility of the course structure. Having live lectures along with recorded lectures and office hours always available was good.",
                "The polls were extremely fun, and the professor made plenty of time available for office hours.",
                "Polls and use of the chat!",
                "It was well adapted to the online course structure, requiring continuous smaller assignments to check for understanding throughout the semester.",
                "As much as I didnt like the biweekly quizzes they did keep me engaged and led me to stay up to date with lecture materials",
                "Online classes worked, but of course it wasn't ideal. Better use of breakout rooms would have been nice",
                "wish more support resources could be provided e.g. office hours\/extra review sessions.",
                "Live Zoom lectures and recorded lectures were both easily accessible, and the assignments on canvas have clear instructions",
                "I felt that the workload was a lot. I understand that the professor just broke down the regular workload into smaller chunks, however, I would have preferred less weekly work but instead, have bigger assignments to make up for that.",
                "I think having sections could help.",
                "Enjoyed that lectures were live and kept me accountable to stay on task and attend class rather than watching recorded lectures (although those were helpful as well). Wish that the quizzes showed the answers right away after completing them.",
                "break-out rooms were great, as was the fact that, though lecture was meant to be synchronous, students did not HAVE to attend lecture and could watch later. I attended nearly every lecture synchronously, but really appreciated being able to watch the few that I missed (bc of exhaustion, mental health issues etc) later.",
                "-Canvas modules were organized efficiently\r\n-Canvas site was easy to navigate, especially compared to other courses\r\n-I wish lectures would involve more interaction with peers, such as polls and breakout rooms. The latter half of the semester, after mid-semester feedback, was an improvement in this regard. \r\n-Questions were moderated by our TA for Prof. Hirsch, such that everyone's opinions were valued",
                "Professor Hirsch really emphasized that even though classes are live, we could still watched the recorded version on Canvas in case we needed a break from Zoom. I feel like that really showcased her caring about her students' well-being.",
                "This course did a great job!! I have no suggestions for further improvement, I think the setup was very accessible and the continuity of either a homework assignment or quiz every Friday made it incredibly easy to remain on-track \/ on top of our work.",
                "Virtual all year. No comment really. But, the online classes were great and to have guest on was also very cool."

                "Yes. Really interesting material and Professor Hirsch is wonderful.",
                "Yes, I thought the material was incredibly interesting and the course was pretty low-stress since the quizzes and exams were open note. Overall, I think that it was a fun and interesting course that also provides useful insight as to how relationships can be conducted.",
                "Yeah, it's an interesting psych credit that's not too tricky.",
                "Yes! The material was very interesting and the assignments were extremely reasonable. I always looked forward to class. I highly recommend it.",
                "Yes! I learned so many important concepts about how relationships form, are maintained, and dissolve. These concepts are very applicable to our relationships!",
                "You really get to learn a lot about relationships (some of them perhaps intuitive, but it's cool seeing the researchers' methodology)... So why not?",
                "Yes! This course is extremely interesting and will change the way you interact with the people in your life.",
                "yes yes yes! Every single human being should take this course. We are wired for relationships which means they are some of the most important aspects of our lives. There are some basic things we just need to know about our own lives and the way we think. This course gave me invaluable, day-to-day, applicable skills that I still use. You will not regret taking this class. Also, Dr. Hirsch is funny, interesting, and very approachable. She makes the class much more fun.",
                "YES YES YES",
                "Yes!!! Every Yale student should take this course in my opinion. The subject matter is so relevant to all of us as college students looking for fulfillment through relationships. It is also perfect for non-psych majors looking for a nice introductory psych course.",
                "Yes. This course is so fascinating and explores various aspects of relationships which can be very applicable to your own life!",
                "absolutely everyone should take a psychology course",
                "Yes, learned a bunch directly applicable to real-life relationships",
                "Absolutely! This course was a pleasure to take due to the material itself and how enjoyable Professor Hirsch made it. The topic is very useful for everyday life, and this was a great introduction to psychology.",
                "I would recommend Attraction and Relationships to a peer. \r\n\r\nIT IS NOT A GUT. In the way the course is currently formatted, there are weekly assignments that (because I wanted to get an A) pretty much ate up my Fridays. I didn't mind because I really liked the material, but I should note that someone looking for an easy, low workload class should look elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI learned so much about relationships and psychology in general, and I think the course *genuinely improved my life*. It was worth it for that reason -- I now believe I'm much better equipped to have healthy friendships and romantic relationships.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hirsch and Zach were great. Thank you for a great semester~",
                "Yes. This is a great course. Very interesting material that is relevant and applicable to everyday life. Great professor.",
                "Yes definitely! It was only my second psychology course I have taken and found that it was a great introduction into studying relationships! Not challenging concepts to grasp and very applicable to real-world",
                "Yes, everyone should try to take this course before they graduate.",
                "Yes, it was very interesting and engaging",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It is a fun and refreshing psychology elective that is not too stressful.",
                "Yes professor is great. Loved the content. Textbook interesting. Everything was super great.",
                "Yes! It was a great intro psych course for students of any background\/year to take and I found it highly enjoyable. The things you learn in this course will be applicable to anyone and hopefully, equip them in maintaining better relationships in their own lives.",
                "Yes, the grading is harsher than you might think, but this course won't stress you out and the professor cares about students' wellbeing.",
                "Yes! I am a junior and this is the best class I have ever taken at Yale so far. Professor Hirsch tells you at the beginning that this is not a self-help course but you will inevitably learn things about yourself and those around you. It was very revealing to me and I have already made changes in my life based on what I learned. It also provides great topics of conversation for you and your friends! And Professor Hirsch is very personal which adds a lot to the class.",
                "100000%. This is the best self help class at Yale. It will help you put words and frameworks to your past, present, and future relationships. It wont solve all of your problems, but understanding is the first step in reaching a solution, and this class helps you do just that. Its like free therapy, and youll want to help others understand these things too. This class helps the greater good of society honestly.",
                "100% This was an amazing course. Prof. Hirsch's radiant personality made each class fun and engaging. Her understanding of us being under a lot of stress made for a perfectly balanced class with enough work to keep students engaged and learning but not too much to drown students in worries about grades. Great class, great prof!",
                "Yes! So relatable and interesting. One of my favourite classes at Yale so far!",
                "yes, if you are interested in psychology \/ relationship psychology and want to take a fun class to see if you really like psychology",
                "Yes. The materials are applicable and fun, you actually learn from the lab assignments, and Prof. Hirsch is really cheerful and sweet! But this is an introductory psych class, so you might find some parts repetitive if you've taken other psych classes.",
                "yes! I really enjoyed this class and the professor was amazing!",
                "This is one of the most practical classes you can take at Yale-- it is so important to know how to navigate relationships!",
                "Yes!! I loved it! It was incredible and now I'm a psyc major!",
                "Absolutely! Relationships are a huge part of our lives and important to have at least a general understanding on.",
                "Yes! This is a great course for evaluating your own life, priorities, and relationships. I will carry what I learned with me for the rest of my life, I'm sure.",
                "I highly recommend this course to other students! The material itself is fascinating and insightful in understanding the enigma called relationships. In this regard, the course should be mandatory for all Yale students. The course, furthermore, incorporates a plethora of recent research, which greatly informed how the digital age of social media\/technology impacts our relationships. That aspect particularly draws so much relevance to our daily lives. Overall, Professor Hirsch was a phenomenal guide to the world of attraction and relationships.",
                "Yes! You get to learn about relationships that backed by empirical evidence and, as a result, reflect on your own relationships in order to make them more fulfilling. It's like the closest thing to therapy without going to therapy.",
                "Absolutely! This was such a fun and easy course, and I still felt like I learned a lot.",
                "HIGHLY RECOMMEND. MAKE SPACE IN YOUR SCHEDULE FOR IT AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET IN LIKE I WAS, TAKE IT. It's awesome and I think the information I learned has been invaluable and actually applicable in my life. A great introductory psychology course."
