                "Strengths: Profesora Vazquez is caring and directly engaged with each student. There was a strong variety of in-class and homework activities that suited different learning styles- reading, recorded videos, a presentation, oral practice, etc. Even though Supersite can seem tedious, the varieties of homework do a good job of reinforcing what is learned in class and helped me prepare for the exams. The grading policy is fair and distributes weight well. The attendance policy is generous. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No major weaknesses. The only weakness that stands out was being cold-called on because it often lead to being nervous (and distracted from really learning because of that) during class, though it does keep everyone engaged.",
                "I think this course was laid out to provide a lot of support to students learning a new language online. It also was very attentive to different aspects of learning a language beyond vocabulary and grammar. I did not think that paying $200 for a workbook was worth my money or time, however, so that is one way I would improve this course.",
                "Strengths: needs high investment and engagement and leads to a better understanding of language. Weaknesses: sometimes has too many unnecessary assignments\/homework\/assessments",
                "Very fast paced, but a lot of content covered.",
                "Strengths: Very engaging and I was able to practice using the vocabulary and grammar I learned everyday in class. \r\nWeaknesses:  A lot of work that you need to keep track of.",
                "The smaller size of classes is good as it allows for more communication during class. The pace is extremely fast and requires lots of studying to keep up.",
                "A strength of the class was the breakout rooms to encourage participation and fluency."

It's practical and the cultures of Spanish-speaking countries is well incorporated for learning. The level of homework and engagement is high, but it is manageable and not too intellectually challenging.",
