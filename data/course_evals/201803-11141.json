    "I learned how to pay attention to wordplay, form, and etymologies while analyzing French prose poetry.",
    "This is my second semester working with Professor Connolly, and once again, he has not disappointed in the insight, thought, and care he brings to his teaching. I am consistently struck with how nuanced his consideration of language is, and how well he is able to communicate subtle thoughts. I accredit so much of my capacity to unpack language and poetry to him.",
    "Learned how to read French poetry more attentively",
    "I felt like I really learnt what a prose poem was, and my ability to speak and write critically in French increased dramatically. I also got a sense of how poetry evolved and developed over the past century and a half. This was a fascinating course.",
    "Writing and analyzing French prose poetry and its authors.",
    "High-level French speaking\/reading skills, reading\/discussing\/writing about prose poetry (and sometimes traditional poetry) in French"

   "comments": [
    "The professor is incredibly knowledgeable and intelligent.  I was blown away by his teaching.  The only weakness is sometimes we did not have time to cover all of our questions.",
    "I do think Professor Connolly can be slightly unaware of how much reading he assigns; entire books of poetry (namely Lautramont's \"Les Chants de Maldoror\") are just massive asks for students. But, I do think the nature of the reading is such so students do not necessarily have to read every, single page to be well-equipped to participate. I suppose improvement then could come in perhaps a targeting the readings a bit more, e.g. assigning a full book, but pointing students in particular directions to refine the class's focus.",
    "Weaknesses: presentations were sometimes a drag... but nothing else comes to mind",
    "The strengths are the variety of works that we read, all of which were supremely well-chosen and interesting. Professor Connolly makes this class a delight, and always has fascinating insights. It's almost impossible to think of improvements, I enjoyed the class so much!",
    "This course was very intensive but provided a wealth of information and a lot of critical insights about the poetry and authors we discussed.",
    "The course is really good! The poetry is good and Connolly leads interesting discussions. A lot of poetry was assigned so it was hard to both read and understand it all due to quantity. If fewer poems were assigned but we were instructed to look deeply\/really think about those poems it could have been a bit better."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this course is intellectually stimulating and will introduce you to some of the most beautiful poetry in the world.  Excellent all-around.",
    "YES! If you are remotely interested and proficient in French, take this course! You will develop appreciation for language entirely unexpected and impressionable! Professor Connolly is deeply caring of his students, and truly works to craft every student's remark into incisive and constructive commentary.",
    "Yes, take it for the poetry. The class is generally well-structured, and Connolly is a pretty good discussion leader and gives decent feedback on papers. The only thing that bothered me about the course was that presentations took much longer than necessary, which took time away from talking about the actual reading.",
    "Yes absolutely. Even if you don't think you have any interest in poetry, or prose poetry for that matter, take this course! Professor Connolly is a wonderful professor, who makes even the hardest texts feel approachable and comprehensible, and you will feel that your level of French improves dramatically. If you're a French major or even a non-major looking to improve both your literary and written French, take this class!",
    "I would recommend this course to other students interested in poetry. It can be difficult but the course is very interesting and worth the effort put into it.",
    "Yeah! It helped my French a lot and the material\/discussions were interesting!"
