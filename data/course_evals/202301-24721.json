                "I learned much about all aspects of Disney that I know before",
                "I learned a lot about how Disney markets its products, what themes are explored in the Disney films, and how they are implementing their agenda as they move forward in regards to being more inclusive.",
                "A survey of all aspects of Disney - from history of the parks, Disney movies, globalization, environmental impact, DEI representation and more",
                "This was an exploratory course that covered very different subjects and topics, so I walk away with a well rounded view of the history, politics, economics, and social critiques of Disney. I learned how to do film analysis, think about important questions like authorial intent and the strengths and weaknesses of academia, and I left knowing a lot more about what goes behind Disney, it's parks, and media.",

                "I learned so much about so many aspects of Disney that I wasn't familiar with before from economics to theme park operations. It encouraged me to think more critically about major corporations like Disney and how to engage with content that might not usually be included in academic discussions.",

                "This course allowed me to really exposed me to various academic disciplines that I had previously never had the chance to explore, through the medium of Disney. I think one of the most essential skills I gained in this course was the ability to take theoretical concepts and apply them to real-life issues. Because the course did not limit itself to one particular academic discipline, it allowed for a inter-disciplinary exploration of issues within Disney that added a lot of depth and layer to my learning."

                "Strengths: such a great classroom environment fostered by Prof. Battle, she made room for fun in the class and for being serious but always with good-faith assumptions in discussing the hard things, assignments never felt tedious (always realistic and super creative in the paper topics) such a cool class that really embodies the residential college seminar program to the utmost degree, paper feedback was helpful, being super interdisciplinary made this class so awesome to discover new things and new lenses\r\n\r\nweaknesses: some weeks were less interesting than others but I know that's a result of the students' varying interests so that's understandable, maybe a lil bit of feedback on reading responses (feedback was only given if improvement was necessary)",
                "Really enjoyed the class but the amount of reading we had to do was oftentimes a lot which got kinda stressful.",
                "Really enjoyed the structure of the course and found the class both engaging and interesting.",
                "Great group discussions and sharing of opinions",
                "While there were a lot of readings for this course, each one was engaging and added something to the discussion. Overall, this course was very effective in terms of the format and the content. Each week introduced a new topic related to Disney, making the interdisciplinary nature of the course a huge plus point.",
                "The course was designed well for student learning. I especially liked the group discussion part of the class both small and large groups. I did feel there was a lot of reading some of which was not covered in class.",
                "S: Professor Battle is amazing, she's kind, professional, and very knowledgable. She lets everyone be heard, and she prepares her presentations wonderfully. She's very open to feedback. The class is very fun, from the different subjects, to the weekly movies, to the out of the box projects/papers. The class is designed to let you explore what you're interested in. \r\nW: Personally I found there to be a little bit too much of an emphasis on race and gender representation, which was a common theme throughout the class. I think there's a lot of other topics that could've been covered (religion, film making process, etc). We also primarily focus on animated films, so if you're looking to study Disney Channel or other off shoots, you'd have to do it in your projects.",
                "Fantastic course! Loved the discussions and I was very engaged with the class. Guest speaker with Dr. Cheu was fantastic",
                "This course was filled with so many wonderful discussions! It was fantastic to talk about new topics surrounding Disney every week!!",
                "Their class is one of a kind. Every single week we had discussions that I wouldn't get in any other classroom with a group of students and a professor who all loved the content. The variety of topics covered was a strength. This probably the only class where I can say I wish we met more than once each week because there was so much to talk about.",
                "strengths: well prepared class powerpoints that were impossible to not develop into rich discussions; interdisciplinary; creative assignments \r\n\r\nweaksnesses: none!",
                "Strengths: The class size being relatively small allowed for engaging discussions. There was a lot of flexibility in the learning process. Especially for our final project, we were each able to delve further into areas that we were personally interested in. \r\nWeakness: The class was only once a week, but there was a lot to cover, so sometimes it felt rushed."

Honestly such a blessing of a class that really sheds light on the complexities (the good and the bad and the in-between). It's easy to be a critic but there's value is seeing what Disney has accomplished too. A true dream of a class for my senior spring and I wish more classes were like this on.",

                "Yes. Students who are interested or passionate about Disney should take this class.",
                "I would highly recommend this class. The course subject is so interesting, and you may never get another chance to study Disney from the angles in this course. You learn soon that Disney is much much bigger, pervasive, and powerful in American culture, economics, and politics, than you thought. It's a fun class, Professor Battle is amazing, and you can't go wrong. She makes you feel welcome and brings Disney to the classroom!",
                "Yes! Perfect course!",
                "This was an amazing course, especially considering this was the first year it was taught! Prof. Battle is an extremely kind, thoughtful, and understanding professor and you can tell how much effort she puts into each lecture. My favorite thing about this course is how interdisciplinary it was-- each week we explored a different topic relating to Disney, such as environmentalism, Florida politics, economic impact, diversity in film, etc. It is unique in that students from a wide variety of backgrounds and majors can engage with the material in different ways and have their opinions heard in this seminar format. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who loves Disney and wants to take a look at some of their classic characters, movies, and rides from a more critical lens in a super fun and engaging way.",
                "Yes, definitely! Even if you are not a big fan of Disney, this course gives you a lot of valuable information since the company is so influential in our world.",
                "Absolutely. I hope they decide to offer this course again. Students from all backgrounds can appreciate this class. You get to revisit films and content you love while also being encouraged to think about it in a new light.",
                "Yes! Absolutely! Was the perfect way to end my time at Yale",
                "I would 2000% recommend this course to anyone. I think the course is enjoyable to anyone from essentially any major, as it really pushes you to think beyond one academic discipline. Even if you are not a fan of Disney, or do not have any prior knowledge of Disney, I think Disney was the perfect company to focus on (there is so much to explore from gender studies to economics to politics to art). The course is really interesting, and the professor did an amazing job to keep the class engaged every week."
