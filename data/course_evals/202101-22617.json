The writing credit was definitely helpful for me to better understand the philosophers and their school of thought, and without those papers, I think I definitely would not have been able to have had the understanding that I left the class with. You get exactly the amount of effort you put in, as the material can be quite dense and confusing, but Professor Shapiro's lectures are really helpful, and section gave me the opportunity to work through my thoughts.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: depending on your TF, discussion can be super interesting (Nica Siegel is incredible! But I think she's graduating this semester). Sometimes what you're learning is applicable to real life, and that's always a super cool moment.\r\nWeaknesses: the readings are honestly super dense and difficult to understand.",
                "The strengths of the class were that Professor Shapiro broke down complicated ideas in very simple ways. The class content was also manageable so that you don't have to have prior knowledge in the area.",
                "weakness was the whole class. the lectures barely helped my understanding of the readings and thinkers because so often we'd just be hearing long quotes or random examples but this did not help. the readings were very long and tedious and didn't even need all that were assigned because they were barely all covered in lecture",
                "strengths -  discussion sections, content \r\nweaknesses - it gets pretty monotonous during the week",
                "The strength of the course is in the engagement with students and the real-life examples drawn into the course. I also thought the discussion sections were fairly interesting. At times, the readings didn't feel entirely applicable to the subjects addressed in class, but they were mostly interrelated.",
                "The class is wonderful and there is always a high level of engagement from all the staff running the course. It is easy to get feedback and assistance on digesting the difficult political theory.",
                "The virtual format was an overall weakness, but that couldnt be helped. The discussion section was a great way of keeping everyone engaged. A weakness would be communication at the beginning: I wish I knew which were writing intensive sections and which werent. (I accidentally signed up for a writing intensive section). Also, a strength were the TAs, who were very helpful throughout the class.",
                "The course took advantage of online learning well. Professor Shapiro's lectures weren't too long, and he was great at synthesizing and explaining sometimes hard to understand readings and concepts.",
                "Strengths: Great TFs and well organized course content.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Was sometimes unclear when Prof. Shapiro was relaying the professional consensus vs. his own opinion. Also, the course kind of felt like it took an unexpected turn at the end to visit some of Shapiro's work.",
                "The lectures were very interesting and the discussion sections helped a lot with understanding the concepts taught in lecture. The readings for this course were very long and often hard to understand, we were often assigned 50 pages in one night that could have been summarized in 3 pages.",
                "Mofopo is a wonderful class which everyone should take to orient themselves in political philosophy.",
                "strengths: i loved section, the TAs are very thoughtful and work hard to make this course engaging. professor shapiro's lectures were also quite interesting. \r\nweaknesses: tying in the reading more to the material. oftentimes, i would skip the readings and it wouldn't materially affect the way i engaged in class or section.",
                "Strengths: always very engaging lectures, and fun discussion sections\r\nWeaknesses: infrequent assessments, and not enough guidance on those assessments especially given that there were so few and far between. Also great amount of reading, some of which was not even addressed in lectures/included for assessments.",
                "Strengths: Reading load was generally manageable, sections were helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Unclear expectations for the written exams, and while Professor Shapiro's lectures were engaging, it wasn't always clear how various schools of thought connected.",
                "I think it is a relatively standard Yale course and you can get as much out as you put in. I learned a lot and am thankful for all the effort my TF and professor put into the course! This may not be the best course for you if you don't like the topics or if you dislike readings.",
                "Strengths: this class was well facilitated for learning! \r\nImprovement: the content was sometimes not taught in lay mans terms",
                "This course did not lend itself very well to the virtual format. While the TF-led sections were a plus every week, lectures were slow and not very engaging, coming from a PoliSci major, but this is in many ways a quintessential course for anyone interested in the subject matter, and I'm sure it will only improve in-person.",
                "I think the lectures were very explanatory and the discussion sections complemented them perfectly.",
                "Many of the readings were extremely dense and sometimes difficult to get through. A strength however, is that Shapiro was able to synthesize the readings in a clear way during his lectures.",
                "This course was really fast-paced and because there was so much material on each person, it felt difficult to absorb at times. In the future I think it could be improved by focusing on fewer people but going deeper into each of their ideas. A strength of this course was the structure of lectures. I thought they were very straightforward and offered real world examples to help apply the concepts practically.",
                "Lectures were structured in a very confusing way.",
                "Strength: It was very pragmatic and most of the topics discussed were part of our everyday decision-making process.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The virtual aspect did not readily provide effective interactions.",
                "strengths: great selection of readings, the overall structure made sense and flowed from one lecture to the next \r\nweaknesses: the democracy section felt a bit rushed and scattered, I would have liked some more clarity and structure there.",
                "strengths: Really enjoyed the lectures themselves. The professor usually cleared up any confusion from the text. \r\nweaknesses: Some of the readings were a bit dense. I wished that for some of them there could have been an outline for what to look for or put more of an emphasis on. I also wished that there was additional class time focused on synthesizing a particular idea or period rather than waiting till the end of the semester.",
                "The course does cover the theorists effectively if more quickly than is helpful for deep understanding. The major weakness of the course, in my mind, is that, for students in non-Writing Intensive sections, there are only two assignments the entire semester: a midterm worth 30% of the grade and a final worth 50% of the grade; this does not allow for growth over the semester and places far too much pressure on these assignments.",
                "The strength is how much it covers, and quite efficiently as well. It could be improved by providing more of a structure to the readings, and trying to connect the title of the course, and some main themes, with Shapiro's occasionally rambling discussion of the subject matter.",
                "Great class. I would say that I wish the lectures were more clear and the sections had some sort of powerpoint prepared to go over key concepts.",
                "The course was brilliantly structured - the professor was very clearly competent and so were the TAs. It was structured in the best way to facilitate student learning. I literally cannot think of one improvement.",
                "The lectures were awesome. Shapiro is great to listen to and he makes it somewhat interactive. The readings can be a bit much but skipping some is totally ok.",
                "Great introduction without too too much work. Not super in depth as its a survey course but definitely built my understanding of political philosophy.",
                "The lectures were a bit boring, but Professor Shapiro did a great job giving an overview of different philosophers and their stances.",
                "Discussion sections were great. Good powerpoints.",
                "The course is great at getting you through a broad sweep of basic political philosophy without requiring any real background in the topic. A weakness would be that aside from the midterm/final, if you aren't in a writing section, I didn't feel like I got much practice or intermediate grades on writing about these thinkers which made the midterm and final more daunting.",
                "Professor Shapiro is a great lecturer and made complicated concepts easier to understand. I appreciated the weekly discussion sections.",
                "weakness - lectures were EXTREMELY slow...could hardly pay attention",
                "I believe the course was strengthened by the discussion sections. However, I feel like the lecture slides were very hard to follow.",
                "Strengths: Shapiro explains things really well and all the TAs were very engaged with their students, making sure we understood the material\r\nWeaknesses: pretty sure every single thinker we went in-depth on was a white male, which was unfortunate",
                "I enjoyed the course and learned a lot from it, but feel like could be more helpful if information was given in a straightforward manner rather than by always asking questions (especially in section) and by going more in depth on fewer topics rather than scratching the surface of many, especially later in the course.",
                "Professor Shapiro is an incredible lecturer! It does cover a lot of material and some parts felt a bit rushed, but it is a good survey course as long as you're willing to put the time into the readings. It's easy to get overwhelmed with the readings and they can pile up, but missing one or two readings didn't really leave me in the dark since there were only 2 papers and a final (for the writing credit).",
                "I got to learn a lot about the basics of political philosophy.",
                "This class has the potential to be very interesting if you are deeply interested in political philosophical study. It is not as centered on politics as it is sometimes dense political theory. Professor Shapiro does a good job at simplifying this, though, as well as making it accessible.",
                "weakness- lack of engagement. the course was not very collaborative",
                "Strengths: learn lots of philosophers\r\nWeakness: learning so many philosophers mean you don't really get to know one",
                "I felt that there were too many philosophers covered during some sessions to the point where it made it difficult to discuss them all within the section time that we had.",

                "Though it may be difficult given the large enrollment, having small assignments or reading quizzes to check our understanding of the content may have helpful, and make it so the midterm/final exams define our grade less.",
                "The strengths was its content and lectures which were both very interesting and engaging. It was impressive how Professor Shapiro managed to generate discussion with 90+ students in the class. A weakness was the difficulty of some of the assignments. Its not easy to get an A on a paper, although its also not to hard to get a decent grade on one.",
                "This course made good use of examples and dove deeply into thinkers for the first half of the semester. The second half was slightly more rushed and I for one struggled to keep up with the pacing at times.",
                "Strengths are professor Shapiro and TA Da'Von Boyd",
                "The course was very strong. The discussion sections were thought-provoking and engaging and the lectures were, too.",
                "Strengths: passionate professor and TFs; availability of resources; fun discussion sections\r\nWeaknesses: difficult to engage with the material virtually",
                "Loved the discussion sections, felt like lectures were drained out and long, could have been just zoom.",
                "The course assigned too much reading. This made it so that I promptly gave up on reading all the assigned materials every week and then soon after that gave up reading more than I needed to to answer the weekly reading responses mandated by my TA. That said, the material was interesting and important, and the readings were good, no doubt.",
                "more engagement",
                "I think a strength was the discussion sections, weakness was that there weren't a lot of assignments so each one mattered a lot",
                "The greatest strength of the course is the discussion sections. Since the discussion sections are smaller (10-15 people), it allows for a lot of good substantive discussion about the material from our readings and lecture, giving us the opportunity to digest the material in our own terms. Discussion sections were really crucial in helping me understand some of the more difficult material in the class. The greatest weakness of the course are the readings. Some of the readings (especially some of the older ones) are a bit difficult to read and understand (because of the language and some missing context), and others are just very dry and/or technical, which makes getting through the readings and understanding them a little difficult at times. Some days also feature a lot more reading than others, which I feel like hinders my ability to understand all of the material from the texts that I've been made to read."

                "I appreciated the flexibility and consideration offered by TAs in the course with regard to assignments. It was also helpful that the live virtual lectures were recorded and posted to canvas. The course offered the ability to engage as much or as little as the students were comfortable with.

                "If the student is interested in political philosophy, then absolutely.",
                "Yes I would! It fulfills the political philosophy requirement for the political science major, so I would recommend it if other students need that. But I also think is a great introduction to political philosophy and is enjoyable subject matter that challenges students' conceptions of the world. Professor Shapiro is really engaging and clearly so passionate about the subject matter!",
                "Not really. I think it was taught in a very confusing way.",
                "Yes, because it is a great introductory class for majoring in Political Science.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a good, solid overview of some of the most influential thinkers in political philosophy. It is geared towards beginners, which is great because you can take the class without intimidation.",
                "Yes I would. It provided a clear and well-thought-out introduction to political philosophy, and I left the class feeling prepared to engage in similar topics in the future.",
                "Yes, depending on what you hope/need to get out of it. Definitely if you want to dip your toes into the (often frustrating) world of political philosophy, go for it. If you need it for EP&E, go for it also. If you really like reading the works of old white guys but were scared of commitment to DS, go for it as well. But if you are more interested in going deep, in really understanding any one of these thinkers, or like the practical aspects of political science, the questions with answers...maybe not. What I will say is that it seemed like the non writing-intensive folks had a blast, and I will say that with almost certainty. All you really had to do (at least this year) was pay somewhat attention during lecture/section and put effort towards the midterm and final.",
                "Yes! Great course. Lots of concepts explored that are relatable to many other courses.",
                "Absolutely! If you are even remotely interested in studying or majoring in Philosophy and/or Political Science, this is a must-take. Note that there is a Coursera version of this course and the material is still introductorythere might be more specialized course you would be interested in as well.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student - only if that student has enough college experience to actually keep themselves on track for the class. It was very easy to fall behind, because there were no real assignments for the class, so you could easily fall behind on readings and lectures and you need to remain responsible for that. But the course's content was interesting, and it was organized well, so I'd suggest it to another student.",
                "Absolutely. A great writing credit for those who dont feel like doing an English class.",

                "Yes! If you want to get a broad overview of a lot of really important thinkers, this is a great course. You definitely get as much or as little as you put in, so doing all the readings, going to lecture, etc will set you up for success.",
                "Yes, if they like philosophy and politics",
                "If you're marginally interested in philosophy and politics, sure, this is a great introduction.",
                "If you have never taken political philosophy before, and would like a very well organized primer on the topic, this course is fantastic. Not a philosophy or PLSC major, and I found the class very approachable a good way to learn without dying in mountains of work.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in political philosophy. It is something of a survey class, so some of the conclusions drawn from each philosopher feel shallow and oversimplified, but the class itself is interesting enough regardless.  However, the structure of assignments provided very little incentive to keep up with the readings or class lectures.",
                "This class is a very basic intro to political philosophy course so if your major requires that you take it obviously take it.",
                "Yes, everything I learned was taught well and was interesting. This course was challenging for me but also very engaging.",
                "Yes, this course was a great intro to political philosophy that takes an interesting approach to analyze moral arguments of real-world issues!",
                "Definitely! Great class to satisfy the political philosophy requirement in the poli sci major, or that of the one in the EP&E major. Also good for a writing credit.",
                "Yes if you're interested in political philosophy and willing to do the reading",
                "I would recommend this class as a good introduction to moral philosophy and politics. It's a good foundational/survey course for anyone who's interested. It felt like a very low-commitment class that didn't actually have that much writing for a writing credit.",
                "Yes, if you are really interested in getting a crash course in political philosophy.",
                "It's a good writing credit and if you want a basic overview of lots of political philosophy, go for it. If you're more interested in politics, take something else.",

                "Yes This is an enjoyable class. Not my favorite class but I think that happen in larger intro courses.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in political philosophy.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, if interested in philosophy",
                "I recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning the basics of political philosophy, but its redundant if youve taken higher level courses.",
                "For those interested in the basics of different political philosophers, this course is a good take and little background is required.",
                "Yes. The course was great, just be prepared to do a lot of readings.",
                "I would, dependent on their interest level in the material. As a non-major, it gave me base level insights into different areas of thought without getting too entrenched in details. It moves quickly and does not go in depth in certain areas, but as a survey course it is quite effective.",
                "Yes, for anyone who needs an introduction to political philosophy.",
                "Yes, I'd say it's a must for anyone interested in political philosophy and thought.",
                "Know that this is a deeply philosophical course  while it is certainly tied to modern government, that is not the focus. This is a class that requires deep thinking and attention. I feel like I did not understand that going in and was frustrated when my expectations were not met. That said I would recommend this course if that is what you are looking for and enjoy.",
                "Not really, don't personally like philosophy, doesn't seem like a good representation of a PLSC major.",
                "I would not. I think the course is simply too much reading and too much information shoved at you all at once for any one to really retain or internalize any of it. For students really looking to attend political philosophy boot camp, perhaps I would recommend the course, but only if they are truly committed to devoting a huge chunk of their time each week to learning the material.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, it made me think a lot !",
                "Depends. If you are planning on a major in political science or any other field related to politics, then this class is probably a good one to take since it gives you a lot of context behind much of modern political thought. However, if you are not planning on majoring in these fields, then it really depends on your level of interest in political philosophy. I was more interested in the politics aspect of the course versus the philosophy portion, so I wasn't all that engaged with the material taught in the course, although it was still overall pretty interesting to learn. The class is also a nice WR credit for anyone who needs one."
