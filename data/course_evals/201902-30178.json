    "The reasons behind criminal actions, causes for psychopathy and externalization, treatments in children and adults, etc.",
    "By taking this course, I learned about how criminal behavior relates to different environmental and psychobiological factors. I was also able to realize some misconceptions on mental illness and criminal behavior.",
    "I learned the difference between people with psychopathy and normal people in behavioral and biological level. Also, I learned new knowledges of how different social factors can effect people living in that society. As I took this course, my perspective toward people with psychopathy changed, from people who are dangerous and should he feared, to the people who should be understood Rather than feared, since their inability in sympathy are from their biological differences, rather than their will to not have any emotions."

   "comments": [
    "Professor was very informative and passionate, and helped make class engaging.",
    "I think there was a lot of material with the studies, and I often felt like they were introduced in a way to be memorized rather than understanding the mechanism of the task so I think that could be improved.",
    "Its a little too hard for high school students to take.",
    "This course was highly interesting and well-balanced between lecture and discussion. Although this course was limited to a summer session duration, I was able to learn a great amount of material quite in-depth.",
    "I liked how we had discussions on specific cases with Grace. We could apply general knowledges we learned in professor Baskin-Sommers session to specific situations we saw in Graces section. It was a really good opportunity to review our knowledge and learn how to apply general information to specific cases. One part I thought could be improved was that sometimes discussions went too fast for me. I am usually a person who thinks a lot and then say my opinion, but sometimes discussions went so fast that I could not solidify what my opinion is and therefore could not say my opinion."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!! If you are curious about the criminal psychology you must take this course.",
    "Yes! Very interesting even if you are not a psychology major because it can be related to many other majors and interests like political science or law, and also gives a different perspective on the criminal justice system.",
    "Yes for those who are interested in this topic.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it provides insight into psychopathy and other forms of psychopathology that are prevalently discussed in media.",
    "Yes. In this course, students could learn about the materials that they dont usually have opportunity to learn, and it already makes taking this class a unique experience. Also, this course was not only unique, but also had a lot of informations in deep level and there were opportunities to apply those information on specific situations. If students are interested in learning about biological or social differences, or the effect of society on human, they should take this course."
