   "comments": [
    "Strengths: writing a senior project proposal, writing a paper draft, presenting to the class, and producing a final paper. This process really prepared me for what I will be tackling next year as a senior in the major. Another strength was the class discussions--it was really interesting to hear other students' opinions on topics they were passionate about.",
    "Strengths: students are very involved in their own learning and the learning process. Weaknesses: we didn't get much regular feedback. I think the seminar discussion often dove into the nitty-gritty details of uninteresting or irrelevant topics and student engagement was lost at this time",
    "Strengths: weekly topic, reasonable amount of reading with suggested and recommended papers made available, high student involvement during class\r\nWeaknesses: disconnect between topics, more time spent on some branches of cogsci (like psych, econ) than others",
    "This is a strong course, very focused on active learning. I enjoyed that immensely!",
    "Active learning meant really high engagement and great discussions"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! As a CogSci major, it gives you a level of understanding and credibility in talking about the different domains of cognitive science as a field, rather than just the topic you are interested in.",
    "I would recommend this to juniors in the cognitive science major. I had very high hopes for this seminar, and it wasn't as fun or as interesting as I expected it to be, so I guess just go in with the right expectations. Still very useful to me, and I have no regrets about taking it.",
    "To all cognitive science majors -- YES! A great way to learn a LOT about the field we are studying.",
    "Absolutely to all cog sci majors. A lot of work but so worth it"
