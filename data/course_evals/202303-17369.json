                "really well run, love the idea of rewriting over three drafts. also think its a positive place to support classmates work",
                "I love the complete workshop format. I also love the three drafts of one story kin of thing. Sometimes it takes two drafts to know you need something totally radical and sometimes it takes three, so I appreciate the extra time with the story. FEEDBACK - amazing. I got such helpful feedback from Michael and each and every one of my peers.\r\nThe only weakness I can think of is all the reading, especially when it becomes four stories in one class at the end. But the third draft seems to need less discussion time than the first or second so it doesn't make sense to do it any other wya. It's just a lot of reading as you get into the real grind time of the semester. Wait I just thought of another one: I really think the stories should be due Friday or sunday night and not thursday night. It's a LOT of work to prepare the stories for class that week and have your story due that same night.",
                "This is a workshop course so your experience will be as good as the rest of the class is. There is no curricular learning, only learning through interaction and experience.",
                "I was initially worried about, and intrigued by, the structure of this course: you basically write three versions of one story. But I think it works really well, for a few reasons. First, it's not all that limiting. Professor Cunningham makes clear that \"rewritings\" can completely reimagine the piece, within reason. We had some students make pretty radical changes to their stories as the semester progressed. Second, if people are anything like me, undergrad writers need more help, I think, with holding onto one story, learning how to let it develop, how to let go of the parts that don't work, than they do with producing a draft in the first place. In that sense, I think this structure has a lot to recommend it over the \"you-will-write-two-or-three-full-length-stories-in-one-semester\" method that characterizes some other workshop courses."

                "Absolutely. I honestly wasn't much a fiction writer before this course, but I loved it just as much as any other genre of writing I've taken a class in at Yale. It's so fun to just get to work with a story and see it grow as well as being in an environment with all your peers who are also working on evolving stories. Just so cool. The vibes were great.",
                "Great for writing concentration majors or students who want to better experience drafting and improving stories.",
