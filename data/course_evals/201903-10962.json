   "comments": [
    "I learned how to build creative structures and personas to fit my dramas. I developed an immense toolbox of possibilities for both voice and structure, and I read exemplary pieces that helped me concretize each of those options. I honed my skills as a workshop commenter. I learned to write gripping, immersively-reported articles, and to revise TK. Most of all, I felt that Prof. Strebeigh invited me into a lineage and a community of long-form writers. It would be impossible to list all that I've learned in this class, but hopefully this starts to capture some of it.",
    "If you have a chance to take a seminar with Professor Strebeigh, seize that chance and run with it! He's one of the kindest and most brilliant professors I know, and is my favorite professor at Yale. He truly challenges you to be the best you can be. This course focuses on creative nonfiction and longform journalism with a specific focus on structure and voice (which Professor Strebeigh believes are the two most important parts of the piece). You write two longform pieces, one in the first half of the course focused on structure and one in the second half focused on voice. The structure of the class is deconstructing published pieces to learn about specific structures\/authorial positioning move, as well as workshops for your pieces scattered throughout.\r\n\r\nI feel like this class equipped me with the ability to specifically identify what an author is doing in an excellent piece (as well as how to attempt to do it myself). Now, when I read a piece that I love, I know what term I can use to describe that structure or how the author is positioning themselves, which is really helpful in figuring out how to do it yourself.",
    "How to write. How to write well (or better than before). How to write using a persona, how to properly structure a piece. How to believe in myself as a potential journalist.",
    "Through readings, we gained examples of various approaches to authorial persona and structure that we could use as guides for our own writing. More than specific models of voice and structure, though, this class completely changed my sense of how craft can serve the drama and meaning of a reported story. I learned that the way a piece is written doesn't need to be separate from what it's trying to say. The course pushed me to pursue more ambitious long-form reporting projects with national resonance, and comments from both Professor Strebeigh and the other students in the class expanded beyond the official scope of the course to help me grow as a writer in general.",
    "This course gave me the tools snd understanding to become a journalist. I had never thought about structure of stories or authorial voice in such a discerning and meaningful way until this course shaped my view. It taught me how to write and analyze storiesproviding me a toolkit for the rest of my life.",
    "I became a much better writer as well as much better reader of long-form creative nonfiction! Professor Strebeigh's insights into the use of voice and structure to advance drama in nonfiction writing are extremely valuable. I will never look at a piece of nonfiction the same way after taking this course. In addition to improving my own skills, I gained a deeper appreciation for the craft of nonfiction and for the impressive work that the very best English nonfiction writers of the last few decades have produced.",
    "I definitely learned a lot more about structure by taking this course, and I got much better at reporting and building drama. Fred is an excellent and rigorous editor. He's got longform creative nonfiction down to a science, and it's incredibly useful to try out that analytical approach (even if, like me, your brain usually works differently.) I definitely became a better writer.",
    "I learned how to read professional nonfiction writing critically, and I really improved my own structure, voice, and style.",
    "I learned a HUGE amount about reporting, writing and editing. Im amazed by how much I could learn about nonfiction in a single class, and Professor Strebeigh was unbelievably helpful and available."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This is one of the two best courses I've taken in my entire Yale career. Prof. Strebeigh obviously cares immensely about teachingnot a surprise to anyone who's heard someone so much as mention himand it shows in his careful pedagogy and unbelievable individual attention. I can't think of a single thing that I would improve about this course, and I would never dare to attempt a comprehensive list of the course's strengths. There are too many to count.",
    "Strengths: You come out with two great long-form pieces that you can publish. As Professor Strebeigh puts it, this class is time for you to write what you want to write! The feedback on your writing is phenomenal -- getting to workshop your pieces with other serious, brilliant writers really helps you understand what your piece can actually become, and Professor Strebeigh will give you 7-8 pages of comments (!!) on your piece, line-by-line.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many, but I would've loved to learn more about how to pitch and get a piece published in national papers\/magazines!",
    "Strengths: Professor Strebeigh, readings, the class structure (two articles per semester), class dynamic, Professor Strebeigh's HIGHLY thoughtful and EXTREMELY helpful feedback. WOW. \r\nWeaknesses: only happens once a week :(, finding a topic for your article may or may not cause immense stress.",
    "A huge strength of the course was Professor Strebeighs unparalleled dedication to every student. We received an almost overwhelming (but extremely helpful) amount of feedback on our drafts. Professor Strebeigh would stay after class until hed spoken with every student who wanted to check in with him. He was kind to everyone, but also had high expectations for us and took our work unbelievably seriously. \r\nI do think we could have spent a bit more time on the persona section of the course. Since workshops had already begun (and we also spent a couple of classes on endings), we didnt get to read or discuss as much for this unit. I feel like Ive come away from the course with a concrete sense of the structural possibilities of a longform piece, but less so for persona.",
    "This course was a tightly run and engaging seminar focused clearly on two elements of writingwe developed a complete and full understanding of these essential elements that I will carry with my for the rest of my life.",
    "The strengths are many; the weaknessesfew. The syllabus is brilliantly organized, comprised of not only engaging readings but also ones that demonstrate clearly the teaching points discussed each class. The course's emphasis on voice and structure works very well and provides a helpful structure for a class centered on two writing assignments. The staggered workshopping schedule also very nicely permits the class to discuss student work just about every weekwithout feeling too rushed. Feedback on drafts and revisions is extensive and clearvery possibly the most comprehensive feedback of any course I've taken at Yale. The only weakness (if it is a weakness) is the workloadproducing two fully-reported, polished magazine-length features in one semester is a very challenging taskand one that may not be realistic for students balancing as many classes, extracurriculars, jobs, social anxieties, etc., as many Yale students have to balance!",
    "Strengths: high quality workshops, excellent and extensive edits on your pieces, high-energy discussions, a fun reading list, lots of freedom in assignments, really detailed and helpful exploration of how voice and structure work in longform journalism.\r\n \r\nWeaknesses: Especially during early classes, we might have 14 extremely long pieces on the syllabus and then only discuss one or two. I wish the syllabus had been more pinned to what we actually ended up discussing. Also, participation could sometimes be frustrating--Fred is a fun and energetic professor, but he often wants very specific answers or interrupts before you can get your entire comment out.",
    "If you want to learn how to write better and especially how to write long-form journalism, this course is a must. I like how we discussed professional published work and workshopped our own. However, I do have some suggestions for improvement. There should be an option to continue focusing on one long project to make it really comprehensive and excellent instead of writing two. Also, the course focused so much on the \"how\" that it often neglected the \"why.\" This course could benefit from a day or at least a few minutes each class to discuss the ethics or raison d'etre of this kind of journalism and storytelling. What does it mean to be a journalist in this day and age? What space is it intended to fill between news and entertainment? What responsibility to the audience or his or herself does a journalist have when choosing how to tell a story? We often read articles from the New Yorker, which caters to a very specific audience. For whom should this style of journalism be written and is there a way to make it more inclusive?",
    "Professor Strebeigh has designed this class exceptionally well for us to learn  we took apart every reading in order to really understand how to use structure and voice in our own writing, and it was super helpful. I learned a lot. I wonder if we could have spent more time on workshopping, dedicating all of class time to it instead of around half. I felt like sometimes we rushed through and since everyone wrote such long pieces it would have been nice to give them more attention."

   "comments": [
    "This is one of the two best courses I've taken at Yale. If you get in, you have to take this class. Prof. Strebeigh is the most enthusiastic, energetic, discerning writing professor you'll ever meet, and I learned so much from him about building structures and personas that creatively fit my dramas. He cares so much about teaching, and I found his extensive feedback on my writing invaluable. Plus, I was amazed by the other people who took this class alongside me. If you love to write, you have to take this class.",
    "100%! This course is amazing because of Professor Strebeigh. His teaching style can scare people at the beginning (he's intense, and doesn't give you the answers -- he expects you to figure it out, even if it means wading around and dry discussions), but trust me -- give it a chance and it'll be one of the best courses you're taking at Yale. Professor Strebeigh genuinely looks out for his students; he'll sit after class and help you brainstorm your piece for an hour or read your clips as you try to apply for a job. He's one of those professors who you want to continue being friends with for years after college!",
    "Yes. If you can get in, you're a lucky duck.",
    "- This class was one of the best Ive taken at Yale. Id recommend it to a student whos willing to put in the work and isnt attached to the idea of a perfect grade.",
    "Yes, this is the best course I have taken at Yale. Professor Strebeigh changed the way I think about and approach writing and stories. Everything we learned in this class, we could pour back into our work. I found my thinking and writing expanding and improving. I looked forward to this class each week.",
    "Yes. This is a must-take course for students interested in developing creative nonfiction writing skills. You will become a better writer, period. And the class is a joy! Highly recommend!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you're serious about your writing! It's fun and frenetic, with quite a lot of freedom in your assignments, and you'll end up with two great clips. If you get in, it's definitely worth taking. As far as how it compares to other upper-level nonfiction classes, I would say it's more report-y than Fadiman and more creative than Stillman or Brill\/Woodward. It's fairly regimented and it is quite a lot of work, although that varies a lot depending on what your reporting looks like. You'll also do pretty extensive revisions on both pieces, which is helpful.",
    "Only take this course if you are really serious about\/really like writing and journalism. Anyone could benefit from learning how to write, but many or most of the class were current or former editors of or staff writers for campus publications, so the standard is high. On the course reviews there was a comment to only take this course during a light semester. I kind of ignored that advice. Bad decision. Don't make my mistake, and take it when you can easily devote time to the assignments.",
    "Absolutely, if you care about writing nonfiction and want to get better. The feedback is incredibly helpful and the class is really intense  the reporting and writing can really take over your semester but its a great intensive introduction\/ immersion into non fiction and journalism. Professor Strebeigh is super great and beyond available. He will work really hard to help you improve."
