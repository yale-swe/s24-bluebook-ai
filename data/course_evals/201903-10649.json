   "comments": [
    "I gained a much stronger familiarity with the Ancient Greek language throughout the course, as well as a better sense of Ancient Greek culture through our reading of Xenophon's Symposium, class discussions where Professor LeVen shared her extensive knowledge, and our class trip to the YUAG. I feel much more confident picking up a Greek text or taking further courses in Classics, which is what I hoped to gain from the course. I also feel that this course helped me discover what methods worked best for me (such as reading with other people and rereading texts multiple times) in preparing for consistently challenging but fair exams.",
    "Greek language skills, knowledge of ancient Greek culture, way to number in French (I love the way Prof. LeVen numbers so much)",
    "This class exercised reading of Greek prose. I got much faster and agile at preparing passages for translation in class and at sight translation.",
    "My Greek greatly improved over the course of the semester. Different grammatical concepts became understood through extensive reading of our Greek text as well as many supplementary review sheets generously provided by our professor.",
    "This class dramatically developed my skills in reading ancient Greek and understanding Greek grammar.",
    "I improved my ability to translate Ancient Greek prose. We focused a lot on vocabulary and grammar. I felt like I was a lot better at reading Greek by the end.",
    "I gained experience reading continuous Attic prose, which in turn reinforced grammar and vocabulary from the introductory levels of the language. I also practiced sight-reading, including small doses of contemporary poetry. Our text, Xenophon's Symposium, offered a window into fourth-century elite culture as well as a sampling of its author's prose style.",
    "the basics of ancient greek literature (prose) and strengthening of vocab and grammar elements",
    "I learned more than I ever wanted to about symposium culture, and picked up some more Greek along the way."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Frequent quizzes, assignments, and longer exams ensured that I was constantly working hard and learning in different ways throughout the course; I especially appreciated more creative assignments, like when we wrote our own section of the Symposium in English while incorporating Greek particles, which we had learned about in a previous assignment). We covered a lot of material (the entire Symposium!) with a very thorough understanding of grammar and content, which felt like an incredible accomplishment for my first Greek reading class. Calling on everyone to read every day made sure everyone was prepared and participated in the class, but Prof. LeVen was always understanding and never made me feel stressed in class.",
    "I think this course was generally quite strong--you read and practice reading.",
    "The course was a challenging leap from beginner level Greek to this intermediate level, but the pace of the course was adjusted to meet the needs of the class. The only weakness was the amount of Greek needed to know for some of the assessments. Sometimes it felt like we had to be familiar with as much Greek was on a midterm for just a quiz. The additional assignments for the class were quite enjoyable. We got to think about Greek in different ways besides just reading it and discussing the grammar. Lastly, getting help for this class was very easy. Professor LeVen was more than willing to help every student and really cared about how all of us were doing.",
    "We read an interesting text; our professor was very available for help outside class; the grammar review was helpful. Yet more grammar review might have improved this class.",
    "This class was a very structured and serious way to get better at translating Greek. Professor LeVen was so helpful because she explained grammar very well. We did other exercises besides translating, like studying particles and making elegant translations, and I really enjoyed those. I think the class moved a little too fast at times, but the pace also forced me to read faster and improve. I think it would have been helpful to slow down and review grammar concepts a little more methodically. Overall though, I loved this class and learned a lot from it!",
    "The course was very good at requiring a high level of engagement with the Greek text that we read, and by the end I am certain that all the students were much more comfortable with Greek prose than when they started. The course might be improved by dedicating more time to actual discussion of the contents of the text and literary analysis of what we were reading. I say this because, though we did go over everything together, I often felt I did not really synthesize what I was reading and rather was only translating. Still, the class very effectively increased my engagement with the Greek language and made me much more comfortable with prose.",
    "In my opinion, our decision to read all of Xenophon's Symposium was both a strength and a weakness. I certainly enjoyed the opportunity to read a full text -- including the sense of accomplishment when we reached the final lines! -- but once I got the hang of Xenophon and his characters I wondered whether I could learn something more from trying out a different text. As any of her other course evaluations will confirm, Professor LeVen's teaching is always a strength. I never stopped looking forward to class.",
    "The course builds intensely off of the previous Greek courses (in addition to expecting a thorough understanding of advanced grammar). All assignments were challenging. Handouts were particularly helpful, and the class support was fantastic (both from the professor and students.) \r\nIf I were more a linguist, I think I could adequately critique the class but I'm certain my experience and difficulty with the language is more unique than common",
    "This course was surprisingly advanced for an introductory prose course. Because the average abilities of the students was so high, the course moved very quickly, and I wish it had been slower. Maybe if there were a more advanced option for the more experienced students, it would have been better for the less."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I feel so much more comfortable reading Greek and excited to take more advanced Ancient Greek classes in the future as well! It was intense and challenging, but always in a productive and not too overwhelming way - the classroom environment fostered was one of intellectual excitement, rather than competition. This class is perfect for anyone hoping to take Intermediate Ancient Greek.",
    "If you just finished your ancient Greek grammar course, just take this course.",
    "This is an excellent L3 Greek class. Professor LeVen is excellent and excited about our learning the language and makes the class super fun. The work is incredibly manageable as well.",
    "Yes! Your Greek will improve so much in this course. It will be a challenge and it will require a lot of work and discipline, but it is well worth it when you reach the end of the semester and realize how much progress you've made and the amount of Greek you've read. Professor LeVen is a wonderful instructor, who will push you to be such a better Greek student.",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "Yeah! If you just took L2 Greek, it's a really great way to continue improving. It's definitely a decent amount of work, but I think it was worth it.",
    "If you are passionate about the classics, then yes I would recommend this. This course taught me not only to be more comfortable with the Greek language, but also to adapt to a college-level workload and rhythm for a classics course. The constant amount of work did get occasionally difficult and has the potential to wear some people down (as it did me at times), but I believe this is to be expected of all classics courses. The course and instructor were very forgiving when it came to the level of Greek that students had, to ensure that we learned in the best way and most appropriate way considering our intermediate skill.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to a student learning ancient Greek, especially if you have the opportunity to take it with Professor LeVen (though I'm sure whoever teaches it in any year will be a capable instructor as well!). This question is somewhat moot for any intermediate language class: if you're thinking about L3, you know where you are and what you stand to learn. I do wonder whether I should have taken bridge Greek instead of L3; still, I'm glad that I ended up in a class where I felt challenged at a comfortable level and had the chance to solidify grammar and vocabulary without drowning in reading. Consider all of your options -- professors and the DUS will certainly help -- and, whatever you do, take Greek!",
    "I would recommend this course to students with a strong foundation in ancient greek grammar, warning students without a strong vested interest in the language that it will be extremely challenging. Learning the concepts and being able to read Greek is an accomplishment and a personal achievement, but this language and this class particularly will push you to your limits linguistically"
