I also learned about past pandemics (e.g. 1918 influenza) and the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic beginning in 2019. As a prospective non-science major, this class allowed me to understand the immune system without having to know the intricate details of chemistry or biology required for a more advanced class. A good course on the whole.",
                "this course taught immunology in a really comprehensive way and helped me put together all the moving parts in my head in a neat way.",
                "This course provided a well-organized, coherent overview of the immune system, which was such an interesting body system to study. This immunity survey class did not provide as deep a study as you would find in an advanced class, but we still gained a good understanding of a number of vital immunity topics: inflammation, innate immunity, lymphatic system, T and B cells, immune cell development, pattern recognition, antibodies, vaccination, tolerance, HIV, Influenza, Covid-19, HPV, and the microbiome (among other topics). If these topics interest you but you don't wish to take an advanced-level course at this time, go for it!",

By the end of the course, you would leave with a good understanding of how the body fights against diseases, ranging from bacteria to viruses to cancers, etc. You touch concepts like somatic hypermutation, etc. regarding the adaptive immune system and how T and B memory cells defend the body. You also touch on concepts like cancer treatments (and the science behind it) as well as the role of art in scientific topics, like art during COVID, among many other relevant topics like vaccines and health organizations.",

I also learned about autoimmune diseases, vaccines, and the importance of our microbiome. Finally, I gained insights about the connections between art and public health.",

                "The strengths are the Professor. Dr. Kavathas is an angel! She is so attentive to students and sweet, not to mention how willing she is to help you outside of class and during office hours if you need it. The discussion section was also great! Some lectures I've taken have very lackluster discussion sections, but this class had very lively ones that actually complimented the lecture well. In terms of weaknesses, a bit more clarification at the beginning would work well for lectures. Especially for non-stem students, launching into microbiology from the get-go can be very overwhelming. Perhaps an initial overview lecture of everything we should know going in would be helpful to preface the content itself.",
                "Fantastic course. I took this course as a non-science student and found it to be the perfect balance of accessible and challenging.",
                "Strength: great class for non-science majors. Professor Kavathas is awesome -- so nice, so fun, so entertaining, and a great teacher of course.\r\nWeakness: sometimes lectures felt rushed and like we tried to cover too much",
                "The only weakness of the course was that I wish when we got our grades and notes back for our psets, they told us what we were missing from questions where points were docked. Otherwise there are many strengths: The TAs Kavathas chose were super helpful and knowledgeable and one even hosted a really helpful study session during finals to answer questions and go over key concepts. Lectures are well organized and posted right after class. One possible improvement though would be to post lectures before class so that you can take notes before class and add to them during because its hard to keep up with everything on the slides. Professor Kavathas is a nice grader, the TAs can be a bit more strict with grades thought but they only grade the Psets.",
                "Strengths: this course is incredibly holistic and focuses on both the biological and social elements of pandemics which I think is really important. There is a good amount of biology involved but Professor Kavathas was really good with keeping the social and political components of biology in the syllabus. For example, we discussed not only the structure of the HIV virus but also the discrimination the pandemic caused. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the readings for discussion section felt random. I really felt this with the Polio book which taught me a lot but was confusingly written and therefore discussing it was sometimes difficult. Also- sometimes the grading of the assignments felt very subjective to which TA was grading. While most of the assignments did add to my understanding of the material, some like the paper did not.",
                "The only suggestion I have for improvement of this course is that the grading of the essay and the presentation seemed somewhat arbitrary to me. I realize that these are the two non-objectively graded components of the course, but I wish there were some more explicit guideline on what to include.",
                "Strengths: tfs were all wonderful, I loved the interactive aspect of lecture (made it feel like a large seminar), appreciated the inclusion of the arts and social issues with the focus on the science\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the powerpoints were a bit confusing and didn't explain the concepts clearly which made taking notes in class a bit difficult",
                "Strengths: well-organized, divided into relevant units, comprehensive booklet that you MUST read as you go along for best outcomes, a wonderful professor and TFs who are generous with their time and care about their students and learning, a diversity of assignments (manageable PSETs, guest speakers, presentations, one very short essay, etc.), very insightful reading assignments\r\nWeaknesses: hard to think of any! The rhythm and instructional methods of this course were all very positive in my opinion.",
                "Gained a better understanding of my own body, the pandemic, diseases, etc. \r\nLooked at art and history related to immunity and epidemics\r\nHelped me unpack readings about science - helpful as a humanities major\r\nTeaching assistants were amazing - appreciated after class tutoring events",
                "Strengths: interesting topic and Prof. Kavathas and TFs really care, and they're flexible in meeting you and also they're flexible in talking with you about assignments. Also, it is very non-science major friendly, with humanities-related topics and readings like when you focus on polio and the different social and political implications of the development of the polio vaccine, as one example.",
                "I think there were a good amount of topics covered and a good amount of time spent on them. The professor did a good job at explaining concepts. I also liked that she had so many different types of assignments and the grade was distributed among them, rather than having high stakes exams that determine your grade as many other STEM classes tend to do. She also did a lot of breakout rooms and activities, and though I am not a fan of those, they were good practices for engagement and integration of the material. The TA's were also great resources, and I liked that she had them do lectures on their own work. One thing that I did think could be improved was that sometimes the professor would go through the material really fast, and have a lot of time left over at the end of class. There was time for questions then, but when no one had any she would let us go a little early. It was nice, but I would have preferred a slower run through the lecture. I think she might have noticed it though and fixed this issue, as I only remember thinking this towards the first half of the semester.",
                "Strengths: There's a focus on equipping students to be scientifically literate. Professor Kavathas really dedicates herself to students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think feedback could have been more detailed on assignments in order to help students improve. Sometimes feedback was only a couple words."

                "Yes! If you want to better understand your body and the decisions you make for it, it's an excellent class. It is not an easy class if STEM is not your strong suit, but I would recommend taking it your first or second year as a science credits with actually beneficial knowledge. Especially during the pandemic, I had a much greater understanding of vaccines and herd immunity. Not to mention the history we went over, which made me realize that we are going through is nothing new, and that humanity has always recovered from pandemics. It was a great class and I definitely recommend it.",
                "Please take this course! Great for non-science majors and science majors alike.",
                "Yes -- especially fro non-science majors who need a science credit. Material isn't too challenging, but sometimes you may eel a little lost with all the terminology .",
                "This is a great science class for someone interested in biology but not a stem major/hasnt taken biology since high school. Professor Kavathas was hands down the sweetest and professor Ive had in a stem course at Yale. She is passionate about the material, wants her students to succeed, and takes the time to get to know students as best as she can. I definitely recommend taking a course with her, specifically this one if you would like to learn about the relevant topics of pandemics and interesting information about how the human immune system works (its lowkey really cool).",
                "I would! It feels very relevant and Professor Kavathas is so kind and caring. There is a good amount of Biology involved, however, so I would not recommend it if you have 0 experience with Biology. Further, there is a good amount of homework so be prepared to put in some effort throughout the semester!",
                "100% would recommend this class to all students both non-stem and stem!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who does not know about the immune system and how it works. Even if you are a science major in another science, I would recommend this course. It helped me to understand how and why vaccines work, how the immune system coordinates its response, and what are causes/effects/solutions for a number of illnesses (e.g. viral/bacterial infection, autoimmune disorders, cancer).",
                "Absolutely! Professor Kavathas is delightful and this class genuinely taught me a lot about immunology (not just the science, but also the social impacts of certain diseases)",
                "Certainly! Though you will find a mix of students in this course (STEM and non-STEM alike), this is not an advanced-level course. That said, you can gain a rudimentary understanding of a variety of topics vital to developing biological literacyProfessor Kavathas ultimate stated goal of the course.",
                "Yes! Great for all majors - \r\nGained a better understanding of my own body, the pandemic, diseases, etc. \r\nLooked at art and history related to immunity and epidemics\r\nHelped me unpack readings about science - helpful as a humanities major\r\nTeaching assistants were amazing - appreciated after class tutoring events",
                "Yes! Good to learn about the body and how it fights against pathogens/diseases, especially for non-science majors. You don't need that much science background if at all, and if you're engaged and doing the work, you'll be learning a lot about the different mechanisms that body has, ranging from T and B cells to macrophages to dendritic cells and the places they are located and the many different ways they interact with each other and detect pathogens (and sometimes self, which is cause for pathology) in order to create the right response. I didn't really know anything going in, but the course material and lectures really help!",
                "Yes. I personally do not like biology that much, but I still think it was an interesting class. The professor also kept the course engaging and fun. The assignments were not bad and there was a lot of opportunity to succeed since there were many different types of assignments (problems sets, essay, presentation, etc).",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class. I hadn't taken biology since my freshmen year of high school, but I still felt this class was accessible to me. At the sime time, I do feel that I learned a ton about the immune system and pathogens. It's even helped me be able to understand one of my friend's (a bio major) thesis research better.
