    "I learnt about how to measure proportions, shade, value, tone and composition. Overall this greatly improved my drawing ability and also indroduced me to a quirky aspect of the art world.",
    "This class was so LIT. I see the world very differently now, and have developed a new sense of how I look at the world and how I draw and how I even THINK.",
    "There's really too many things to list. I really learned a lot from this class and it's definitely one of my favorites. \r\n\r\n1. how to draw still life: fruits, boxes, buildings\r\n2. 1 & 2 point perspective drawings\r\n3. figure drawing\r\n4. tones\r\n5. drawing faces\r\n6. experimental \/ creative drawing (abstract)\r\n7. creating symbols \/ letters that aren't a language (i forgot what you call this)",
    "I started this class with no knowledge of how to draw, and by the end of it I felt like I had learned the foundations of an analytical skill. I learned a lot about how to draw but also about important artists and art history moments."

    "You learn a lot as you draw a lot for homework. I enjoyed the figure drawing in class but aside from that the class could be improved by doing more drawing in class. I enjoyed the peabody trip but would have loved to do more trips outside the classsroom.",
    "The class itself was a lot of fun, but it's a lot of work because there's a lot of homework. In-class itself is a lot of fun, but it started out quite slow because we drew boxes for a couple weeks.",
    "biggest strength: you learn a LOT because there is a lot of drawing during class and there is also a lot of homework\r\n\r\nweakness: the workload is the most out of almost any of the yale classes i took but it's honsetly worth it."

    "Yes!! It was super enlightening and challenging and totally worth the workload",
    "absolutely recommended. the instructor edgar serrano is really really good and helps you learn a lot.",
    "This is the best class I've taken at Yale and it makes me wish I had started doing art courses sooner in my college career. it's a lot of work, but in return you are able to dig into the development of the skill in a way that's really rewarding."
