                "The strengths are the instructor and the syllabus readings, but I do wish there was more class engagement early on and a more diverse range of African American thinkers in terms of different religious backgrounds",
                "Strengths: balance of leftist and conservative arguments on key issues pertaining to Black liberation, easy to speak up in class\r\nWeaknesses: harsh grading considering little feedback / guidance given on essays, could have used more breaks during class",
                "Strengths \r\n-The course was well organized and comprehensive. \r\n-Wide range of thinkers and topics. \r\n-More African American thinkers explored than the traditional Black canon of Malcolm, Martin, DuBois, Washington, Douglass.\r\n-The assignment load is fair, diverse, and clear. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- Some omissions that may have made the course stronger include the work of Toni Morrison, Audre Lorde, James Baldwin, Angela Davis, Stokely Carmichael, and Huey P Newton, to name a few. \r\n- The week on early Black Feminism would have been well complemented with works in more recent and contemporary Black Feminism.\r\n- Professor Collins did explicitly address this at the outset of the course but it's worth noting here: some issue debates can be presented on the syllabus as though there was more of an even 50/50 intellectual split on the issue in the Black community than there actually is. This distortion I think is inherent to all syllabus construction when one is trying to capture has many perspectives as possible, but may pose a frustration to some students.\r\n- The syllabus includes a lot of opinion pieces. I am pro non-traditional and more informal forms of scholarship on syllabi, but I think some of the shorter pieces on this syllabus were more un-nuanced and hallow than pithy and poignant and take up space from more substantial pieces."
