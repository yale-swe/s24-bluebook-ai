    "This course, being a continuation of the Japanese language classes that preceded it, allowed students to gain a deeper understanding of additional grammar structures, kanji, and vocabulary, as well as the ability to better apply these aspects of the language to real world situations such as conversation or reading\/viewing Japanese language media.",
    "Much more kanji, a good number of new grammar patterns but also a solid review of old grammar patterns, more about Japanese culture than previous Japanese classes"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course definitely helped facilitate growth in the language, and served as an almost perfect continuation of L3. While the workload was high, this is a necessary component to advancement in any language. My only real complaint would be that it would've been nice to have review of old vocabulary and grammar structures interspersed throughout the curriculum so as not to forget them throughout the semester.",
    "As with other Japanese classes, I sometimes think this class moves too quickly. As in, the rate at which we are expected to memorize new kanji and vocabulary is often overwhelming. Otherwise, I really appreciated the review of past grammar patterns and the ability to learn about Japanese history and culture in Japanese!\r\nThere were some weeks in which we had 2-3 major things due (a skit and an oral test, for example) and this was stressful - I would prefer to have these major assignments spread out more instead of clustered together."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if one has the required skill to take this course, I would highly recommend it. By the end of it, I became much more able to converse with others in Japanese, representing real tangible growth. I would not recommend this class to someone who is worried about the time and\/or work commitment, however.",
    "I'd recommend this class to anyone else in a heartbeat. Great class, great professors, and you learn so much. The workload is high, but if you've taken L1\/L2 you should be used to it and the class is totally worth it.",
    "yes",
    "Though the workload is a lot, I think the strength of the Japanese program at Yale lies in the professors being so dedicated to your learning and growth in the language skill, and I highly recommend the L1-4 Japanese courses in general. L3 and L4 provide a more chill environment in which the focus is on understanding what you are learning, not just haphazardly stuffing it into your head, as L1 and L2 felt to me. L4 in particular is cool because each chapter in the textbook teaches you about a different aspect of Japanese life and culture: travel, politics, history, even traditional stories!"
