                "Before taking this course, I had a pretty much fully formed opinion about what the problems in education are and, generally, what people currently involved in public education need to do to solve them; however, after taking this course, I learned that there are so many possible ways to \"reform\" education and that perhaps the question is not which one is the right way, but rather how can ideas from each model be synthesized to offer the best possible educational experience to children? \r\n\r\nI loved that this class was based on case studies of particular districts, schools, and states, so I became a lot better at identifying the practices that actually function to improve learning versus those that just look good on paper.",

                "This class is perfect. Genuinely. Maybe not a growth mindset that Professor Lemons would like but I would not change anything about the course.",
                "Strengths: incredibly engaging seminar! All of the readings were interesting and facilitated meaningful discussion during class. This truly is a class where you learn from your peers as much as you do from the readings or professor.",
                "This is an amazing course. The biggest strength of this course is that you are engaged 100% of the time. Professor Lemons often cold-called us (but not in a way that was intimidating), made sure to ask for everyone's opinion, had us role-play, and facilitated a variety of activities using breakout rooms. The cases and articles that Professor Lemons assigned us to read were thought-provoking and always left me with questions, and I genuinely looked forward to our once-weekly seminars where peers would share their thoughts on the case and Professor Lemons would give his own take.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of this course was a group project where we essentially got to choose whatever education-related problem we wanted and research it\/come up with a proposal. Throughout the semester, you turn in chunks of the project in the form of diagrams and memos, and at the end of the semester, there is a symposium where Professor Lemons invites many important stakeholders of education in Connecticut (i.e. superintendents and the commissioner of education) and all the groups present their findings and proposal and receive feedback from the audience. I had such a great time working with my group, and Professor Lemons always gave us great feedback that encouraged us to look at our problem from a different angle. I honestly have nothing negative to say about this course.",
                "Professor Lemons is outstanding: professional, compassionate, and enthusiastic.",
                "This course is fantastic.  I especially like how the work was spread throughout the semester with the case analysis and the group project.  The only small improvement would be to spend less time on logistics in each class so that we could explore the cases in even greater depth.",
                "This course's greatest strength is Professor Lemons, who breathes life into the material. This class was one of the best I've ever taken at Yale.",
                "The course is centered on examining real world applications of education reform policies, which was an incredibly refreshing departure from how Yale classes normally go (too theory heavy w\/o consideration of implementation and consequences). The biggest strength of the class, however, was Professor Lemons who is an absolute gem.",
                "Strengths: great professor, lively class discussion, a very accepting and kind cohort of classmates, group project (surprisingly!) and the readings were some of the most interesting I've ever had \r\nWeaknesses: the online format was really difficult and sad especially for such an interactive class"
