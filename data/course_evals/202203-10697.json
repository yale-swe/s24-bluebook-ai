                "Analysing a broad range of texts, films and literature in a fun and engaging way. I learnt a lot about indigenous culture and appropriation, which I didnt know much about previously.",
                "I was able to fill in the grammatical gaps that I had from the Spanish I learned in high school. I also learned a great deal of new vocabulary and much more confidence when speaking. Outside of the language though, I learned a lot from our three units, movies, texts, and artworks that we interacted with. These ranged from changing narratives, cultural appropriation, colonization, indigenous wisdom, fake news, and to sum it up, I really learned about humanity in general.",
                "speaking in spanish and developing my writing skills",
                "Learned a lot about Spanish culture.",
                "I gained skills in speaking, listening, and writing in Spanish. The topical rather than linguistic focus of the course allowed me to learn and use Spanish in-context rather than only learning grammar and vocabulary.",
                "spanish speaking and language, communication, cultural knowledge, modern day issues",
                "How to look at art, practicing critical analysis of movies, art, and theater.",
                "The structure of this class was really different to L1-3, as you built upon your knowledge of Spanish through quite advanced analysis of artworks, books, plays and films as opposed to set grammar and vocab units. I learnt how to speak more spontaneously in Spanish and built really regular practice of full sentence structures, using the subjunctive and expressing opinions. The unit topics were also very engaging and varied, for example on intersectionality, fake news and the indigenous experience.",
                "We covered three main themes in this course: the connection between witches and feminism; worldviews, culture, and struggles of indigenous communities; and the effect of fake news, propaganda, and lies on the Spanish-speaking world. Grammatically, we learned about how to use the subjunctive in different tenses, vocabulary associated with each unit, and more. We learned new material by reading or listening to primary sources such as scholarly articles, periodicals, songs, documentaries, and video essays discussing its impact as a class, and then diving deeper into the subject in homework and projects. Through taking this course I gained a brand new perspective on the lives, trials, and worldviews of groups that are often left out of conversations on cultures in the Spanish-speaking world, and I definitely want to expand upon this in future study of Spanish."

                "I think some more one on one time with the teacher could be useful. Even the teacher just walking around checking up on students would be really helpful.",
                "The strengths of this course was the asynchronous Wednesdays, especially if you have a 9:25. I also loved how intimate and collaborative the course was, it definitely pushed me to get more comfortable speaking Spanish with others. A weakness of this course, for me, was groupwork that needed to be done outside of class time. It can be very hard to communicate and find times to meet outside of class if needed. However, working with a group decreased the work needed to be done on a project, and it's always better learning together than on your own, in my opinion.",
                "Really structured.",
                "The wide variety of projects, assignments, readings, and texts we worked with was extremely helpful. There was a good mix of reading, writing, group work and individual work. That being said, sometimes the group projects on asynchronous days were more of a hassle than they were helpful. The asynchronous days, apart from group work day, were very helpful.",
                "strengths: very interesting topics, engaging projects, hands on learning\r\nweaknesses: not very many ties to actual Spanish culture itself, some material didn't feel necessary",
                "Strengths - The class content was very well-structured, and really encouraged you to practice speaking and having longer conversations with native speakers. At first I was surprised the course did not have a formal approach to teaching grammar and vocab (they were mainly drawn from the texts we were analysing and nota huge part of the homework) but the Professor explained the aim is to get us using these in our day to day speech and homework and I agree this had rewards in the long run.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - A lot of the assignments were art/media related and it sometimes felt like we were spending more time creating a video/art piece/editing a TikTok than actually improving our Spanish. Spanish was of course an important element of the script and structure, but there were two instances in the class when you had to create an actual piece of art or a video as part of the project and that felt like a distraction from the actual aim of the class.",
                "This course was tremendous at drawing parallels between the seemingly disparate units and weaving together a collective narrative that left me with a new perspective on the Spanish-speaking world. It was also very good at breaking down each worldview or perspective that we studied into its principle components and systematically learning about them through class discussions, homeworks, and projects. I think having a fully fledged lesson or two on pertinent grammar that would aid us in our discussions and deepen our knowledge of the language would helps students express their opinions on the course material more effectively and be prepared to dive deep into the material of future Spanish classes."

                "I would recommend this course to any student that is interested in applying their Spanish in a more contextualized way. This class is less about learning how to speak Spanish and more about learning in Spanish. The topics in this course were highly interesting, and I feel more confident in my writing and speaking abilities at the end of the semester than I did at the start.",
                "Yes, if you want to develop your speaking skills specifically.",
                "Absolutely! This course was very well taught and it definitely broadened my horizons on different lived experiences in the Spanish-speaking world. The workload is definitely manageable and you learn from a variety of different sources in each unit from periodicals to movies. Profesora Glenski is a great instructor who gives detailed feedback on each assignment, is passionate about and engage with the course material, and is always happy to help students out when they need it."
