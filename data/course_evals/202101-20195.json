                "Through the workshop setting of this course, I developed my fiction writing skills through a series of writing assignments accompanied by feedback from the professor and other students. In addition to individual writing, we also read short stories by a variety of authors and discussed their craft and writing techniques.",
                "This class was a traditional workshop-style fiction class: each week we workshopped 2-3 stories by members of the class, and we read and discussed published works of short fiction. Because it was an advanced class, we didn't dive too deep into the nitty-gritty of form, craft, plot, character, etc, but instead used our workshop discussions to learn about what makes a strong story. I think I became a better reader of fiction through the workshop setting. We also had to write a few rough pages for smaller groups twice over the course of the semester to practice experimenting and getting thoughts out on the page. I never used these pages for my 2 stories, but it was an incredibly worthwhile exercise that I will take with me.",
                "This course allowed me the time and space to develop two fleshed-out short stories. Furthermore, I read and learned from the works of other authors, using their pieces as models of writing for my own.",
                "I learned how to think critically about fiction what questions to pose and how to answer them. I learned how to hold discussions about fiction and summarize what I think are the strengths and weaknesses of a piece.",
                "I got feedback on fiction I had written and learned analytic skills for reading short fiction",
                "I learned a lot about how to improve my own writing through the workshops, and also gained a better understanding of how to give constructive and useful feedback to others. Further, through the readings (both outside and from others in the class) I got a new insight into techniques I can incorporate into my own pieces.",

                "I can't think of any major weaknesses in this course. Some of the deadlines felt like they could have been a little later in the week (it seems like midnight on Friday would have been a more reasonable workshop deadline than noon) but for the most part everything worked really well.",
                "I loved that this class was run as a traditional workshop. The other students were both incredibly talented and incredibly insightful, so every workshop was illuminating. As I said above, the smaller group mini-workshops of rough pages were also fruitful, and something I haven't done before in other workshops. I do wish that, in addition to writing canvas comments on people's stories, we were required to make some line edits and comments like I've had to do in other classes - those are very helpful to me as a writer, and make me an even more careful reader of other people's work. It was also slightly anticlimactic to end the semester without a \"final revision\" - revising one of our stories as a final assignment would have compelled us to implement some of the comments we've received. Lastly, I wish we had ended the semester with a talk/discussion about futures in writing - as both a wrap up and a useful sounding board for questions we all might have. But overall this class was amazing, even over Zoom.",
                "Strengths: the sheer amount that we're told to write was challenging but allowed me to thoroughly explore all corners of a story. It also gave us a lot of material to discuss. The class was extremely well organized and structured  everyone was able to participate an equal amount.\r\nWeaknesses: I almost wished to have more direct takeaways when discussing the readings. Sometimes, I felt like too much time had been dedicated to workshop that we lacked the time to have in-depth discussions about the readings. A lot of times, I felt like I had to come to my own conclusions about what I was to take away from a reading. I'd almost prefer not having a presenter so that we had more time to just dive into discussion.",
                "I loved the assigned readings for this course, and the workshop discussions were really great. Personally, I might have appreciated a bit more instruction about craft outside of the workshop or reading discussion, as well as some writing exercises/prompts, but that's just my preference.",

Her marginal comments on drafts are fantastic, and generally, the class atmosphere was a really positive one. Everyone in the course was so talented, and it was always a joy to read their work.",

But, Professor Choi is extremely helpful and welcoming, so it wouldn't be still be a very productive experience.",
