While we practiced them all in class, it was not always possible to schedule more time to practice. Occasionally, we had homework projects in which we practiced the techniques, but these were not weekly. While this would increase the class burden on both professors and students, I think more frequent homework assignments would have improved my acquisition of these skills. However, I understand that the professors had many kinds of imaging to teach us and could not always spend much time on each one."
