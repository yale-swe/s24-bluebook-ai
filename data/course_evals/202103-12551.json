                "A strength of the course is the breadth of material it covers. A weakness is that it is all very subjective material, so what is taught is simply the opinion of the professor, which can make it very difficult to find guidance / clarification via the internet or textbooks. The course was also taught remotely, which made it a bit difficult to take in the information.",
                "Strengths: lectures were recorded, so we had access to watch them again. Also, Jonas was incredibly helpful as a TA.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lectures could be hard to follow and Professor Wettlaufer did not pause often to answer questions.",
                "Lectures were well organized and I was really interested in the topics covered in the course. However, I didn't feel like the lecture prepared us for some of the questions on the problem sets and midterms. It would've been helpful to have readings to cover the concepts or maybe a bit more preparation for how we would be applying the things we derived in class, because I ended up feeling somewhat dependent on the teaching fellow's discussion section to go over concepts that we were being assessed on. Also, the problem sets and midterms were sporadically assigned and that part of the class did not feel well organized."
