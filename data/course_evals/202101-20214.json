The readings build on each other and provide diverse perspectives on the same core issues. I think class discussion was sometimes a little slow, especially in the middle of the semester, but this could be vastly improved in an in-person teaching environment.",
                "Prof. Kramnick does a really good job balancing his syllabus between works of philosophy and works of literature, and my only complaint is that, as a more literature-oriented person, we'd sometimes spend a bit more time on the philosophy than a couple of the poems. More balance would be great, but that's a very small thing.",
                "I thought the course was fantastic! We read great texts and had great discussions. I think having a clear focus for the course (an inter-disciplinary look at the connections between literature and philosophy) really helped keep discussions concrete and focused, an issue that I've encountered in other English course I've taken. I appreciated Professor Kramnick's introductory lectures at the start of each class, and our occasional break-out rooms (though I would have appreciated more variation on the standard seminar-discussion from time to time)."
