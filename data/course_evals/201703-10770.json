    "Learned a lot of chinese!",
    "I built proficiency in basic Chinese. It helped me build my confidence in speaking as well; the strong emphasis on spoken language and conversation is unique to Yale's program.",
    "Beginner level knowledge of Chinese. Speaking, writing, reading, listening all at a conversational level.",
    "Introductory Chinese",
    "Learned basic writing\/reading\/speaking of Chinese.",
    "Although I had taken a couple of Chinese courses before, this class took my use of the language to a level far beyond what I had thought possible in this short amount of time.",
    "I felt like I received a transformative introductory education to Chinese and cannot express enough how much I enjoyed this course. Critical thinking, pushing myself to my greatest academic limits, and more.",
    "I learned how to speak Chinese.",
    "I learned how to critically think about and use the grammatical structure, pronunciation, writing, and reading of the Chinese Language. I also learned valuable listening skills and was challenged to find creative and alternative ways to learn the language in ways that were best for me.",
    "I went from 0 knowledge of the language to feeling comfortable learning. I've been told by several Chinese speakers that my accent is excellent, and I can begin to decode Hanzi. It's really great.",
    "a whole new language!",
    "I learned so much grammar and vocabulary that would be essential to all types of conversation in Chinese. Before I dont think I would be able to survive in China, but now I want to travel to China and learn more Chinese."

   "comments": [
    "One of the very few things I would change about this wonderful class is the level of support students receive with respect to writing characters. No instructional time is regularly and consistently dedicated to understanding the pictorial etymology of characters or practicing radicals -- I strongly believe that a greater focus on writing during class time would be enormously beneficial.",
    "Great teachers!",
    "This course doesn't have many weaknesses, but I might have appreciated being forced to have more extended conversations more often. Otherwise, the instruction is great and the homework is just enough to keep you caught up in class without drowning the student in new material. I never found myself too busy with Chinese, but I still learned loads this semester.",
    "It meets everyday, so there is daily homework and daily quizzes. Which is great for learning but a lot of work! The materials are fun and easy to study with. Class is a bit fast-paced with an emphasis on speaking, so there isn't much time to take notes.",
    "Great teachers, very interactive and engaging",
    "I have no complaints about the course, I especially like the system of rotating teachers.",
    "Really a fantastic course all around, the only way I could possibly want it to change is to have the teachers suggest more opportunities for students to further their learning except for the Chinese table and calligraphy on Fridays.",
    "The strengths were certainly the small class sizes, the wonderful peers and friends developed in them, and the quality of each professor. Every one of them was incredibly engaged and interested in you learning in a positive and productive way.",
    "no weaknesses \r\n\r\nstrengths - phenomenal teachers! I felt like every single teacher really cared about me learning Chinese and was very engaged.",
    "This class is very well structured for elementary students in Chinese. For the students who speak a different dialect of Chinese (eg Cantonese or Fujinese), perhaps there could be beginning Mandarin class for them."

    "If you are even remotely interested in the Chinese language then please take this course. Yes, it can be a lot of work at times, but it really is so rewarding at the end of the day. The teachers work very hard to make the language easy to learn.",
    "Would recommend. Great teachers and great class setting.",
    "I would. It's one of the best classroom learning environments you'll find if you want to learn Chinese. There's a reason Yale is known for its Chinese program.",
    "Yes! The teachers are phenomenal and the material is so fun.",
    "Yes, great course.",
    "Absolutely. Chinese (and East-Asian languages in general) is one Yale's strong suits,  so it's great to take advantage of their great department!",
    "Very good teaching. Strongly recommend.",
    "Absolutely, it is a great way to learn the language.",
    "YES. I loved learning Chinese and think that I will actually be able to utilize this language with further training.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to learn Chinese.",
    "Take it. You will learn so much and even after only a semester you'll be astounded by what you can do. The professors are wonderful. The work is worth it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is very good.",
    "YES because Chinese is such a useful language. Yale truly has the best Chinese department, so if you want to learn Chinese you should better do it here.",
    "Definitely take Chinese 110!! You learn so much, and at an incredibly reasonable pace, and youll be a much better speaker by the end of it."
