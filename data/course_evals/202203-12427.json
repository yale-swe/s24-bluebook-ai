I learned how these circuits can be used as qubits for quantum information processing, and I learned about methods for controlling such quantum systems using microwave voltage drives. I learned how to use the Python software packages scQubits and QuTiP to analyze the spectra and matrix elements of these circuits and simulate their evolution in time. More broadly, this course taught me valuable skills of self-directed research, such as keeping a research journal, setting up regular meetings, reading papers, and balancing a research commitment on top of classes.",

                "As an independent research course, the quality of the course is determined mostly by your specific research advisor and project. However, I will say that the final presentation being a Zoom room with basically only Prof. Baltay in attendance was really sad. In the future, the final presentations should be in person and split into sessions or they should be in the form of a big poster session.",
                "The required assignments (Plan, Midterm Progress Report, Final Presentation and Report) forced me to stay on track without being overly burdensome.",
                "This course is an amazing opportunity to elevate research to the same level of priority as other academic courses during the semester. It is especially potent during Junior year, when I was able to start directly applying the skills I was learning in my physics and computer science courses to research. I liked the regular checkpoints such as the mid-semester report and the end-of-year presentation and paper. This course is definitely more self-directed than many courses, but the extra degree of freedom was helpful in creating a very positive research experience that will lead me to conduct more research in the future. The weakness of this course was that there was little connectivity between students participating during the semester. I think it might be valuable to have several regular presentations throughout the semester so that students can see what other groups are researching and learn from their experiences.",
                "My only suggestion would be some scheduled reminders a few days before major deadlines (proposal, midterm report, etc.)",
                "This course has a lot of flexibility, which I think is essential for the nature of research. However, I think the meeting at the beginning of the semester should be scheduled with all of the students (or recorded or something) to make sure everyone understands the expectations completely before starting. I also think the final presentation should be a little bit of a bigger deal, perhaps with publicity to the faculty. This may just be a pandemic carryover, but I think the presentations should be in person because it was a bit anticlimactic to be presenting on Zoom to very few people.",
                "Strengths: time and freedom to complete your own research project\r\nWeaknesses: it might be helpful to have a couple example resources for proposals/reports to make sure we're on the right track. I'm assuming nothing is provided because the grading is very flexible, so I'm grateful that my work was accepted, but I was a bit nervous while writing my reports since I had never done a research project before and didn't know what would be expected for my papers. Overall, though, I think the lack of rubrics/strict guidelines was probably meant to relieve stress.",
                "pretty flexible",
                "I think some more check-ins could be useful, and some feedback on submitted work could be nice. It's also not very clear how grading works for this course."

Having this course count for a credit made it easy to prioritize research alongside classes, and I will take that skill with me even if I conduct independent research during future semesters without receiving course credit.",
