                "Strengths: Professor Steinberg; the reading list; the professor's fantastic mini-lectures at the beginning of each session; the seminar discussions; the structure of the course; the flexibility to submit 3 reading responses any time during the semester; the 2 longer papers. Weaknesses: none",
                "The course's strengths are its very interesting subject matter and readings, well-designed assignments that encourage reading and thought without excessive length, and a very intelligent and thoughtful instructor. One of the course's weaknesses is that it is not always clear what kinds of questions should be asked of the readings we do. Professor Steinberg always has great thoughts, but they do not always arise naturally in the discussion. Because many of the readings are historical in nature, it is hard to argue with their claims without a prior knowledge of the historiography, which no students coming into the class have. Another area of improvement is the way the seminar itself is run, which often functions more like a Q&A between each of the students and the professor rather than a group conversation. Part of that is the size of the class, bordering on too large for effective conversation, but also the professor jumps in with comments frequently, responding often to each student's contributions, which tends to keep the conversation from developing smoothly. The end of the class in some ways is the most disappointing because the frequent presence of guest speakers turns the class into a strict lecture/Q&A format right when students have developed the most knowledge and thoughts about the class material. I found myself wanting actual discussions at the end about the readings and the pandemic, even though the guest lectures were interesting. I wish there was a way they could have come earlier in the class when the collective knowledge was lower.",
                "The course was had many amazing and informative readings, along with great guest speakers who spoke candidly about their work and experiences. The course was fantastic and could only be improved by having a set of discussion questions to reference if/when class discussions aren't flowing.",

I would recommend this course to such a variety of students, from pre-meds to political science majors to global majors to anyone with an interest in African history, public health, or global governance. For someone new to the social sciences, this course allowed me to build confidence in writing 10 page papers with no prompt, doing original research, reading the literature effectively, and participating in seminar.",
                "I would highly recommend this course.",
                "I would recommend the course to someone interested in the material and who wants to learn about a very important part of history that is often unacknowledged. The material itself is really great, but it is likely not the best conversational seminar you could take.",
