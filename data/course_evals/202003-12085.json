In normal times the opportunity to view objects in the Babylonian collection in person would be an additional bonus. There could be a greater effort made to integrate the topics between the three main cultures of focus - perhaps organizing the course by type of magic or ritual and then discussing its use and applications in each of the three cultures.",
