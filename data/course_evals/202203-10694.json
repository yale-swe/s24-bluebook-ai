I thought that all the media we engaged with helped expand my understanding of social dynamics in Latin America with regards to indigeneity, race, class, gender and nationality. I appreciate how the class was structured to improve my Spanish skills through engagement with important topics, rather than through a focus on grammar and more technical aspects of language.",
                "I think the discussion-based format was a major strength that forced us to practice and refine our verbal Spanish. But the lack of actual advanced grammar  lessons/review/assignments held me back from reaching fluency. Also, the greatest weakness of this course was the focus on social justice. It is definitely a language AND social justice course. To some people, it could be polarizing as the focus moved beyond language.",
                "The course was very hands on and what we read and watched was very interesting. I wish the course did more work on listening comprehension, watching videos without subtitles and learning how to understand the language better.",

                "Speaking",
                "Loved this class and I thought it was organized much better than the L2 and L3 Spanish classes. Weekly grammar reviews mightve been beneficial.",
                "I think this course is very strong in providing engaging content and assignments. I wish we had more concrete opportunities to practice our speaking skills and expand our vocabulary, as I struggled with that throughout the semester.",
                "Excellent course overall. Very strong in developing conversational skills. I would have appreciated, however, a bit more energy into in class discussion about how we can say different things in Spanish using phrases or grammatical constructs that we dont have in English"
