                "I learned new insights into the human perspective of sexuality and creating a new lens of thinking about the world around me in many different aspects. I learned about world cultural differences of sexuality and different ways science contains bias. I also learned how to critically read and write in ways that I had never thought of before.",
                "Analyzing archives, understanding the intense theory of Foucault, and articulating myself better were some of the skills I developed in this class. This course offers the opportunity for Yale students to tackle questions regarding sexuality throughout history in a nuanced manner. Students in the class will also get the chance to have discussions with authors of works read in class as well.",

Usually I feel pretty nervous in my classes, but I felt really comfortable contributing and asking questions. She provides really helpful comments on the essays. Even the layout of the classroom facilitates learning (we sit in small groups and get to share our ideas with each other before moving to the larger class). I've become a better writer and thinker because of this class.",
                "There are only strengths. Everything from discussions to readings to essays makes this a phenomenal course.",
                "Professor Trumpler made class feel like a very safe, comfortable, and fun environment! Class was also not in a typical Yale classroom which made it more engaging. Readings were also very diverse and interesting, very engaging. Sometimes reading whole books (3 times) was a lot, but it made sense for the curriculum of the class and she didn't make us fully understand the entire books, so it was fair. Group discussions for about half of class time was both engaging and helped facilitate learning!",
                "The biggest strength was the discussions for every reading. Having them in small groups for half the class was meaningful and helped make the environment more welcoming to all viewpoints.",
                "Strengths: Great discussions, easy professor to talk to, great content. Weaknesses: None.",

                "Yes!!! Great intro writing class even for STEM people, connects science, society, and sexuality in a super engaging way and changes how you view sexuality and the role of science throughout history! Professor Trumpler was an amazing, super helpful professor as well",
                "100% take this course. If you think you would be interested at all, take it. Professor Trumpler is so wonderful and this course helps you see the world in new ways (especially the past). It doesn't have a huge workload but is engaging.",
                "Yes, this course is great for both humanities and stem majors.",
                "I would recommend this course immediately to so many people. I think it is a great intro to WGSS courses and also gives you a great foundation for looking at the world in a different way. I think this is a foundational class that should be more widely offered.",
                "I would totally recommend this class to another student! Professor Trumpler is so detailed in the feedback that she gives you on your essays, and the way she is so intentional in the development of class material is outstanding! I learned so much from this class and it is a great choice for first'years that need a writing credit.",
                "Yes, it opened my eyes and reframed how I view sexuality and the history of science.",
                "Definitely. There are many misinformed and superficial claims about sexuality in media nowadays. This course provides a fantastic recount of the developments in the discourse on sexuality and how it changed our perceptions of what something sexual or what sex is."
