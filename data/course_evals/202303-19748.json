                "This course is fairly unorganized. The professor does not use Canvas, so you never really know what your grades are on assignments. Thus, you really have no knowledge on your class performance until the very end. Throughout the entire semester, we only received feedback on our midterm, despite having several other assignments.",
                "It would be great to receive more feedback on our art as we went along, but practice makes perfect!",
                "I felt that I did not have as much feedback on my work as I would have wanted.",
                "The strength of the course is Meleko and Zoe, so just in general, the teaching team. The weakness of the course is sometimes short notice about assignment due dates, which creates stress among students, and also limited communication about grades up until your final grade comes out.",
                "Weaknesses are the grading schema. Very unclear about how the midterm, small assignments, and large assignments played a percentage role in the grading. The teacher also NEVER responds to email nor does he update the syllabus. The TA, Zoe was absolutely lovely."

However, this course is not really a gut and will require quite a bit of effort, especially if you're a beginner. The grading of assignments is also much stricter than you'd expect, given that this is a basic drawing course. In the end, I felt more stress from this course than I expected to.",
                "A great compliment to the rest of your workload. Also, fantastic for deepening your appreciation for art, and your own self-reflection.",

                "yes, I would 100% recommend this course to every single student. It changed my semester; it helped keep me sane. I learned so much about myself, my passions, and strengthened my drawing abilities. I grew so much and I made great relationships with everybody in the class and learned so much about them.",
                "Yes but don't expect it to be a gut: you will have to draw a LOT and the evaluation metrics are not lax."
