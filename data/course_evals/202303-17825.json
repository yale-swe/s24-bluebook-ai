            "comments": [
                "Strengths: low workload, engaging lectures, sections were very fun\r\nWeaknesses: requires heavy memorization for tests",
                "The lectures were informative but I think the tests were disproportionately difficult to the rest of the class.",
                "I think the course is strong, I do think it can get a little bogged down in the details at times.",
                "I didn't like how the retake date was within 2 days from the third exam. I felt myself having to memorize a lot of information and sometimes confusing the two tests.",
                "Gives me knowledge in spaces I normally would not delve into.",
                "The strengths were that the professors were all very enthusiastic in their teaching and explained concepts well. They genuinely seemed to care about our learning. However, I wish the exams incorporated more analysis-based, open-ended interpretation as opposed to rote memorization.",
                "Strengths: The lectures are all you need. The three exams are not cumulative. They are straightforward. What you learn in class is what you should study for each exam. The professors rotate, which is good or bad depending on your view. Personally, I thought Professor Carlson was best and I'd like him to teach all the lectures, but the other two professors were also very good and I enjoyed hearing their different perspectives.\r\nWeaknesses: Section is pointless, and the final project is mostly busywork. It barely has anything to do with the course content.",
                "The class has two glaring weaknesses. 1) They do not help you prepare for the exams. The review sessions are useless because the TFs do not even know what material will be on the exams. The review sessions are the TFs taking turns speedrunning the lecture material (verbatim). 2) Section is a waste of time. We did a bunch of dumb stuff to \"enhance our learning\" but it was just a waste of 50 minutes.",
                "very well organized, fair exams, manageable workload and definitely designed with non science majors in mind.",
                "Strengths: interesting topics, varied lecturers, accessible content\r\nWeaknesses: lots of content to memorize for the exams and the review sessions aren't particularly helpful, could go more in depth about marginalized community impacts",
                "The main strength is the three instructors, who were incredibly engaging and made me want to come to lecture each week. Discussion sections, which so often feel useless, were both enjoyable and helped me continue to learn. The main weaknesses were the assessments. The three exams were extraordinarily and unnecessarily detail-oriented (like they were missing the forest for the trees): they forced us to memorize and regurgitate the most random details about a specific species or molecule, but never really asked us to analyze or apply the broad ideas or themes we were learning in lecture. The final project also felt like a throwaway, as it had very vague instructions and we received zero feedback about what we were doing (despite having several early deadlines).",
                "Easy and manageable workload, and the experience section was super super fun (definitely recommend!). One thing to be aware about is that the tests are very memorization based, so you either know the answer or you don't.",
                "Organized and several of the topics were very interesting",
                "Strengths: well organized\r\nWeaknesses: exams required lots of memorization about small facts",
                "Strengths: easy to understand the content, clear structure and expectation, engaging lectures.\r\nWeaknesses: sections felt a bit unnecessary sometimes, and some of the lectures went a bit too fast",
                "Strengths include the broad survey of biological concepts accompanied by the section format. No weaknesses.",
                "Good professors, but the material can be a bit dry.",
                "Strengths- great teaching team, lots of tfs, topics are very fascinating \r\nWeaknesses- I wish students received more section feedback so they could know whether they're on the right track or not; although the semester has ended, I still have absolutely no idea what my section participation grade looks like or what I could've done better",
                "Strengths- great topics and lectures. Information was discussed in depth but also so it could be understood well. \r\nWeaknesses- discussion section information was often posted really close to section, so it was difficult to do the work much ahead of time.",
                "This course had great professors as well as interesting content. I liked that there was deep information, but also more of a crash course approach that allowed different topics to be covered in enough depth to be intriguing but not overbearing. A weakness of this course could be the fact that the sections don't really have any bearing on the tests or the lecture in general. It was interesting to deep dive into information and I really appreciated that, however before tests it might have been nice to go over concepts that would be on the exam.",
                "Cool content but a lot of factoids and regurgitative exams. 0 relationship between section and lecture. Exams basically test the most niche and random information tucked away in the corner of lecture slides.",
                "Strength: Emphasis on real-world relevance provides practical insights into addressing contemporary environmental challenges, making the content more engaging.\r\nStrength: Engaging teaching methods, such as case studies, guest lectures, or interactive discussions, contribute to a dynamic learning experience.\r\nStrength: The course provides a global perspective, helping students understand the interconnected nature of ecological systems on a worldwide scale.",
                "Lectures made it easy to understand the concepts, sections were decent",
                "I think the actual content of the course was quite interesting, and I thought the instructors did a good job of connecting biology to issues that apply to general society. However, in terms of the course exams, I do feel like the questions were a bit too niche and that the exams did not cover subjects that we had discussed in greater detail during the lectures. This often made it difficult for me to know what to study, as I wouldn't have a good grasp of what would be on the test, even after the professors said that the questions would be altered to be more general.",
                "I thought this course was as advertised: a fairly interesting not too difficult science credit for non-science majors that you had to put some work into but would not dominate your life. I got what I bargained for, and appreciated it for that.",
                "strength: the material was always interesting \r\nweakness: some lecturers were more engaging than others.",
                "The biggest strength of the course is that it is accessible to people from all majors and backgrounds. Also, given the lower workload, it is much easier to fit it into your schedule and still get a lot out of it. One weakness is perhaps how the exams mainly test memorization of facts, where there isn't much application of the knowledge and skills to new contexts or situations, which would rely more on problem solving and critical thinking skills, rather than brute memorization like the exams do now.",
                "I thought the course was well structured, and the rotation of instructors flowed very well instead of being a jarring transition each time. The information built on itself, and I felt that the extent of information was a nice balance. I had a great experience with my discussion section as we had the chance to interact with science, but I know some friends who felt their mandatory discussion sections were uninteresting and, worse, did not help with exams.",
                "Weakness: The discussion sections are pointless because they arent on the exam or anything. Strength: the lecturers are great",
                "I enjoyed the course thoroughly.",
                "It is good how it is.",
                "Recording lectures would have been very useful for catching up and reviewing material, but overall I really enjoyed the lectures and thought they were pretty engaging. It might've been nice if section had more to do with the content actually covered in lectures and exams, rather than supplementary material.",
                "Exams with more options to show learning. For example, on one exam there was a question on Parkinson's that I didn't know the answer to but I did know parallel answers about Alzheimer's.",
                "I feel as though the section could have been more closely related to lecture",
                "Very good lectures, connected to contemporary issues. Can improve ability to ask questions during lectures.",
                "I enjoyed sections as the semester progressed because they encouraged collaboration and were usually a group activity in relation to the lecture topic of that week. And in that way, I think a strength of this course was my TA. I think this course is weak in many respects. I found it extremely hard to study for the three exams in this course because there was no way to know what would be on them so you were forced to memorize lots of material from lecture and the slides--most of it unnecessarily--just to find the exam asking for the most obscure information from a little corner of one lecture slide. They did offer review sessions for each of the exams but at these sessions, the TAs were just re-reading the lecture slides to us and it was not helpful at all. The third topic on plants was kind of a disaster in that the professor jammed so much information into his 7 lectures and the slides were incredibly unhelpful. This course would benefit from narrower topics and a restructuring of the exams.",
                "If you need an Sc credit as a humanities major, this class is for you. There is a lot of material covered on exams, but the material itself isn't especially complex. Make sure to spend time reviewing for the exams.",
                "The lectures are very interesting and the professors are great. But sometimes it felt like even if you studied for the exams, the questions would be so specific and random that you would still miss a lot of points. The exams didn't really feel like a good reflection of whether you understood the material.",
                "Lecture was disengaging",
                "Strengths: Professor Marlon, Gendron, and Carlson were all amazing and the material was easy to engage with because of them. I enjoyed going to this class everyday because I was always looking forward to learning from them. There were also no forms of heavy workload which I appreciated very much. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: even though we were given learning objectives each lecture, the exams were never as straight forward as we were told they would be. If you really want to get an A on the exams, you have to dedicate more than one week studying for that exam.",
                "This course is very engaging and the professors were obviously very passionate about teaching us about biology. It was very well run and coordinated and I always understood what was expected of me in terms of sections, assignments, and the final presentation. I only wish that the professors reminded us of test dates more in advance and provided us with more practice materials. However, the course was overall very great and had few weaknesses.",
                "I thought everything in this class was fair. The lectures were very engaging and interactive (sometimes students participated in live surveys or experiments), the discussion section was interesting and related to social equity issues that many of us were interested in, and the assessments were also fair.",
                "Weaknesses: The course was split into 3 sections, each taught by 1 professor. Each professor had their own way of teaching meaning you really had to develop a new study method for each section. \r\n\r\nStrengths: The material was interesting and the professors were all very kind.",
                "Strengths: Great content, really great teaching, final project wasn't bad at all, tests were very fair. Weaknesses: Honestly none, its a little easy to not go to lecture and do fine but that's not really a weakness",
                "You learn some interesting science knowledge, but they try to do too much with 3 exams, a final presentation, and then a bunch of activities in section.",
                "Strengths are the lecturers and lectures. Super fun and engaging and perfect length while still being very educational and relevent.\r\nWeaknesses are the TAs and sections, where we didn't do anything very helpful and was just a \"checking the box\" activity.",
                "This class was perfectly taught, perfectly paced. Professor Carlson and Professor Gendron were such amazing and engaging lecturers. It is very clear that they love teaching, and their passion for the subject made me passionate as well. This was a very comprehensive class, and I found every lecture to be applicable and relatable to my humanities and public policy interests. I am incredibly grateful that I took this class with such incredible professors, and I don't see any room for improvement.",
                "The activities in the discussion sections were pretty fun, especially the group activities. The professors' lectures were engaging and interesting. One major weakness is that the midterms rely heavily on memorizing the lecture slides, especially on memorizing specific details, names, and examples. I think the midterms would have been less challenging if they focused more on the larger implications of the information in the lecture slides.",
                "I think the strengths of the class are certainly the entertaining and knowledgable professors who make the information really interesting and gravitating, especially when they can be slightly boring or even dark.  I think the section was also a great application of the concepts we learned, especially with bigger ideas like how to solve issues in the world.  I think some of the weaknesses involve a very broad concept and very specific questions on the tests; some questions were so hyper-specific after learning a ton of information that it felt like a trick.  I also think that sometimes the sections didn't prep for exams as much as they looked to re-emphasize general discussion.",
                "The course sections felt very discombobulated, differing in structure enough to confuse. The exams especially did not feel to reflect teachings of class, instead prone to strict memorization of minutiae."

                "The class itself is not so bad for a non-stem person, but I found that the exams took up so much time to study for and they were pretty hard. Section is easy and chill and the workload is almost nothing.",
                "yes",
                "This course requires a lot of memorization so if that is something you struggle with I would advise students to not take this. Otherwise I found a genuine interest and fascination in many of the topics.",
                "Great class, exams are harder than anticipated",
                "Interesting \"gut\". Not that gutty cuz there's 3 tests and a final...",
                "I would recommend it if you are looking for a science credit; however, the exams require a decent amount of memorization. Also, the slides are mostly just picture-based, so simply reviewing the slides isn't that helpful. You have to take detailed notes.",
                "This course is similar to AP or IB Biology, so if you took one of those, it will be a gut for you. If you haven't taken biology in a while, like me, it might be more difficult to get into the habit of memorizing and regurgitating large amounts of biology for each exam. Particularly if biology isn't super interesting to you. On the other hand, if you're good at taking 50 min exams, attend section every week, and put at least some effort into the final project during reading period, the class is not exceedingly difficult.",
                "definitely recommend especially to fulfill a science requirement",
                "Yes! Great course.",
                "Yes, if you are non-STEM looking for an interesting but relatively unstressful science credit",
                "This course is not a gut, as it actually requires a great deal of memorization and attention to detail for the exams. But as long as you're prepared to do that work, it's actually quite enjoyable - I feel like I learned a lot over the course of the semester (and about things that might be useful or applicable in the future), and the instructors do a great job of making lectures interesting and engaging. If you enjoyed biology in high school, you'll likely find this course to be interesting and not overly difficult, so long as you're willing to put in the work on memorization.",
                "Absolutely!! Easy workload and a great 5th class. The professors are amazing and you actually learn a lot of relevant topics in this class.",
                "Yes, I was very engaged in the course and I felt that the topics directly related to things I was interested in",
                "If need a science class and willing to put in work memorizing for the tests",
                "Yes, for a straightforward science class that is still fun and interesting",
                "Yes; if they were interested in obtaining a survey-level knowledge of introductory biological concepts.",
                "No, if they are looking for a science gut.",
                "Yes! When I added this course onto my schedule, I didn't expect to be engaged with it, and was mostly looking for a science gut. However, I ended up really enjoying the lectures on climate change, which for me was completely unexpected. I'm not much of a science person, so I was not expecting to enjoy this class, but the teaching team really does a great job of making the class accommodating to people of all backgrounds and majors. Please take it!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is not a science/STEM major and is looking for an introduction to the concepts of biology not as much the in depth processes. There is no previous biology knowledge you need for this class, and it was extremely interesting!",
                "I would because I found the amount and topic of the work to be interesting, and I also liked how accessible it was to the average non-stem student. I also think that the lectures were engaging and the sections are fun!",
                "A bit all over the place, but worthwhile for students without a science background. Good footing.",
                "Yes, if the student appreciates an interdisciplinary approach that integrates biology with environmental science and human impacts, this course would provide a well-rounded perspective.",
                "Yes, good science gut, just need to grind for a few hours for the exams and you are good",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student since I feel like it was definitely a more accessible science credit for Humanities students, which was the main reason why I took Bio, the World, and Us.",
                "This course is as advertised and consistent with its reputation among studentsit is fairly interesting, not particularly challenging but does require some effort and studying, and will get you a science credit. I would highly recommend it for that purpose. It was a pleasurable, interesting class that, if you put a reasonable amount of effort into, you will do well in. It is memorization heavy for the exams, so beware if that is not something you are ok with/good at.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, it is a great and engaging science credit",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student, especially those who do not come from a biological science background. There's a lot of practical knowledge to gain, even in understanding the world around us and news headlines we see.",
                "I would recommend the course to another student. I thought the lectures were genuinely fun and interesting without sacrificing any of the educational quality. People may take the course simply to fulfill a science requirement, the course does a good job of managing learning for students who are not in STEM-related majors.",
                "No",
                "I would for a student interested in science but not a science major.",
                "Yes, it is interesting and a great science credit for non-science majors.",
                "It's a very manageable fifth course or science credit!",
                "Yes, pretty good introduction to biology for folks unsure about whether to pursue the major or not. A great course for non-science majors !",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who was a good test taker as so much of one's grade is based on the course's three exams. However, if you don't really know how to study and don't have a strong background in biology (as I found a lot of other students in the class did: ie. they took AP bio) I would definitely not say this is a gut and would urge you to be cautious.",
                "Yes! If you need an Sc credit as a humanities major, this class is for you. There is a lot of material covered on exams, but the material itself isn't especially complex. Make sure to spend time reviewing for the exams.",
                "Yes, if you want a wide survey of biology topics. You learn a lot about the world around you!",
                "No",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is looking for a fairly easy science gut, especially because of the fact that this is a non PSET science course. However, make sure that you dedicate time for studying for the exams as they are not easy. However, this course was definitely my favorite class this semester.",
                "Only take if you need a SC credit",
                "I would recommend this course to any non-STEM student who needs a science credit. The course is interesting and engaging, but not too difficult compared to other science credits I have taken. It's definitely a great opportunity to learn more about biology and connect it to the world around us.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, regardless of what their major is. It is set up in a way for students without a biology background to understand, and students with a biology background to learn the social implications of what they currently study.",
                "Yes, if you have the time to memorize slides. It's a good class for the science requirement, just not the best class if you do not want to memorize.",
                "Yes. It's very easy to get an A and the stuff you learn is very, very applicable to the real world. They talk about scientific breakthroughs that happen recently, not just stuff from the early 2000s and before. Tests are very, very fair and no trick questions. The curve is great. TAs are great. Instructors are fantastic, very passionate about their topics and flow really well in class.",
                "Yes, especially for light-work science credit. However, they didn't return any feedback or grades for the final exam, section participation, and final project. This led to me getting a much lower grade than anticipated despite performing very well on the first two exams. It was blindsiding to get my final grade back, and there was no communication from my TA.",
                "I completely and wholeheartedly believe that everyone should take this class. I loved every lecture and found the professors to be particularly engaging and warm and enthusiastic. This has been my favorite class that I've taken at Yale, even though I admittedly only took it for a science credit. The course is paced very well and I appreciated that the course was so well structured.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in the applications of biological concepts.  I think the class itself is really interesting and the professors are great.",
                "Not really. I wasn't super engaged with large pieces of the course. The discussion section was not related to the content that we were learning in class so I thought that was frustrating",
                "No, sadly the wonder of science was not represented in this class."
