    "This class helped me learn about the history of Russian and it's impact on art. Through the various excursions I gained a deeper respect for the city of St Petersburg and the historical and literary figures that shaped it. I learned about the distinct writing styles of different authors and how they lived.",
    "A solid insight into the transformations in Russian art and literature from Pushkin to present.",
    "broad history and analysis of russian literature starting at pushkin",
    "You learn the basic trends in Russian literature by reading the defining authors starting from Pushkin ending with Pelevin.",
    "Deep insight into Russian literature and cultural history.",
    "A lot of knowledge of russian literature",
    "Survey of trends in Russian literature and history",
    "Furthering my knowledge and understanding of Russian literature.",
    "This course was a great introductory survey of Russian literature and culture. It covered the works of the most influential and famous Russian authors and artist throughout history."

   "comments": [
    "The class allowed for engaging discussion, however the readings were sometimes too long for the time allotted.",
    "In my opinion, too much time is spent trying to analyse the really nonsensical futurist, constructivist, and suprematist literature and art.",
    "seemed to slow down after dostoevsky, but really great readings the entire time",
    "The course was great, but there were too many trips to churches.  Also, many of the museums would have been more interesting with no tour guide.",
    "The course is introductory and does a good job showing how the idea of transformation runs throughout Russian literature. Professor Firtich does a good job running class and guiding you through the works.",
    "Great literature and lectures, though a little slow at points in Russia. Amazing excursions",
    "Great professor, interesting content, not enough time",
    "Too much content.  If I had not read most of the material prior to the course then I would have been unable to complete all the readings.",
    "The selected readings were always very interesting and engaging, as well as the analysis in class afterwards. I would suggest covering the Russian history surrounding these works in class more often, not only to bolster our knowledge of Russian history, but also to give us a bit more context regarding each work."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class for anyone that wants to truly experience the vast and beautiful Russian history. It was a truly life-changing experience.",
    "Firtich is a really fun and interesting professor. The readings are generally pretty interesting, even the background ones, and definitely worth doing. The class is only really good when people have done the readings and are engaged, which definitely suffered once we were in St. Petersburg and people began to fall behind on readings, but overall it was a good course and a really good introduction to Russian literature.",
    "I would! Its an intriguing course.",
    "yeah",
    "Yes,  a great course run by a great professor. Must take if you want to understand Russian lit.",
    "Yes - you really get a good survey of Russian literature and art. The excursions in Russia were amazing!",
    "Yes! Firtich was great",
    "Depends on the student and what they are trying to gain from the experience.",
    "Yes. Summer in Russia was an amazing experience, and it's wonderful to be introduced to Russia's rich culture, not only as a means of appreciating the country itself, but also developing a stronger passion for the language."
