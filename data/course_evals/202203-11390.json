I learned how to realistically analyze the benefits and drawbacks of the technology and what kind of policy would work better.",
                "I have learned about the application of science concepts I have learned about in high school on real world problems, such as energy consumption and carbon print reduction e.t.c. I have also learned how these concepts and technology affect public policy formation.",

                "Very gutty and minimal work for the second half of the semester. First half of the semester has 3 PSETS which are really easy but tedious. Lectures are super boring but the professor is incredibly kind.",
                "Strengths: The professor is very knowledgable on the subjects which are being taught. \r\nWeaknesses: It is a very lecture-style course and is not as interactive or \"seminar-style\" as I would've liked it to be.",
                "I greatly enjoyed the guest lectures, but at times felt as though I could not fully appreciate them because I did not have a thorough enough understanding of the science they were discussing. \r\n\r\nI also felt as though I was not adequately prepared to do the calculations that were required on homework assignments and the midterm. Having no background in physics or calculus, I found some of the math problems to be out of my reach. Working through more examples of the math problems in class would have been helpful.",
                "Strength is the professor; he is a very kind and insightful individual. His passion for physics and teaching is very present. He is willing to answer any of your questions. A weakness is the grading done by the TA; it was unfair, where some points were deducted.",
                "Strength: I love how the course allow us to know from the history to the modern application of many technology that I previously don't know. The professor showed us many real things and took us to small field trips.\r\nWeakness: would be better if there are more discussions session and some technological terms are hard to understand.",
                "The course was very interesting to me and I enjoyed attending lectures and learning these concepts. But, I would say that the course had a lack of resources I could use to prepare for examination. Although I was exposed to a lot of interesting internet articles and publications that were related to the concepts we learned in class, I still couldn't find resources that I could use for exam preparation, such as fully understandable class slides or a text book supplement. Other than that, the course was very interesting and my professor made efforts to keep everyone engaged with the material.",
                "The class gave a good overview of different types of technologies, including their recent histories and basic mechanisms, in a way that was understandable for people with little scientific background (some of the slides do get more technical if you're curious, but you aren't required to know the intricacies). Professor Prober puts a lot of effort to connect the lessons with live demonstrations and guest lectures, and is understanding of students' situations. Notable weaknesses of this class include the lack of natural discussion opportunities despite it being a seminar, and the lack of clarity on what criteria are needed to earn points on some pset questions.",
                "The final presentation was very well designed, however, I don't believe that the midterm exam and pset formats accurately assessed student learning.",
                "The material might be too advanced for non-science majors. The class is structured as a lecture more than a seminar."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students and have already done so! \r\n\r\nThe course teaches students to think about the practical effects of public policy, instead of focusing solely on the moral\/ethical\/social concerns of policy.",
                "I would recommend just for the Professor he will make your experience learning about technologies enjoyable but be aware to put a lot of time into the problem sets.",
                "Yes! Would recommend to non-science major students who want to know more about technology.",
                "I would recommend this course for those who want to gain insight into how technology is developed and functions in society, while maintaining a light workload (especially in the second half of the semester, where lessons are guest lectures with no more psets). The final group project is open and allows you to explore a current technology in more detail. If you are looking for a heavily student-discussion-driven or in-depth class, however, this may not be the best choice.",
                "I would only recommend the course as a light survey of modern technology and a food first-year science credit for non-STEM majors.",
                "No, because the professor was not very engaging and it was designed to be a seminar, but ended up being a lecture.",
                "It depends on the student. If you are interested in renewable energy, history of electricity, sustainable buildings and policies, you will probably find this course interesting."
