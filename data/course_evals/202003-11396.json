                "Strengths: learning how to write essays in various styles, selected readings and films, peer editing\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the class discussions could be a bit dry, and although most of the readings were good, some were not very engaging",
                "The discussions are really interesting! We watched films, read chapters from a self-help book, and read research papers. There are a lot of different genres and mediums explored in this class, and a lot of freedom in terms of the papers as well.",
                "In depth descriptions and discussions of the texts and films we used were definitely a strength. However, a weakness was sometimes the conversation lulled because no one was willing to really expand on their ideas.",
                "The wide variety of materials we read were interesting and helped develop our critical thinking  as writers and readers. Our engagement with multimedia was an enjoyable and helpful supplement. The only think I might add to the syllabus would be a fiction piece.",
                "My professor did this, but I'm not sure if the others did so I'll put this here anyway: when there are deviations from the syllabus schedule, it'd be good to let students know clearly, such as using a Canvas announcement and directly editing the syllabus beforehand.",
                "The strength was definitely the professor. Professor Dwyer structured this class so well given the online circumstances, and I looked forward to it every Monday and Wednesday. He laid out a clear plan for our class, but also kept it fluid and adjusted as necessary, which was very important for such unprecedented times. The content was also very engaging, the mix of readings and genres, as well as the occasional viewing material gave new dimensions to the class and generated some great discussion during our synchronous time. The writing assignments also had a nice variety, challenging my skills and strengthening my abilities as a writer. As far as weaknesses, I think every class is watered down by zoom, but obviously that's something we tried our best to overcome. I also think even more diversity in the readings would be interesting, such as the inclusion of poetry or some other \"creative\" texts that we could discuss.",
                "A strength of this course was the organization! The theme of high school might seem odd, but it was a good way to reflect on the unique effects of the pandemic on life. It also pulled together seemingly disparate themes, but the course always keeps them in conversation with each other. Of course, ZOOM lectures can be tedious by nature. However, Seamus does a good job of guiding thought-provoking discussions!",
                "Very engaging course with great articles.",
                "Strengths: the amount of drafts and extensive feedback for each paper, Seamus made each class enjoyable and was super understanding",

                "I think the only main difference between this course during the COVID-19 pandemic and a normal year is that the class was over Zoom, so there isn't really anything that could've been done about that. We were placed in breakout room sometimes which helped us get to know our classmates during these unusual circumstances.",
                "The online format worked well in this class! I felt engaged throughout the semester. The breakout rooms could be improved, but I've found that generally breakout rooms can be awkward regardless of the class.",

                "I think people were virtually engaged because the format of this course was a seminar, where people can't avoid having their cameras on and participating.",
                "One activity that worked very well was the \"annotate\" feature on ZOOM. That way, we could mark up a document in real-time. I think that breakout rooms were also thoughtfully arranged and always had clear goals.",
                "The professor did a great job with adjusting the course to fit the needs of online schooling.",
                "The seminar format worked pretty well over Zoom, since it was a smaller group of students so discussion happened pretty freely. The workshopping with partners, both synchronous and asynchronous, was very helpful for paper-drafting. For other times, breakout rooms and discussion topics could have a little more structure to them just to facilitate better conversation.",

We all went through high school to get here, and taking a deeper dive into that shared history with such an amazing professor was so enjoyable.",
