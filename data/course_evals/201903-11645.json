    "I improved my written, oral, auditive, and speaking skills in Portuguese. \r\nI learned how to write a research paper in Portuguese.\r\nI learned a lot more about Portuguese drama, cinema, and literature.\r\nThrough the variety of material, I learned about some aspects of the Brazilian culture I was previously unaware of.",
    "I was able to further develop and solidify my Portuguese skills, in speaking, reading, and writing. I also gained a deeper understanding of cultures of countries that speak Portuguese.",
    "Better understanding of lusophone theater and film, the historical context for them, and how to write about them in an academic manner in Portuguese."

    "Strengths: \r\n- small class so easy access to professor and students get to know each other well\r\n- course material very well organized \r\n- a lot of material covered\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- a lot of time spent on plays (theatre) and this was unclear on Yale Course Search\r\n- not enough time dedicated to preparing the final exam (performance)",
    "Strengths include the use of different types literature (short stories, plays, etc.) and videos\/films to understand themes, concepts, and ideas. Class structure facilitates participation from all. Interactive and fun activities.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses include weekly reflections at the end of the week that became monotonous after a while.",
    "The small size of the class and Professor Tordin's amazing teaching really made our discussions flourish and help us gain a better understanding of the material we were analyzing. I think the course's pace was great, but would recommend maybe streamlining a few activities\/worksheets we had to complete and use as a discussion foundation in class, because they often felt more obstructive than conducive to discussion."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student who has a sufficient level of Portuguese to take this course and is interested in Brazilian culture. I wouldn't recommend this course to a native Portuguese speaker as it might be too easy for them.",
    "I would recommend! The class definitely allows for further developing your Portuguese skills and is fun and interactive. The professor is very helpful and understanding.",
    "Highly recommend this class; Professor Tordin is phenomenal, and the pieces we look at were always interesting and engaging."
