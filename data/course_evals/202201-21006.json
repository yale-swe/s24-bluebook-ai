                "First and foremost I gained such valuable experience listening to classmates' work and discussing how music and storytelling works in a ridiculously talented class. This class was truly a caring, honest, and ambitious community of extremely passionate creative people -- something I've rarely experienced in a Yale classroom setting, even a music one -- and so I always wanted to bring my hardest and most genuine work to class, which really pushed me as a composer and also a human navigating a really difficult semester and time. I feel like I know more about what a musical theater song *does* and was pushed to really think on the macro level as Jeanine urged us to hone in on the story, not the plot, in a pithy \"Spielberg pitch\" kind of way. I feel not only more capable of idiomatic and catchy musical writing but I think I really came into my own with lyrics for the first time this semester. Unexpectedly (but very gladly, as a music history nerd), I also learned about so many jumping-off points into the world of uncovering marginalized voices in music theater history such as the history of Black musicals in the US. There's so much more I could say. I'm so grateful for this experience."

                "It's inherently very hard to compose an original song about once a week, let alone in a full covid-era Yale semester. I think Jeanine balanced high expectations with compassion well and urged us to communicate about our limits and capacities, and that definitely eased the stress of maintaining that kind of output during the semester. I think that the 2-hour seminar format is ideal, and would only wish the class was longer so we could delve more deeply into everyone's work, particularly the technical and musical elements (in addition to the story elements, which we focused on)."
