   "comments": [
    "I learned extensively about a part of dance history that I did not know existed until I took this class. Not only did I get to learn about it, but I also got to interact with it by learning choreography, meeting important figures, and seeing a performance.",
    "This class was a wonderful mediation of practice  (through dances that we recreated in class) and theory (the art historical framework furnished by art historians like Carrie Lambert-Beatty, Sally Banes and artists themselves). As a result, through this synthesis, I was truly able to learn experientially and theoretically postmodern dance.",
    "I learned about the history and foundations of postmodern dance, as well as  certain skills and full dances from the practice.",
    "This course allowed me to discover a technical and physical approach to modern dance. It was a privilege to be able to learn, even as an amateur, with Emily Coates.",
    "I have developed a deeper bodily awareness from Emily Coates' \"Post Modern Dance Class.\"  Furthermore, I have received a richer understanding of Post Modern Dance History, an expanded vocabulary (verbal and non-verbal) to engage with this art form, and an indispensable experience of holistic learning and dialogue with brilliant artists.",
    "I learned about the history of modern and postmodern dance, and much more about how to read about dance and analyze it in discussion and writing. It was wonderful to learn the history and theories behind famous names in the field, and to interrogate their methods. \r\n\r\nThe movement exercises we did also expanded how I think about dance and how my body moves. They encouraged me to be more accepting of my body's natural movement, and playful with it.",
    "This class combines history, theory, and practice. It meets once a week, so students are expected to complete serval things outside of class each week: readings surrounding the history of artists and artistic movements; videos of prominent dancers and choreographers; readings about the theory of dance and its intersection with other artistic movements; weekly discussion posts interacting with the material and themes of the week and posing questions for class discussions. In class, students usually spend an hour or more practicing the methodologies of the artists being discussed that week. Then, for the second half of class, we engage in group discussions. \r\nThis class also encouraged students to have agency in their own practices with the assignment of self and group choreography projects."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is strong in that it is very interactive and splits the time between studio learning\/\"lecturing\" well.",
    "While there were tons of readings, they were truly instrumental to understanding postmodern dance beyond \"anyone can do this.\" I also thoroughly enjoyed our trip to New York and seeing Parts of Some Sextets live. We prepared all term to build a sophisticated understanding of postmodern dance, so that culmination was rewarding.",
    "This class did a wonderful job going into the world of postmodern dance, however, as someone who has very little dance and theater expereince, it was quite challenging to jump into the level of discussion on certain topics discussed in the class.",
    "It was amazing to see Parts of Some Sextets by Yvonne Rainer in Brooklyn and even have a conversation with Rainer.  This course was so rich, so special, so rigorous, and stretched preconceived ideas in the most graceful way.  Ultimately, this course was incredible, though it left me with a hunger for more opportunities to dance and move.",
    "This course is strong in that it teaches through multiple methods: reading, discussion, writing, choreographing, and moving. I appreciated that there was relatively equal rigor in all of these areas. I also appreciated that the class was open to both dancers and non-dancers. Having the diversity of perspectives and less preconceived notions about dance was refreshing. The field trip to see Parts of Some Sextets in Brooklyn was also wonderful, as was our guest instructor! There were no weaknesses of the course.",
    "Strengths:\r\nThe course was organized and thorough. It had the breadth of a survey course while still engaging seriously and rigorously with each topic and artist. \r\nIt encouraged students of many academic backgrounds to participate and to bring their unique experiences to the intellectual and practical aspects of the class. This IS NOT a course just for dancers.\r\nAlthough the course focuses on the mid to late 1900s, it does not neglect what is going on in the dance world right now. We attended a field trip and had a guest speaker, making the information super relevant. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSince it meets only once a week, this class can seem easy to overlook. You do not \"need\" to do all of the readings and watchings to be successful, but of course you will learn so much more if you do!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes- it is highly interesting and also accessible to non-dancers",
    "Definitely - this class helped me break out of my comfort zone and helped me develop intellectually and bodily in ways that I didn't expect.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in learning about postmodern dance, or trying a theater studies class.However, it was more challenging than I expected.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is unusual in the hands-on approach to the work and to dance.",
    "Yes.  I would recommend this class to everyone.  Emily Coates is both brilliant and humble.  The atmosphere of the classroom was equally rigorous and hospitable.  This course has been one the highlights of my Yale career thus far.",
    "This course is really great, mostly because Emily Coates is just incredible. She's so knowledgeable and has been directly involved with the work of many of the artists we discussed. The course provides a good overview of the postmodern dance canon, with special emphasis on Yvonne Rainer. The choreographic assignments were really fun and not at all stressful. The reading from week to week could be kind of a lot, especially when there were also long viewings, but was generally interesting (if at times a bit dense). The paper was kind of long, but you can really write about whatever you want so as long as you choose a topic you're interested in it shouldn't be too bad. Overall, a really great class. If you want to learn how to watch and understand and appreciate postmodern dance this is the class for you.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course! Take it to learn about your body, the history of dance from the 1950s onwards, and the endless possibilities of dance as an art form.",
    "Yes! This made me more curious in my day to day life. It also made me consider how we look at art, how art can challenge definitions, and how art of many types intersect with each other and history."
