                "This class is pretty philosophy-heavy, so analyzing that was a skill that this class developed. It also covers a super broad area and time period, so we got to work on making connections across really varied topics. Nana also pushed us to be far more critical readers and class participants.",
                "An introduction to essential texts in African studies ranging from philosophy, sociology, cultural criticism, history, religious studies, and more! The texts we read in this class were phenomenal. Prof. Quarshie did a wonderful job introducing us to some of the leading thinkers in defining and redefining African systems of thought. We look through different case studies and examples to understand the linkages between colonialism, hierarchies of knowledge, and divisions between art and science. From learning about embodied knowledge from Qur'an schools in West Africa to multisensory cultural performance as resistance, Prof. Quarshie is an amazing scholar who I am so lucky to have learned from this semester!\r\n\r\nAlso, the assignments taught me how to write short, succinct papers and define terms using our own words. This was a really unique aspect of this class, and I hope that Prof. Quarshie continues this. I think this class helped me improve as a writer and thinker. I was give really practical and applicable writing advice and guidance. The assignments also pushed me to connect our readings within different units (as well as with other discussions in our class!)",
                "This class helped dramatically improve my ability to think in a balanced way with limited bias in the consideration of difficult topics having to do with severe societal faults or morality. I learned a great deal about the history and complications of epistemology, culture, philosophy, medicine, and science within the African continent and in the Africa diaspora.  My comfortability level and general ability to express myself clearly and effectively through writing also greatly improved through this class.",
                "A lot of African historical contexts",
                "This class debunked my conceptions of what it means to be Western, African, and what the term science really means. It had me look into very firm beliefs I formerly had and see how they held many misconceptions. My writing skills were honed, especially in being able to write concise, logical papers. I also got out of my comfort zone and discussed in seminar very difficult concepts."

                "This class is ambitious and I really appreciate how it pulls in seemingly- disparate readings\/topics under four sections. However, because this class is so broad, sometimes discussions can feel a bit unfocused. I do think the way we moved through readings helped us to develop the skills we'd need to analyze readings that came later in the course. The class also made room for students of all majors and years, which is really rare for an upper-level seminar and brought a lot to discussions!",
                "The strength of the course was definitely the class discussion. It was very thought-provoking to listen to my classmates' opinions and the instructor's interpretations. I would be lost on many of the readings if we didn't discuss them. I was also very appreciative of the length of our papers. They were never too long.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course was the amount of readings. I have only taken a few courses with grad-school-level reading assignments, so I had to really adjust to the amount of readings every week. I started having to cut corners with the readings towards the end of the semester. This is more of a critique of my own learning style and capabilities than a critique of the syllabus, however.",
                "Every student came into this class with different backgrounds and interests. At the beginning of the semester, it was a bit of a rocky ride understanding where our discussions needed to go and what common threads we were drawn to. Because of these difficulties, I appreciated when Nana took a bigger role in facilitating the discussions. I admire that Nana treated us like graduate students and had high expectations for the ways in which we engage with these important works. Unfortunately, with varying levels of engagement and the fact that this was the first class in this field for some students, I struggled with the student-led discussions sometimes. The strengths are definitely in Nana's extensive knowledge of our readings and our authors and the opportunity to reflect on each of our units before moving on to the next one through a short writing assignment. I wish there was an opportunity to connect more with my classmates and understand the expectations of our reading and learning practice. Lastly, I really appreciated the specific feedback he gave us on our writing and how he structured the class.",
                "Strengths: Weekly student-led discussions allowed us to really dive deep into the course materials, Professor Quarshie made himself incredibly available and offered so much help when thinking about a lot of the topics.  He definitely is one of my favorite Professors! \r\nWeakness: I wish we had a bit more time for certain discussions.",
                "This was a truly amazing course. It is hard for me to think about how this course could be improved in an online format. I do think it improved significantly after slight changes made after the class had difficulty discussing the topic.",
                "Nothing",
                "Strengths - great reading, good discussion, very knowledgable professor, good length papers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - could've started with a reading to getting into the terminology and concepts of the class as it was very hard to understand things at first. Too much reading, I felt as if the readings were very interesting but took time to understand. Would have been more productive if I had an in depth knowledge of texts, instead of surface level of very complex texts."

He made sure all the readings were accessible and we had resources available digitally.",

I really enjoyed most of the readings and I think that this class is hard, but worth it, especially if you want to work on thinking outside of the box.",

                "Yes! Be ready to participate, be committed to completing the readings, and take your time while writing. The benefits are worth it. This class will definitely expand the way that you think about the world and equip you with important frameworks to guide other classwork. Prof. Quarshie pushed us to be critical about the statements we make and questions we ask. Through writing and discussion, we were able to wrestle through difficult questions and build a web of resources from other scholars thinking through these same issues.",

While taking \"African Systems of Thought\", I felt my thinking, writing, and method of discussing challenged to a degree that I had never experienced before.  The readings and discussions were always fascinating, challenging, and engaging. Nana is an incredible professor, and he made this class a really wonderful experience.",
