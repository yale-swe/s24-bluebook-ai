                "Strengths: Really thought-provoking readings; by connecting visual art with broader theories (some of which do not even explicitly mention art), you see how art is connected to the human condition very deeply\r\nWeaknesses: Given so much class time was spent discussing the readings, analyzing actual art pieces sometimes felt like an afterthought"
