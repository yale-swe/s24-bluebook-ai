                "Dry and somewhat boring. Tests had a very different feel than the problems solved in class and on homework, so be prepared to feel thrown off on the first exam. Not much support or guidance from the professor, and I felt like I was really on my own for the entirety of the course.",
                "I would say the strength of this course is that for the first two units, it is very organized and there is enough time to tie back all the concepts at the end of each unit (before each midterm exam). For example, integration techniques linked very well with the fundamental theorem of calculus and then sequences and series was a cohesive unit that linked back to integration at the end. I'd say the biggest weakness of this course was the organization of the last unit where areas, volumes, parametric equations and polar coordinates were all shoved together. It felt a bit rushed in the end and not as developed as the other topics. I think this could be improved by cutting some time from the Riemann Sums and adding that to the last unit.",
                "Sometimes it was a bit hard to understand the graduate student teaching the course which was a weakness but I can tell he put in a lot of effort in preparing for teaching the class.",
                "Strengths: Review Sessions\r\nWeaknesses: Organization of the contents",
                "Strengths: organization of material throughout the term, preparation for exams through psets/practice tests, exams reflecting material we had seen but in new contexts (so it tested knowledge and application but not in an unfair way)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course depended entirely on the teacher you had. Before I switched sections, my experience was so bad that I considered dropping the course - I couldn't get questions answered, I had to teach myself material, etc. However, after I switched, my experience was far better. So I would say the primary weakness is the discrepancy in student experiences",
                "I think there was good help but some of the teachers were a little hard to follow at times and it was very fast paced. Also the tests were hard.",
                "I think some of the professors were better at teaching than others and this resulted in different levels of understanding between the classes. I wish we all gained the same quality of teaching."

As a result, I can't see many people who don't have a passion for mathematics or the sciences enjoying it.",
