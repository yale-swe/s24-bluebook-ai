                "One of the biggest strengths was the engaging nature of the films, and the fact that we had to write a discussion post about each film before our 2 hour long seminars each week. Through these discussion posts there was also plenty of content to discuss during class time, so we were never at a loss of topics. Similarly, it also made sure that everyone had already familiarized themselves with all the content beforehand, so bouncing ideas and conclusions with others in the class was very fluid and enriching."
