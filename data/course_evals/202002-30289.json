   "comments": [
    "Prior to taking this class, I didn't possess much knowledge regarding the formal and academic side of the movies. This class helped me refine my ability to put into words what I already saw as aesthetically important or beautiful, and it opened my eyes to a higher level of film-consuming. I also learned a lot about the background of Chinese films which helped me better understand the context of China and its diaspora today.",
    "I was able to gain knowledge in Chinese cinema through the perspectives of many different directors. Was also able to gain skills in scene and film analysis.",
    "I've learnt some scene analysis terms and know how to use different perspectives to see China and Chinese films.",
    "I learned more about Chinese history, culture, and film from taking this course.",
    "Film techniques and Chinese culture\/history that are vital to in-depth analysis of Chinese Cinema.",
    "This course focused on Chinese film in the post-Mao era. While we learned about film formal analysis, we also were exposed to Chinese culture in tackling questions about Chinese-ness and the tremendous changes that were happening in the political, social, and economic arenas during this time. By watching a selection of Chinese films from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the mainland, reading academic literature on these films and the movements they belonged to, and discussing both the films and the texts, we were able to apply the formal analysis skills we learned in class to interpret the messages about political regimes, social issues, displacement, etc. these films conveyed.",
    "A very comfortable knowledge of recent Chinese history.",
    "Basics of film, Chinese history and culture",
    "Broad sense of different movements (geographically and aesthetically) in Chinese cinema. Formal analysis techniques."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The number one strength, for me, was the quality of the lectures and the obvious knowledge of the instructor. She clearly knew her stuff, and I learned a lot when she spoke. \r\n\r\nI would argue, as I seem to do in a lot of my classes, that less student presentations would improve the experience. I would much rather hear from a knowledgeable teacher than my peers.",
    "I thought there could be less focus on Taiwan and Hong Kong cinema and more focus on mainland cinema. Since there are so many important mainland films, I thought we could have spent more time on it.",
    "Strengths: high participation and discussion",
    "Strengths: Professor Wang is very knowledgeable about the films and the greater context surrounding them. The film choices are also very diverse and engaging. The course was very well organised and afforded me lots of flexibility. I also appreciated the structure of the course, I had a general idea of what I needed to do before every class before having to check the module.\r\n\r\nCons: Some of the readings are on the heavier side, and for some student a movie each class might be a bit too often. (This has more to do with the course being scheduled over the summer instead of during a full semester) There's also not too much structured student engagement in this class, both with other students and with the professor. (This also could just be a result of the class being online) Presentations could drag on to take a little too long from time to time.\r\n\r\nI really don't know if I would change anything about the course (maybe other than some of the readings) given the chance. I think this class was constrained by its short duration and having to be virtual, neither of which can really be helped. This would be a great in person full semester course! \r\nOne thing that I also think each session would benefit from would be a break in the middle of class.",
    "Strengths: the class is very organized and the readings and films are fun but intellectual. No prior experience of film and Chinese needed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we always seem to be running out of time (might be due to the intense nature of a 5 week course load for YSS).",
    "The course was structured well and was very engaging. While the online format definitely made it easier to watch the films in our own time, it would have been nice to have in-group viewings where we can discuss our reactions to the films as they occur. I also think there could have been a bit more focus on commercial Chinese films, as the majority of what we watched was less mainstream.",
    "Strength: Great contextualization readings for each section of the course. Class discussions were well handled over Zoom. Professor came in with wonderful insights and additional commentary. She really helped to explain the material!!\r\n\r\nWeakness: Perhaps too broad - any cinema survey class risks generalization and I don't know how to counter that? The presentations did get tiresome sometimes - if we all watched the films and did the readings, we don't need a recap, but I did appreciate discussion questions."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in modern China or film-making more broadly. Additionally, anyone with a passing interest in anything from sociology to literary studies would enjoy this class.",
    "Yes, It's a interesting course.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone even remotely interested in foreign film or more specifically Chinese culture.",
    "YES, it was a really fun course and you learn a lot. The class is really diverse in majors (most students were not Film and Media Studies) and background in Chinese (half of the students does not speak Chinese and it's not a barrier).  I had no prior experience of film analysis, but the class will teach you everything you need. It definitely made me look more in depth every time I watch something on screen whether it's a video sent by a family or TV shows (Xueli emphasizes the importance of not being manipulated by them, and I agree since we are in era where so many things are made to make us think a certain way and it's often misleading).",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in taking a film class and learning about formal analysis. I also would recommend this to anyone who is interested in Chinese history\/politics, or just wants to learn more about Chinese culture.",
    "Absolutely! Wonderful class.",
    "Yes, I would! I honed formal analysis skills. I learnt about new cultures in a respectful way. My aesthetic palette was enhanced!!"
