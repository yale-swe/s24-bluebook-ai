                "I learned a lot about sleep from so many different angles, and really appreciated the interdisciplinary focus of the culture. I felt much more motivated to learn about the science concepts than usual, too, since lectures were accessible and intertwined with lots of real life anecdotes and perspectives from the humanities. I feel like I developed a healthier relationship with sleep because I know that my body really needs it, and I've stopped questioning when I naturally get sleepy and started to embrace it if it falls at appropriate times (mid afternoon! the night!), making me feel more energetic and restored each day. I can even give my friends some science based advice now.",
                "We learned about the inner workings of sleep and the basic science of it, such as the stages of sleep, what happens during these stages, the inner workings of sleep deprivation and its effects, how dreams work, different sleep disorders and their effects, and what you can do to treat sleep disorders.",
                "Sleep is integral to our lives, and we get so little of it at college. This course was very interesting and provided insights into sleep from various different perspectives, including biology, chemistry, art, history, philosophy, psychology, etc.",

It's a LOVELY environment.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- none",

Also, the evaluations were, in my opinion, a little bit ridiculousa lot of information was thrown at us and some of the exam questions felt quite trivial. I would have preferred a closed-note exam that would have required us to deeply understand core course concepts as opposed to a kind of hectic frenzy that the open-note exams introduced.",
                "Strengths: actual gut\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: completely uninteresting, professor is self-obsessed about his amazing course and pioneering sleep research",
                "I think the online exams and creative open ended assignments are major advantage of the course but that the lectures can be improved through better recordings and greater details in the slideshow presentations on canvas.",
                "I think this class was very well organized and taught. Some communication regarding assignments was a bit unclear, but it was always clarified when inquired about.",
                "Enjoyed the final projects and that the papers were allowed to be creative.",
                "Many guest lectures which I enjoyed",
                "The course moves at a good pace and the weekly workload isn't high.",
                "The projects are very fun, the papers give you lots of latitude as long as you connect to course topics, the tests are fair, and the discussion posts are the right level of frequency to just make sure you're engaging with core concepts. I did feel like some themes in the middle of the semester surrounding sleep cycles and sleep need could have been compressed into slightly fewer lectures, maybe to make room for a later lecture on the current cutting edge of sleep science. I will say that the repetition of core themes was really really helpful for remembering them though.",
                "The strengths were that there was flexibility with the projects. To go into deeper detail, you were allowed to do either a scientific or creative paper for the projects. The group project was also very flexible and a highlight of the course. Some of the weaknesses were that sometimes the course content was a bit unorganized, and some of the slides repeated content from other slides. This made studying hard sometimes, because of the repeat content. Also, there were some rules changes for the final project which I didn't appreciate.",
                "very easy to participate in class without going to class; understanding professors and TA's",
                "Easy, but super interesting class. Low workload which was great. Was offered in the late afternoon, which ironically made students sleepy",
                "I do not see any weaknesses--this course is engaging, leaves room for improvement, and allows students to demonstrate their sleep knowledge in personal and varying  ways",
                "The course was well organized. The content was interesting and the professor was great.",
                "Strengths: Assignments are fair and manageable, Professor Kryger is so sweet and knowledgeable\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures can be repetitive sometimes",
                "Strengths: \r\n-lecture is recorded & have in depth presentation slides which makes reviewing for exams easiers\r\n-exams are at home so you feel less stress and pressure which eased my testing anxiety\r\n-there are so many opportunities to get creative through the papers and final project that make learning fun\r\n-discussion prompts allowed me to not just learn the information but reflect on it in my own life\r\n-offered time at the end of each lecture to ask questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- None (it is the best class I have taken at Yale thus far)",
                "Strengths: relevant to college students, engaging, shows importance of sleep but also ways to improve, really enjoyed science lectures\r\nWeaknesses: humanities lectures could use more nuance",
                "This class is interesting and applicable to daily life. It is not too hard to understand for those coming from a limited or no science background. Concepts are reviewed frequently. Papers have an option of submitting a creative paper if you aren't into writing a scientific paper. There are lots of guests instructors which keeps it interesting. There are too many assignments though - 2 papers, a midterm quiz, a final quiz, and a project. The project really feels like busy work because it doesn't enhance your learning at all. The class would be much stronger with less quantity of assignments and better quality of assignments.",
                "Well done, no suggestions.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Kryger - his subject knowledge and care for students (transitioning a small seminar into a large lecture while maintaining connections with students) struck an excellent balance of pedagogy and practice. The course was well designed for student success and to implement the class's content in our own lives through discussion posts, projects, and papers which could be scientific or creative.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I found myself wishing a bit more time was spent on some of the biological concepts (caloric needs relative to sleep) but this was not a large weakness."

The workload was quite heavier than expected, thougha midterm exam, a final exam, two 8-10 page essays, occasional discussion posts, and a final project. If that does not deter you and you have a profound interest in sleep science, then go for it, I guess.",

                "If you're interested in sleep in any capacity, I would recommend this course. I came into this course trying to fix my own poor sleep habits and I think I learned a lot. Even though my sleep isn't perfect I implemented many of the things I learned in this course and have improved a bit. If you are into lecture learning and writing this course is for you. If you are not into the science of sleep at all and don't appreciate writing I wouldn't recommend it.",

                "This class is interesting if you want to learn about sleep and need an easy science credit. The content is not too hard to grasp but there are a lot of assignments that don't really add anything. The professor can sometimes ramble and there is a lot of repetitive content.",
                "Yes for an easier science class (though you still have to make sure to review the material for the exams and put some effort into the writing assignments). Prof Kryger's also a great presence. And everything we learned about sleep was interesting and so applicable to our lives because we all sleep. So it was cool to think about the sleep science going on in our bodies.",
