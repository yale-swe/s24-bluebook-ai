                "I learned a lot about old Spanish literature, ranging from poetry to philosophy to plays. We had very engaging discussions about the social, political, and cultural contexts of these pieces and their meaning overall.",
                "My Spanish comprehension level is so much greater than it was at the beginning of the semester. I was honestly worried that I would struggle to keep up with the course because it has been a few years since I took Spanish, but the progression of the course was such that I had room to grow and improve. By the end of the semester, I felt infinitely more confident in my speaking and reading skills.",
                "Reading\/writing about\/discussing literature in Spanish, understanding medieval Spanish, interpreting text and analyzing themes.",
                "This course taught me to look at literature through a thoroughly observant and critical lens, such that I could examine and understand the social, political, and religious contexts that shaped each work. I learned not only about several seminal works in early Spain but also the history that accompanied those works, and the prevailing values of the times in which the works were completed.",
                "Great foundation in classic Spanish literature",
                "Spanish medieval literature (how to read it in its original language, most important works, etc); how to write in-class and take-home literature papers in Spanish",
                "I learned about a whole literary canon from a time period \/ region I had never studied before. Prof. Velasco does an amazing job of contextualizing all of the works that we read with important historical, geographic, and cultural background information. He also led phenomenal discussions that allowed us as a class to extract important themes from the texts.",
                "I learned how to read medieval Spanish and improved my conversational Spanish. I learned the basis of the Spanish canon and about relationships of race, class, gender within it. The course dealt with universal law and rights too. It was so fun.",
                "Reading medieval Spanish literature, historical knowledge of Spain during the Golden Age and the seventeenth century, contributing to and following a discussion on said literature and history.",
                "You learn so much overall. Not only about the specific works and authors, but also about the history of the time.",
                "I developed my Spanish reading comprehension, discussion, and analysis skills. In general, I got more comfortable with speaking in Spanish throughout the semester.",
                "Perspectives in Spanish literature throughout the years",
                "Reading comprehension for complex Spanish texts; ability to better interpret complex Spanish poetry; written communication skills.",

            "comments": [
                "Professor Velasco was definitely a strength of this course. He was dynamic and engaging, and he made everyone in the class feel truly welcome. I also really appreciated how he shaped the curriculum to include not only literary \"canon\" works like Don Quijote, but also a wide array of works by female and minority authors. The only weakness of the class was that occasionally the readings could be a bit long.",
                "I loved how Professor Velasco engaged the class through a wide variety of mediums. Not only did we read Spanish texts, but we also listened to music, acted out plays, and interpreted art. I also think a strength was the class rapport. I felt very comfortable in this environment, which enabled me to participate more openly. One weakness is that we did not really receive grades throughout the semester, so I never really got a sense or benchmark for how I was doing in the class.",
                "Strengths: Amazingly passionate and fun professor, reasonable workload and accessible for people of many skill levels in Spanish, good syllabus, very chill class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I felt like reading one text for each lecture didnt give us time to fully explore each work and forced us to gloss over some of the longer novels.",
                "The class had three main strengths: firstly, the professor and the TA (Professor Velasco and Yelsy) made the class extremely engaging by opening the floor for interesting discussions and facilitating an environment in which everyone was able to contribute their opinion. Secondly, the class covered a wide range of fascinating works, and students had the opportunity to delve deeper in any of the works of their choosing, as neither the essays nor the final had an extremely rigid structure that limited us our exploration of the literature to specific works. Lastly, the class made an incredible use of the Beinecke's resources and allowed us to examine (in person!) several ancient manuscripts and rare books. It was an incredible experience. \r\nThe one area for improvement is the amount of time spent on each work of literature. Understandably, covering one work per class period allows us to explore a much wider breadth of literature. However, the depth at which we can discuss literature is sacrificed when we can only spend seventy five minutes on it. It's also difficult for students to read and fully comprehend two hundred pages of literature and pick out what might be important for a single lecture period. It might be easier if, instead, the professor narrowed the selection of literature a little bit to allow for more discussion, or he chose slightly shorter works so that students can read each work in-depth and then have a rich discussion about it in class.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Velasco is really empathetic towards students and a phenomenal (and hilarious) lecturer. His knowledge about medieval literature -- not to mention his linguistic abilities -- is astounding!\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of the readings are in old Spanish, which I don't think helped improve my overall level of Spanish",
                "Strengths: Professor Velasco is definitely the biggest strength of the course: he's amazing! Very engaging, funny, and knowledgeable -- makes class so fun. I also loved the Beinecke sessions: it was so cool to be able to see the works of literature!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: My main difficulty with the course was the large size. ~40 people in a lecture hall trying to have a small-seminar discussion just doesn't work as well -- although Professor Velasco and Yelsy were amazing and made it a good experience even so. It's a little intimidating, especially in a foreign language, and impedes active and equal participation. I would have preferred the course as a capped seminar (or at least a lecture with official sections). I think the readings could be adjusted -- some are very long and not as engaging as others. Finally, I would have preferred more structured assignments (the in-class essays felt vague), and more detailed feedback afterward to know what to improve. I wish my Spanish would have improved a little more, and I think more feedback (and a smaller course size) could help with that.",
                "There are so many strengths to this course, the most important of them being Prof. Velasco himself. He sits among just a few other professors I've had at Yale who are as genuinely enthusiastic about the material he teaches, and that enthusiasm is truly contagious in the classroom. He's funny, kind, and supportive, and he made this class so exciting. I think a potential weakness of the course is that we only get to spend one class session on one work, so there isn't much time to go into depth with any of the works, but at the same time the breadth of the course allows us to survey a wide range of texts. One thing that may have been helpful is for Prof. Velasco to provide some of the historical context before we read the works, because I often found myself somewhat confused by the readings, and they often had to be clarified in class. Also, some of the readings felt slightly too long to finish in one homework's worth of work, but the overall workload in terms of other assignments was incredibly manageable (I loved that we had no exams!)",
                "Professor Velasco would rush into class and play a few minutes of medieval Spanish music (great stuff), humming or dancing along, and began lecturing over the music. It was magical. The readings were okay, though sort of incomprehensible, but as soon as the Professor started reading or explaining them they made perfect sense. The assignments were super reasonable and fun to do, and office hours were helpful. The classroom environment was funny and Professor Velasco is brilliant  knows every language, is passionate and comedic  Yelsy is also wonderful.\r\n\r\nThis class has no weaknesses.",
                "I think if the class facilitated discussion in various ways, rather than just the large seminar-style, then there might be more involvement with texts that were harder to read. However, I really enjoyed the parts of the class where Professor Velasco lectured because the context and explanation of the readings that we did was really interesting and made me want to be more engaged with the material.",
                "I thought the readings were all unique but also connected. This kept the discussions interesting, while the overarching themes made the course enriching.",
                "I feel like the course was tailored to those that were fluent in Spanish, including native speakers, rather than additionally providing opportunities for students that were still learning Spanish to have as engaging of a time in the class. It would be useful to have more resources available to speakers that are still developing their Spanish-speaking skills to better understand the topics being discussed in class.",
                "The material\/literature of this course is super interesting and is taken from a good variety of authors. The format of discussion, although intimidating at first, became welcoming and great for developing ideas and better understanding the works. Also, the formatting of the assessments is nice and not stressful.",
                "Strengths: Consistency; each class was a discussion on the assigned reading. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no grade evaluations\/assessments all semester. You have no idea how you are performing. Although there are assigned readings, there is no tangible lesson you are learning.",
                "The professor is amazing!!! The readings start off as long, but get significantly more manageable as the semester progresses. The course is also geared towards improving everyones individual skills, as most people are at very different levels of Spanish when they come in, and does a great job of supporting students of all levels.",
                "The strength: Professor Velasco! He really cared about each students perspective and wanted us to appreciate (not just understand) the texts. One weakness came in the length of the readings, as it could be disheartening to feel overwhelmed before you begin. Most of the texts were really informative and interesting, but I think the class could have benefited from either reading less content more closely or spending more time on each text."

                "Yes! Its a great class even if you arent a literature person. Jesus is amazing! If youre only goal is fulfill L5, still take the class. You get out what you put in, but its really not stressful and lectures were really interesting and taught a lot about the history of the Iberian Peninsula, literature, music, and life.",

                "Absolutely. This class was magical. The work was easy, the thinking that went into class participation and our brief essays was fun, and class was a delight. Spanish literature is also...shockingly...really good.",
                "Yes, I think this course definitely challenged me in my ability to read a text in Spanish. I improved as a student because of it. Further, I think the way that Professor Velasco presented the information made it really engaging where it might have otherwise been dull.",
                "Definitely! Super engaging.",
                "I would recommend the course to people who feel fluent in reading, writing, understanding, and speaking Spanish. It seemed like most fluent speakers had an entertaining time in the class and enjoyed learning about the topics that we covered in class.\r\n\r\nFor non-fluent speakers, I would suggest considering, during add\/drop period, whether you can keep up with the workload in the class. Reading large texts while having to frequently translate words or think about grammar can cause a deceptively large workload. As a non-fluent speaker, I felt left behind often during the class discussions.\r\n\r\nIf learning to read Spanish is your passion, the class is very useful in developing that skill.",
                "Yes! The class consists of mainly discussions and moments of lecture\/speeches from the professor, which are easy to participate in. I think the format of the class makes it engaging and interesting.",
                "If you are truly interested in Spanish literature, yes I would recommend taking this class. Classic and staple works of Spanish literature are introduced and thoroughly discussed.  If you are solely trying to fulfill a language credit, then no. There is a high workloadin terms of readingsand the readings can be very complex.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! Professor Velasco is an amazing professor and makes each day in class incredibly engaging and fun to be in. In addition, youll learn about a wide range of Spanish literary works, some of which are extremely famous and essential to know as a Spanish speaker, but others that are less known yet equally engaging and important.",
                "Yes! Professor Velasco is amazing and is committed to keeping the class engaged."
