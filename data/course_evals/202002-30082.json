   "comments": [
    "Deeper understanding of the Middle East",
    "I learned about the History of the Middle East from about 1800 to almost the present day.  We learned about the Ottoman Empire, Qajar Iran, and the successive mandate states to those regimes.  I developed insight into how the Middle East's history has influenced its trajectory.",
    "I learned the history of the modern Middle East, from 1800 to the most recent issues.",
    "I got an incredible understanding of the Middle East starting in the mid 1800s to today. I learned how to read primary sources and search for biases and write an solid historical paper.",
    "This course enabled me to understand the modern historical trajectory of the entire Middle East Region. We discussed the themes of colonialism, nationalism, and state formation at length, analyzing how these forces have shaped the development of geopolitics in the region today. As a result of this course, I am also now able to evaluate claims made about the nature of Middle Eastern politics and culture today.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of the late Ottoman Empire, and how that impacted the current layout of the Middle East. We also delved into the history of imperialism and nationalism in the region, and how these two forces worked together to form states.",
    "By taking this course I got a good general understanding of Middle Eastern History from around 1800 up to the present. Special emphasis was put on the Tanzimat reforms, the various debt administration, the colonial encounter, concessions to European powers, anti-Imperialist movements, Kemalism, Constitutionalism and the role of Islam.",
    "I had never taken a history class at Yale.  It gave me the skills and confidence to take another one!",
    "I learned about the nuances intrinsic to Middle Eastern history and how those nuances manifest in the Middle East that we see today.",
    "I learned the history of the modern Middle East.",
    "I got a compact but thorough summary of the key events that lead to the shaping of the modern Middle East from about 1800 to the present day. I also had the opportunity to practice my writing through the two papers, and learnt about the form of writing history articles. The class also gave us the opportunity to discuss some myths\/popular notions that media and popular opinion have created surrounding the Middle East, Arab peoples, Islam, etc.",
    "I learned so much new information while taking this course! In high school, our history curriculum provided me with minimal knowledge about the Middle East. When we did discuss the Middle East, it was almost exclusively in the context and from the perspective of American or European history. I certainly do not remember reading or analyzing primary sources created by citizens of Middle Eastern states. The Making of the Modern Middle East has dramatically changed these unfortunate shortcomings in my education. From the first week of class, I could already detect this shift as we read a primary source detailing an Egyptians anger over Frances invasion of his homeland. During lecture, in our textbook readings, and, most importantly, in our assigned primary source readings, the perspectives of Middle Easterners were always put in the spotlight. One of the most important lessons I learned from this course is to always question who is writing the material I am being taught; more often than not, imperialists and colonizers are the authors, and they rarely paint the people they subjugate in a positive light.",
    "I learned about overall history of the Middle East and North African region from the Ottoman Empire until recent events of the Arab Spring.",
    "I learned so much from Professor Kynn about the Middle East. I now have a broad understanding of Middle Eastern history from the later part of the rule of the Ottoman Empire to the modern day Middle East. The course allowed me to better understand how different regions of the middle east interact and how these different relations form the modern landscape of the Middle East. I also had a lot of skill development in historical writing and the analyzation of primary source documents, specifically how primary sources fit into\/form the greater historical picture we're looking at.",
    "I learned about the construction of the modern Middle East and the ways in which different overarching themes affected it.",
    "Knowledge of the history of the Modern Middle East",
    "A solid understanding of the Middle East starting with the beginning of the Ottoman Empire and culminating in modern times.",
    "I learned a lot about the foundations of the Modern Middle East and how different historical patterns have manifested themselves in the region. I also developed my writing and historical analysis skills.",
    "I gained a considerable amount of knowledge on the Middle East and about 18th and 19th century Europe, which I had been ignorant about prior to taking this course. This course also enhanced my critical thinking and taught me how to look at primary sources carefully.",
    "This course was an excellent crash course in the history  and resulting politics of the Middle East since the early 19th century. I didn't have much experience in the subject  beforehand, but I found the course really enjoyable and helpful toward understanding the emergence of major political movements in the Middle East and how it relates to the rest of the world.",
    "I gained a great background in the history of the Middle East and learned about many events that have led to what is seen in the region today.",
    "This course provided me with knowledge and insight on the history of the Middle East from the 19th century onward with right level of nuance in terms of historicism. The course also allowed me to further develop the skill of primary source analysis through various mediums.",
    "We learned about the Middle East and North Africa from 1798 to 1970.",
    "A holistic history and context of the making of the modern middle east. We learned about how the Middle East came to be how it is today starting from the early Ottoman Empire, Qajar Iran, and Egypt, and tracking their development into the various Arab states of the contemporary era. We learned about the influences of European imperialism and how the backdrop of Islam influenced and more often served as justification of political development in the Ottoman Empire and continued throughout this time period.",
    "I developed more critical thinking skills when thinking about history and the effects of European Colonialism on the Middle East's development that can still be seen today. I've learned to use history to give context to current issues in the Middle East and learn more about a nation's history, which will help me in my dream career of working as a diplomat in the Middle East.",
    "Debating and refuting common historical misconceptions and inaccuracies, applying events to broader trends and themes in history, investigating how past events create current social, cultural, and political circumstances, formulating historical theses and writing essays explaining them.",
    "I learned about the formation of the modern nation states system in the post Ottoman era and how specifics of the Ottoman period, in addition to imperial forces, heavily shaped the Middle Eastern region to this day.",
    "Knowledge of the history of the modern Middle East, focusing mainly on Turkey, Egypt, and the Arabian Peninsula from 1800 to today."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was exceptionally well taught, the professor did an amazing job, especially over video, of getting students to engage and interact with the material. You could tell his depth of knowledge and interest in the material during lectures. The only thing that could be improved was that every single day about 10 minutes was spent discussing the timetable for the day, which was identical each day, and this caused us to run over time about the same amount of time each day.",
    "It was well balanced. I liked that there were no recorded lectures and the readings were great. And the setup of the class was very straight forward",
    "The strengths of the course were that it quite thoroughly covered the material that it claimed it would, and had a plethora of relevant readings.  The only weakness of the course that I can think of was that only some readings would be mentioned in discussion, disincentivizing reading the reading of them because at some point they felt unnecessary.",
    "I think the course is great and the instructor design its structure well. The only pity is that it is too much for a summer session. I believe if it is taught during school year, it would be better.",
    "I would say the only weakness was that classes usually went over time, but this wasn't really a huge problem because I was engaged in the information so I didn't notice. The course overall was great and the information was detailed enough to get the full story of the time period, but not too focused to the point you get bogged down in detail.",
    "One of the strengths of this course was its frequent use of media. Throughout the course, the professor used photographs, newsreels, and primary sources to illustrate the concepts we were learning in class, which turned out to be very engaging. He also provided summaries of the course material at the beginning and end of the lectures, which I thought was helpful and useful. There were few weaknesses.",
    "The format of the course was easy to follow and straightforward. All the materials were easy to access on Canvas, as were all the readings. I really liked how were had to submit essay outlines, and received feedback. It really helped me with my writing (not only with this course, but with others as well). I did think sometimes there were too many assignments due at once (essay outline, timeline assignment, missionary archives reading response), but that is probably a result of the short duration of Summer Session.",
    "The Zoom sessions were amazing and very engaging! Moreover, the readings gave a great supplementary understanding of the events discussed during lectures. The discussion sections were also very insightful. I honestly think that there is not much room for improvement given how interesting and engaging this course was! Just concerning the summer session format, writing the final essay felt very rushed, so maybe planning in a little bit more time for that\/having to submit the essay draft earlier would be helpful.",
    "There was a lot of reading and I think that it was difficult to finish all of it.  It would be great if the reading workload was something more manageable.  I think the lectures were great!",
    "Strengths: really well taught, professor and TA team are obviously very knowledgeable and make the material engaging. Their support for their students was prompt and thorough.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: just personal preference but I wish the lecture material topic was presented first and the readings for that topic assigned after the lecture. I would prefer to have a big picture summary and then get into the reading than the other way around, but I understand there are drawbacks to that system as well.",
    "Tyler Kynn was a very good lecturer. The history of the Middle East is relevant and interesting and he made it very accessible to someone with no knowledge of it (and scant experience with history courses at all), like me.",
    "This was an excellent course. Other courses at Yale should be modeled after this. It was intensive, and certainly one of the more intense humanities courses I have had at Yale, but it was very well constructed and always engaging. This has to have been one of the only courses in my 3.5 years at Yale where I have actually paid attention to every minute of the 2hr lectures. \r\n\r\nI came into the course wondering if there might be some bias in how the politically charged events discussed would be presented, given the fact that our professors are American (to my knowledge) and that we are studying at an American university. But I was satisfied by the end of the course that information had been presented to us curated and taught in an objective and well-rounded manner.",
    "Strengths: I really enjoyed the variety of primary sources we were assigned to read in this course. My TA (Camille Cole) was also fantastic! She gave great feedback on essays and lead discussion sections very effectively. Another major strength of this class is that it challenges the label of the aggressor too often placed on Middle Eastern countries by the United States\/Europe. I also enjoyed that Prof. Kynn made lectures more interactive through the use of Zoom polls. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I cannot think of many weaknesses. Although I realize that this course is very constrained by the 5-week time limitation, I feel that it would have been beneficial to spend more time on the damage that the US has caused in the Middle East in more recent history.",
    "I think this courses biggest weakness is that it moves very fast through history and some topics aren't covered as deeply as one might like. However, this isn't necessarily a drawback since the description of the course was that this would be a survey course about the history of the Middle East that leads to what it looks like today. I don't see any way Professor Kynn could improve this type of class.",
    "I found the diversity of activities in the course very engaging. The workload for the summer was apt. If anything we could maybe break up the course more so it is not in three hours chunks which can be hard to sit all the way through.",
    "It does a good job of covering an array of topics in a short period of time, and it managed to be engaging and interactive even though it was conducted online.",
    "Very little weaknesses, but the course was very well-organized and the subject matter was very interesting. Guidelines for the papers allowed us to explore our interests while still staying ingrained in the subject matter.",
    "The only weakness of this course was that it was compressed into a month, however I feel that the workload was still manageable.",
    "This course excellently used the features of both Zoom and Canvas, and I felt like the topics were very well organized. The instructor and TFs were genuinely interested in engaging us, even though class started at 9am! I felt like the only notable weakness was the changing due days of the week and times for assignments.",
    "Strengths: TFs--at least mine.  Camille Cole was excellent in helping both with understanding material and also organizing thoughts on papers and assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures often felt rushed and sometimes a little disorganized.",
    "This has been the strongest online class that I have taken online so far. Professor Kynn and the TF's designed a class that was incredibly engaging, and you could tell how much time and effort they put into making it so. The organization of the class was very straightforward, as were the assignments and deadlines. The expectations of the class were clearly presented. I very much enjoyed the incorporation of different types of media into the class, such as photographs, recorded speeches, newsreels, and advertisements. A highlight of the class was the role-playing game in which the members of the discussion section discussed the topics of the class from the points of view of different Ottoman leaders. All-around, this was a highly engaging and well- taught class.",
    "Strengths: covers a lot of content with a surprisingly high amount of detail, helps understand the bigger picture and rich history\/context of today's standings\r\nWeaknesses: it was a summer class, so it was too short :(",
    "Strengths: handled Zoom very well, interesting material, well organized discussion section, freedom in paper topics, 10 minute breaks\r\nWeaknesses: material not presented in the most engaging way",
    "Strengths: This course was an astounding step up from the online classes Yale had to construct during the 2020 spring semester. The variety of different methods of engaging students really added to the class; the course involved roleplay of different historical figures, incorporation of primary sources, high-level historical discussions between students and TFs, and efficient assignments like essays and timelines. Choosing to do midterm and final essays instead of online tests was a very good call for this course, as it avoided any issues of cheating or inequity and added another level of learning (ie historical writing) to the class. But the biggest strength of this course was the faculty. The professor and every one of the TFs (and I can honestly say every one of them) were incredibly knowledgeable about Middle Eastern history, quite engaging and passionate about the class' topics, and continuously diligent and accessible to students during and outside of lectures. It was also awesome that each instructor had a specific, unique area of expertise (be it region or time period), so that when students asked tough questions about a highly specific subject, it could be quickly relayed to the correspondingly knowledgeable TF\/professor. I kid you not, I believe that every single time (and there were many times) except once, even the most obscure specific question was quickly and completely answered.\r\nWeaknesses: Being online BUT this course was so, so, so much better than the online regular-term Yale classes I had taken the preceding spring. It was far more polished and well-planned and engaging. Another weakness was just how short the session was.\r\nImproved: I think the short breaks may have been a little too long and could've been shortened, although perhaps it's easy to say that now that we're not doing hours-long sessions. Also I suppose it's a bit much to ask instructors to keep talking and teaching without much break for over three hours... I was greedy for more of the course!",
    "The course was amazing. Very well organized and very interesting readings and lectures. However, it's a lot of reading so I am glad I took it as a summer course. The reading definitely reinforced the lecture and I likely would not have bothered to do the reading atop 4 or 5 other classes. The discussion section activities were actually very helpful- some of the only useful discussion sections i've ever been in!",
    "The teaching was very good; I appreciated the small discussion sections.",
    "My only wish is that the class could have lasted longer and Yale Summer Session courses did not have to be crammed into five weeks. Taking this class was such an amazing experience: the choice and length of readings was perfect, and we had just the right mix of class-related activities outside of lecture and discussion."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, especially if they want to understand the Middle East better",
    "I would recommend this course to another student that wants a strong background on the Middle East and Middle Eastern politics and regimes.",
    "I would recommend this course as the course did change some of my stereotypes of the Middle East states. The history of the Middle East helped me understand the shaping of the modern states there. Generally speaking, the course is really interesting.",
    "Yes! This is a great introduction into the history of the Middle East. You find yourself learning so much just from listening to the lectures, let alone doing the readings. It is well paced and you always have some work todo to further your understanding, but it is very manageable.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who desires a deeper understanding of the Middle East, its geopolitics, culture, its struggles with colonial imperialism, and its bouts with political instability. This course is a wonderful primer for those who may have never had any background in this area of study.",
    "Yes! I know many people who are interested in the Modern Middle East, and how it came to be where it is. This course is an interesting deep dive into the history of the region.",
    "Yes, if you are looking for an introductory course to give you a general understanding of the historic developments that have shaped the Middle East from 1800 up to the present, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Yes I would.  It gave me a lot of insight about the Middle East that was very valuable to understanding today's events.",
    "I would! It's a stellar intro history course that makes history actually interesting.",
    "Yes. This is a great course for anyone who wants to understand the background behind current day issues in the Middle East.",
    "Absolutely. If the Middle East, or current affairs of the world in general, are something you are interested in, you would probably really enjoy this. I also think the contents of the course were very illuminating when it comes to the role of imperial powers in the world today, the effects and after-effects of the World Wars and the Cold War, and the general myths that people have regarding Arabs, Muslims and the Middle East. Thus, I would recommend this course even to people who don't think they are actively interested in the titular subject matter.",
    "Yes!! I definitely would recommend this course. I think that since most high school curricula and the popular media that westerners consume too often portray Middle Easterners as the villains in world history, courses like The Making of the Modern Middle East should be required classes in college. By taking this course, you finally learn history from a Middle Eastern perspective rather than through an imperialistic narrative. And, of course, the Middle East is very relevant in current global affairs, so its essential to have an understanding of the events that have caused Middle Eastern countries to evolve into their current forms.",
    "Yes, the professor is really good and the course provides an interesting survey.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It was a good lecture which provides a basic, intro level understanding of the history of the Middle East. Came into the class with literally 0 knowledge about the region and left it feeling definitely much more informed about the issues and complexities of the Middle East. Pretty easy and manageable workload too which was nice, especially for a summer class. Also, Professor Kynn was an awesome prof and made the lectures and discussion section super engaging! Him and all of the TAs were super knowledgeable and wanted to make sure that all students were enjoying the class and learning a lot. You could definitely tell how much work and thought they put into the class - would definitely recommend taking the class!",
    "YES!!! This course is crucial in fully grasping an solid understanding of the Middle East and why it is the way it is today. Coming into the course I had a very vague understanding of the region, but afterward I knew how the string of events from the past each led to the modern Middle East. The course will open you up to the many complexities of the region and how much influence on global politics it truly has. If you're not a history major looking for a great humanities course, a beginner in the history major, or just someone that's curious, I highly recommend this course. It is fascinating, structured in a very clear way, and flexible in allowing you to dive in on the things you found most interesting for major assignments.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone looking to develop a very strong foundational sense for the middle eastern history. It is more broad than deep so maybe think over it if you are already very familiar with the regions history.",
    "If you are interested in Middle Eastern history, Yes.",
    "Absolutely, a fantastic, in-depth introduction to the Middle East.",
    "Yes! Both my professor and my TA did a great job covering the course material and facilitating interesting discussions regarding Middle Eastern history.",
    "Yes, the insights you gain from this course, not only from the professor and TAs but also from your peers, are incredible.",
    "I would, for sure. I thought it was a great opportunity to learn about part of the world I don't generally study, and offered a lot of insight into the present moment regarding American influence and interests in the Middle East.",
    "Yes, definitely.  I think this course is very important for anyone to take given that its subject material helps explain the sources of conflict and unrest in the Middle East today.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I feel that it was organized very well especially for an online course and was very engaging and rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. While I initially thought that a three-hour class would be difficult to sit through, Professor Kynn proved me wrong. I was excited to participate in lecture and section every day, as I knew they would always be engaging and interesting. Professor Kynn and the TF's were always very clear about the expectations of every assignment, and feedback was thorough and helpful. This was definitely one of the most organized history lectures I've taken at Yale.",
    "100% regardless of your major. You simply can't escape hearing about news coming out of the Middle East (and I expect that won't change anytime soon). This course equips you with the foundational knowledge to not only understand what is going on in the Middle East but also engage in discussions about it. You learn a lot about the region's history and relevant context. Most importantly, you learn about this history from the perspective of the region, rather than from a Western\/outsider's point of view. This was crucial in understanding many of the themes, such as constitutionalism, religion, and Western imperialism that you can't otherwise get a clear perspective of. 10\/10 class.",
    "YES definitely!! Given the pandemic, I was looking for an interesting class that was minimal work, and this class fit perfectly! Weekly quizzes, a 5-7 page midterm, and a 8-10 page final. The readings weren't too long and pretty engaging, and we always read and talked about primary sources so it was super interesting! Although the professor did not have the most engaging lecturing style, I really enjoyed the material and my discussion section.",
    "Yes, assuming the same set of instructors. The curriculum is great and highly relevant, but so much of what made the class really outstanding to me was the way Professor Kynn and the TFs brought the curriculum to life, engaged students, and kept up the flow of the course. I really looked forward to each class lecture and discussion, and I had fun.",
    "Yes!!! Amazing and nuanced foundation of the modern Middle East. Seriously. Superb reading pics and a very engaging and understanding professor.",
    "Yes; it's a great introduction the history of the Middle East.",
    "Definitely. I guess the subject area interested me to begin with, which facilitated my learning and made me love each module of the class. I think that if someone is not as interested in the topic as I was this class could still be a perfect introduction. If a student is even remotely interested in studying the Middle East, imperialism or nationalism, I would recommend this class."
