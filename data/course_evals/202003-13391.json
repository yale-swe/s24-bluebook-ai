                "This course offers an interesting selection of readings related to cities. Ranging from: how to run a city, social capital theory, local politics, and how to engage those within a community. I learned much more about politics on a smaller (local level). In addition, Professor DeStefano has much knowledge on New Haven-specific politics and it was fascinating to learn more about the city where Yale resides.",
                "In this class we learned about various aspects of a city and the importance of city politics in creating lasting change in communities. We engaged with the history of urbanism as well as contemporary topics revolving police brutality, housing segregation and reparations, immigration, and income inequality, especially looking at New Haven and discussing how these issues are relevant on a city level.",
                "Getting the opportunity to interview professionals from the city for the group project was very rewarding. It was really nice to hear their real-world encounters with the issues we discussed in class and to have the chance to ask them anything we wanted. We were also able to learn a lot about the history of New Haven from a former mayor, which was very valuable and provide a unique perspective.",
                "I learned a lot about urban development and what it means for those affected. I also learned a lot about New Haven including a lot of what happening today.",
                "I enjoyed this course because it offers an inside-look into how politics actually operates. A lot of poli sci classes often focus a lot on theory, but this class strikes a good balance between theory and application. A lot of the readings go into political theory and how they apply to real-life situations.",
                "I learned about how grassroots organizing and local politics come together to create change. I learned about how city planning and geography affect the development of politics in various areas such as health care access, immigration, and policing. All of this was learned in the context of New Haven, so I also ended up learning a lot about New Haven that I wish I had learned much earlier.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of New Haven and how it has operated in the past and the present. We also learned about issues such as urban development and other factors affecting cities. The class was split up into four main categories for group assignments (housing segregation, policing, immigration, income inequality) in which we essentially did crash course classes on how these issues affected New Haven."

            "comments": [
                "One of the main strengths of the class was Professor DeStefano's organization of the syllabus anchored around the core assertion of cities as places for social change and requiring social cohesion and legitimacy of institutions. I think the improvements in this class could come from a few updates to the readings, especially to include more authors writing in critical race theory and womxn leaders of the black radical tradition.",
                "It didn't always feel like everyone did the readings, so oftentimes DeStefano did most of the talking. This was not necessarily a bad thing because he has lots of valuable insight and brings up important topics\/questions. It just would've been nice to have a more substantive discussion that didn't just include a few of the students.",
                "Strength was how Prof DeStefano adapted the class to a pandemic. Although I was relatively engaged, the class did not give me any more stress on top of a global pandemic. \r\n\r\nWeakness was that even though it was a seminar, I felt that our discussions were not as student-led as they could've been because of Prof. DeStafano's tendencies to talk a lot",
                "A strength of the course is that it gives you an opportunity to learn from someone who has worked in politics for a long period of time. A weakness is that the class tends to turn into lectures because the professor has a lot to say about many topics. Overall, it is a great course. Highly recommend!",
                "The course assignment structure, specifically the group project, was very good. Gave students an opportunity to take a breather while another group presented their project in a given week. We also got the opportunity to speak with very interesting people as part of our group projects thanks to Professor DeStefano's connections, which was very insightful. I appreciate learning from people working on these issues on the ground, and in general, the course felt very grounded in reality, unlike most political science courses in my experience.",
                "One strength was that I felt as if I learned a lot of important information about New Haven and the developments of cities. Although I enjoyed the group presentation aspect of the class, I felt that it caused less engagement with the material from non-presenting classmates during seminar discussion."

The virtual discussions weren't always super strong, in part because it is easy to be disengaged over zoom, however DeStefano did a good job of trying to raise questions and encourage engagement.",
                "The adaptation of the course load and having the big assignment be a group project were very effective.",
                "I think the class's usage of small groups enhanced the quality of the course. Small group projects and discussions allow us to have more participation and engagement with the professor and fellow students.",
                "I thin the group project was relatively successful, though I think more guidance might be useful in the future (maybe one additional session where you meet with Prof. DeStefano to discuss). It would also be nice for students to have examples for what a good reading response might look like or clearer guidelines on what the deliverables for the group project should look like (e.g. had no idea what the paper for the group project was supposed to cover).",

I enjoyed coming to this class every week, although I wish it would have met in the afternoon.",
                "Yes! It is really a privilege to be taught about New Haven by Professor DeStefano who was mayor for many years and has so much knowledge on the power of cities and the history of New Haven. Also, every Yale student should engage with the history of the city that we occupy and take up so much space in.",

                "Yes, if you want to learn more about New Haven in a relatively relaxed manner I would definitely recommend this class. Professor DeStefano has a lot of very relevant and important wisdom that he shares."
