                "This course is a really broad view of grand strategy. We first read Isaiah Berlin's the fox and the hedgehog, which is the Compass for the class. The first half is spent largely reading Professor Gaddis' On Grand Strategy - a collage of stories, strategy and specific leaders approaching their problems. This class is less about examining specific events, but rather understanding leaders' worldviews, 'thinking about thinking,' and crafting best practices along the way.",
                "I improved my writing a lot in this class. Professor Gaddis expects succinct, smart prose and gives you the tools to write fun, creative, and smart pieces.",
                "I learned how to think across historical time periods and strategies. If you read Professor Gaddis's book (On Grand Strategy) ahead of time, you'll have a  good sense of what you'll get going into the class. I also learned to write more clearly and elegantlyProfessor Gaddis always gave prompt and detailed feedback on our papers.",
                "This course allowed me to significantly improve my writing, feel comfortable facing a range of thought-provoking writing assignments, and engage in some of the most thought-provoking discussions I've had at Yale. Its content has given me much to think about regarding the value of history, the power of a good analogy, the state of the world, and where it may evolve from here. It has even enabled me to reflect more deeply about my personal future.",
                "A brief summary of Western history (emphasis on cold war-now) through the lens of Foxes&Hedgehogs.",
                "I learned a lot about China and it's emergence as a strategic threat to the United States.",
                "Main insight: don't take a class with a professor just because he's famous. I've talked to some other people from this class and they definitely share similar sentiments, and feel that the class is underwhelming. I haven't really learned much from the class at all, and Gaddis never calls out other people's bullshit in class. On top of that he also doesn't answer questions properly and just dance around them: one time a student asked something about FDR and internment camps and he just didn't answer the question at all."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths:\r\n- Gaddis's impromptu anecdotes and lecturing (which he tries to avoid) is excellent. It is one of those Yale course where you know how much the teacher knows and really just want to hear what they have to say.\r\n-Your writing will improve. Gaddis has a brilliant and humorous checklist of do's and don'ts. If you heed his advice, your prose will be more concise and clear. \r\n-You get an introduction to Grand Strategy and are constantly asked to consider which approaches work and which do not. \r\n- You have a sense of what is going on in the world and within the US. \r\n- The writing prompts are intellectually challenging, yet creative. There are no normal history research papers here and this is for the best. \r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n- A self-selecting crowd that brings stress and stunts student discourse. The first day jitters do not seem to settle. Students are constantly looking to impress each other and Gaddis. Environment is bit cut-throat.",
                "Students should take this class just for the chance to listen to Professor Gaddis and learn how he sees the world. The reading list and writing prompts were always interesting, and I leave the class with a new sense of how to organize my thoughts on everything from world politics to my own life. The class discussions were not always riveting, but I attribute that more to the students than to the professor. I also always find the 3:30-5:20 time slot challenging for staying focused in a seminar, so that might have contributed to any lags in discussion.",
                "Strengths: \r\n-Excellent professor.\r\n-Well-crafted syllabus with an arc that intertwines a range of interesting discussions. \r\n-Great readings and discussions.\r\n-Great writing assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-No significant weaknesses.",
                "You learn a bit of everything... without learning anything. Most seminars are driven by the professor's often incoherent agenda. The conversations are too broad to be memorable, and the lessons are too cliche to be useful.",
                "I greatly enjoyed the readings that Professor Gaddis assigned us - each week I felt like the readings taught me a lot. Sometimes class seemed to not follow a clear plan -  this may be a strength and a weakness. On any given week we could cover 2,000 years of history and it might be fascinating, but other weeks we seemed to blindly have a conversation for 2 hours.",
                "I really enjoyed combining a broad cherry picking of strategic moments and people in history with the problems of today. However, I felt that we could have selected from a larger cross section of history rather than only military history.",
                "Strength is that you get to do a close reading of Gaddis's book in depth, and it's not a bad book, but you can also just do it on your own. Weaknesses? Discussions in class are rarely fruitful, grading is so arbitrary (some students get Cs just because they didn't write something Gaddis \"expected\" them to write), and the professor really just doesn't really care about your work (a student even got an A for the final project without him seeing the work). I've talked to people who have taken this class in the previous years and almost everyone I talked to agrees that they didn't learn much at all. Honestly I still think with Gaddis's cult of personality there will be a lot of students taking the class just for his fame, and he won't really change his teaching style, so I can see little room of improvement for this class."

That being said, be prepared for tougher grading on papers than you might have expected, and be ready to do a substantial amount of reading each week. Class discussions might not be riveting, but you get the chance to think more creatively about history than in any other course at Yale. So yes, take it, and if you could take it with a friend to talk about the readings outside of seminar, that would be even better.",

                "No, if you want to learn anything.\r\nKinda, if you want to understand the grand strategy without taking The Grand Strategy. Professor Gaddis is an influential mind in the US, and attending this class will make you understand how the US got involved in Iraq, Afghanistan... Still, it might not be worth your time.",
                "I enjoyed this course and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning from Professor Gaddis. This is not a typical history course - if you can go with the flow, accept that, and be willing to sometimes be confused about what the class is discussing, you'll enjoy the course.",
                "I would recommend this course if youre looking to learn from Professor Gaddis. This is more of a small weekly lecture than a discussion.",
                "NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT. Do not trust the past reviews on coursetable. This class is a joke. Unless you are a polisci bro who likes bullshitting in class, you'll find this class adding very little to your life. And don't take it just because it seems to be a gut: he is a very arbitrary but not easy grader, and you might get a C for real. Also Gaddis remembered the name of every white man in the class from the very first day, but mixes up names of women in the class even in the second to last class. Not that it matters greatly to everyone, but just an observation from a lot of people in the class."
