                "I learned how to close read philosophical texts with the goal of integrating them into religious studies.",
                "In this course, we explored theodicy, providence, free will, and many other philosophical comments through the lens of the Book of Job, Saadia Gaon, Maimonides, Aquinas, and Gersonides. We learned how to do close reads of the primary sources and analyze them meaningfully. We learned different philosophical schools of thought and similarities and differences between Jewish and Christian thinkers",
                "The course was insightful and taught us how to read medieval philosophy with an eye for specificity and details hidden in the text. After an introduction the problem of evil itself, we began discussing the general trends in how scripture\/revelation and philosophy\/reason were related throughout the periods from which we would read. We read contemporary philosophical reviews alongside primary texts from Saadia Gaon, Maimonides, Thomas Aquinas, and Gersonides. The knowledge was presented in the form of these readings, papers written by students each week, student presentations, and mini-lectures from Prof. Shemesh. We learned how to compare literature and philosophical arguments while also finding new perspectives to aid in our approaches to new philosophers.",
                "Definitely learned more about Judaic scholars and their opinions on the problem of evil and how it can be solved",
                "This course teaches you how to approach certain philosophical questions from different perspectives. It also helps to develop writing skills, and public speaking skills.",
                "I learned a lot about medieval theologians and philosophers and medieval philosophy as well as interpretation skills."

            "comments": [
                "This course is a really great way to become acquainted with medieval philosophers. However, the title is somewhat misleading: the class discusses summaries of the problem of evil as philosophers conceive of it but do not engage much with the issue by their own formulations.",
                "Strengths: Great discussions, readings, and prompts\r\nWeaknesses: Reading can be kind of heavy, and discussions get a bit awkward when most people didn't do the readings",
                "The strengths were in the student papers and insight from Prof. Shemesh. Requiring students to read primary readings, then secondary literature, then synthesizing ideas really helped us understand the philosophy and argumentation in a class that only meets once a week. We had lively discussion and were able to have clear pictures of what was being discussed and why because of the background given. There really weren't any weaknesses. If there was something that could have gone better, I would have recommended that Prof. Shemesh gave us a greater focus\/key details to look out for in the readings so that we may be more prepared or looking more deeply into the text.",
                "Not really any weaknesses in y opinion, but some people may find it a little less structured of a class. Doesn't mean its a good or bad thing but may not be the best for some individuals",
                "Readings were a lot- weakness",
                "The strength of this course come from who is in it. Almost everyone in the course had some religious background and a strong belief system going in. Therefore, as we discussed topics from different religious perspectives, different people would offer unique perspectives. In addition, the professor, despite having his own belief, was able to keep everyone at a similar playing field and it seemed that everyone felt comfortable to contribute from their personal perspective. The weakness came in time management. Presentations were placed at the end of the class, so they were always rushed.",
                "I really enjoyed the course. I wish we spent less time discussing student papers in class because it took away from our overall discussion and oftentimes us individual students didnt have much to say about other students papers."

                "Yes. I learned a lot and really enjoyed all the reading. Professor Shemesh is really fun and helps you learn well. Also I enjoyed the assignment format this semester, where we wrote short essays and responded to other students essays, then wrote a mid-sized final paper. It kept me engaged but not overloaded."
