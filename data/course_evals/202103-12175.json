                "This course was very well organized. I liked the structure of having a character quiz every day, one oral presentation every lesson, and a test every two(?) lessons. I also found the daily homework very helpful. However, I felt like this structure wasn't introduced very well at the beginning, so it would be great if the professors could give an overview of the semester and their expectations at the very beginning. I liked that we practiced speaking a lot in class and had a lot of oral presentations because this made me feel much more comfortable speaking in Chinese. I also liked that this course was fast-paced but in a manageable way- I didn't realize until the end how much we had learned so quickly! \r\nOne thing I think could be improved is review of past lessons, especially the vocabulary and the character writing. This could be done by administering short character quizzes, like the ones we currently have, but for characters from past lessons. By the end of the semester when I was studying for the final, I felt like I had forgotten a lot of the vocabulary from past lessons, and I spent a lot of time re-memorizing how to write those characters."

As long as the student isn't taking too many other courses with high workloads and is willing to commit the time for this course, they definitely should take this course, regardless of if they have a previous interest in Chinese or not. Mrs. Saussy is such an engaging and fun teacher, and she made it so easy to wake up in the morning for this class every day."
