                "The lectures are well-organized, and the instructor is able to convey core ideas in a super clear way.\r\nThe course can be improved if the instructor can publish recordings earlier.",
                "Prof. P is an amazing teacher. The only improvement I could offer is that I think there are better alternatives for the main textbook (Thornton & Marion).",
                "The live sections were definitely a strength. Prof P did a fantastic job clearing up ambiguities from the lecture and working through representative problems. Additionally, I felt the problem sets were hard but not crushingly long. Most were comprised of 5 solid problems and would take me about 8 hours to work through. They were tough to be sure, but more manageable than some Psets I've encountered previously in the department. \r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness, for me, were the exams. I came into this class with marginal previous experience in Physics and math (about the bare minimum you could have), so I can't say if my experience is representative of the rest of the class, but for me, the exams were brutal. I appreciated that they were take home and spread out over a multi-day time frame, but they ended up taking me between 10 and 12 hours to complete, which I did at the sacrifice of other courses. It was a ton of problems, which were often significantly harder than anything on our Psets. I found them to be graded fairly, though.",
                "It facilitated high engagement, but the combination of watching lectures asynchronously, meeting for a seminar on extra homework problems, and doing weekly homework assignments was a lot and increased my workload and stress during the pandemic.",
                "Most of the homework problems didn't really help me understand or improve, they were just confusing. Every problem was different and I didn't feel like I gained anything. More PSET help and office hours with TAs are a must, more TAs too."

                "The live sections were vital to my understanding in the course. The recorded lectures were tougher, and I got lost frequently and couldn't exactly decipher what was a derivation and what was critical information. They were a good length but definitely were a little harder to follow at times, which is why the Q&A sections were so vital for me.",
                "I really liked the flipped classroom format of this class. I've never been able to work in a small group on physics problems, it's always been in a large lecture hall with an instructor at the front, so I loved being able to discuss questions and concepts, and see how to actually approach solving problems, in a small setting. It felt like I was getting together with a study group each week. I only wish we had more time, to go over more material and discuss more problems.",

                "I'd say yes. Be prepared to really have to work to understand the material though, especially if you took 180\/181 instead of the higher-level intro sequences. But Prof P is a good instructor and doesn't give you anything you can't handle.",

The material is very interesting, even though this is not the first time we've seen these topicsyou look at them from a new perspective and learn different problem-solving techniques.",
