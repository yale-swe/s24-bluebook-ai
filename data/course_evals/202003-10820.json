One of Professor Smith's biggest goal was for us to be able to think like a sociologist, and that goal was definitely achieved. I see a lot of societal situation through a very different lens, and I have more knowledge of paradigms and theories proposed about social issues and how society is viewed in general. I also effectively learned how to connect different topics learned in class to real-life sociological research.",

            "comments": [
                "I liked that the course covered a wide variety of topics so if you weren't interested in one it wouldn't be a long time studying it. It was frustrating that the slides had very little information on them (just terms), and lectures weren't recorded, so if you ever had technical difficulties or missed what he was saying you were lost. Also, it didn't make any sense to have the midterm and response paper due the same week, as well as the final paper and final exam the same week. With no other assignments, they should've been spread out more.",
                "Strengths: Professor Smith is entertaining. His lectures are interesting, the topics vary each week to keep from being dull and repetitive, and he responds directly to student questions live. Lower workload as compared to many classes (discussion sections that don't require huge participation, 2 papers, a midterm and a final exam)\r\nWeaknesses: The response paper and midterm (30% of the total grade) are clustered around the same time. The term paper and final are the same way and make up another 60% of your grade. If you're not comfortable having 90% of your grade determined based on one week in October and one week in December, don't take it. Otherwise no problem.",
                "The readings were very well selected. They were always pretty interesting to read and discuss in sections. The selections for the final paper were also all very interesting to write about. Luckily, the lectures didnt drag on because it was only 50 minutes, but it wasnt as engaging as it couldve been.",
                "It would be very helpful if the lectures were posted because they go over a lot of information very quickly.",
                "The course was a good overview to the field of sociology and got me thinking in different ways about lots of the very pressing issues in today's society, and also got me questioning some of the ordinary things we take as given. The course could have been improved through more lively lectures, but I think the virtual format of the course and the fact that people weren't required to have cameras on made this difficult. I also wish lectures our lecture outlines\/notes were published online, and that each lecture finished on time (often lectures would need to be finished at the start of the next class).",
                "Strong: very strong lecturer\r\nWeakness: low levels of homework so not much reinforcement of concepts",
                "This course covers a lot of material, which is one of the reasons it appealed to me during the selection process. There were lectures on such broad topics as gender, the body, and sleep however, these lectures sometimes seemed surface level. For example, in the gender class, we used most of the time to cover introductory ideas like the difference between gender, sex, and sexual orientation, which didn't seem like an effective use of our time. There was one question brought up about whether there is a real sex binary (given the existence of intersex people and the construction of sex characteristics to fit gender norms, not the other way around). I think that one way to structure the class to make it more interesting would be to give each lecture one of these big questions to open for discussion, covering basic info in the beginning but using most of the time to let students apply the sociological framework that we're learning about to approach debate. I also think we could flip the material that is covered in lecture and section-- use section for students to clarify basic ideas and establish a foundation of knowledge that we can draw upon for debate in the main lecture, rather than using lecture to establish knowledge and leaving the complex discussion for section.",
                "Strengths - clear lecture\r\nWeaknesses - the professor could have been a bit more clear about some of the topics \/ key thinkers that were named. I think it would be helpful to have an introductory slide that provided an overview of what the lecture would be about, and a concluding lecture that kind of brings all the topics and thinkers mentioned together. Also, the section guides are helpful but I think we can also provide more space during discussion section for students to discuss ideas with each other rather than just answering questions.",
                "Strengths: very clear lectures, a lot of help offered for students who need it",
                "The professor delivered almost all concepts in real-life contexts that really helps in understanding!",
                "Strengths: Professor Smith was an amazing lecturer and held so much knowledge. He was always willing to stay after class for further explanation. Tg] The TAs were also great resources. The topics covered were probably the best part because they were very interesting and relevant to life today.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the powerpoints were very bare and without recorded lectures, it made it very hard to go back if you missed anything in class. This combined with the professor's very fast-talking made it hard to catch everything he said, and left holes of information in notes.",
                "strengths: some of the concepts were cool\r\nweaknesses: I do not know why but lectures were not uploaded online which was frustrating. Professor Smith often spent the first 10 minutes of a class finishing up last classes' content and things always felt rushed. The COVID applications were sometimes interesting but could have been condensed because the class is only 50 minutes. Section felt pointless 90% of the time, but I did appreciate that some of the questions were guided toward the end of the semester. The power points were essentially useless to students because they were more so a guide for Prof Smith to keep track of what tp say and had very minimal detail (think bullet list of topics that have no explanation). So if you miss lecture or your WiFi cuts out a lot like mine did, you can't really go back and learn the info on your own because like I said, lectures were not uploaded and the power points were not helpful. I like to get my work for later in the week done on the weekend and sometimes the reading guides for section were not posted until very late on Monday night. Also, some of the things Prof Smith said during the lecture on race and ethnicity had me raising my eyebrow...",
                "I liked that the course load was spread evenly between essays, exams , and discussion section readings, but there was not too much preparation necessary for the lectures.",
                "The strengths of this course definitely involve the breadth of material covered. The course contains over 20 units of information, and each lecture provides new insights from a wide variety of sociology researchers. The course is very helpful to gauge your interest in the field of sociology. There are no major improvements I would make to the course.",
                "I found the subject matter interesting and the lecturer good at explaining and responsive to questions. Most weaknesses were a result of the virtual format of the class, which made engaging with the lecture material slightly more difficult than if it were in person.",
                "A strength if this course was the breadth of material covered in lecture; I feel as though I got a surprisingly comprehensive look at many important areas of sociological inquiry for an introductory course. The focus on reading research papers rather than textbooks or other materials was also important, and made the course more engaging and informative. This course also did a great job of focusing on the practical application of the concepts and theories we learned. A potential weakness of the course was that sometimes the lectures could feel somewhat unstructured. Lots of information was given, but a greater outlining and organizing of the topics to be discussed would be helpful."

I do think that some points were really useful and interesting, but those points sort of emerged naturally in the lecture rather than being relegated to the COVID applications slide at the end. I think that having one culminating class period about COVID maybe at the end of the course would be a better way to address it than the daily obligatory slide.",
                "Since this was a lecture class, I would have liked for it to be recorded. Maybe they can be recorded midsemester and at the end before the finals, to incentivize students to show up anyway. But they would have been useful to refer back to because there are a lot of topics that the professor covered in class and hard to note all of them. Also, the professor always began class on time but would go over time, which felt a bit unfair.",

                "I think the raising hand feature in discussion section worked well enough and made an organized system for discussion. That being said if the discussion sections were slightly smaller and we could've chosen to stay unmuted, I've found that that really does encourage engagement. I know on zoom it has become a barrier to have to unmute before speaking that has deterred people from jumping into the conversation. If we could just speak freely the conversations would've progressed more naturally and given the feel of an in-person discussion. I think the lecture should've been longer to allow for more personal engagement in the class. The questions method we used in the chat worked fine but everything felt so disconnected and I know that led to lower engagement for some students.",

                "I felt as though Professor Smith's live virtual lectures were very successful and really allowed me to retain complex, novel information. During the virtual lectures, we were able to input our questions into the \"Chat\" feature of Zoom, which Professor Smith always answered with no hesitation. The only improvement I would make is posting the lectures on Canvas after class is finished. As I studied for the midterm and final exams, I found that my notes could be confusing, and I desired to look back at the lectures for confirmation. While the lecture slides were posted on Canvas, I think it might be helpful to post the recordings as well.",
                "I found the integration of COVID-19 applications into each subject covered to be fascinating and the lectures to be relatively engaging and educational despite the inherent limitations of zoom. I think the virtual component detracted most from my ability to make connections with the professor which can certainly help with the learning process and further education outside what is covered in the lecture, but I'm not sure how this could be accounted for in a pandemic.",
                "The course made good use of virtual technology to share slideshows with students in real time. More virtual practices could be used, such as the use of Zoom breakout rooms, polls, or other screensharing options beyond slideshows. The fact that the course lectures included COVID-19 applications of the different subjects learned was great, and helped make those topics feel much more engaging and practically applicable."

The topic was really interesting and constantly blew my mind in how it explained such familiar ideas in sich a detailed and researched way. I think any and everyone would benefit from taking this class.",
                "Not really. It wasn't very difficult but felt disorganized and unengaging.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone because it gives a great overview on society as a whole and makes you think differently about the world around you.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The material is really fascinating and engaging, and it facilitates questioning of concepts we tend to accept in everyday life. I found myself discussing the course material with my peers outside of the classroom, because I found it to be so thought provoking.",
                "Yes, I found the subject of sociology to be extremely fascinating and thought that this course was a great way to learn a wide variety of topics within the field. The work load was mostly reading, with the majority of the papers assigned being very interesting and the few essays we had to write were among my favorite to write this semester.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student looking for an overview of the discipline of sociology. While it might be a survey class, this course explored many fascinating concepts and ideas on diverse subjects and highlighted their various applications to our social lives. The focus on reading actual research means first-hand exposure to some of the exciting work which has been and continues to be done in the field. Students will walk away from the class with a wide array of new tools to understanding the complex social world in which they live. I think that this course is valuable to students of all disciplinary backgrounds, not just those interested in sociology or the social sciences."
