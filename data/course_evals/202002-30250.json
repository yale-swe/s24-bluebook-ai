    "I gained insight on the internal structures of the education system in the United States and some of the everyday challenges that are faced by PoC, namely Black and Latinx students. We also delved into how education relates to urban studies and how many children are disadvantaged simply because of their zip codes.",
    "Learned so much about how urban housing and education policy perpetuate segregation and inequality! This course delved really well into a topic I was not super well versed in and allowed me to reexamine both my relationship with education and space in a new light.",
    "I learned more about the historical development of discrimination in housing and education policy, especially in Atlanta.",
    "I was able to develop a deeper understanding of the situation I grew up in and the situations other students like me grew up in. Super insightful course!",
    "I was able to learn about the prevalence of racism and anti-blackness sentiment in housing and education. This course gave me a specified view on how presumable remedies to segregation (such as school choice) have been used to reinforce BIPOC oppression.",
    "I learned a lot about discrimination in both housing and education and, most importantly, how the two are inextricably linked.  This class gave me quite a bit of practice navigating different roles in a classroom discussion (presenter, discussion leader, \"panelist,\" discussion participant) -- doing so over zoom was new to me, but it was very informative.  The readings were well-chosen for the course, and I learned a lot from putting them in conversation with one another.",
    "This class taught me about the systemic racism present in our countries and how it is deeply rooted in the housing and educational systems in our cities.",
    "A deeper understanding of our country's history regarding race and how systemic racism is still prevalent in our country's education and housing systems."

   "comments": [
    "Discussions about class readings were well facilitated by the professors and TAs. The readings that were given in the class were engaging and informational.",
    "This class was absolutely amazing. I understand it was a challenging circumstance to modify it to be an online class, but nevertheless, I still think this was one of the best courses I've ever taken. The only change I would suggest is to have this course in person and for a longer amount of time!",
    "The readings are super interesting, and they made the class really enjoyable. One weakness is that class discussions often felt really awkward. It seemed more like people trying to say something for participation points than genuine engagement with the text.",
    "Strengths: Literally everything. Formatting of the class is conducive for learning. Breaks implemented because it was a lengthy time period. Very discussion-oriented\r\nWeakness: Organization of the discussion section. But that's a super easy fix.",
    "This course is thoroughly engaging and offers a lot of support to those who really haven't taken many anthropology\/writing classes. However, some of the weaknesses is the amount of course assignments given and the limited topics explored. There are quite a lot of writing assignments (at least 2 a week) and that can get a little overwhelming with the class and readings. The last week with the presentation, roundtable discussion, and essay was especially stressful and wasn't conducive to student productivity. Additionally, I feel like the topics addressed were rather limited. Regarding education, I was expecting to address multiple facets of its inequalities\/structures yet the topic heavily addressed was school choice.",
    "This course chose excellent readings.  There were also many different kinds of assignments and different ways to engage with the material, which I appreciated.  Sometimes, though, it really just felt like an overload of medium-sized assignments.  At a certain point, it was just a bit overwhelming and I felt that I was spread thin between the different tasks that the course demanded of me.  I would have appreciated paring down the assignments a bit and having more time and instruction on each one.  In general, the course was pretty disorganized.  There were lots of discrepancies between how assignments were listed and described in different places, so much of my energy was devoted to decoding whether the syllabus, the canvas assignment, or what was said in class was the correct set of instructions.  Streamlining all of that information would have allowed me to devote more thought to the content that I wanted to put forth in my assignments, rather than figuring out what was expected of me for each.  I think that more thought could have also gone towards how the class time would be broken down (I found discussion section to be some of the more valuable class time, but it always felt like we had too much content to get through and were just skating the surface of most topics rather than truly engaging with the difficult questions that the readings presented).  Also, feedback was not timely.  I know that it's hard in a class with such a condensed timeline, and I really feel for the professor and TFs having to grade so many assignments quickly!  But the students were held to a very high, unwavering standard as to the timeliness of our assignments, so I would have appreciated a similar standard of timeliness for grading.  It was difficult to approach assignments having not gotten any feedback on our previous work.  I think it's maybe worth considering that if there are too many assignments in too quick succession for the teaching team to turn around grading in a timely manner, maybe there were also just too many assignments in general.",
    "The class had great discussions however, not everyones voice was heard during these discussions. With the size of the class and it being online, it was difficult to have conversations that felt completely natural. With that being said, Professor Barnes and the TFs did a great job lecturing and pushing us to think critically about the subject matter.",
    "Strengths- Good mix of lectures and discussion during class\r\nWeaknesses- Would have been nice to get some feedback on assignments earlier on in the course",
    "The readings were incredibly enlightening and eye opening"

    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is curious about the inner workings of the American education system as well as interested in how geographical context matters when we talk about the accessibility of educational resources to students. As social justice movements have regained momentum in the last couple of months, this class provides a really important foundation to our knowledge and awareness of the injustices that exist in this country and pushes us to continue the dialogue on these issues.",
    "yes if you like anthropology or education and want to gain more insight into the tortures of racism.",
    "Yes! This course totally reshaped the way I see education and housing policy and has made me conscious of the spaces I inhabit and have moved through.",
    "I would recommend this class. With the writing assignments and projects, the workload is unnecessarily high. However, nothing is graded excessively harshly. Beyond that, the TFs and Professor Barnes are phenomenal. Professor Barnes is leaving, so I wont elaborate on how wonderful she is, but they truly made an open and welcoming learning environment.",
    "Definitely. This class will remind you of the struggls that a lot of students experience in education and hwo their race and address affects that for them. Check your privilege with this class and do what you can to help the education crisis.",
    "Yes I would. It's a very insightful course that helps students understand systemic oppressions BIPOC endure in housing and education. Although there are a lot of writing assignments, I believe this course improved my writing skills and my ability to think critically.",
    "I think this course is a really important one to take if you want to understand how inequality operates and perpetuates itself in our society.  Especially for urban studies majors, anthropology\/sociology majors, and anyone else who studies urbanism and our society, it's really important to understand the ways that discrimination gets embedded in our landscapes and has far-reaching effects.  The readings are really great, and some of this should honestly be mandatory reading for all of us (we're all implicated in and\/or affected by this system in some way).  If you're going to take this course, though, be prepared to navigate a somewhat confusing web of assignments and due dates.  You have to be twice as organized because the course organization itself will not make things easy or clear for you.",
    "I would recommend this course to my classmates. The course was very relevant and informative.",
    "Yes, the material is extremely relevant in today's society and understanding how systemic racism is still prevalent in our society is very important.",
    "Absolutely; one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I loved this class. Nothing but good things to say!"
