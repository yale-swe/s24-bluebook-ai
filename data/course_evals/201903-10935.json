   "comments": [
    "I really improved as a writer, I think, or at least identified lots of areas that I'll be working on improving going forward. Professor Warner sat down with everyone for our first essays, and there it really was a data download of how to optimize clarity, syntax, development of ideas... just great. The close reading, too, helped me understand the process of decoding a text. Lots of great stuff.",
    "This course provided a nice overview of American Literature spanning across different genres, eras, and topics, as well as offered experience in performing close readings on texts and writing effective essays.",
    "This course is a great way to read great texts in the literary canon, and improve your writing skills.",
    "I learned how to critically engage with the American literary canon.",
    "I honed my skills as a writer, enjoyed thoughtful discussions, and learned to change the way I structure my papers.",
    "I learned how to be a better reader and improved my writing.",
    "This course exposed me to an important selection of writings in American literature up to the present day. Reading poetry, short stories, essays and more, I really enjoyed each of the works we read. Furthermore, Professor Warner was extremely helpful in learning about the practice of revision, and this course helped me learn new strategies for better writing and improved the quality of my writing too."

   "comments": [
    "Great course! no notes.",
    "I enjoyed the use of reading responses to facilitate our class discussions, as it encouraged students to speak more openly about aspects of the texts that interested them. I loved all of our readings and thought each text was given the right amount of time for us to discuss them. Though intimidating, I thought the extensive read through of our first paper with Professor Warner was helpful in understanding essay writing on a sentence-by-sentence structure and provided a great foundation for later papers. However, I felt that while we were given a decent amount of time for our first paper and its following feedback, we had a very short turn around time between the assignment of our second and third paper and its due date, which meant there was less time able to be dedicated to planning the papers or speaking to Professor Warner beforehand. This was not a huge problem, as the paper assignments were quite short (4-5 pages for the first two, 6-8 for the final), but something to keep in mind.",
    "If you ever get the chance to take a course with Prof. Warner, I HIGHLY recommend doing so. He is the greatest strength of this course, and have such a vast and comprehensive of the texts it's kind of astonishing just to listen to him speak. One of the most interesting people I've encountered in my time at Yale. The course is intense -- my first paper was absolutely torn apart -- but provides the chance to greatly improving your writing and reading skills if you stick with it.",
    "I liked the reading list, class discussion, and the reading responses (surprisingly). While I usually think that English courses are too small and difficult to get into, I thought this one was a little too large and didn't facilitate a lot of student engagement. That could also have been an effect of the 9:00 am time though.",
    "I would only suggest that classes like this one not be held so early in the morning, because I think the early hour made it difficult to have a lively discussion in some cases.",
    "I cant really think of any weaknesses of this course, I enjoyed all of our readings, discussions, and the papers (open ended if you want them to be and Prof. Warner is very available for talking through them).",
    "One strength of this course was the intimate learning environment it provided. The seminars, although guided by Professor Warner, were very much student-driven and we had plenty of opportunities to engage with aspects of the works we read that we individually found interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed the vast knowledge and expertise Professor Warner had and learned something new and interesting every seminar. Although I would have changed the pace how we engaged with several pieces, overall I think we spent a good amount of time on everything we read so as to challenge our initial readings and leave us interested to tackle new questions that arise through discussion. I cant really think of any glaring weaknesses with this course. I would have loved to cover more topics in the class, such as American Gothic writing or colonial era works, but I think that given the time constraints of the semester I was very satisfied by the selection we read."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Warner is great, and the readings are really interesting. Moby Dick is a slog but a rewarding slog. Worth it for the discussions. Good good course.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in American Literature or in becoming more skilled at close reading and essay writing.",
    "Yes! I took this course as a non-english major (I'm Econ), and it was sometimes intimidating to be in a small seminar with mostly english majors. I would still recommend this course to anyone even slightly interested in reading great literature and work on your writing! Especially with Prof. Michael Warner!",
    "I'd recommend it if it's a requirement for you, you want to learn about American literature, or you want to experience a basic Yale seminar structure. However, there are more imaginative, experimental, or niche syllabi out there.",
    "Yes, though it is not easy but the works we read were wonderful and you receive a lot of personal attention on your writing.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the reading list, especially with Prof. Warner. Id only taken one (lecture) English course before and I didnt feel like I was out of my depth; Im pretty sure even if I didnt have that background it wouldve been fine.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, especially as taught by Professor Warner, to anyone from English majors to someone taking their first English class or trying to find an interesting option to satisfy their writing requirement.",
    "Yes, definitely. This course is amazing and most definitely worth your while. If you are very confident in your writing, I would suggest taking it with Professor Warner as he will likely humble you in one way or another. If you're already hesitant about your writing skills, I would take it with a different Professor. P Warner does not hold back on his comments at all. While this can be helpful for some, I found myself not at all excited about writing the final paper. I felt as though nothing I could possibly conjure, regardless of how long I dwelled over the word choices or overall essay structure, would meet his expectations. Do I, after taking this class with him, feel like an overall better writer? No. Do I feel more capable of analyzing texts to extrapolate their meaning? Yes. So, while I loved each class meeting and the way that Professor conducts them, the way the writing assignments were graded\/the way feedback was given wasn't necessarily the most helpful for my learning."
