    "Improved my skill to read, speak, and write Spanish.",
    "I learned more Spanish verb tenses and practiced my speaking skills.",
    "This course has the most grammar instruction of any spanish class I've taken at Yale. Tons on grammar structure, which is great, but a lot of work. It also provided a lot of literature, which was nice to be able to read (and mostly understand)!"

   "comments": [
    "Very high workload.",
    "The course load is very unevenly distributed. It escalated too fast till the end and I was having trouble keeping up.",
    "I think this is a very strong course that demands engagement in order to be successful. I think that in order to be more manageable for students, the syllabus should be tweaked to reduce the possibility of having a few weeks which have a very large amount of work due. A few times it was difficult to keep up with 140 and my other courses.",
    "Too much work, harsh grading. Strengths were a variety of avenues to learn through ie videos stories music art etc",
    "WAY TOO MUCH WORK!!! I don't think it is necessary to do this much busy work in a class because it is so easy to just plug in answers formulaically rather than actually thinking about them, especially when you have so much to do! Also which there was more active speaking in the class rather than grammar review.",
    "The course is poorly designed. Daily assignments were manageable in the beginning, but the work for the course all of the sudden ramps up drastically about 3\/4 of the way through. This made the last few weeks of the course rather excruciating to live through...",
    "Strengths: good feedback from the professor. \r\nWeakness: Workload was suddenly incredibly concentrated toward the end of the semester. Almost unrelentlessly so.",
    "Overall, it's a well structured course. However, Supersite seems to be waste of everyone's time (I felt the same way after L3)."

   "comments": [
    "If you have to take it, take it with Leon. She's a slightly tougher grader but very good at what she does and very much cares about her students and their success, very willing to work with students outside of class or do whatever she can to help with their success.",
    "No. Unless the student need this class for graduation requirement.",
    "Yes, take L4. It is a demanding course but can be very rewarding if you do the work. It's a constant workload for the most part.",
    "Absolutely not, made my semester much more stressful than it could have been otherwise. I honestly wished I started in L1 to not take L4 at the top.",
    "Only if you have to.",
    "If you have to take it, there's not much my recommendation will do to impact your decision. If you don't have to take it, do not take the class until you have a deep interest and passion for learning Spanish.",
    "Not unless they were very passionate about Spanish.",
    "Lots of work, which is obvious since it's an everyday language. A ton of grammar work and reading, but it's rewarding if you actually put in the time. Be prepared for a test of some sort (essay, quiz, exam, debate, presentation, etc) every week! Prof. Len is AMAZING. If you can take it with her, do it, no questions asked. She expects a lot, but she is super clear with her instruction and really made the class worthwhile for me."
