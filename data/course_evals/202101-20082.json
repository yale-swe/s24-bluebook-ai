                "The course seemed unstructured and there wasnt any clear feedback. It was difficult to advance in my learning and I felt like i was always trailing behind.",
                "Weakness: Very monotone professor, the content went very slow and needed more concise and engaging structure. PSETs were designed for those who knew Matlab already, very tough for those who were familiar. The grading was very erratic.",
                "I think this course suffers from a lack of engagement. It was very boring to watch someone code for the entirety of class, and even when we did have those quizzes on some days, it was extremely rushed and stressful. I liked the content, and the structure of the class generally was very good with the multiple units and such. But engagement was definitely a low point for me.",
                "This course is very coding heavy and was not incredibly engaging and I sometimes felt like the material could have been shared in a more interesting and engaging manner.",
                "Mak is not a great lecturer and it's very hard to keep engaged with the class.",
                "I benefited from this course because of the good availability from the TAs to meet and understand certain problem sets/lectures more. I felt this class was harder to follow given the lecture setup, but the grading is beneficial because it helps you focus more on your creativity rather than stress about the grade.",
                "Lectures were very often confusing even to students who put a lot of effort into understanding. Derivations often skipped many steps and slides included many variables that were not explicitly labeled. This could be improved by going over examples with real numbers rather than a variable. This would both help everyone understand what each variable represented and what sort of calculations Matlab is preforming under the hood.",
                "lectures were semi unorganized and hard to follow. i think if there was more guidance on the final projects, it would have helped immensely.",
                "The course felt unorganized and some parts were repetitive or unnecessary.",
                "The strengths of the course is that the homeworks and practice exams resemble the exams, the homeworks are based off lecture material, and that the TF's are very helpful. One weakness is that sometimes expectations were a bit unclear for certain homework problems, but overall the class was quite a positive experience."
