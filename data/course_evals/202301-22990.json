                "In addition to a comprehensive overview of modern architecture, this course and the various themes covered helped me make interdisciplinary connections across my courses this semester. Overall, it helped me think deeply about concepts applicable to my non-architectural course work in general.",
                "Learnt about a lot of buildings, across a wide range of times and locations. We also learnt how to compare buildings, and to consider the socio-historic context behind them.",
                "Overview of modern arch. history",
                "This course provided an informative overview of Modern Architectural history beginning in the 1750's.",
                "Learning how to think about modern architecture critically and in the context of our own environments.",
                "I look at the world around me with completely new eyesand I'm not exaggerating. I find myself staring at buildings for minutes at a time, reflexively analyzing how their exterior details might telegraph what the inside looks like\/how it is partitioned. Buildings I have passed hundreds of times take on new meanings. But in addition to giving me purely architectural knowledge\/skills, this class has also made me more interested in and cognizant of the power of art more generally.",
                "I learned about the evolution of architectural styles, materials, typologies, and techniques since around 1750. \r\nSkills: visual and formal analysis, comparison, synthesis.\r\nInsights: architecture has exhibited ongoing debates and reformulations of central questions for centuries: is\/should architecture be universal or regional? what is the relationship of architecture to modernity and antiquity\/tradition? how does\/should architecture respond to history? etc",
                "This class was a great overview of modern architecture and the social and historical implications of architecture around the world. One of my favorite classes I have taken.",
                "I learned so much about modern architecture!",
                "I learned how to do a structural and typological analysis of a building. I also learned how to critically analyze buildings as how they are recorded in history and how they are being preserved today.",
                "learned  basic and comprehensive history of modern architecture in a very western centric context",
                "I learned about the history of global modern architecture and how architecture can be a tool used to both reflect on and shape society.",
                "Knowledge of major architecture\/art movements in the context of politics; how to visually read buildings; short biographies of major architects in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries; knowledge of how to conduct structural and typological comparisons of buildings",
                "Fantastic survey course covering neoclassicism to deconstructionism. Learned architectural terminology, comparative visual analysis of buildings, situating stylistic trends in broader intellectual culture, (dis)continuities and developments between distinct movements in architectural history.",
                "I gained fluent vocabulary and understanding in talking about modern architecture, and how each movement is related to the previous ones.",
                "An understanding of the major trends, architects, and movements, in modern architecture, beginning with neoclassicism in the 1700s and extending until the present. I feel like I understand how architecture has developed and can identify elements of many buildings around me and trace them back to a moment\/architect\/building from the class.",
                "I learned about the way historical events shape our surroundings and buildings. I also learned about architectural language, regarding the physical aspects of a structure but also the experience inside the building.",
                "I received insights into the context and meaning behind modern and post modern buildings. I also learned how to compare and contrast buildings of different styles and eras.",
                "I gained a general overview of primarily European architecture from the 18th century to the present, with a focus also on Brazil and Japan. I was taught how to closely analyze a structure's visual features and write a comparative analysis of the typography of two buildings. I gained a deeper understanding of influential architectural movements and the linear progression of artistic influence in some geographic spheres.",

                "Strengths:\r\n- lectures are fast paced and interesting\r\n- section provides an opportunity to discuss the buildings further in depth",
                "Amazing lectures, engaging slides and images, and prof. buckley is such an eloquent, thoughtful, and captivating speaker!",
                "The course lectures were always informative and intuitive in how they presented course topics. As a student who often struggles with auditory learning, I felt that the material was easy to follow and engaging. The course sections were not always the most helpful, but I found the occasional visit to special collections at the libraries special and engaging.",
                "Strengths: Incredibly compelling lecture, engaging professor, awesome buildings, reasonable paper\/exam expectations\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Having never taken an architecture class before, the only problem I encountered was a small learning curve with the first paper. As a visual analysis assignment, it required a grasp of terminology\/vocabulary that I didn't have. It was easy enough to catch myself up using online resources, but it might be helpful to devote an early section to discussing these basics to bring everyone on the same page. Other than this small detail I have no complaints!",
                "Strengh: professor Buckley, material, lectures, readings, assignments, visits to archives and gallery, just a fantastic course overall\r\ncannot think of a weakness",
                "Strengths: professor Buckley is a great lecturer, well organized, assignments and readings are manageable and relevant\r\n\r\nWeakness: section could be slow at times",
                "This is a great course.  The first writing assignment was observation only.  I think it would be helpful to allow but not necessarily require bringing in secondary research.",
                "The strength of course was the readings we had. I feel like they were really informative and detailed and they helped introduce the topics Professor Buckley covered the next day. A minor weakness was that the class exceeded the 2:20 end time.",
                "very interesting lectures and love working with primary sources but the course is so european centric in a way that i wasnt expecting",
                "The lecture material was extremely well thought-out, interesting, and accessible even for me who has never taken an art history class at Yale before.",
                "Strengths: provided a robust overview of architectural history over the past 300 years as well as introduction to architectural concepts\r\nPossible Improvement: I hope we spent more time going over basic architectural terms as well as smaller writing assignments aside from the big papers",
                "A strength of this course was the style of lectures, it was nice to come to class and look at a slideshow of pretty pictures. The workload wasn't too heavy, and the assigned readings provided sufficient context for the lectures.  I also liked being able to analyze and visit buildings in New Haven; the section trips to the Beinecke and YUAG were also helpful.\r\nA weakness was the slightly misleading course title: the \"global context\" we studied did not leave Europe and the United States until about two weeks before the final. Even then, we gave one day to Brazil and India, and another day to Tokyo. The course felt pretty Eurocentric in how it defined \"global context.\" This could be improved by having non-European works and architects throughout the semester and not just all at the end for convenience. \r\nAnother weakness is the structure of the midterm and final exams, which are mainly based on memorization of buildings and architects. It's easier to memorize (and thus prepare for these exams) if you've already seen most of the works in prior coursework.",
                "Trips to YUAG and Beinecke are highlights. Lectures are captivating and very lucid, and the assignments are well-designed to capture what youre learning. The discussion  posts sometimes felt a bit lackluster and I wished we had spoken more about the readings either online or in section.",
                "The lectures are amazing, and I am glad that they're not available online until right before the exam. \r\nHowever, I wish there was more facilitated process in section in writing the papers.",
                "Strengths: lectures are amazing and essays are a blast to write. Only weakness might be that I don't find studying for slide based exams that interesting, although the final was an improvement over the midterm on that respect.",
                "The course was really interesting and Professor Buckley does such a great job and is so knowledgeable. The course could be improved by spending more time on non-European cases of architecture that could serve as instances of comparison.",
                "Strength: lectures are interesting after having taken a couple architecture history classes before. If I had not taken any history of architecture classes, I would have felt very lost hearing architectural terms without an in-depth explanation of them.\r\nAlso, having the midterm and final during the 50-minute class period was very fruitful. I would much rather have a quick test than a three hour one.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeakness: class presupposes knowledge of architectural terminology and basic architectural concepts.",
                "The lectures were very engaging and provided an in-depth overview despite the quick pace of the course. The organization of the slides was very clear and helped facilitate the digestion of material. A weakness of the course was the lack of class engagement. The lecture style made it hard to participate actively with the content outside of discussion section. An overview of architectural vocabulary would help clear up any confusion for students who are taking the course without previous knowledge of specific terminology."

                "Yes 100%",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn more about architectural history. It is a great overview of modern architectural history from a global perspective, which I find valuable not only to those interested in art and architecture but also to those of other disciplines.",

Rather I found myself excited to go to class, which felt more like a digest\/documentary than a lecture. I also found myself taking note of everything Professor Buckley said word-for-word given how articulate and intelligent his architectural analysis is. As an econ major, this was the most refreshing humanities class I could have chosen. The grading\/workload is also extremely reasonable as a kicker. Take this class.",

                "I'd recommend this to a student in Architecture, Urban Studies, or the History of Art majors, but only towards the end of their time at Yale. The midterm and final are based mainly on memorization, so it's easier to study and memorize in preparation for them after you've become familiar with most of these famous works\/architects.",
                "Yes, it is a really good class. A great counterpoint to small seminars - its really nice to take a lecture that is so well-designed for that format. Prof. Buckley is telling you a story and its engrossing.",
                "YES!! The course content is super engaging. It might seem like a lot of memorization, but Prof. Buckley really scales in down and it becomes quite manageable.",

                "I would highly recommend this class. Prof Buckley is amazing and makes lectures very engaging. It's a good course to take after having taken one architecture or urbanism course like ARCH 280, because they both cover similar topics and many of the same buildings.",
                "only if they are majoring in architecture or art history; otherwise the class would be pretty dry",
                "I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in architecture looking for a general overview of multiple movements. Since the class covers such a large time period, the class does not dive into extreme depth. Still, the presentation of the material and readings are quite fascinating, even to those without previous knowledge of architectural history.",
