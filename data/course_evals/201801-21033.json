    "I got to hone my craft as a screenwriter, in a more intense way which was super helpful.",
    "Skills in writing dialogue, analysing screenplays, and structuring narrative.",
    "I learned a lot both about the format and structure of screenplays. I learned how to introduce action in the most dramatic way possible for the reader, and I learned how to begin constructing your story from the end and work backwards.",
    "I learned so much about film, and how important stories about our society can be told through film and other forms of art. I learned how to write a screenplay, both in terms of style in formatting but most important developing characters, telling a story, and conveying a message. Through this class, I feel like I gained insights into not just film and writing but also my own aspirations as a soon-to-be graduate. I cannot emphasize how much I learned by taking this class.",
    "I came in with no knowledge of screenwriting, but quickly learned the proper format and structure necessary.",
    "I loved this course. A must take if you are interested in this field even a little bit."

   "comments": [
    "Until we actually start workshopping screenplays, the class is just Marc going off on tangents. The workshops are definitely the most helpful part of the class, and I think it could be improved by having the weeks before spring break be an opportunity to workshop your story, as a lot of people ended up having to rewrite the whole thing. As fun as Marc's side bits are, they're best when worked into the workshops.",
    "The strengths are the class format itself. Lapadula is very insightful and helpful. I think the class could be improved by either lengthening the final project from 8-12 pages OR allowing students to write the first 8-12 pages of a project they would like to expand into something longer.",
    "I thought that this course was excellent; the assignments were all really interesting and the students in the class were extremely engaged. I don't really have any changes to suggest.",
    "This course was really interesting as far as getting to really dive into screenwriting and storytelling. However, i do wish there was more structure. While this class does equip you with the skills to develop and write a 8-12 page screenplay, it does not give you the skills to write a 100-page feature length screenplay. Considering that I have taken a class that does teach this, I believe this class's shortcomings are that there was very little attention given to structure and creating timelines, etc.",
    "This class is perfect."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to be a filmmaker or screenwriter, this class is a must. Despite some of the stories about Marc, you improve a lot as a writer in this class.",
    "Absolutely. Marc is tough, but everyone in the seminar emerged from the course way better than before. His insight on both screenwriting and life (both are inextricably linked) were incredibly useful and enlightening. Take the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with even little or no screenwriting experience who has interest in both writing and reading scripts. The workload is manageable, especially if you have coverage experience or are interested in reading full screenplays, and you get to leave with a short project you can feel proud that you wrote.",
    "Yes",
    "I would give this course the highest recommendation. You MUST take this class while at Yale, I am so so glad that I did. I only regret that I didn't discover this class as a first-year so that I could've taken all the other screenwriting classes. This was probably my favorite class in all four years.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes at Yale. It was a bit out of my comfort zone, as I am not a film major, but I had an amazing experience with it. I cannot recommend this class enough.",
    "I would be happy to recommend this course to another student interested in screenwriting! This course was really interesting as far as getting to really dive into screenwriting and storytelling. However, i do wish there was more structure. While this class does equip you with the skills to develop and write a 8-12 page screenplay, it does not give you the skills to write a 100-page feature length screenplay. Considering that I have taken a class that does teach this, I believe this class's shortcomings are that there was very little attention given to structure and creating timelines, etc.",
    "Yes, but Lapadula kind of rambles on very often. Not much class discussion for the first half of the course. Also hard to get in if you're not in the major and are an underclassman. Shop it and see. Overall pretty good, 7\/10.",
    "ABSOLUTE MUST TAKE CLASS."
