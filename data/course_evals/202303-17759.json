                "I definitely learned how to think critically about not only linguistics, but other subjects in general. MMP's teaching style is definitely unique but it does make a lot of room for questions on your end and will definitely leave you curious for more answers even after class is over.",
                "In this course, we learned about the structure of language and how language lives in the mind.",
                "The first half of the course is very introductory, setting the ground for the build-up of the rest of the course's knowledge. The second half was much more what I hoped the entire course was like. I (re)learned a bunch of things about basic linguistics, that I didn't necessarily need, but I think were important for those for whom this course was the first introduction to such subjects. After that, we started investigating the role of language in cognitive processes, and development, which was very interesting, and what I thought the entire course would be like. Overall, I think I got a good grasp of some recent research in neurolinguistics, but surely not a very comprehensive one. This course is definitely an okay introduction, but you're gonna have to dive in much deeper if you actually want to learn something.",
                "I learned about various components of the language system, i.e. phonetics-phonology, morphology, semantics, syntax, etc, and the further relation between this structure and other cognitive functions, i.e. through language acquisition, heritage languages, etc.",

                "Disorganized",
                "The course has an interesting subject matter. On that note, I don't think MMP does a good job at packaging it, especially since it is a course that is marketed as an introduction or first-year course if you're interested in linguistics. I think the course could do with more structure on the teaching end. Though she did have handouts and a schedule on the syllabus, a lot of class was just MMP talking about topics and it was easy for her to get side tracked.",
                "The course material was interesting, however there exist very little resources on the internet for help.",
                "The main strength in my opinion is that the course was very well structured in the sense that even if you are a beginner in linguistics, with some hard work, you will still be able to understand what is going on because of the introductory classes. The main weakness was the difficulty of the quizzes. They were unnecessarily hard and required you to memorize so much stuff that is literally one Google search away, making so much of your course's final grade directly related to your ability to remember very specific information about minor details in the course. This ended up making most of the students in the class Credit/D it, with motivation only going down class after class.",
                "Strengths: since it's a seminar, I think this is a pretty good alternative to Intro Linguistics if you want a smaller, more student-driven introduction to the field. The professor is really willing to respond to any questions students may have, and it's exciting to hear her reflections upon current linguistics/cognitive research. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class could sometimes be disorganized and unengaging, as it could devolve into certain tangents that seemed unconnected to the material at hand. Also, it would be important for future students to know that there is a required section on Wednesdays (which isn't super obvious during registration).",
                "strengths: that you could drop an exam (including the final), the homeworks didn't take that long, the final project was fun, I did feel prepared for the exams \r\nweaknesses: prof's cold calling and oh my gosh having section. the class already meets twice a week for 75 minutes in basically a lecture format, and then there was a mandatory 50 minute section that was also basically a lecture format until we started working on our projects. it just felt unnecessary, especially since the section was not something we had to enroll in on yale course search -- she announced it to our class on the last day of add drop period."

MMP's teaching style is not beginner friendly and will put most of the pressure on the student to fill in the gaps she didn't cover in class (which was more often than not waayyy more than what was covered).",

                "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have an introduction to neurolinguistics and is willing to pay the price for it. This is DEFINITELY not your easy class. I would highly recommend thinking strongly about whether you want this to be your introduction to linguistics, but if you decide to go for it, make sure that you are ready to suffer with the quizzes, final project cramming, and sometimes hard-to-understand lectures."
