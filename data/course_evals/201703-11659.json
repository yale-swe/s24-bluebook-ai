   "comments": [
    "This taught me the basis behind laboratory techniques, not so that I am very good at them, but so I am familiar if I were to ever have to perform them again. Writing the lab report, while extremely difficult, was also a good learning exercise. I think thinking critically about the data and drawing conclusions was something I improved upon.",
    "This class was so beneficial to me because of the way it was set up. This semester consisted of two major projects, both of which were incredibly similar to types of research projects you would complete in an actual biochemistry lab. Because of this, I feel like I learned so many useful lab skills and the lab reports really helped me synthesize everything that we'd done and helped me get a feel for what writing a scientific paper would be like.",
    "Learned a bit about scientific writing and some of the context of MB&B 300 content.",
    "An amazing introductory biochemistry lab. THe course teaches you so many amazing and crucial biochemistry techniques as well as how to write lab reports. THe professors are so knowledgable, kind, and care about you learning the materials and just enjoying it overall.",
    "I learned lab techniques for biology. The skills taught are ones that are important for all labs and are highly applicable elsewhere."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class is well structured time-wise, once per week with lecture, quiz, and experimentation. However, I felt that the lab manual and what we were told to do did not line up. Also the lab report was really difficult and instructed on kind of last minute. I wish there were smaller assignments throughout the semester geared to help us build up the report.",
    "GRADE TRANSPARENCY! only received quizzes back. The course has been over for two weeks and I still don't know what my grade is, even remotely.",
    "Strengths include the sheer amount of information I was able to learn and laboratory skills I was able to master. Weaknesses include the lack of direct guidance on lab report 1 and 2. I found myself constantly reaching out to the TAs asking to clarify.",
    "The course is amazing. The only weakness may be the ending lab reports in the end as they do take a long time. I wouldn't call this a weakness though because they are similar to writing a research paper and very helpful for a career in biochemistry. This course is excellent because the professors teach you so much about biochemistry.",
    "Overall a great lab course. Everybody wants to help you succeed. The things we do in lab are really helpful for other lab work you get into. Almost everything we did in lab, I also use in my own lab. Also, they structure it in such a way that it's not just random labs each week to learn skills, all of the skills are a part of a bigger project which makes it feel more cohesive and important. My only critique is that sometimes the weekly quizzes could be pretty challenging, even if you were prepared for lab."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this lab if a student is pre-med because some med schools require a biochemistry lab.",
    "I would recommend this course because if you are wiling to put in the work, you will succeed and learn a lot. However, if the you don't start the two lab reports really early, than your in lots of trouble. For example, lab report 1 is worth 40% of your grade and I spent 9 hrs a day every day of thanksgiving break working on it. That being said, you really will learn a lot, the weekly quizzes are not hard, and the best part of all is that there is no lab practical!",
    "If you take this course, make sure you budget time for working on two lengthy lab reports. The quizzes do require a fair amount of preparation prior to lab.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who has a interest in biochemistry and just basic science. The teachers are encouraging and the experiments are semester long projects that really build well on each other.",
    "Definitely take this if you're looking for a biology lab! It's work, but not a crazy amount and TAs and professors are very helpful."
