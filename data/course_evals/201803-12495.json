    "Write your senior essay in one semester if you have a dedicated advisor who will walk through the research process and paper writing process with you in great depth. Set a schedule and deadlines (even if just self-imposed) for yourself at the start of the semester and follow it!! You don't want to be writing the entirety of your thesis at the end of the semester. Most other majors have deadlines but because poli-sci doesn't, it is important to set them for yourself.",
    "Depends on what you want to write, and the adviser you choose."
