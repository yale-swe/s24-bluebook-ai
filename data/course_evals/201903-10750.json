   "comments": [
    "I learned how to read and write, as well as how to speak in more formal settings.",
    "A greater grasp of Chinese language and culture, especially how to carry out formal conversations",
    "I developed my Chinese abilities considerably, starting from barely being able to write a character to being able to not only write but use a whole array of characters and sentences. I also further developed my study habits, as the course assigned a 1-2 hour homework assignment for every meeting.",
    "I learned Chinese speaking skills, grammar, writing, and reading. It was honestly one of the most productive and well-developed Chinese classes I have ever taken and I felt like I learned a lot.",
    "I was able to improve my speaking and writing through this course. I learned new sentence structures and vocabulary that elevated both my speaking and writing ability.",
    "Speaking and Reading skills.",
    "My Chinese genuinely improved so much as a result of this course! The workload and vocabulary was well-suited to my ability, and I learned a lot! It really boosted my own confidence in my reading, writing, and speech. A lot for the topics for the course also paired well for heritage speakers, with topics like tiger parents, Chinese holidays, and feelings regarding heritage. Theres not as much content on modern-day Chinese culture, but there is also some. All in all, this course is fantastic for learning.",
    "I learned how to read and write Chinese proficiently, and elevated my Chinese speaking level a lot. Coming into the class, I wasnt sure what to expect, but I feel like Ive learned a ton just from this one semester.",
    "I furthered my understanding of the Chinese culture and learned many language formalisms.",
    "I learned quite a bit about the difference between colloquial and written chinese. \r\nLearning how to write essays in semi-formal written chinese was invaluable.",
    "Mandarin culture and formal language.",
    "This course gave me extensive practice in reading and writing Chinese characters. Overall, I feel that I have significantly widened my Chinese vocabulary and gained a stronger understanding of Chinese grammar."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think it's great that the course isn't curved (because the levels of students in each level were so different). However, given that the teachers know that heritage students are generally not great at reading\/writing, they should test us less on vocabulary we don't learn in class or move students to lower levels despite their oral ability. I feel like the abilities of students to take tests were very different based on how much Chinese vocabulary they came in with, but they were all placed in the same level.",
    "Strengths: very relatable and relevant lesson plans. Xu laoshi really cares about your learning!!\r\nWeaknesses: textbook wasn't standardized so ppl had to make flashcards",
    "Strengths include how comprehensive the course was and how relevant most of the curriculum was (words both my parents would speak at home, and more complex phrases found in texts). Furthermore, as a first-year, the class was a great introduction to a consistent workload. Not many weaknesses.",
    "One weakness was that the class was pretty big (~15 students) and it would sometimes be difficult to get the teacher's full attention. Also, there were times when we were reviewing for the final that I felt were very rushed, so perhaps there could be some set times for reviewing for the final. Finally, there was one particular chapter (the one about politics) that was significantly harder than the rest and could perhaps be omitted from 152. \r\n\r\nI thought Professor Xu was a great teacher, very patient and attentive. She clearly cared a lot about us and our engagement.",
    "A lot of this course is centered around textbook readings and exercises, but there were a few additional materials that were incorporated from outside, such as watching a short film and listening to music. The textbook readings and exercises sometime could get very repetitive, so if there were more projects that were outside of the textbook, that could make the course more engaging. The textbook readings and exercises do help solidify the class material, and the teacher is very good at reinforcing these concepts in class.",
    "It's really memorization based, and a lot of the characters we learn seem to be niche and out of the way. We didn't even end up learning all that much about \"The Roots of Chinese Culture\"",
    "Strengths: Im so personally engaged in all the work, and theres multiple different aspects to the work to test different things; daily writing quizzes to test memory, essays to test writing ability, reading passages for reading, presentations for speech, this course has it all. Xu Laoshi is also just a fantastic instructor, which really makes this a wonderful course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes I felt that we were going a bit fast, and I didnt totally understand how to use certain words in certain contexts, but I think that ties more to how short the periods are; three 50 minute periods on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I would happily accept a longer period, because I often felt that we were on the verge of understanding more right at the end of class.",
    "I really enjoyed how the class was structured, and how interactive every class was. The textbook had interesting texts that really challenged me as a reader and writer, but all of the grammar structures and vocabulary were made very clear during class. This helped me learn the content a lot. I think one weakness of the course is how fast we move through the material. As a person who had little to no experience reading or writing Chinese, but was a native speaker, I felt like I had to put in a lot of extra work in the beginning of the semester just to follow the progression of the class. However, by the end, I though the pacing wasnt too bad.",
    "I think the course is very good - the pace was fine as was the material learned.",
    "There is a lot of character writing memorization.",
    "The curriculum felt redundant at times; I would've liked more variety in class exercises and activities.",
    "While it was nice that L5 only met 3 times a week instead of 5, the classes became too short as the lessons got harder. It didn't feel like we had enough time to truly go over and practice all of the vocab and grammar. Instead of 50 mins, maybe extend to an hour."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! Even though it was really difficult, it felt worthwhile afterwards. Chinese is a useful language and L5 is when it starts to become actually helpful to know.",
    "Yes. Regardless of how well you think you understand Chinese, this course will teach you a lot. Plus you will make a lot of close friends!!",
    "For any student looking to improve their general Chinese ability, I would recommend this course.",
    "I would! It is a significant amount of work, but it is very steadily distributed. You get used to the homework assignments. I thought it was a very rewarding class, in that the more work you put in, the more you would improve.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are able to spend time doing the work. It is not an easy class, but it will definitely improve your reading, writing, and speaking skills!",
    "I think if the student really wants to learn Chinese and isn't afraid to work a lot for the course, go for it.",
    "Yes! If youre a heritage speaker, and you want to learn Chinese, and this is the appropriate level, for sure take this course! You learn so much, and it really boosts your personal confidence in Chinese.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a native speaker who is interested in improving their reading and writing skills. It might be fast-paced, but the amount of improvement that comes out of the course is amazing.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wishes to further their Chinese ability.",
    "If they are serious about improving their Chinese, absolutely take this. The heritage learners' sequence readings center around chinese culture and questions about immigration and identity, so not only was the course tremendously helpful for my language abilities, but the content was relevant and engaging.",
    "Really only worth taking if you are planning on taking CHNS 153 as well (from a learning Mandarin perspective).",
    "Yes, this course is well-designed to give students practice in vocabulary and grammar conventions.",
    "Yes! You really improve your language skills in all aspects, and all the Chinese professors are really caring and thoughtful. While it's a hard course and it feels like there's more work because there's a quiz\/assignment due every class, that type of daily practice is really important if you want to get substanitally better."
