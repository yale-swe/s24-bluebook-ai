    "I learned so much from this course about diagnosis, treatment, legal and familial implications of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The speakers in class were insightful and fascinating.",
    "Knowledge about all areas around autism, biological, societal, psychological, and many other insights into the disease. In the course, you also write a reasonably long scientific paper about a topic of your choice about autism, which is great to practice how to write a scientific paper APA style.",
    "Learned to see a certain disorder from multiple perspectives--research, sociopolitical, and medical. Also saw specific examples about how these different areas contribute to one another",
    "I learned about Autism!",
    "I learnt a lot about various aspects of autism and related disorders such as genetics of autism, family support and autism, psychopharmacology and autism, autism and the legal system and other such topics.",
    "I learned so much in this course! Before this class, I definitely didn't know much about autism and any related disorders such as the genetics of them, symptoms, risk factors, treatment and intervention, etc. This class really expanded my knowledge on topics that are very important to be aware of.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is very much dependent on student engagement. The seminar consisted solely of students asking questions to the professor. There was very little material presented from the professor himself.",
    "The structure of the course worked well for the content; I appreciated the opportunity to ask questions in the biweekly Zoom sessions and thought the Canvas lectures were very informative. It could be useful to include more primary literature in the course readings, but the textbook readings were still very helpful.",
    "This course was well-paced, thoughtfully taught, and great care was given to ensure that we were all engaged.",
    "Weaknesses are that the lectures are unfortunately rather old (some are from 2014 still...). But to make up for that, the course brings in experts in the Zoom sessions and Prof. Volkmar and Dr. Jackson answered all questions about current challenges and insights with a lot of expertise that is probably unparalleled anywhere outside of this course. The course gives many interesting resources to read and lots of optional texts as well for all sorts of interests. The course is very appealing and very well organized.",
    "I love that we have live sessions where we can just ask questions, and then we can watch the more conventional powerpoint lectures on our own time. I also like hearing so many guest lecturers who are experts in that specific lecture topic. \r\n\r\nI think it would be even more engaging to have more guest appearances in the live sessions.",
    "Amazing class! Love Fred & Scott, such incredible lecturers.",
    "Professor Volkmar was a very nice and knowledgeable. The workload was pretty low but most of the weight was given to the final paper as there wasno midterm and just weekly response papers and participation grades.",
    "Was a great course that was super informative and engaging all at once. The material was very interesting and was presented in a very engaging manner that made the students want to learn more. The classes provided a lot of time to discuss aspects and ask questions.",
    "This class is awesome. I have hardly any complaints at all. Any weakness or difficulty really stems entirely from the new remote set up and I don't feel any of the difficulties I experienced can be attributed to the course itself or the teaching. That having been said, I think receiving more feedback on reading \/ lecture response papers would be helpful. Nonetheless, it was a great class that provides tons of resources, fascinating guest lectures, great presonalization \/ student engagement, and an in-depth look into many different autism-related topics.",
    "Strengths: professor and TF are very knowledgeable and helpful, I enjoyed the flipped classroom setup because it was a good use of the limited time in a summer course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: professor was not clear at times with emails but there was a helpful syllabus and canvas was used well. I think there I too much weight on the final paper (50%).",
    "The course material is very interesting and you do learn a lot, but I wish the recorded lecture videos are more up to date since there are growing numbers of research in the autism field from recent years.",
    "Strengths: The lectures were very informative and easily to follow. Class discussions were lively and Professor Volkmar always kept things interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The pace of the class was quite fast so it was hard to delve deep into topics I found particularly intriguing.",
    "The strength of the course is that there is a heavy emphasis placed on discussion, which fosters good questions and ideas and keeps the class engaged.",
    "The professor and TA are so personable and passionate about the topic.",
    "The lecures were extremely interesting.",
    "I believe, given that the course was all online, this was an amazing course with enough engagement and reading."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they like classes which are dependent on student engagement only. This seminar consisted solely of students asking questions to the professor. There was very little material presented from the professor himself. There is very little wrokload, 2 weekly responses and a final paper, but you still learn a good amount.",
    "Yes, this is a great course for any student interested in learning more about the history, diagnosis, and treatment of autism and related disorders. The course covers clinical, educational, and scientific concerns related to autism, so it is a great introduction for people from any academic background.",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to anyone interested in psychology, law or medicine!",
    "Definitely recommend! Knowledge about Autism (a very common disorder) can be useful for anyone, no matter what major or what background. It is not very complicated to learn about the topics around autism, but extremely interesting to know about the difficulties that people with Autism have in this world and what might cause these difficulties. Also, writing a scientific final paper on a topic of your choice relating to autism (and there are so many topics related to autism) is a lot of fun and you learn much about the topic itself and also practice how to write a good scientific paper.",
    "Take this course! It's low-stress & high-reward in terms of engagement and learning. Even if you're not planning to go into developmental psychiatry, knowing about autism is extremely important. Also, you'll learn to see a disorder through multiple lenses--scientific, cultural, ethical, etc.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! Professor Volkmar is an incredible, nice and helpful professor. The workload for this course was very low and I learned a lot of interesting material in class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student, no matter what their major is.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student who wishes to learn more about autism or even neurological disorders in general. It really helps you gain a lot of different perspectives and understand so much about current research, understanding, and methods of improving outcomes for families with an autistic child. Additionally, there is an opportunity to volunteer at various autism centers in New Haven which is really exciting. Impressive course and great teaching methods - I learned so much in 5 weeks and it was extremely engaging.",
    "Yes, but this course is very different in an online setting. Normally, students would get hands-on experience that I wish I could have gotten. However, I learned something new everyday and felt comfortable asking any questions I had.",
    "Yes! Prof. Volkmar is really knowledgeable and nice, and the TFs are dedicated. You learn a lot about ASD with a very manageable course workload.",
    "Yes, definitely if you are interested in the subject matter!",
    "Yes. Professor very knowledgeable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Addressing autism and other disorders is such an important issue in society today. Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation about autism in the public sphere and thus this class helped clear up a lot for me.",
    "Yes, this is a great course who not only wants to understand the science and pathophysiology of the disorder but also insight into other aspects such as effects on families and legal rights.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn more about autism, whether it is for personal or professional reasons. This course is a great starting off point, as it covers a broad range of topics.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, most definetely. Autism affects people and families in our society. Even if you have never interacted with someone with autism, you are most likey going to in your lifetime and it isimportant to understand what autism is.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. Given the rising issue and prevalence of autism today, this course provided the necessary background of understanding and greatly built upon that foundation. The perspectives taken from what is happening currently in research, what happens into the brain, to what happens in the family was so satisfying to learn with great detail. The discussions were also very informative and added to greater questions outside of what was being learned."
