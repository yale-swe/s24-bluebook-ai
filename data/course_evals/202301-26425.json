                "Learning about the cultural anthropology behind food in South East Asia. What drives certain cultures, castes, and genders to consume food and the politics that surrounds it. We discussed vegetarianism, street food culture, indigenous food, large corporations and GMOs, climate change, food taboos, etc.",
                "I have learnt many food-related concepts, which have helped me to explore my interests in food sustainability and food practices.",
                "I learned a ton about South Asia in general as well as food practices. Each week was extremely interesting and I learned so much about a topic I was unfamiliar with. We really see how food intersects with every aspect of life and each global issue",
                "I hadn't taken an anthropology course before, so I learned what that area of study was like. I also learned about food cultures in South Asia which is a topic that I have never learned about! I had minimal background in South Asian studies, so this course also expanded my knowledge on this region of the world.",
                "Learned a ton about the subject and developed a great appreciation for the region",
                "I learned about agriculture, food systems and issues of policy and taboo around South Asian food",

                "Strengths: extremely engaging content and material, professor that genuinely cares about the course and the students. Food is frequently bought into class to be tasted, which is a huge treat. One of the most fascinating topics to learn about, interesting speakers\r\nWeaknesses: more direction and instruction on the papers would be helpful",
                "The course was more than half presentation\/discussion based, so I would have preferred it if Prof. Kikon lectured more since she has so much knowledge. The readings\/topic was fascinating, but the organization of the class could have been better",
                "I think that the professor chose interesting readings\/videos\/movies to assign, so that was a big strength. We had student-led presentations every week which were both a strength and a weakness as it allowed us to dive deeper into the material, but we didn't get to hear as much from our professor. I think this was a missed opportunity and weakness of the course because she was an author and an anthropologist, but we only were able to hear random bits and pieces about her experiences.",
                "Strengths: professor Kikon! she is awesome, and always a delight to be around.",
                "Weaknesses are that there was too much reading"

                "I would, it is a great class to learn about food generally and within South Asia, and it's a pretty niche topic in comparison to other classes here",
                "I think I would if a student was interested in learning more about how food is an integral part of many elements of society. It was difficult to know how to succeed in this class since we received minimal feedback, but the course content was interesting and the professor was very sweet and caring.",
                "I would highly recommend it, although I don't know if it ever being taught again.",
