                "The course is very refined, and there is little room for improvement. I'd love to have more opportunities to practice speaking, but I understand it's impossible with 10 students in the class.",
                "Really well broken up! A lot of material but introduced in good chunks. Great instructor!",
                "Though this class was quite difficult for me, as I have difficulty learning languages, the strengths of the course were so high that it became one of my favorite courses. The professor was amazing at keeping students engaged and the pace of the class was extremely challenging and enjoyable. The way the material of the class was organized was also more intuitive than in any other language course I have ever taken! The conversational learning meant that even if I didn't have massive lists of vocabulary for every object I could think of, I feel like I have a solid grasp on grammar structures and am much more comfortable in conversation than I would have been a year or two into learning another language. Furthermore, the high workload meant that every aspect of the language was constantly reinforced. The individual sessions with the professor once a week meant that I could get corrections on every error I might accidentally make. This has been the most well organized and one of the most engaging courses I have taken at Yale!",
                "The only weakness for this course is the lack of organization on Canvas assignments and exams. Many homeworks and exams had technology issues, and due to some issues on the Grades section of Canvas, we could never actually see a correct grade at any time in the course. That being said, this course was filled with so many strengths. There was a huge emphasis on reading, listening, and speaking in real sentences (not just memorizing vocabulary words) which was incredibly helpful, and I couldn't have imagined so much could have been done in only three months. Li laoshi was incredibly engaging and cared deeply about every one of us, including getting on us. This class is run exceptionally well.",
                "This course was the highlight of my academic week, and was also highly educational.",
                "I wasn't a huge fan of how the assignments were spread across so many different platforms. We were using quia, canvas, the course website, the various textbooks, OWL, and had to download a lockdown browser for our final exam that we didn't use for the other exams.",
                "Strengths: moves quickly but not too quickly, covers what's most important, the emphasis is always on learning\r\n\r\nPossible weaknesses: Characters take a lot of time to learn and if you're not careful about reviewing them on your own, you'll realize that you don't remember how a character looks, or how to write it -- however, I'm guessing you'd rarely need to be able to hand-write characters in day-to-day life, so that's not so bad"

Moreover, the professor was extremely good at keeping us engaged in the content. I liked that we all had our cameras on as much as possible and, though it was difficult, the professor using the class time to cold-call on us and ask us questions kept us extremely engaged!",

I am unsure whether this is different from a normal year, but if it is I felt my handwriting is behind where it would have been. Besides this the course was perfectly transitioned into a virtual format.",

                "All of the assignments worked well when moved onto Canvas. However, I thought the testing policies were a little questionable. There was no way to tell if a student was cheating or not during an exam, including the final. Of course, it's the student's loss if they cheat, but I didn't always feel sure that everyone was testing fairly."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning both the Chinese language and Chinese culture. The classroom structure is very conducive to learning.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to any student who is serious about learning Chinese. The course gets increasingly demanding as the semester progresses, but you learn from great teachers how to speak Chinese in a way that Chinese actually speak. Writing characters and memorizing vocabulary words--these sorts of memorization and repetition exercises are left for self-study, as they should be. But having four hours a week of constant drilling with fast speech, fast comprehension, and an individual session every week cements Chinese in you, and you start to think in it, even if at a very elementary level. This course is indicative of how languages should be learned.",
                "Yes I would highly recommend this course. Despite the workload it was incredibly engaging and fun, as well as beginning to teach me an invaluable life skill.",
                "Chinese is one of Yale's strongest programs and I would highly recommend it. The course is a lot of work, but it's daily work, so it never feels like too much at once, and if you like learning Chinese, you don't even notice the high workload. In the end it was very rewarding to know how much we learned. Lots of beginning language classes can feel a little tedious, but I never felt like that was the case. All of the course material is extremely well-planned and well-paced, and you'll learn a lot of the most important Chinese grammar, vocabulary, and characters, constantly reviewing and reinforcing. Lots of people are intimidated by Chinese, but the Chinese professors make it easy and accessible for anyone. If you have ever had the desire to learn Chinese, this is the best way to do it."
