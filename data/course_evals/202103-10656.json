                "Professor Inwood is definitely a strength of the course. He explains the reading very well in a way that makes them more comprehensible.\r\n\r\nThere is a decent amount of reading, so I would not take this course if you were not prepared to do a lot of reading and rereading.",
                "Very enjoyable lectures. great TAs",
                "Strength: a lot of practice on philosophy writing. You will get good at it.\r\nWeakness: Some reading is a bit dense, especially Aristotle. Pre-Socratic philosophers are also a bit less interesting",
                "The reading needn't be so intense. The lecture material was more than sufficient, and some of the readings were absurdly difficult to understand, to the point where it felt useless to attempt.",
                "Strengths: Professor Inwood is an amazing lecturer, there isn't too much work and all the essays are fun to write and have good prompts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes discussions felt a little redundant or unproductive, but the key principles of the course are very interesting.",
                "I would appreciate it if more time, both in lecture and section, was devoted to teaching philosophical skills (how to read dense passages, efficient ways to annotate, logical/philosophical techniques), rather than just the content of the arguments and theories that each philosopher posited. Especially considering this is an intro class, I think many students would have a richer understanding of ancient philosophy if more of an emphasis was placed on philosophical skills.",
                "There's a lot of great readings, but there are a lot of readings. And having only three essays was nice, but also a little scary that three grades (and the final we were supposed to have) made up our entire grade. For me, it would have been helpful (since I am a procrastinator) if there were mandatory check-ins or progress points for the essays. Also the second and third essay were too bunched up right before the final. Moving all the essays earlier a bit would have been nice.",
                "Clear overview, at an introductory level.  \r\n\r\nCan help see connections to more developed ideas in other phil classes.\r\n\r\nLectures are very linear -- for better and worse.  Clear and understandable, but not that challenging.",
                "There were no great strengths or alarming weaknesses. It was just your typical philosophy class. I'm not the biggest fan of ancient philosophy though, so that might impact my opinion a bit.",
                "Professor is great at integrating readings into the class and you can clearly tell that he is passionate about the material. Office hours were promoted very little.",
                "No sense of context\r\nNo relationship between assessments and lectures or sections\r\nToo much variation between sections",
                "The strengths of this course were the fascinating content and the writing sections, which were really well-structured for student learning. However, the lectures were sometimes a bit dull/redundant, and we rarely got through all of the material in section, so it required a lot of catching up on our own time.",
                "Strengths: The seminars were so helpful. This is where all of the inter student discussion took place, and who your TF is will determine a lot about how this course goes. You are able to develop a close relationship with your TF as they guide you through learning how to write a philosophy paper from scratch. Lectures were very interesting, and Brad was wonderful in his ability to answer his questions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Brad's level of engagement with the students was minimal, the TFs graded all essays so the grading was not equal across all sections. Again, really make sure you have a close relationship with your TF because they will be the ones grading you on practically everything.",
                "No huge weaknesses other than the variability of TA. It seems that some groups had incredible TAs who provided a lot of handouts and review materials, and other groups had TAs who weren't quite as supportive.",
                "There was a lot of content, but low engagement in class because there were no powerpoints/few useful visuals/little time for absorbing information.",
                "I think it was very helpful to have a discussion section to engage with the material more in depth.",
                "One problem with the course is a gap between when the paper was assigned, when we were expected to begin working on it in discussion section, and then a rush to get TF feedback before submitting it. This improved after mid-semester feedback, but is worth reiterating here. The main improvement to this would be to get going on the paper faster in section so there is more time for review and editing. Also, the content is discussion section often fell well behind lecture. \r\nThis course is strong in the revisions and feedback itself, at least in the case of my TF. The lectures are consistently engaging and the reading is relevant (sometimes quite long and sometimes quite short).",
                "Sections are great especially with Jennifer, but lectures are not the most engaging",
                "The sections for this course are extremely helpful. They help condense the information presented in lecture and my TF really helped with writing papers. Since the final exam would have covered all the material, it would have been nice to have seen a midterm like it before the final.",
                "The course is interesting and the lectures are helpful in breaking down the readings. I think the reading schedule was a little confusing at times and some more clarity wouldve helped.",
                "The course should focus less on the pre-Socratics and post-Aristotelians and more on the most foundational texts.",
                "Lecture's weren't always very productive",
                "Record the lectures!",
                "Strength: fascinating texts parsed by an extremely knowledgeable professor\r\nWeakness: too much breadth, not much time for examining arguments closely",
                "strengths: content was interesting \r\nweakness: this lecture style was kind of the instructor rambling so it was very hard to follow at times",
                "At first we had a very mediocre TF, but it got a lot better once we got Jennifer. So I would make sure to say to have sections that are engaging like Jennifer did.",
                "Strengths: great TAs, interesting lectures, good instruction for paper writing\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could be a bit more engaging",
                "It felt like we spent the entire semester talking about just Plato/Socrates and Aristotle. I get that those two are pretty important, but going into a class that was supposed to introduce all of ancient philosophy, I thought we'd spend more time covering a broader range of thinkers. Also, we didn't end up taking the final exam because of covid complications, but the idea of matching passages of text to the text they came from felt like a very inept way of measuring what we took from the course.",
                "If possible, I would like a general review in terms of a written outline at the end of the term or after each philosopher. It is easy to get lost in lectures and going back to watch all lectures doesn't seem very efficient.",
                "The TA program is very strong. I do feel like theres so much content covered and only small portions are talked about is talked in lecture, understandably.",
                "There should be more instruction on how to write a philosophy essay if this is meant to be an introductory course.",
                "I liked the lecture/section structure, I think it gave a good balance of teaching styles and allowed students to learn in different environments. The scope of the class what I expected it to be, and I enjoyed the essay prompts.",
                "This course, I thought, was much too focused on the history of philosophy and science than it was in actual philosophy. The class schedule was far too skewed towards Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle, and the first two weeksgoing over a handful of minor, insubstantial philosophers I found to be a waste. Also, the readings were very disproportionate. Reading all of Plato's Republic over three classes was way to much, and it made me stop doing the readings completely for a while.",
                "The strength of this course is the discussion sections. It was a good way to engage with the material and gauge my understanding. The weaknesses are that the lectures can be a bit hard to engage with and the readings are awfully long. Sometimes its difficult to fully engage with the material and understand all of it when you have to read so much in such a short period of time. I understand that this is an introductory course, and thus theres a lot of material to get through, but maybe it would be better if the course was more focused on fewer, selected topics so that we can engage with the material better and gain a deeper understanding, rather than just superficial knowledge."

If you are not in the philosophy major, perhaps I would recommend this course, although only if you already have a strong interest in ancient philosophy. Otherwise, I think there are probably more interesting introductory philosophy courses, if you want to try out a philosophy course.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are looking for a broad introduction to the ancient philosophers. It is not particularly intriguing in any way, it is an intro course. You will learn how to read and write philosophy from scratch, so if you have taken other philosophy classes before maybe choose a more niche class. Otherwise, this class did exactly what it advertised, it was a broad introduction.",
                "If you care about ancient Greek philosophy, this course is rather good, especially under Inwood. However, if you have no care for ancient Greek  philosophy, don't conceptualize this as THE intro course. you can get started elsewhere.",

As a writing credit, it is a solid introduction to philosophy papersan enjoyably alternative to the more stereotypical English papers that allow you to focus primarily on the quality of your ideas and justification for them, instead of elegant presentation. The lectures, too, are engaging and interesting throughout the course which aligns well with the relevant reading. After taking the course, you feel confident in your understanding of the ideas of the ancient world and understand references to Plato, Aristotle, and how the hedonistic Epicureans and the 'living in accordance with nature' Stoics.",

The quality of discussions will vary, but the quality of the lectures and readings will not disappoint.",

Even waiting a semester for intro to modern is probably a more exciting and interesting way to dip your toes in the philosophical water. Of course, if classics and the ancient world are your thing, by all means take this course--you might love it. But for anyone else, just keep in mind that there are many other types of philosophy that Yale has to offer if this isn't your thing.
