                "The breadth of this course is breathtaking. Its title hardly does justice to the many stories, histories, agents, and philosophies that are included across the syllabus. As a result, I not only became deeply familiar with the nominal \"history of African American religion,\" but also with the archival, historiographical, and stylistic considerations that go into so many of the rich works that Professor Turner included in the course. From engaging with extremely local histories, to sweeping histories spanning centuries, to more creative and fictional works, I feel I have been thoroughly introduced to the diversity that this field has to offer. This is especially important to me because I was completely unfamiliar with the field, and so I am particularly grateful to have explored its many ins and outs. As a result of taking this course, I feel I have learned historical and scholarly perspectives that I can bring not only to this subject matter, but also to my scholarship that extends in very different directions from what we learned in the course.",
                "I developed a robust historical knowledge of African American religion. This includes Black American religious devotional practices, cultures, (political) theologies, philosophies, and demographics in the United States. We also gained a substantial amount of historiographical insight on how these AfAm religion has been studied and contemporarily are. We also gained a lot of practice with written and oral communication. We also had to lead class once during the semester, so we gained experience leading a room's educational path."

                "Possibly the most important part of what made this course so magnificent was Professor Turner's pedagogy. She is an incredible professor who listens carefully to her students, taking handwritten notes on what we say all semester long. She checked in with us at the beginning and end of every class, and seminar would flow naturally out of these more personal chats; as a result, there never seemed to be the pressure to be \"on,\" but rather to just be ourselves. She listens to us deeply, and is extremely supportive of our diversity of interests. Her teaching style made going to class a genuinely enriching and fulfilling experience--something I could not say for any other class I have taken so far. Reading was a pleasure because I always looked forward to speaking about the book with the class. There was no pressure to \"perform\" because we were all so comfortable working through hard texts with each other. Professor Turner used a light hand in guiding discussions, but also managed to constantly posit mind-blowing questions. These questions typically had no definitive answers; and as a result, our differences in backgrounds and opinions really shone through. She somehow catered to the entire class, which was comprised of a very diverse group of students (in terms of our respective disciplines & interests). We all became familiar with one another's views, and Professor Turner always made space in the classroom for us to mature our own perspectives.",
                "No weaknesses to the course. Everything we did/read for class had a clear, recognizable connection to African American religious history. I was very satisfied with the range and depth we gained. I was happy to discuss what religious influences Black folk brought with them from the continent. I was also happy to study \"minority\" religious demographics in class like the Nation. I also think we gained an excellent survey in the foundational scholars (historically and contemporarily) of AfAm religion. With the scholars of AfAm religion also comes the major \"camps,\" or scholarly styles. It was beneficial to critically reflect on these styles and how I will apply those reflections to my own scholarly work. The writing requirement was heavy but also meaningful and ultimately beneficial. I'm a fan of weekly reflections and a final research paper."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. In fact I already have. I would recommend this class to students in basically any humanities discipline, and not just historical ones.  The histories presented here can undoubtedly serve students across disciplinary boundaries, but it is really the rich variety of approaches and styles that makes this class particularly special. No two books were the same, despite being intimately related in their topics. All semester, I could not stop talking about how much I loved this class to my friends (and I am normally a complainer when it comes to school). If this class is not offered any longer, then I would recommend anything else Professor Turner is teaching.",
                "Yes. I think everyone who studies Black people in the US should have to take a course like this, as well as an Americanist generally. Not necessarily to contribute new information to the world of Black Religious Studies but to understand how the material bears on their own work. It's even more important for those who work in Black Religion."
