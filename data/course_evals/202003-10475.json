                "This course is a little heavy on the reading side, but very much worth it. The works we read provide an amazing grounding in art historical and philosophical questions that are crucial for understanding artistic production. The discussions lead by Professor Fiduccia are always thought-provoking and excellently guided, leading us into lines of questioning that evaluate the discipline of art history itself. Professor Fiduccia's incredible knowledge and expertise is a huge strength of the course. An improvement to the course would probably be to make the second paper slightly earlier in the semester - in the end it was quite close to the final project. I felt that it would have been slightly better to have it in the run-up to Thanksgiving break rather than at the end of it. Overall, a great class - it was nice to be able to choose which weeks we did the reading responses and presentation so we could manage the course load across the semester ourselves.",
                "Weaknesses:\r\n- The prompts for essays were very vague and it was difficult to understand what she was asking for\r\n- The number of essays required was quite excessive\r\n- The readings were very complex and not explained well in class\r\n- When anyone voiced their confusion, they were more or less ignored and others who did understand took over the conversation. Many of us were confused but felt like we couldn't speak up because our comments would be overlooked. \r\n- Sometimes Prof. Fiduccia's brilliance inhibits her from helping those of us in the class who are struggling. \r\n- The class became very theoretical and sometimes failed to connect concepts to concrete examples\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n- Prof. Fiduccia is nice and well spoken.",
                "A big strength was the small size of the class; it facilitated candid and engaging discussion. The readings are rather difficult, but I think the classes were well enough organized that we could spend enough time on each of them.",
                "Strengths: Professor Fiduccia, super cool readings that you'll want to share w\/ everyone, gives you a new outlook on the (art) world\r\nWeaknesses: Well, it's hard, but that's less of a 'weakness' and more of a truth"

                "The choice of which weeks to do the reading responses, and which week for the presentation, was really helpful. I also appreciated Professor Fiduccia's flexibility for the first paper assignment, where she asked us to find an artwork we could see in person (or, if not, find one that is entirely online). This gave me a lot more flexibility than, say, a work that we had to see in the YUAG given the remote format."

                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Though it would probably be most useful to art history or art majors, I think other students interested in the humanities, material culture, philosophy and critical methodologies would gain a lot from the class and really enjoy it in the process. Professor Fiduccia is an absolute gem of the art history department and it has been amazing to take classes with her so early in her Yale career. I think some people even in the art history major haven't quite discovered her yet, and it has been an honour and a pleasure to take these courses with her. Every single class I am blown away by her eloquence and experience in the discipline and I have a feeling that she will go on to be an integral part of art history at Yale. Amazing class and amazing professor.",
                "No, definitely not. Unless you are an art history major and have to take this, run as fast and as far away as you can. This course requires so much background knowledge and assumes a student has a solid understanding of critical theories when that is usually only the case for rich students who had access to art history as a discipline well before coming to college. The readings were overly complex and difficult to grasp, and then in class, they weren't well explained. I don't feel like I learned that much throughout this course, I just spent the entire semester trying to keep my head above water. Steer clear, friends.",
                "Although this course is a requirement for History of Art majors, I suggest non-majors steer clear. For History of Art majors - do not intend to take this course with a full plate as you will be dedicating most of your time, energy, and willpower to this course. Furthermore, pay careful attention to who is teaching the course as that may make or break you.",
                "Yes, if you like talking and writing about art, and want to learn how to do it more deliberately",
                "Well, if you're considering taking Critical Approaches, you're probably an art history major, in which case this class is a requirement, so yes, I recommend it wholeheartedly. \r\nIt seems like the course is taught by a different professor every semester, but if you have the opportunity to take Critical Approaches (or any course) w\/ Professor Fiduccia, please jump at the chance. She is a fantastic instructor in every way, and while her standards tend to be high, I guarantee you will be a better writer (and aspiring art historian) by the end."
