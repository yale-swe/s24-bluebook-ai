I had a great time learning about (and helping to develop) their new framework of presupposition and more. I learned about how language has all these facets that I had never considered before and learned how to engage and discuss these topics which are so very relevant in an age of Russian politics and American politics that are so complicated and/or dastardly. Also got help on writing my first philosophy papers ever which was great !",

                "Prof. Stanley is a very helpful great guy who always keeps class interesting. I enjoyed all of our discussions which have inspired much more further study in the field. I would say my only change would be to have a more set-in-stone plan for the syllabus and assignments, but I understood that we progressed based on what we needed to discuss, so I don't think that hurt us at all. It just leaves a little bit of uncertainty in the students' mind, but it did in fact work out just fine! This class is super relevant to the real world which I loved about it since it was very academic but also super relevant. Very accommodating to students of all academic disciplines.",

I had little phil of lang experience (meaning actually none except for an intro logic course and a racism course), and I had a wonderful experience in the class. Since we were discussing an entirely new framework (from the ground up) it wasn't too hard for me to hop right into the debate with everyone else. Really applicable and great stuff for the state of affairs in politics that we have. You also don't get dogged with useless assignments which is great too.",
