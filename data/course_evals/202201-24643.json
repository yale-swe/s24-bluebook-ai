                "This was one of my favorite classes that I've taken at Yale. I went from having to google \"who is Bashar al Asaad?\" in the first class to feeling confident in my understanding on the four conflicts discussed in class. It was especially nice to learn more about Iraq and Afghanistan because I was so young during the height of those conflicts that I didn't have much understanding of the geopolitical implications of those wars. This class helped me feel more aware of the crises  and human rights violations unfolding in the middle east. I would leave class with my head buzzing and usually ended up calling a friend or family member to discuss and digest what I'd just learned.",
                "Lots about the humanitarian dimensions of current conflicts in the Middle East",
                "Learned a ton from truly amazing professor",
                "This class was a very large seminar, but mostly taught via lecture. I think this class could provide people without previous exposure to the Middle East a baseline. I appreciated the diverse perspectives from the other students and wish I could have heard from them more.",
                "I learned about the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Yemen and similarities and differences between them.",
                "Broad knowledge in 4 conflicts of the Middle East",
                "I learned so much about the background and humanitarian aspects of these four conflicts. I never had the opportunity in the past to spend time actually learning the details and context of conflicts in the Middle East, and this class gave me ample opportunity to pursue my interests."

            "comments": [
                "Amazing professor, a lot of time spent on student presentations meant not as much on class content",
                "This class should have been half the size it was. There were simply too many students to have a good seminar conversation, and so it ended up mostly as a lecture. I wish there had been some standard Middle East studies books included in the syllabus. I think students could have benefited from reading chapters from books like Barfield's \"Afghanistan: A Cultural and Political History\", Rachid's \"Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia\", Hinnebusch and Ehteshami \"The Foreign Policy of Middle East States\", etc., just as a few examples. I felt like a lot of students had strong personal backgrounds which was great, but then a number of students had no real academic background in the Middle East. \r\n\r\nThe guest speakers brought in were quite controversial, especially Peter Galbraith -- who profited between $50-70 million off Norwegian oil interests while claiming to be a disinterested expert on Kurdistan during negotiations -- and Graeme Wood -- whose article \"What ISIS really wants\" is a notorious example of mainstream Islamophobia that I have focused on in other classes. I think it's fine to hear their voices, but I would have really gained a lot from an evaluation of their vantage points with these controversies providing nuance. \r\n\r\nFor strengths, I definitely think the diverse voices and perspectives of especially Arab students enriched the class. They provided unique insights an helped other students understand better what it is like for Arab and Muslim people working in foreign policy.",
                "Really good class, would recommend adding broad contextualizing readings to the syllabus.",
                "Strengths: Janine is an amazing instructor with lots of practical knowledge, the guest speakers are also fantastic.",
                "I wish that Professor di Giovanni had used a different, more engaging style to teach us about the context of the conflicts (rather than just PowerPoints). However, I enjoyed hearing from her perspective and her unique experiences, and she is the perfect person to be teaching this course."

                "Yes 100%! Very interesting course and Janine is awesome",
                "I would recommend this class if you have an interest in learning about the conflicts in the Middle East from a humanitarian perspective, no matter what your background is in regard to the topic. The class offers a lot of flexibility and you are able to do a lot of research on your own and choose what it is that you want to hone in on for your final project."
