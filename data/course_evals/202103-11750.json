Weaknesses include a somewhat fast pace at the beginning.",

I thoroughly enjoyed how our class discussions were structured and found class to be invigorating. I really enjoyed listening to my classmates' perspectives, analyzing different texts, and engaging in discourse and meaningful research. I wouldn't change anything about this course.",

                "This course was very insightful and had a lot of interesting and different texts that really changed my understanding of nostalgia. The only weakness is that sometimes the texts were extremely hard to understand, but these texts were usually thoroughly explained in class.",
                "I really liked the small, seminar-sized class size for this course. It allowed everyone to participate during class and I feel like we were able to effectively give feedback to each other. There were no noticeable weaknesses to this course. It was, overall, very organized and the pace did not feel too fast or too slow.",
                "Receiving feedback on my writing was useful and helped me to improve. I also enjoyed the various texts we read. Sometimes the topic and discussion in class became repetitive.",
                "The course was very organized and I enjoyed the readings very much. Although they were difficult, many of them were interesting and contributed to productive discussions.",
                "The strengths was the ample support and resources provided throughout the course like the workshops and library visits which were helpful. A weakness could be the fast pace of writing assignments in the beginning of the year in which papers were due back to back."

This course asks students to write for different purposes which will definitely come in handy in the future. The content, at least for this section, was very engaging and I really liked attending classes.",
