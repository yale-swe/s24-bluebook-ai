                "No major weaknesses. The course has two main strengths: the subject material (you read seminal authors like Plato, Lincoln and Robert penn warren), and the prof. Bryan Garsten is one of a kind. Wonderfully kind and great at leading discussion.",
                "Strengths: Professor Garsten is so smart and thought-provoking\r\nWeaknesses: the readings were a bit unequal - some weeks were very short, other times we had a 300 page book",
                "Strengths: I really like the way that Professor Garsten teaches and I feel that I learned a lot from him and the readings. I also really like the assignments. I felt that they were fair and enjoyable to do. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was very hard for me to participate in class because I did not enjoy the dynamic of the people in my seminar as it felt like everyone in there had done DS and would speak about political philosophers who were out of the scope of our class which made it difficult to chime in about. It felt like the class was meant for a certain type of student and was very hard to feel like I was not an imposter during discussions even though I had comments that I wanted to share, I was intimidated. Also, at times, the reading load was way too heavy to reasonably get done in a week.",
                "Great class! I personally enjoyed the earlier parts of the course bi more, where we discussed works by Plato, Hobbes, Weber, etc. Still, the later conversations about the media\/social media were very interesting too."

For instance if someone had done DS or was very familiar with political philosophy I would recommend this. \r\nI was trying to get out of my comfort zone of courses by taking this course and I struggled with imposter syndrome frequently throughout so I would not recommend this course to someone who thinks that may happen to them.",

However, the small size of the class and Professor Garsten's excellent ability to guide the discussion meant that even when we were not directly discussing the texts (which were well-selected), the issues brought up were very relevant and meaningful."
