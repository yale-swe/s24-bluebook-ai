    "Not enough class discussion. A seven-student seminar that lasts two and a half hours needs more actual debate and discussion, even over Zoom.",
    "Strength is the variety of topics covered. Weakness is it can be more organized with fewer written assignments, and classes can be better prepared.",
    "Good discussions, although it would have been good to have more student to student interaction",
    "Very knowledge and passionate professor. \r\n\r\nThere should be more discussions, debates and other ways of participation in class",
    "Strengths: Engaging lectures - Prof. Mahon is incredibly knowledgeable and charismatic. The readings were all easy to digest and the authors chosen brought traditional and contemporary points of views."

   "comments": [
    "The readings are fascinating, and although the subject is somewhat dry from a philosophical perspective, it has applications outside of academia. The class itself is boring, which is the biggest problem. Unless you're really interested in the topic, I would not recommend this course.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in ethics and reading so many papers on lies and deception, take this class.",
    "It's a good philosophy course that doesnt get bogged down in semantics and allows you to get to the meat of issues.",
    "Yes, it is a great course for people interested in the philosophy behind deception and lying. Deception plays a huge role in other aspects of society like politics, economics and more.",
    "Definitely! Take the class if you've never gotten into political philosophy (and even if you have)."
