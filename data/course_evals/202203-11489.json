                "I gained a greater understanding of game theory terms and game theory optimal solutions to problems. We also talk about different negotiation tactics that range from being \"fair\" to being exploitative. For a few negotiations you had to build a very simple Excel model which was a skill many people developed in the course. You also had to write a negotiation report, which helped me learn to write concise insights from each negotiation. I gained confidence in this class and tangible negotiation skills that will stick with me as I leave college.",

                "I have not taken a class at Yale that taught me more skills than this class. I learned about negotiation tactics, from emotional triggers to rational strategies. I learned how to read a balance sheet and how to model finances. I got practical experience with negotiations: preparing for them, conducting them, reflecting on them after.",
                "I learned about how to negotiate with other parties, and more importantly, the importance of preparation. By understanding your own BATNA, trying to determine the other party's incentives, and working out a deal that both parties like, it is possible to reach and integrative deal. Anchoring and trust are also super influential on the outcome of a deal.",
                "The best class I've taken at Yale. Dan becomes a prof and friend.",
                "Through a series of fun negotiations, I've learned the tools to become a better negotiator and found the best negotiating style for me. I've learned tactics for each type of negotiation (distributive vs. integrative) and things I should always keep in mind to base my quantitative decision-making.",
                "I learned actionable strategies for trust building, negotiation and preparing for negotiation.",
                "I now have negotiation skills! I know which negotiation techniques to apply to which situations and feel confident using all the skills I practiced during class. Before this class, I was very hesitant and afraid of negotiations. I also have a more thorough understanding of the world of business.",

                "I learned about negotiation tactics and learned a lot about real-world negotiations, often from the professionals who negotiated them. I also grew to become much better at reading individuals, reading situations, doing math, and making spreadsheets. Beyond the skills and the space he allows for us to practice them, I learned a lot about a broad range of industries (professional sports, sports betting/casinos, music festivals).",
                "I learned the principles of game theory including how to approach developing a strategy. I also learned many psychological and game theory based techniques for negotiation. I also learned about a number of real world negotiations and how negotiation functions in a number of different industries. I firmly believe that I learned more from this class than any other class at Yale.",

                "Strengths: gain tangible negotiation and modeling skills; you're asked to reflect on your personal strengths, weaknesses, and goals; learn to be okay with public failure and success; manageable workload; very fun assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many at all! At times the course can be a bit overwhelming due to the level of engagement it requires. But if you buy-in, the few overwhelming days are well worth it.",
                "The class was fantastic over all. The only weakness was that canvas was confusing for some of the quick turnarounds from assignment to assignment.",
                "Biggest strength are the creative negotiations that guarantee real-world experience.",
                "This course goes from strength to strength: learning important, practical things; interesting speakers; the best professor. No weaknesses.",
                "The different games/case studies that we played throughout the weeks are a strength of the course. Through the process, I was able to meet many of my classmates while also practicing negotiations. I think it would be interesting if we didn't spend all of the class debriefing on the results of the previous case study. Perhaps we could have a little bit more structured learning within the classroom (instead of just having different reading response groups haphazardly share). Although we heard about a lot of concepts, they seem to be random and a bit disorganized (at least in my head).",
                "I loved the class and didn't see any weaknesses in particular. Still, one should remember that negotiations typically require arranging 1-2 meetings in 4-5 days with counterparties outside the classroom time and a good level of preparation. On the other hand, you get to know many great students who are also taking the class on a personal level since paired negotiations require great collaboration. The course allows you to experiment with theoretical concepts learned in class and lose, find what works and doesn't, and learn from your mistakes before negotiating in real life. You get used to the competition under pressure with tight deadlines and little time for preparation, which is often the case in real life,  with fulfilling outcomes at all times, either in the form of winning or reflecting on your mistakes in the negotiation report that complements each negotiation. \r\nProf. Singer is an entertaining and engaging professor. Dan always stayed in touch and was eager to meet in person to talk about all sorts of things, from expanding on the concepts learned in class to giving life advice. Overall, the seminar created a comfortable environment for growth as an individual.",
                "The hardest part of the class is time. Sometimes I felt like there wasnt enough time to unpack negotiations. Other times, I wish we could do live games in class more. Or even talk to the speakers for longer. Its a good problem to have since every part of the class is really engaging. I kinda botched some of the later negotiations; I think these were a little too difficult to parse, but this could also be on me.",
                "This course is truly amazing -- it not only teaches you about negotiations and negotiation tactics from various schools of thought, but it also allows you to actually ~practice~ those tactics. This hands-on learning is a huge strength of the course. Other strengths are Prof. Singer's style, the supportive class environment, and the high-profile guest speakers.",
                "The biggest strength is Dan and the atmosphere he creates in class. I looked forward to class each week, found discussions with industry professionals to be really interesting and memorable, and bonded with the group. The industry professionals he brings are, on the whole, very, very cool. The readings are all very informative, simple, sometimes entertaining. The workload is extremely manageable.",
                "This course is perfectly designed to give students practical, hands-on experience with different types of negotiations.",
                "strengths- the professor!! Dan is absolutely incredible and makes the class a truly enjoyable learning experience",
                "This course is well-organized and filled with fun negotiations followed by insightful feedback. The professor and the speakers share invaluable industry experiences relevant to the course topics. The final paper offered students with great flexibility to write about interesting and passionate topics. Though the course could be even better if students could better learn how to build the models within the final negotiations, this course is exceptionally fascinating, fun, and filled with insights."

                "This is one of the best, most unique courses at Yale. I particularly appreciate this course because it is atypical of most yale courses - your homework is negotiating with your peers and writing about it! On the surface it seems like this course may only be applicable to \"business people,\" but the skills/tactics learned are applicable to everyone. For example, you will learn tactics to help with salary negotiations, buying a car, and everyday conversations with friends and coworkers. It's also just fun! Dan is incredible - he wants you to succeed and is incredibly approachable. I also admire how he creates an environment where failing is inevitable and okay!",
                "Yes. This is a fantastic negotiation seminar. The guest speakers are awesome. This is a class you will talk about for the rest of your life.",
                "Totally! Best class I ever took. Gives you a good sense of business school classes.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone even remotely interested in business or negotiations. Dan is amazing, first of all, and really cares about his students. You learn a ton of important things that feel immediately applicable. It's also just a boatload of fun to negotiate with your classmates. This has been one of my very favorite classes at Yale.",
                "YES! Take this course for the experience and opportunity to work on your negotiation skills in a safe setting. Dan is an excellent teacher and always has fascinating stories and insights. If you have any interest in game theory, negotiations, or sports, definitely take this class.",
                "Yes, however, grading is clear.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to other students. The best class I've taken at Yale as a junior.",
                "10000%. Its one of those classes. Its just one of them. Its one of them where youre hanging on to every word and you want to put it a lot of your heart into. On top of that you walk away with real bonds with the other students and professor (any class where you have to exchange phone numbers is elite).",
                "Yes, strongly recommend!! This is the best class I have taken at Yale. It is such a practical class and you leave with important skills you will take on to your career and personal life. The class is fun and allows everyone to succeed.",
                "Absolutely, Game Theory in Action is a super valuable and engaging class with activities that provide important lessons for real world negotiations and business. The negotiations can be stressful but are not nearly as stressful as I anticipated and are generally quite fun and insightful.",
                "Absolutely, it is a lot of fun! There will be more work than it seems just because you have to do a bit of negotiating outside of class.",
                "Cannot recommend more. Easily the best class I have taken at Yale",
                "If you are admitted and given a spot in this course, youd be a fool not to take it. \r\n\r\nYou will learn a lot. You will have fun. You will improve as a negotiator, a skill that people of any profession need in some way. Given the structure and environment of the class, you will likely make friends (or adversaries, if you're unwise). \r\n\r\nThe class does have quantitative and modeling components. You will have to build spreadsheets to do well. But if this scares you, DO NOT FEAR. I hadnt done any real math since 2016 and had never built a spreadsheet with equations, but I ended up loving the class, in large part because Dan and Annie are very strong resources and you can learn a lot from them with just a little bit of effort. If you find yourself in a classroom full of consulting kids and you feel intimidated, you really, really should not be. And if you are a consulting kid in the class, with high fluency with spreadsheets, youll still have a lot to learn. So much of the work we did was about having a personality and fluency with people, not exclusively with numbers. \r\n\r\nIn short, the class is well-designed for any type of engaged student to thrive and learn a lot. Do the readings (they are very light), commit yourself to meeting with the TA or Dan from time to time, and encourage yourself to grow in some way -- you will enjoy the class very much.",
                "I have already recommended this course to many other students. I learned a lot from the class, the professor is amazing, and the whole experience was very fun.",
                "YES TAKE IT",
