                "The course material, overall, was very interesting and fun. Most of the vocabulary and grammar was helpful for learning Chinese, and the textbook was helpful. The pace we learned the characters at was sometimes too fast for me, as I often found myself behind on memorizing characters.",
                "Strengths: Chinese acquisition.\r\nWeaknesses: Hard to stay focused 5 days a week over zoom.",
                "The class is, while hard, very interesting. Learning Chinese in that class is a very rewarding process. The instructors know it is hard but rewarding so they in turn are very encouraging. The workload for the course is heavy but necessary to get a deeper understanding of the language and its mechanics.",
                "Strengths: daily classes, phenomenal instructors, good homeworks... basically everything\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none? perhaps a bit more turned-in writing practice (but I think this change was due to covid only)",
                "Strengths: So well-organized, with many opportunities to practice different elements of the language. Probably one of the best ways to learn Chinese in the entire world.\r\nWeaknesses: Some lessons were much more difficult than others. The early lessons in the first half were quite difficult, and completed with rapid pace. In contrast, later lessons were far easier and completed in a similar time frame.",
                "The course is intensive, you need to study every day! But this means you learn more Chinese than you think possible in a semester, so it's a definite strength. The only weakness is the one-on-one tutorial. It's the only time to have live conversation practice, but too often they just turn into prepared answers and responses that don't practice live use of the language. Other than that though, the course was a really well-organized language class."
