                "The accelerated nature of this course allowed me to study a broad selection of Hallyu cultural products. However, our class was not able to go over every single aspect of Hallyu because of time constraints. That being said, I feel that Mr. Kwon's selections of weekly discussion topics was still engaging. Moreover, I really appreciate all of the guest speakers Mr. Kwon was able to invite because their expertise helped to shed more light on a certain week's topic. Finally because many of us do not come from an East Asian Studies background, I would suggest recommending that future students read one of the books on Korean history that Mr. Kwon recommended. I think the time spent introducing the history in class could have been more productively spent on discussing that week's topic in more depth.",
