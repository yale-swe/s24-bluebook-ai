                "I became a much better reader, writer, and speaker in Spanish. Profesora Trtora has set up the class with several writing assignments, all with a multi-step revision process, so students can receive feedback on their work and improve their writing skills. She also assigns many great readings and gives great lectures about Latin American and Spanish history and culture. I learned so much from this excellent course.",
                "I learned a lot about both writing and reading in Spanish, including formal letters, argumentative essays, poetry, short stories, and other pieces of creative writing. It was great to read famous examples of each type of writing before learning how to write them for ourselves. I also got much better at editing and critiquing my writing and my peers work, too.",

                "Lots of good information but would have loved more immediate feedback and more specific, hands-on teaching of writing techniques or grammatical structures.",
                "Strengths: Good variety of assignments and readings, helpful peer review processes, fun projects \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: For peer review, it could be helpful to mix up the pairs/groups so that we get to read more classmates writing.",
                "I really appreciated the built-in draft assignments. I have always struggled to keep myself from procrastinating, but my work is always so much better when I take time to let work sit and then revisit. This is an integral part of the course. I didn't always feel that I got written feedback/grades from Profesora super quickly, but it was an intense semester for everyone so I completely understand. If I had sought out feedback in office hours/via email she would have provided, for sure!",
                "This course was very engaging and demanding, which helped to facilitate learning and growth beyond your comfort zone. The weekly journal on top of the homework assignments was a lot to do, but I think it was beneficial for furthering writing proficiency. In addition, sometimes the homework would ask us to read too many articles or short stories, which was unfeasible with the amount of other homework I had. The teacher, however, was very kind and understanding in all situations.",
                "Such an amazing professor. Profe is really passionate about Spanish and teaching and it shows.",
                "Pros: Welcoming atmosphere and interesting readings. Lots of between-student engagement can be a plus if that's your thing\r\n\r\nCons: could be a bit more challenging and rigorous, I think?",
                "The strengths of this course are that it is a very low workload for an L5 class. So if you want an easy class (~200 words of writing a week), it's great. However a weakness is that there is very little feedback or engagement with the professor, little practice with oral discussions, and it feels as though your Spanish language skills are not improving through the class."

Profesora Trtora also shows more consideration and attentiveness to students than any professor I've had at Yale. She brings energy, good spirits, and humor to every class and makes the class truly a community, inviting everyone to get to know each other.",

                "Absolutely! This would be a wonderful class for someone interested in continuing with L5 Spanish at Yale but hoping to improve writing skills before diving into something more intensive content-wise.",
                "Yes, I would totally recommend this class to another student. I think it was very good for me to keep my Spanish skills up and sharpen them as well.",
                "Yes because the professor is so caring and intelligent",
                "Yes, I would recommend to any student looking to strengthen their Spanish writing, but also their communication skills. I learned so much from Professor Tortora and would highly recommend!",
                "yes, but only if you have a strong foundation in writing to begin with, as the course seemed to me to be more so about practicing preexisting writing skills than about TEACHING you to write.",
                "No. The class is not challenging and did not enable me to grow in my Spanish. Additionally, images and narratives of Hispanic death and trauma are consumed without any critical analysis. It is traumatic to spend so much time reading over this material and looking at the images without any discussion of why these harms exist."
