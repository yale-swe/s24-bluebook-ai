I was able to connect data and topics from RIP and seminar series lectures with further concepts in immunology and felt confident in understanding from this course to think creatively and ponder gaps or open questions in the field.",

                "Strengths in this class included the curriculum's structure, which allowed you to integrate knowledge within a section more fully and apply it to future content. I enjoyed the discussion sections each week that reviewed key content as well.\r\n\r\nI do not see any weaknesses in this course. If you are interested in immunology, please take this! It's amazing to have so many different faculty presenting on what they study and pioneer knowledge in - as well as to get a taste of the work being done in the Department of Immunobiology.",
                "I think it's a great summary of Immunology and it's really nice that each lecture or so is a different professor to provide students with some change. While this is net good, I do think this can be hard for the TFs at times because there wasn't any \"standardized\" components for any of the lectures - this made it challenging to study and I'm sure was frustrating for the teaching staff who often times had to adjust or cut lectures from exams/homework due to the confusion.",
                "There could be more cohesiveness between the lecturers and more exam time. The TA sessions were great.",
                "I loved the discussion sections, I found them to be very helpful. I think the class was a little too high level at times, but I have also never taken immunology before and was expecting more of an introductory course.",
                "none",
                "Strengths: Good concept of trying to fit in material necessary for a PhD student to succeed immunology.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures not always clear in preparing for exams, TA sessions highly variable by teacher, and exams are not always representative of focused topics during course. Not well suited for undergraduates to take.",
                "The course felt incredibly disjointed. Lecturers would often cover the same information multiple times and what we learned in lecture was often not covered on the exam. I regularly attended lectures, but it would often feel like a waste of my time due to covering the same material multiple times and knowing that much of the information from the lectures would not be seen on an exam.",
                "Something that can be improved is having the lecture slides uploaded promptly. Some of the slides for a few classes were never uploaded.",
                "Strengths: Each PI adeptly presents a topic within their expertise, enabling them to simplify complex information into basic concepts while incorporating essential details.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: For this academic year, it was my impression that the TAs held more influence over the exams than the PIs, although this might be a subjective observation. Despite PIs stating that knowledge of XYZ was unnecessary, the TAs overloaded evening sessions with precisely those XYZ details. Furthermore, although the last exam was declared non-cumulative, some questions were distinctly focused on details from the initial module, which were not revisited in the third module. More transparency about this discrepancy would have been appreciated, and additional time to review modules 1 and 2 for the last exam (held just two days after the final lecture) would have been beneficial. Perhaps scheduling the third exam after the reading period could have provided more preparation time.",
                "I liked the way the modules were set up to teach the material. I really enjoyed the final module that focused more on conceptual learning.",
                "A huge strength of this course was that it was able to cover so much information but be able to connect the topics and lectures to a wider concept and to each other. Having PIs with expertise in the field give lectures was fantastic as well. I feel this course could be improved by having the PIs giving the lecture have a bit more guidance on what needs to be covered. There were a few occasions where the lecturer didn't cover the material that would be on the exam and the TA session would have to cover it instead. This was fine but I feel it would be much more efficient and interesting if the topic had been covered in the lecture and the TA session could just be a review. Also, the amount of material covered in the exams felt very inconsistent. For instance, the first exam was pretty light but then the second one covered all of B and T cell development, signaling, effector functions, activation, etc. I feel that this could be improved by having maybe an extra exam added (break up the second exam material into two exams) or add material from the second exam into the first or third exam.",
                "Strength: all the faculty members are very professional and nice.\r\nWeakness: The exams are too close to the last lecture of each module.",
                "Course organization could be improved because some lectures focused on the textbook chapters listed, whereas some didnt and instead used research and review papers. Content was good, but it was a lot of information, and it could make it hard to know what to focus on studying. \r\n\r\nExam grading could also be modified. According to the TAs, they were grading the short answer and essay questions strictly based on what was written on the answer keys. But what could happen was students could get points off for writing the right things because their answers were not specific enough. Points could also be taken off for not writing something mentioned in the answer key. And it could be difficult to know how much details to put down or exactly how they wanted the question to be answered for certain types of questions"
