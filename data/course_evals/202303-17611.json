                "I gained a greater understanding and appreciation for the diversity of Native American history, culture and presence throughout America at tribal, regional and state levels. I feel a greater need, and understand the importance, of reframing American history within the Native American perspective that gives necessary context to a truer version of history.",
                "Learned about the importance of perspective with regard to American History, as well as aspects of 20th- and 21st-century Native American history which I had not been exposed to in other history classes.",
                "I learned about various methods of telling tribal histories in both institutional, public, and private settings and their ethical considerations. We studied the Red Power Movement through a book titled \"Like a Hurricane\" which gave a great overview of the issues both Urban Natives and reservations faced throughout the 60's and 70's. It helped for those who had not had much education of Indigenous history, laws, and protest in the United States. We then read a selection of other books that document the histories of tribal nations, some on a personal and poetic level like \"The Way to Rainy Mountain.\" We also studied institutional museums' exhibits on Native Americans and discourse throughout museum studies on these exhibitions. We also took trips to see Yale's expansive collections of Native American papers, art, and photography and discussed depictions. I learned so much in this class that it is hard to even distill it down to a paragraph. There is so much the education system does not teach about Tribal Nations in the US - the legal battles, racism, discrimination, representation, protest, art, philosophy... This class helped to fill in some of those gaps. The final project was an opportunity to dive deeper into something you are passionate about, which was fantastic. This class honestly changed the way I see the world and I am a better person because I took this class."

                "Each weekly reading in this class was meaningful and engaging, along with each student-led conversation. However, these conversations often lost momentum over the course of two hours and could be facilitated differently to maximize engagement. Maybe this could look like increasing the number of presenters on book presentation days so more students are held accountable for bringing in topics of conversation and perspectives on that day's book.",
                "Strengths: exploring history through texts in a way that encouraged deep thinking, creativity, and interacting with history in new ways\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the course had focused more on specific events in 20th and 21st century Native American History like the occupation at Alcatraz and Wounded Knee. Exploring perspectives, shifting attitudes, and ideologies were certainly important, but I would have liked to learn more about concrete historical moments and turning points.",
                "A major strength of this course is Professor Blackhawk. He chose helpful and insightful readings, was very accessible through email and office hours, and supportive through many complex discussions about race and privilege that could sometimes be awkward. He made the classroom a safe space and encouraged open discussion, making everyone feel welcome. He even hosted a class from his home in New Haven and brought us all breakfast. This was so above and beyond the treatment of most professors at Yale and he took extra steps to ensure that we felt we could come to him to ask questions and discuss anything further. This class pairs so well with Yale's collections and it was well integrated into the course. We took visits to the Beinecke and YUAG and learned about how to use these collections for research, but it was also incredible to see up close the things we were studying in class. I truly loved every moment of this class and there is nothing I would change."

                "I would recommend this class to anyone, especially those who are interested in history and law. Understanding the evolution of American history and policy from the Native American perspective is important to understanding a fuller, more accurate picture of history and the truth. Each weekly reading was engaging, calling attention to different Native American cultures, ways of being, struggles, and histories that highlight the diversity of Indian Country and its place within America.",
                "Yes! Incredibly important subject matter, and even more important to engage in discussions that help enrich your understanding of it.",
                "This class is one of the best at Yale and I believe everyone should take a Native Studies course, particularly if you're in a field that relates like ER&M, American Studies, Linguistics, History, etc. Professor Blackhawk is amazing and supportive. You will leave this class with a deeper understanding of Native American histories, depictions, ethical considerations, and more - something many people don't know anything about due to a lack of accurate teaching or no teaching at all on the subject in the elementary, middle and high school education system. You have an opportunity to write a project at the end on a subject that interests you and it is rewarding research. It is a lot of work to read all the books and do the final project. Depending on what you choose you might spend most of your time the final month of classes doing this project, but it is all well worth it."
