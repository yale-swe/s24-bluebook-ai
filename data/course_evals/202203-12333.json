                "I learned more about the brain, memory systems, and the use of memory in American culture.",
                "This course taught me a lot about memory from both a psychological and literary perspective. It was more psych and philosophy heavy than English, but it was interesting. The videos in class were great and the visiting artist was a wonderful addition too.",
                "Lots of fascinating insights into how memory scientifically works, and how it is represented and explored in philosophy, films, and novels",
                "I learned about memory from both a scientific perspective and a literary perspective. It was so interesting getting to dive so deeply into a particular subject, and I absolutely fell in love with memory from this class.",
                "A lot of different insights and opinions about memory",
                "I learned about how memory works (to the extent that psychology has been able to glean so far), different exemplary cases of amnesia, and several speculative theories about the role of memory in philosophy. I wish we had been able to focus in on any given topic to derive more insightful conclusions about each object or subject, but as is I gathered a vague web of thoughts about memory which I suppose I will need to fill in slowly in future courses and thought.",
                "Understanding of memory from multiple angles",
                "This course was an exploration of memory through a variety of mediums literature, films, art, scientific research, philosophy. This course gave me a variety of perspectives through which to understand memory and news ways to incorporate memory into my own writing.",
                "I learned a lot about the different aspects of memory and its impact on individuals and culture, as well as its biological processes. I also learned a lot about researching for longer papers and how to create useful, comprehensive annotated bibliographies."

            "comments": [
                "This course was honestly a mess. Great professors individually but not well synced. Kept changing deadlines on us last minute...",
                "While the concept of this course had so much potential, it was somewhat disorganized, scattered, and inconsistent. We did not always discuss the assigned readings, many of the assignments on the syllabus were vague, and the grade distribution was not clearly communicated. Although I did learn a lot from this course, it could be strengthened after feedback since this was the first time it was taught.",
                "Strengths: Visiting artist, videos super interesting, interactive memory psych study, accessible via zoom if sick, readings were easy to find. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: assignments weren't always clear (word count, pages, etc. wasn't posted anywhere), the syllabus was misleading when it came to the quiz\/in class response portion, as we only ever had one in class grade and it was on a psych study, only one paragraph response, sometimes class discussion felt one way and a lot of hearing John and Sam exchange their thoughts but not a lot of student participation or student led discussion. It would also be helpful to have access to the class slides on canvas. It would also be helpful for the professor office hours and contact information to be somewhere on canvas, as it was nowhere to be found. The course would really benefit from a good detailed syllabus.",
                "Strengths: the readings for each class were awesome and thought-provoking. Weaknesses: the seminar became more of a lecture format because it was a kind of large class, but the lectures themselves didn't explore a whole lot more from what we had already read for the class",
                "This class was great. I think my only complaint would be that there was slightly too much lecturing and not enough discussion, potentially because the class was a little large for a seminar. It also really annoyed me that about half of the class was always on their laptops working and would never pay attention or participate in discussion. I think a no electronics classroom would have been better.",
                "Strengths - good discussions, a lot of breadth of material\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes disconnected",
                "Fascinating topic, but because the course attempted to be so interdisciplinary and it only met once a week, the discussions seemed fairly unfocused and lacked cohesivity week-to-week. The class size was too large for everyone to have the opportunity to engage, and the result was often a pseudo-lecture with occasional student comments. As lectures, the material was interesting (sparking a lot of sources of discussion and engagement) but again lacked narrative focus, neither building on top of previous discussions nor generating novel insights. One gets the impression that this course would do better as either a pure lecture series, a pure seminar, or one which explicitly alternated week to week rather than trying to divide focus and failing to integrate disciplines.\r\n\r\nWhile I fully understand the reasoning behind the \"late acceptances but no feedback\" policy, it seems counterproductive to me as--with such a large class-essay comments are one of the only ways for students to receive feedback or directly engage with the course, and having to dispense with this essential academic process because of even excused extensions does not seem like a productive compromise, as lenient as it appears.",
                "It was interesting to look at memory from two sets of disciplines, but the course didnt connect the two together as much as Id hoped, and it also leaned much more on the English side than the Psych side",
                "The primary strength of this class was the combination of two professors from very different fields coming together to co-teach. My favorite parts of the class were when one professor was leading the seminar, and the other was asking questions, acting as a student as eager to learn as we were. Hearing the different perspectives from which the professors approached the same topic added so much to the class. The course had a lot of great variety from films to literature to scientific articles to visits from artists, so the class never grew monotonous and served a lot of different interests. The talks from visiting artists were highlights.\r\n\r\nThe primary weakness of the class was that it felt a bit disorganized at moments. We often didn't get to everything we had prepared for a class which was frustrating when we had big readings that we had to complete for class that were ultimately not discussed. Assignments were also a bit vague, and expectations weren't always clear. The assignments also seemed to favor the kind of work that humanities students would be more comfortable with which was hard for the social science students in the class.",
                "The biggest strength of this course was definitely the two professors and the atmosphere that they established in the classroom, which always allowed for constructive, thought-provoking discussions."

                "Granted they incorporate some feedback from the first teaching of the course, there is no harm in taking this class. However, in its current form, it may cause more stress than learning.",
                "Maybe. It depends on the structure of it the next time it is taught. The content itself is very interesting, but the class discussion never took off and the assignments and grading are unclear. We were assigned really big readings sometimes and we never discussed them or only spent five minutes on them. And they said there would be a quiz for one book we read and there never was. Sometimes we were told there would be a break and there wasn't. It was all a bit unclear. But the professors are both very nice and helpful if you ask for it. It is also the first year this course has been taught, so I expect it will improve in future years.",
                "Yes, its a strong course whose interdisciplinary nature can be really exciting. Seminars aren't the most engaging, but the assignments and readings for the course more than make up for it",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! This was one of my favorite classes at Yale ever. I felt like my mind was completely blown every class by what we were learning, and I honestly really enjoyed my writing assignments.",
                "It's cool to learn about memory from different perspectives! This is definitely a survey course - there's so much to go through that you don't go super deep into anything, and the english and psych sides of the course sometimes feel disconnected, but it was a fun class to be in",
                "As it's currently structured, no. There are better psychology courses on memory and thought and better English or Philosophy courses on mental processes. Mixing the two without regard to how they elevate or contradict each other does not feel like a productive use of a course slot.",
                "Yes if you are curious about cognitive science and how it is portrayed in the humanities.",
                "Yes",
                "This is a very accessible social science credit for a humanities student, so I would definitely recommend the class to anyone looking to fulfill that distribution requirement.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in taking a class that brings two very different disciplines (english\/film and neuroscience\/cognitive science) to bear on an issue and are excited about a somewhat amorphous class structure that jumps around a lot, this is certainly a class I recommend. If you want to take a straight English class, this is not for you. If you want to take a straight cog sci class, this is not for you. It was really fun to have weeks where I felt very in my element, working within the field I am majoring in, and others where I was thrown in the deep end, asked to think about things in an entirely new way. Only take this class if you are willing to be a bit confused at times and are excited to work in that confusion.",
                "Absolutelyregardless of whether they have Professor Williams and\/or Professor McDougle, the class and its content was always engaging and interesting."
