                "Professor Malaker is a very considerate teacher. We began the class with pop quizzes, which were stressful and not very effective. However, Professor Malaker recognized this and asked us how to be a better teacher. We no longer had pop quizzes, but we were given other opportunities to grow as thinkers. I have tremendous respect for Professor Malaker: she wasnt afraid to admit that her pedagogical choice wasnt a perfect fit for the class.",
                "I thought that the course was well structured all-around, and I learned much about different aspects of protein and carbohydrate chemical biology. My only complaint is that we had had problem sets instead of quizzes for the entire class and that we did not discuss the readings enough in person.",
                "A lot of material, each lecture had like 50-60 slides to review and the professor went over them really quickly. There were also pop quizzes (at least in the beginning of the class until she took them away because we all hated them) which were extremely stressful and had really low averages (one average was 11\/20). I also felt like Professor Malaker didn't do a great job at explaining things sometimes; she's so intelligent and knowledgeable about the subject but then when I didn't understand things it felt like she was annoyed trying to explain them when I didn't get it after her first explanation. She also didn't provide any information as to the final grades\/what the curve would look like before the final so it was hard to know where we stood in relation to the rest of the class."

Professor Malaker is and will continue to be big in the field of mass spectrometry, so its a privilege to learn from her.",
