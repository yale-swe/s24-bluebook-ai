    "I learned so much in this class and had literally so much fun. The material was so engaging, I even managed to stay awake through it at 9 am.",
    "Literary Analysis, writing a nuanced literature paper",
    "-how to write with more structure and precision\r\n-became a better reader\r\n-learned different approaches to a text: close reading, looking at historical context, looking at how the work relates to other works",
    "how to analyze text in a new way and get a deeper understanding of the text that goes beyond themes and metaphors. This course really rewarded me for reading the text more closely and having an open mind while at the same time constantly questioning what was presented to me.",
    "My appreciation for the literature of the western canon was expanded and deepened.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about the development of literature from the Homeric tradition to The period in which Dante operates. Moreover, along with the other Directed Studies programs, I learned how to produce essays under a significant time constraint. I also discovered in greater depth my interest in the humanities, particularly through one on one conversations with Professor Lindskog during office hours.",
    "I truly enjoyed reading these texts, as I have always wanted to but never got the chance. The wide range of texts allowed me to gain a broad understanding of literature during that time period within the western canon, and it was especially interesting to see the progression of religion and Christianity."

   "comments": [
    "Pacing was really good and manageable, especially for a DS course",
    "-strengths: the readings, the essays, the essay feedback\r\n-weaknesses: sometimes the discussion felt more directed than it needed to be, would have liked for there to be more aesthetic appreciation of the works (for their beauty, emotional qualities, the wonder and awe they may evoke)",
    "I feel like the jump from ovid to dante is a big one.",
    "I think that the course is run very well. I also thinks its syllabus is great. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in understanding the development of literature.",
    "The strength is that we read such an interesting and wide variety of books, and the weakness that the class discussions can sometimes get a little circular. Perhaps it could be improved with more structure\/guidance to the class discussions, such as with a starting question."

    "Yes, if DS is your thing you will love love love this class.",
    "Yes, overall a great literature class",
    "Yes! The course follows a progression through western literature that is cohesive and exciting. All the books we read and the conversations we had about them were rewarding.",
    "Yes! I think that this course, in conjunction with the rest of the DS curriculum, provides a really valuable foundation of knowledge, as well as a foundation of training in thinking and writing. These are important books to read! Writing essays is very helpful for clarifying your ideas and improving your writing! The course is challenging, and that's what's great about it. I would also recommend this section in particular: Katja was a very good professor.",
    "Yes. Very interesting and enjoyable. Challenges you to think in a new way and just think more and work through ideas",
    "I would definitely. As long as they are prepared for the courses heavy workload!",
    "I would recommend the course itself to other students, as I loved reading the different texts and learning about the authors' contexts. I have always loved literature, and this allowed me to explore texts I had not been able to read before."
