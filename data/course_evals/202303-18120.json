                "Well organized.",
                "One strength of the course is that it provides theoretical insight rather than just the applied perspective.  The weakness of this course this semester is that it become more applied than before, which makes it easily covered by other similar courses.",
                "I'd say the course was structured well, although I didn't like that the lecture slides had a lot of blanks. I also didn't like that the lecture recordings were only available if we requested them from the professor. I felt like it was an unnecessary barrier to reviewing for quizzes and exams.",
                "Strength: the instructor is brilliant, kind and knows how to teach.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The depth of the course falls short of Ph.D. level expectations, resembling more closely an undergraduate introduction to linear models",
                "The bi-weekly psets are very nice. I love how the professor always made sure everyone understood a concept before moving to the next one -- even if this meant we spent more time with certain things than he planned. I wish there were more data science (coding) involved in the first half of the class.",
                "Strengths: Very approachable course, good mix of theory and practice that was both informative and not overwhelming. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As with most STEM courses, I'm a strong advocate of recorded lectures. This is because advanced STEM courses often reference significant amounts of material from past years, which is difficult to recall at the moment. It is invaluable to be able to review said material and rewatch lecture at a later point. This class would have been improved with better quality and more consistently released lecture recordings. To counter the negative effect this would have on class attendance, I'd recommend implementing a \"trivial quiz\" at the start of each class (even as simple as what color is displayed on the lecture board right now) to see which students are present and which are not. I have seen previous professors do this to good effect.",
                "This is an excellent linear model course which gives a good balance between theory and application.",
                "The course is generally well paced, but I personally found it to be a bit slow at times.",
                "This course was really well taught. It blended math, theoretical statistical reasoning, and practice very well. I got a very wholistic understanding of the material that I think I will be able to apply beyond this class.\r\nMy one piece of feedback would be that some datasets for the homework were boring. For example, we once had to predict car MPG based on its characteristics. I don't think this is a super interesting question, so it made some of the homework questions feel like busywork. I think a more interesting dataset would resolve this issue.",
                "Good",
                "Slower at the beginning and become faster later.",
                "Strengths: good professor, made linear models as interesting as it can be. Weaknesses: material can be dry",
                "Strengths: Professor Ma was an EXCELLENT professor. I felt like I understood what he was teaching because he was very receptive to student feedback about course/content difficulty. Weaknesses: In the same vein, I feel like the course was too easy and we didn't learn as much as we could have. Though the exam averages were decently low, this was mainly because a single T/F question would be worth 7% of the exam, which was a bit ridiculous. I felt like the exams were fair in what they tried to assess but the lack of partial credit screwed with grade distributions. The problem sets started off at a reasonable difficulty but quickly became like 1-hour long psets analyzing a dataset with basic R functions..."

                "You definitely need S&DS 241 or 242 before taking this class. I'd recommend for S&DS majors needing to fulfill the Methods of Data Science requirement.",
                "I really liked this class. Coming from a non-stats major, I did not expect to like this class as much as I did, and it almost makes me wish I took more stats classes / became a stats major. I felt motivated to learn the material since I feel like linear models are just so important. This class was a nice blend of theory with practice. We covered simple and multiple linear regression really in depth and there was a lot of nuance and interesting nuggets of information along the way, while it also didnt feel overwhelming since parts of the class were repetitive, which helps reinforce tougher concepts. The work was also not too bad, there were 5 homeworks and 3 of them were relatively light and straightforward. There were 3 short quizzes together worth 7.5% of the grade that were low-stakes multiple choice questions that helped me stay on top of reviewing and studying throughout the semester. We had a midterm and timed take-home final. All assessments were open-note, open-internet, open-Chat-GPT, and focused on conceptual understanding so it was nice to know that we are prioritizing obtaining a deeper understanding of the material without the grunt work. One last note is that I took this class without S&DS 242 and was able to follow along, so it is doable although at certain points I was confused, but office hours and diligent studying helped alleviate any pain points.",

                "I would definitely recommend this class. It is an excellent blend of theoretical understanding and practice. I feel confident that I would be able to use the material learned in this class in a future setting. It's also lots of fun! Interesting material, and Professor Ma is very engaging.",
                "I would recommend this course, especially if Professor Ma is teaching. His instruction is particularly excellent - he is able to consistently gauge the understanding of the class and delve deeper into certain topics as necessary. As an S&DS major, Professor Ma is the best instructor that I have had so far, and truly cares about student success in the course.\r\n\r\nWhile the scope of the class felt somewhat constrained to a rather small area within statistics and data analysis, I felt that I learned much more intuition into an essential topic that wasn't really taught that well in S&DS 230 or S&DS 242. Whether this is attributable to the course organization, or to professor instruction, I'm not entirely sure. I would still recommend this class if you're looking for a interesting, and relatively lower workload course.",
                "Good course and learn more math",
                "Yes, it is good for the start of statistics.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, this is in my opinion the best taught class in the S&DS department I have taken so far. Professor Ma is engaging, funny, and most important of all takes time to make sure everyone understands basic concepts, unlike many other teachers who tend to move too fast. I also am grateful for the intuitive geometric explanations he gives for linear models.",
                "of course if they want to further explore statistical learning",
                "I would recommend to stats people looking to get another class in the category A for the major. It wasn't too hard, especially in the second half of the course, and the assignments are chill. It was a lot of recapping material.",
                "This was an excellent course, in my opinion. I felt like I learned a LOT of very valuable content, though much of it is similar to the beginning chapters of Intro/Elements of Statistical Learning. The professor explained the topics really well, in an approachable way with continuous reinforcement. Although, at times, I felt like the material was TOO dumbed down at the sacrifice of covering more topics / more in-depth topics. It's a linear regression course; it's not too difficult and introduces linear algebra in a great way that is necessary for more advanced courses like S&DS 365. Exams and quizzes were open book, OpenAI (LOL), which meant that the questions were often gauging reading comprehension over mastery of content at times. I think I liked that the quizzes forced me to relearn content before cramming before exams, but were not spaced out properly to optimize for that, and it was annoying that there were only 4 multiple-choice questions decided 2.5% of your grade each time (which is a lot in STEM courses, where the cutoffs are very tightly bound)"
