            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Psets sometimes had interesting problems. John Lafferty is a generally good lecturer and explains things well (although sometimes his timing is off, see below).\r\nWeaknesses: John Lafferty is a good lecturer with terrible lecture timing. We spent the first 45 minutes of every class recapping the last class. I feel like if he used that time to go more in detail and more thoroughly explain the topics the FIRST time, the class would be more productive, especially because he is definitely capable of explaining things well. Exams and psets varied wildly in difficulty. I never knew when opening an assignment if it would take 5 hours or 40. The teaching staff on this course (TAs/ULAs, not talking about Lafferty) was truly abysmal, with maybe 2 exceptions. The office hours schedule was super inconvenient (no weekend times) and TAs would change their office hours last minute. In office hours, TAs were often totally unhelpful. In fact, I had one of the most appalling office hours experiences in my life in this course when I watched a TA basically refuse to explain how to solve the homework questions (he just wrote answers on the board and would not say a single word to elaborate) and openly laugh at students like they were stupid. I think the quizzes are a bad pedagogical tool. We are told they are just to make sure we are on track, but also they are graded and often they were poorly timed (too hard for the allotted time), so I was not sure what to think about them.",
                "very great lecture, homework helps to consolidate understanding of concepts\r\nhard content",
                "It is really good to learn so many interesting topics about machine learning.",
                "Strengths: This course probably covers the most material out of all the courses I've taken. Some of the exercises we do in problem sets are very fun and insightful. I'm also grateful for the plethora of office hours and resources (lots of practice exams for the midterm + final!) that significantly helped students with understanding course material. The reward students feel after completing this class is likely unmatched compared to other courses in the major, and you do learn so much and it is taught so well by Prof. Lafferty.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course is very difficult, which is not a weakness in itself, but it is sometimes almost impossible to follow at the pace the class is taught. Therefore, this class requires a lot of time, so it would make a regular semester busy and a busy semester potentially unbearable. As a result, it is difficult to stack courses in your majors while also taking this course and if you do not manage your time well and/or have many time commitments, this may pose issues. The other issue I have with this course is that some of the mathematical exercises on problem sets are, I believe, unreasonably difficult where students almost have to attend office hours and/or consult friends (who likely attended office hours) to complete these exercises. Not only is the math difficult, but the approach to solving these problems often requires unintuitive steps and hints, and it is difficult to find the motivation for such findings as well as difficult to understand the impact of the results.",
                "I think the main strength of the course is that there are a lot of topics, so students receive quite a wide picture of modern machine learning. Of course there are many more topics in Machine Learning, but it's very impressive how much we covered during one semester",
                "Strengths:  Lafferty's knowledge, organization, expertise, and talent as a lecturer",
                "I think the class was very organized and conducive to student learning. Having biweekly assignments and quizzes gave students the opportunity to assess their level of understanding prior to exams. Also, since the quizzes were not worth too much of the overall grade, I found them to be more of a learning opportunity rather than a source of additional stress.",
                "Strengths: This course helps in building a strong understanding on most of the sections covered and where they can be used. With both its assignments and quizzes, the important parts of each section are regularly highlighted, so that the student can absorb them.\r\nWeaknesses: I believe that some of the parts covered could be either left out or limited in less classes, given the available time in the semester, so that the ones that are left can be explained better and in more depth. For example, the second part of the course, after the midterm, felt like it was taught in a rush and no proper time and insights were given to understand the sections cover (like RL, seq learning).",
                "Strength: very detail and full of math proof. We can learn machine learning deeply\r\n\r\nWeakness: the procedure is too quick to accept all knowledge perfectly",
                "The course is excellent, and I don't think it has any kind of weaknesses.",
                "Lectures could be made a bit more engaging, the slide deck and lecturing combo doesn't do the best for class attention.\r\n\r\nAlso, I wish the assignments were more programming-heavy. A takeaway I wish I had from the course would be to have the knowledge to use TensorFlow for my own purposes, but in the assignments the starter code abstracts that all away.",
                "More details can aid better understanding",
                "I think this course is really good.",
                "Strengths: Amazing course that enhances students' understanding of machine learning methods (and how to carry out ML projects)\r\n\r\nAreas of Improvement: The last part of the course felt a bit rushed, and I wished we could have spent more time learning about the math behind some of the advanced topics, such as transformers.",
                "Weakness: some parts are so mathematical and theoretical that it's hard to fully understand.\r\n\r\nStrength: Very good lectures, very good demos.",
                "strengths: interesting content. weaknesses: had to learn some prerequisite material on my own, particularly with regard to matrices",
                "The courses strengths are in its coverage of topics. It attempts to cover the relevant topics in modern machine learning, and does so fairly well; it is hard to go into more depth without losing students. The homeworks are excellent. My one complaint has tondo with the nature of some exam problems, in particular the CNN feature maps. While problems of this nature are not necessarily bad, there are often far too many possible options for a plausibly correct answer.  In contrast, the Q-function questions were much easier to deduce.",
                "A strength of this course is when it sheds some light on the intuition behind modern ML methods. The extra handouts providing proofs of some facts stated in class was also helpful. However, it could be significantly improved by modifying both the pacing and the content. With regard to the pacing, each lecture often opened with a half hour or so that consisted solely of restating material from the previous lecture. This meant that the rest of the content had to then be rushed through, and even though it was restated at the start of the following lecture, this resulted in students receiving two (almost identical) rushed descriptions rather than a single slower-paced explanation. With regards to the content of the course, in my opinion it places too significant of an emphasis on methods which are frankly no longer at the forefront of modern ML. The section on transformers and self-attention should be expanded, and material should be added regarding GANs, message-passing graph neural networks, and diffusion generative models. To allow for this, the remaining material could be condensed (linear regression, including regularization methods could be two lectures -- smoothing and Mercer kernels could be one lecture -- Gaussian processes and glasso/plasso could be omitted entirely). While these topics all have importance in their own right, it would be more valuable for students interested in actually applying ML in the present day to have less focus on these \"classical\" techniques and more on those utilizing deep neural networks.",
                "We learned a ton of super cool stuff. The stuff we learned was conceptually super hard though.",
                "very clean lecture",
                "The course is comprehensive on ML theories and applications.\r\nThe weakness might be that the slides are not clear enough.",
                "Strengths: in the first part of the course, there was a good amount of theory, which explained the concepts rather clearly. Also, the course demonstrated some new deep learning applications in language models such as transformers. \r\nWeaknesses: the latter half of the semester was rather sloppy in terms of mathematical notations....",
                "professor is smart, math is deep, but also a little hard.",
                "Very challenging course, should have mentioned earlier that matrix calculus is a prerequisite. It would be helpful if the math done on the blackboard had corresponding notes/appendix that were posted online. Midterm should have one sheet double sided, final should have two sheets double sided.",
                "Well organized with posted lecture and supplemental notes along with recordings, supportive teaching staff and professor. Problem sets, exams, and quizzes were very fair",
                "Strengths: lots of interesting topics. Weaknesses: some hw questions are too theory based",
                "Prof knows his stuff. First half very theoretical with a lot of discussion of techniques that aren't that applicable to ML in industry (e.g. lots of focus on classical approaches). Second half is more practical, although if you're looking to go into ML in industry, I would argue something like CPSC 488 is more useful. Does a better job than most other classes of encouraging understanding instead of brute force memorization.",
                "Strengths: The professor has done a good job of structuring the course. The lectures are (for the most part) well-planned. Weaknesses: It's a lot of material. The homework assignments can be long/difficult, and while the professor allows use of Chat-GPT, I felt like everything I learned was at a very high level and I don't know how I would implement anything on my onw. Many times I thought it was just me that didn't understand how to implement the code, but then I go to OH and realize lots of people don't understand, not just me. At times this course can be confusing in what it expects the students to know. I felt like it straddled a weird line between a ML theory class and a survey course.",
                "Clear organization of course materialthe website is especially nice and has a good amount of examples in the form of Jupyter notebooks",
                "The instructor is very responsible and the slides and lectures are in very good quality",
                "The class covers extensive topics in machine learning. It feels like many of the topics have been skimmed through, but the underlying mathematical details are not required anyway for this class. Definitely a good class to get to know how certain ML techniques work & examples.",
                "It's difficult as the course covers a lot of material, and thus assumes familiarity with a lot of the mathematical and statistical concepts.\r\nStrengths: homework assignment are designed well and help facilitate learning of lecture material, demos on jupyter notebook very helpful for seeing how to implement these concepts\r\nweaknesses: lectures go a little fast, would appreciate a bit more explanation on some of the more fundamental concepts."

                "Absolutely! This class should appeal to not only S&DS majors, but also anybody interested in math and/or computer science (you need not be a major!). Obviously, if you want a B.S. in S&DS, you must take this course, but I would agree that one must take this course in order to attain a B.S. in the major. You learn a lot about the math behind these machine learning concepts, so it can be very math-intensive and difficult to follow. That said, you will need to put a lot of time into this class outside of lectures to truly understand the material in its entirety, and I would not take this course in a semester where you take more courses and/or already have a heavier workload than normal. Some of this knowledge is essential and can be the framework for revolutionary findings as machine learning continues to rapidly improve. This course's curriculum can grow a significant amount every year with the current rate of advancement. If you are looking more for coding and a more application-oriented course, S&DS 265 (Introductory Machine Learning) is likely a better fit, especially if you are not a S&DS major, but I would still recommend that ones take this course. In fact, taking this after S&DS 265 may be helpful, but I did not take 265, so I cannot comment about the difference it makes.",

                "It was okay.. I think that the course could have been structured a little better to facilitate student learning. I personally would've benefited immensely from some form of written course notes to review - the in class slideshows felt too sparse and the supplemental notes felt too confusing/in depth. I often found myself confused by terminology, since John tends to very quickly gloss over it, and with no resource to return to to actually figure out what some of the concepts in the course were in plain english. Lectures where Professor Lafferty worked out concepts on the board were MUCH better and easier to follow than his slideshows and I think this class would be greatly greatly improved by restructuring how lectures are given. It also feels like a shame to me that this is required for the S&DS BS - the material felt very out of alignment with the overall S&DS curriculum (i.e. an expectation to know concepts like matrix calculus despite it never being covered in any of the previous required classes). Overall, I enjoyed some parts of the class but I think it could be improved, and I'm walking away with a still somewhat shaky understanding of some of the material.",

If you haven't taken IntroML, you can get by and just need to develop the intuition for what the ML models are designed for.",
                "I would not really recommend this course, especially if it is not required for your major.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lafferty's lectures were extremely dense and fast paced, which made it impossible to really grasp topics in the moment. Lecture attendance quickly decreased over-time, and towards the end felt disproportionate with students (mostly graduate but some undergraduate) who had previous (industry/academic) experience with machine learning. With a significant amount of outside work, I was able to grasp intuition of most of the the topics in the course. However, that didn't really help given the class organization.\r\n\r\nThe coding and exercises on the problem sets were pretty enjoyable and interesting. However, many problem sets contained difficult mathematical proofs that couldn't be confidently solved without the help of a TA and didn't really contribute to understanding of course material.\r\n\r\nTA and ULA instruction was particularly poor, with questions from EdStem going unanswered for days at a time. Going to office hours in person still didn't help to develop the intuition behind some of the difficult problems on the problem sets.\r\n\r\nExams were particularly difficult, especially because of their dissimilarity from practice/past exams that were given to help in studying. \r\n\r\nOverall, the course material is very interesting and Professor Lafferty is an exceptional thought leader within this space, but given the poor organization and instruction of the course, I would not recommend taking it.",
                "Definitely. Lafferty is an expert in this field, and understanding the underlying mechanics of ML is probably important if anyone wants to get into some form of computational field.",
                "Very good course for advanced machine learning techniques",
                "Only if it's required. Lafferty is a good instructor, but I really just don't get the point of the class. We cover a lot of different (and difficult topics) but don't really go that deep into any of them so I'm not sure if I really learned much of anything. I strongly think the class should cover fewer models and cover those models in much more depth",
                "Yes. I can truly learn new knowledge.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who has an interest in machine learning. While I initially took the course as a requirement for S&DS, I was exposed to a broad overview of machine learning topics that are crucial to data science.",
                "Yes, the course offers a fair amount of work and is equally rewarding.",
                "Yes, can learn a lot.",
                "Only if you went to work in ML or go to stats grad school. If neither of those are true I don't think this course is worth the effort that it requires. The first PSets took me about 40-50 hours each. The rest of the PSets are actually pretty light which is fine. This course also has a few online quizzes, all of which are pretty tricky.",
                "Yes! Its a great introduction to many techniques in ML, and you learn about the theory underlying many different models. Very helpful for anyone looking to go into careers with AI or data science applications.",
                "Yes. This course covers fundamentals in modern machine learning. Do I need say more?",
                "Under certain circumstances, I'd recommend it. If someone wants to get an overview of the statistical ideas underlying modern machine learning methods, this course could provide that. However, as a practical introduction to the way modern deep learning methods are constructed and analyzed, it's significantly lacking. There was one quick lecture on transformers, and no mention at all of GANs, diffusion models, or message-passing graph neural networks. This means that either self-study or an additional course would be needed to prepare students for understanding cutting-edge machine learning techniques.",
                "Yes, even if you're not S&DS major.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, this is great for guys who want to learn ML.",
                "Definitely recommended. It challenges your understanding of machine learning, assuming mathematical maturity.",
                "Be warned that this course is very intellectually challenging. Homework sets require more pure mathematics than the average S&DS course. The material is very interesting and useful. Homework sets and exams are quite difficult.",
                "yes, great way to learn fundamentals of ML",
                "Yeah. As and S&DS major, I took this without intro to machine learning and I felt fine.",
                "Yes, if you enjoy learning the theory. ML classes in CS are more practical.",
                "Yes!",
                "The course covers a lot and has a lot of prereqs. I had all of the prereqs except intro ML (S&DS 265), which I skipped. I was sort of confused throughout the class, but I honestly think a large part of that was due to the course organization itself (and people I know who took intro ML and then this course were also confused). PLEASE take this after or concurrently with S&DS 312; many of the topics I would not understand until after I learned the theory/ lower-level math in 312. If you really want to understand the content, you might have to learn a lot of it yourself (I watched a LOT of YouTube videos to try to understand the concepts). A lot of the time it was unclear to me how one part of the class connected to another part, or the motivations for things we were doing. On the upside/after all that effort, though, I definitely have a much better understanding of machine learning concepts and where the field is today.",
                "Yes. Very insightful focus of Machine learning.",
                "Yes, useful for machine learning research",
                "I would recommend for S&DS majors",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. I did not take intro ML before, yet I found it not difficult to follow the class from the beginning as Prof. Lafferty does not assume lots of prior knowledge. Some topics are touched on & rushed through, so I believe people who are interested in this field can learn more alongside this class if they are willing to spend time on extra learnings.",
                "Yes. I think this course teaches a lot of great techniques in machine learning and builds from the ground up, focusing on the math/stats behind these techniques. That said, lectures cover a lot of material, and often assume a certain familiarity with math/stats. There were many times I had to rewatch lectures or look at the provided code demos or online resources to really understand the material. I took this course without having taken any prereqs and with minimal stats background. I'm not sure how much the prereqs would have helped, as I think many people who had taken them were also confused. \r\n\r\nStill, I think even without a complete understanding of the math, one can still learn a lot from the class and perform well on tests. The homework assignments are very well designed and a reasonable length (the first one is a bit longer). Overall, an amazing class!",
                "Yes. Very inspiring if you're interested in ML. The professor is very experienced in this field and can provide very intuitive insights.",
                "Yes, if you are not an expert in machine learning but want to start learning."
