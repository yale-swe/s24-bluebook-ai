A weakness of this course is its lack of organization. Some of my classmates were not submitting paper work on time repeatedly, so there was a switch to Canvas. But the Canvas page is very disorganized and it became really difficult and annoying to submit 15+ page physical homework packets on Canvas, requiring all of the work be photographed and made into a pdf.",
