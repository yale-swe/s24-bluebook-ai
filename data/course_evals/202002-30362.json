    "Strengths: great class discussions and you learn a lot of French\r\nWeakness: very high workload and fast paced. The last week especially had too much reading.",
    "Online tests are really flawed, and canvas quizzes leave no room for interpretation. Also we don't actually get a result of our tests back, so we don't know what things we actually need to improve on although the instructor's quizzes are very useful in preparing for the test."
