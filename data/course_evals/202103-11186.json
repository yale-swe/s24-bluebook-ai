                "I learned a lot about contemporary Russia through a Russian lens, which was very different from how I'd learned about Russia in the past. I have a newfound appreciation for Russia and I feel like this class made me more familiar with the Russian people and erased the perspective I had of them as this \"Other\" people of which I had nothing in common with. I also learned how to close read films and analyze the director's and actor's choices and consider why they had made those decisions to contribute to the film overall.",
                "I learned a lot in this course, from Russian History and Culture to how to analyze a scene from a film.",
                "This course really teaches you how to engage with Russian literature and film in a super engaging way. I also have a better understanding of Russian history as well as the current methods of protest being used within the country currently.",
                "I have learned so much about Russian history, literature, art, and film. My close-reading and writing skills have improved tremendously, and I have learned to analyze film and craft original arguments for my work.",
                "Improved my writing a lot and critical watching of film.",
                "I learned a lot about Russia in the form of novels and films. I also became a much stronger writer and critical thinker.",
                "I learned very much about the history of Eastern Europe in this course, both contemporary history and past movements such as the russian Avant Garde and the Soviet conceptualists. I also developed my ability to analyze literature and films. Finally, because of Professor Bozovic's involvement in contemporary Russian art and politics, I learned a lot about exciting modern movements.",
                "I learned about contemporary political art from the post-Soviet Wild 90s to Putin's Russia. I greatly improved my writing skills, comparative analysis, and close reading abilities. I also learned how to write about film for the first time!"

                "I like the seminar style and Marijeta did a wonderful job moderating conversation. I also appreciate that she counts Reading Responses towards participation grades, as sometimes it could be hard to get my exact thought out while in class. I liked that we got to study a wide variety of mediums and we got to meet with Marijeta after each paper in person to discuss strengths and weaknesses. It would be wonderful to have more speakers the next time this class is taught. I do wish that we had learned more about the history of Russia, because as someone who is not a Slavic major\/does not come from a Russian background, I felt a bit lost at times in conversation when I did not know the context of what we were discussing\/it was hard to offer original insights.",
                "Nothing",
                "Strengths: The best part of this course is undeniably Professor Bozovic her focus on individual feedback truly helped students become better writers and understand the course's content. It was legitimately hard to not be excited about the class because of the way she taught it, her passion was contagious. Aside from Professor Bozovic, the assignments were clear-cut and the readings\/screenings were generally interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Truly cannot think of any.",
                "Strengths: fascinating material, manageable workload, and an INCREDIBLE professor. \r\nWeaknesses: absolutely none.",
                "The syllabus is amazing, but Professor Marijeta makes the class! One of my favorites",
                "Professor Bozovic is the strength of this course. She leads a very interesting style seminar course and it was a joy to come to class everyday.",
                "This course is extremely effective in teaching a highly specific subject matter to students, regardless of their expertise. While our classroom varied widely in terms of experience with art, literature, film, politics, and Russian history, the course equally engaged everyone, neither boring those with more knowledge or becoming inaccessible to those with less. There was also a great deal of freedom to get what you wanted from the course and shape it to your own particular field of interest.",
                "Strengths: WONDERFUL, engaging, and supportive instructor. This is one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Yale! Weaknesses: a lot of writing but it's worth it"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning about contemporary Russia protest culture from a Russian (rather than a Western lens). Marijeta is an amazing professor and I loved her teaching style. I developed my writing skills and my close reading skills of both films and books over the course of this class.",
                "Yes, whether you need a writing credit or are interested in Russian Culture, this course is perfect",
                "Absolutely, please take this course you won't regret it!",
                "TAKE THIS CLASS. This is by far one of the best - if not the best - classes I have taken at Yale. I would recommend it to RSEE majors and students who have never taken a class in the department. It is one of the very few WR credits that actually cares about and improves your writing. Prof Bozovic meets with every student to plan our essays before we write them, and then meets with us once more to review them with us once she had graded them. I've never had a professor more invested in helping students sharpen their writing skills and learn to craft original, though-provoking arguments. The workload is light, but the material is fascinating and very varied. The Slack channel is a great way for everyone to distill their thoughts before class, and really helps the students build off of one another's work. Lastly, Prof Bozovic fosters a dynamic class environment in which everyone is able to participate and learn - both from her and from each other. As a result, the whole class really grew as writers and thinkers and got to know each other by the end of the semester.",
                "100%. Learned a lot about Russian culture and loved the environment of the class",
                "I would 100% recommend this course for anyone in need of a writing credit or if they want to learn more about Russia.",
                "Yes, absolutely. The course is extremely accessible to everyone regardless of their experience level, and the skills one learns (as well as the knowledge of Russia, an increasingly important region) are practically helpful as well as interesting.",
                "YES!!!! Take this course for the incredible Professor Bozovic! I would love to take more of her classes in the future."
