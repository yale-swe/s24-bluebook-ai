Students were forced to hand in drafts while the instructor does not even go through them.",

It is a class that is fast-paced and requires you to spend some time on almost every day, but being able to communicate better in Japanese, write more complex sentences, and read longer texts makes it worth it. We also got to talk to Japanese college students (via Zoom) for a few weeks, which I found really fun and eye-opening.",

                "Yes.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn Japanese and Japanese culture. Note that this is a 1.5 credit course with a lot of homework and tests are graded rather strictly."
