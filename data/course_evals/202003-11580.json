                "I think this course is probably amazing in person but online, it definitely depended a bit on the photos that were included for identifying each structure given. I do think the structure of the course generally makes it accessible to both STEM and non-STEM students.",
                "Dr. Sargis is a wonderful teacher and was great at answering questions. Online lecture sometimes was difficult to engage with, but I feel this is a challenge that comes with online coursework.",
                "A strength of this course was its emphasis on practice before a real assessment. I felt that the labs held before every quiz prepared me to do well in the course. I also enjoyed how much the knowledge learned in the class was framed in terms of practical purposes. As an aspiring doctor, I feel like I have many new skills that will be helpful later in my career.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness was the virtual format, but that's something that couldn't be changed given this semester's circumstances.",

It's rare to find classes at Yale that satisfy all three benefits of 1.) being intellectually stimulating and useful, 2.) being light on work, and 3.) having a generous grade distribution. Of course you should only take a class if it interests you, but I found those other considerations to be met by this course. I would recommend taking this course when it's offered in person, though.",

Really satisfying to finish the course and realize you know all the bones and their key features, as well as important muscles and nerves, which will be an excellent foundation for learning further anatomy if you want to pursue medicine. Not too rigorous, instructors facilitate learning, virtual labs are engaging, and quizzes were not stressful"
