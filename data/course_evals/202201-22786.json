                "I learned a ton about the history of segregation in the school system and efforts to desegregate. I appreciated how we focused on the situation in NYC, the city having the most segregated school system.",
                "I learned a lot about all of the structural and historical systems/factors at play that have kept American schools segregated and inequitable, as well as ways in which we can imagine more equitable futures for schools. Sarah's teaching method is also so deliberate and fascinating in and of itself, so that's a plus. And we gained so much knowledge from people doing social justice work as professionals, which is rare in a Yale class.",
                "This course allowed me to assess school choice and segregation through varying different lens, establishing a better understanding of the general welfare of public school students and how policy choices harm poor students of marginalized identities.",
                "I learned a lot about segregation and also how to go about working to solve this issue. I learned how to do readings selectively and also I gained some valuable work experience skills",
                "I learned so much about school segregation and different systemic issues related to schools. I developed knowledge about legal frameworks and other frameworks such as white bodied supremacy.",
                "I learned SO MUCH about youth organizing, building coalitions, trauma-informed and anti-racist pedagogy, and more. I was able to investigate how I fit into school equity and integration work. The readings gave me a great foundation in understanding the history of school segregation and its intersections with different avenues of oppression. I particularly appreciated the exposure to the concept of racialized trauma, which has changed how I view myself and the world. The guest speakers and class discussions facilitated a network of passionate experts. Most of all, I felt energized and prepared to take on a post-grad career that aligns with my values.",
                "Learning more about",
                "This class should be renamed to \"the legacy of segregation in the school system\". We learned about how segregation exists in schools today, particularly in the New York City Public School System, and specific topics we touched on included segregation through these areas: school zoning, gifted and talented programs, magnet schools, entry exams, etc. We also talked about types of resistance, including lawsuits, school abolition, and radical homeschooling. One skill I gained was reading through lawsuits and learning how to understand them.",
                "I really liked the way this class was structured in two parts; the first part focused on learning a lot about the issues that contribute to/formed the system of segregation that exists today and the second half focused on strategies for combatting segregation. I think this class helped me to conceptualize the intertwined nature of both the causes and the solutions in a way that had not previously been accessible to me, as well as giving me tools to think about my own place/history with schooling.",
                "This course brought my attention to the ways in which the structures of our world today have been influenced and based on racism.  We examined the ways in which racism has affected our interpersonal and intrapersonal relationships.  We've also examined the ways in which it has affected school structures, immigration, healthcare, and so much more.  Although, the most important skill I've gained as a result of this class is the steps and actions necessary to combat this racism and attempt to remedy its effects.",

                "Very well organized, clear commitment to accessibility. Would like more diversity in class structure (and smaller class)",
                "Lovely course!!",
                "Strengths: well organized and structured, instructions clear for assignments, guest speakers were interesting, lots of opportunity for discussion, Sarah was amazing!\r\nweaknesses: maybe more time for framework review/going over content from readings",
                "Strengths: Sarah is a radically different type of teacher in a really good way. She pushes back against the tendencies of academia and makes her class structures very responsive to student needs. You learn a lot about systems of power and how they operate in order to oppress, but you also learn about ways in which people/communities/institutions are currently fighting these structures. The experiential learning project (instead of a final paper) is great for gaining experience and building a network.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class is way too big for good discussions, as it is. I'd pare it down from 25 to max 15. Some more expectation-setting for the experiential project would also be nice.",
                "Sarah is an amazing professor. This class is amazing simply because she supports and reinforces us as students. Content-wise, the course pushes students to think beyond the school building and conceptualize the problems we experienced and how to overcome them. The class is structured well to hear speakers out while also learning from classmates.",
                "We needed a classroom that better accommodated this discussion-style course. The guest speakers were great (this really was a strength), but there were almost too many of them at times",
                "This was an amazing course that relied on student engagement and participation. One of the greatest strengths was the design of the course with all the guests and the ability to bring in personal insights into conversations.",
                "Strengths: Sarah is an amazing professor and does a great job breaking down institutional segregation, the experiential project is a great way to transition classwork into real practice; Weakness: class could benefit from more discussion time (sometimes felt like guest speakers took up a substantial amount of seminar time)",
                "This class was excellent, far better than any other class I've taken at Yale. It really facilitated a class community where we learned from as well as with each other. The class was focused on thinking beyond the academy and into the real world. I learned so much and felt interested throughout the two-hour seminar, a rarity for me. The variety of perspectives offered from diverse classmates (it is a testament to Sarah's class that this was most racially diverse class I've been in at Yale) to incredible guest speakers to engaging multimedia course materials to Sarah herself gave me such a clear understanding of the issue of school segregation and the was it can be undone.\r\n\r\nOne potential weakness was that Sarah had so much to offer us that we couldn't always fit everything into the two-hour seminar. The class was so great I honestly would have been okay with a three-hour seminar or a twice-a-week class (maybe with guest speakers on one day and student presentations on the other day). Another one of the strengths of the course was Sarah's willingness to take feedback throughout the semester. She was so open and responsive that I can't think of any other potential weakness that members of the class haven't discussed with her.",
                "Strengths: material, structure, guests. Assignments were great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: too many readings meant discussions were unfocused.",
                "The primary strength of this course is that Sarah is extremely passionate about the topic and is great at bringing in real examples. Weaknesses of the course include covering too much material every week, moving through abstract frameworks without diving into them deeply, and trying to accomplish too much in every class with framework evaluation, discussion, and guest speakers.",
                "I thought the course was really well structured around the students, and I loved the use of \"frameworks\" to help conceptualize materials.  Additionally, through the experiential project you are really able to put what you learn in the classroom into work with an area that already interests you, which is so crucial to begin to do the work to break through divide between yale and the real world. I do wish assignments had been clarified a bit earlier, but in general thought it was very very well put together!",
                "I believe one of the weaknesses of the course was the fact that we consistently ran out of time to discuss the weekly readings and concepts as a class.  However, I believe it was just a matter of how much information was within a week which I believe there happens to be a very simple remedy for this.  That is not me saying the information was not valuable but rather perhaps more class sessions for the number of concepts or a shortening of concepts.  I think one of the strongest aspects of this course was its real-world application and the amount of work students were consistently engaged with outside the classroom.  This course was revolutionary in terms of academic learning strategies.",
                "Sarah is extremely understanding and responsive; as such the course itself adapts with student input as the semester goes on. Timing was a bit of an issue as there was always quite a bit of content to go through each class, so going in depth or having time with the visiting speakers for questions afterwards was difficult. A pro and a con was the class size; Sarah did her best to accommodate/accept as many people as possible for the course as it can be quite popular. While more people could take the course, here was less time and space for focused class-wide discussion."

                "Yes!! Sarah is a gem of teacher, who is committed to activism and mentoring students. You'll learn a lot about segregation and integration, as well as ways in which to combat segregation. You'll also hear from lots of outside speakers who do social justice work related to education. And you get to do a project with a social justice org, instead of writing a final paper.",
                "Absolutely. The Professor is amazing and we are challenged to think beyond the general school framework, making this my favorite Ed Studies course Ive taken.",

                "Definitely! One of my favorite classes at Yale. Sarah is amazing and the class environment is great!",
                "Absolutely - one of the most unique aspects of the class is how it centers much less on instruction/learning tons of material and is much more about building networks across different advocacy spaces. Sarah is great at drawing guest speakers into the class, all of whom are brilliant, and allowing the students to connect with them and their work. If you're looking for a course experience that connects you with powerful activists and prepares you for advocacy work beyond the classroom, this is the place to be.",
                "100% yes. Regardless of your major, if you are interested in education or racial justice you MUST take this class. It will be a breath of fresh air in the middle of the week while also engaging you in difficult, grounded material that matters to real people. If you can get into one of Sarah's classes, I promise she will make your time at Yale better.",
                "Id recommend. Gotta have interest in education activism. Background knowledge/experience can enhance the course too.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in how segregation, race, and equality play out in public schools. The material is a lot and can be a bit lofty, so I would recommend it only to people really interested in the subject and with a background in sociology/ed studies/ethnicity race and migration. Be prepared to think critically and intensely about inequality in schools!",
                "YES!!! I think this is one of the most student driven courses I have every taken, and I felt I was able to grow so much in my understanding and actions!",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to other students (especially to other FGLI students).  The fact that the instructor for this course was a Latina was highly refreshing as someone who also identifies as a Latina and has never experienced a Latina instructor.  I also think this course managed to bring out a vulnerability in exploring topics and connecting them to our experiences as students and humans.  As someone interested in national leadership, I think this course should be recommended as an intro to the structures that greatly affect our nation today.",
                "I would highly recommend to people who do and don't have experience in the subject area. There is quite a bit of content, but you can narrow down what you want to focus on and still learn something new or hear what you missed during class discussion."
