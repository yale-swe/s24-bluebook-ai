Learned how to edit and identify the most important characters or movements, and how to remove the rest. My writing improved immensely and I learned that less is often more. He helped us drill deeper into our characters to make stories that felt organic, yet focused. Reading everyones pieces and diving into them really taught me how to identify what makes a good story, and borrow those strategies in my own work.",

                "Although it was over Zoom, I really looked forward to seeing everyone's faces and talking about stories! Hearing other people's feedback helped me formulate my own. I also loved reading everyone's original fiction over the course of the semester. It tended towards realistic fiction, which I think best suited the professor's needs. Even still, when we got something different in genre it was really exciting.",
                "The best part of this course is the strength of the writers present. The caliber of writing and feedback really pushes you to improve your own writing and read thoughtfully, but in a collaborative and non-competitive way. Caz will also take time to talk about your stories or your writing career with you midway through the semester, and we got to meet with a literary agent at the end which was cool.",
                "Strengths- Caz is a fantastic professor and I learned so much from him! He's generous with his time and always available via email or office hours. I really appreciated every minute I spent talking to him; he can quickly identify the problems with a piece, and really helped me distill what I was trying to do in the work. He's a harsh critic  but I loved it. That's why we're here, and the blunt feedback worked wonders. (in my opinion.) I loved the workshop element of class, it was a joy to read these varied, diverse pieces, and see how differently everyone wrote. I definitely grew close to a few folks in the class and it was great to have that. The Q&A with a literary agent at the end was also really helpful and grounded the class in the realities of the profession. \r\nWeaknesses- The workshop also depends a lot upon the commitment of the students in it, so the live critique really depends on whether your peers are staying focused... which seems hard over zoom. Also a few peers didn't always send in their \"workshop letters\" to you after Caz stopped requiring them to be sent to him... so that led to a kind of asymmetrical experience where you might spend a lot of time trying to critique others' work but not getting the same support in return.  But this might be because there's less of a \"community\" via zoom.",
                "I honestly think there are really just strengths. The class is very enjoyable because you really focus on other people's stories along with your own and learn a lot through the large amount of reading and commenting you do.",
                "The class format is really helpful because it is a workshop - I was able to get\/give really detailed feedback for my classmates and from the professor.",
                "Strengths: Peers and Caz provide insightful feedback. The workshop structure is ideal.\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "Because students only write two stories in this course, there was less opportunity to improve my writing or explore many ideas. It would have been nice to write more stories. After workshops, each student sends a 1-page letter of feedback about your story. However, Professor Phillips does not send feedback until after you have submitted your final draft. I found this to be counter-intuitive, as I only had his verbal in-class comments to go off of. In previous creative writing classes I've taken, the professor will send a 1 or 2 page letter of feedback after a workshop to take into consideration for the final draft. This allowed me to learn and grow as a writer. I feel that I did not grow as a writer in this class."

That ran a little counter to the \"discussion\" aspect that makes seminars so engaging. This wasn't at all Caz's fault. I guess it's just hard for some students to stay focused when you have less of an in-person group dynamic and feeling of responsibility to others.. also it's a pandemic-specific situation",

Overall, I think the class this semester was chosen well, and created a really welcoming and helpful atmosphere.",

Going through the motions of writing, rewriting, and editing is critical, and Caz's frank feedback and expertise was invaluable.",

                "No, but perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I had not taken it during the pandemic. I don't think that Professor Phillips' teaching style jived well with how I learn best, but that is because each individual is different."
