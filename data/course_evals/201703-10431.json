   "comments": [
    "I learned to understand drawing as a full-body experience and as a physical activity. I learned to see in new ways, to deconstruct objects, masses, and bodies, and I learned to represent light and mass in both simple and complex manners and methods.",
    "I learned basic drawing skills, how to create strong compositions, and how to coordinate my hand and my eye.",
    "I improved my drawing skills and learned new ways to approach assignments.",
    "I learned how to draw circles and straight lines! Which is yes, important",
    "I learned how to draw more confidently and to appreciate the process of drawing.",
    "I learned how to experiment with the way I observe subject matter. I Learned how to use new mediums and combine them to make mixed media pieces. I also learned about abstraction and how it can still be based on observation.",
    "I had a great time taking this course. I am incredibly passionate and interested about art, and it was incredibly rewarding and beneficial for me to go back to the basics, and fully understand all concepts, both more structural and conceptual, to make a drawing. I was able to gain back basic drawing skills, which I am incredibly grateful for. Being in a drawing class, it is important that you learn from your classmates, and that is what I felt happened in this class-- I gained  so much from reviewing and studying my piers work through which I was able to gain deeper insights into what makes a good drawing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Rapid-fire and playful exercises get students energized, but many homework assignments feel overwhelming in comparison to classwork. Several repeated homework assignments give room for students to clearly see their own progress and understanding of a concept. The class can feel monotonous and dull for the first half, but the second half is worth the wait for the freedom to explore and to experiment.",
    "I wish I got more feedback on the work that I was doing. I really liked the pace of the class and the material covered.",
    "I think that giving the students more creative freedom within the assignments would encourage engagement and excitement about the projects.",
    "At the beginning you have to use china marker a lot and some of the work is a bit tedious. However, by the end of the semester this pays off and I really felt like my drawing improved.",
    "The course puts heavy emphasis on observation, which is very important to developing drawing skills. I like how it covered a broad range of mediums and subject matter. We were able to work from a live model during the second half of the semester (in high school, we did not work from live models until our third year). Since I already had drawing experience coming into the course, I found the first half of the semester pretty boring. We were not given a lot of creative freedom in our homework assignments, so I found it hard to push myself. I was more challenged during the second half of the semester, when we were taught to depict forms in different ways (contour lines, mass, negative space, etc.)."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, as I think it teaches long-term, practical drawing skills and makes you hyper-aware of your own actions and processes while drawing. It assumes no prior drawing experience, though most students in the class are already rather proficient in drawing. The class, on a whole, also makes the assumption that photorealistic drawing is the most valuable, and only technically worthy style of drawing.",
    "Yes, if they want to improve their drawing skills and take a good introductory course on art.",
    "I would recommend this course. While it does involve a lot of work, I feel like my drawing improved a lot, since I had never taken a formal drawing class before, but enjoyed doing it on my own.",
    "Yes, this course is great for beginners (and more experienced people too).",
    "No matter what level of drawing you have received, whether a beginner or very advanced, I definitely would recommend taking this course. Everyone is incredibly supportive of each others work, and you definitely learn so much from the professors and classmates. For me, it was great to go back to the basics of drawing, as I was able to fully practice the more simple parts (but still incredibly important) of a drawing-- the lines and shadows, while then being able to do more conceptual drawings, through which I was able to learn different aspects of drawing. One of the best parts of this course was the freedom you received, and I also felt that I had lots of support, both from the teachers and my piers."
