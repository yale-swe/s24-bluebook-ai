We read essays, reviews, and fiction, and discussed the traits of each piece of prose and how they fit the character of a particular magazine.

This class was so interesting and we had so many cool writers and editors come to speak to us. I loved all of the readings, the discussions were always interesting, and reading submissions for The Yale Review helped me build an important skillset and critical eye as both an editor and writer.",
