                "Strengths: interesting readings, guest speakers\r\nWeaknesses: assignments (see below), discussion format\r\nImprovements for assignments: for more engagement with the reading, consider replacing the case study and\/or final paper with short (2-3pg) reading responses. Or, consider assigning a draft of the final paper rather than the case study, then incorporating a week of paired or group peer review, and then having students submit a revised final version (this would also get students to start working on their papers earlier).  If keeping the case study, please provide more written feedback. The case study assignment was confusing for individuals who had not written a paper like that before (if the assignment is kept, please provide examples of acceptable case studies submitted by former students).\r\nImprovements for class discussion: circulate discussion questions in advance or at the beginning of class, encourage students to submit discussion questions. Enforce a time limit on the presentations to make time for discussion. Could also revise syllabus after learning about students' interests the first week, or asking students to submit readings to get them more engaged.",
                "This was a great introduction to the study of Law & Society. One of my criticisms is that some of the texts that felt foundational to the field were listed as optional, and we didn't receive sufficient exposure to them through the student presentations (E.g. the Rosenberg-McCann debate, Ewick and Silbey). Since this was a survey course I think some of us would have appreciated a little more moderation during discussion by the instructor (rather than by the student presenters). I appreciated that the course provided exposure to a range of methods and drew connections between the study of law and many other subfields in political science."
