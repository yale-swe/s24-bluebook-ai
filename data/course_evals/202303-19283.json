                "I was able to gain a deeper understanding of Japanese society, in regards to the Japanese Empire and its atrocities, and how it deeply affected modern society.",
                "I learned about Japanese society from the post-war period (and what that means) through modernity and engaged in a diversity of perspectives throughout these eras.",
                "Knowledge of postwar japanese history and culture, collective memory, historical trauma",
                "This course is a semester-long investigation of the forces shaping the culture, history, and politics of contemporary Japan, with a lens aimed at understanding the complexities surrounding Japan's relationship to its imperial past and how these tangled narratives continue to shape the country's identity and geopolitical relationships with neighboring nations. In doing so, students are trained to think critically about the processes by which certain questions get rebirthed and reinterpreted with each generation without oversimplifying their analyses.",
                "I gained a better understanding of modern Japanese culture as well as the social and economic landscape of postwar Japan. I feel like I am more well read about the pacific theater of World War II, and I know more about the nuances of war responsibility and victimhood."

            "comments": [
                "The course is a seminar time-wise but is taught like a seminar, which made the long class period a little frustrating.",
                "This was a really strong course, Professor Koga & Shoko were both great! I liked the choice of readings & films and the weekly responses were a great way to critically reflect on them.",
                "The Professor was wonderful and always opened the class up to new perspectives and interpretations of Japans history. It was a great class!",
                "This course was one of my favorite I've ever taken at Yale. \r\nStrengths: Professor Koga is a saint! She helped give me perspective on how to take Anthropology courses, and how to do deeper research on subjects of interest to me. Additionally, she gave me an understanding of how to engage with a region that I've studied heavily in different ways.",
                "The strengths are that Yukiko and Shoko were wonderful instructors and always willing to personally interact with students, the course material was extremely interesting, and the class environment was conducive to good discussion. The group project and essays also were fun, low-stress assignments. The weakness is that 1 hour-50 minute lecture style classes could feel a little long at times, and that it was difficult for both the group project and essay to be due the day we came back from October Recess.",
                "Strengths: Yukiko is a wonderful professor! She is sweet, funny, and very passionate about her work. She curates a wonderful syllabus with extremely interesting readings and movies. The workload is also very be eh manageable, so it never feels like a chore. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found that the short 1-page essays made it harder to engage with the material than a normal longer paper. I know brevity is the point of the exercise, but I personally like being able to piece my thoughts together and find new connections as I write, but the 1-pagers arent really conducive to that.",
                "This course's strength lies in the rich selection of sources that the students engage with each week. From films to journal articles to book chapters, students are encouraged to consider historical debates from a myriad of perspectives, each with their own nuances, strengths, and weaknesses. In doing so, the course pushes students to be better scholars of history and of people. However, the format of the classes felt a little bit strange - given the impressive breadth of perspectives explored by my peers' reflection posts each week, I wish we had dedicated time in class to break into small groups and engage with each other more, in addition to the collaboration necessary for the midterm project. I also wish we could have obtained feedback on some of our weekly discussion posts prior to the midterm and final essays to better focus our anthropologist's lens, so to speak.",
                "this class needs to have slides. extremely slow moving and hard to keep focus. it's not a seminar, it's more of a lecture, and to not have slides is honestly just really lazy on the part of the instructor",
                "Strengths: very interesting material, loved the focus on films as well as readings, and overall enjoyed discussing the topics of the course\r\nWeaknesses: the class was too large  I felt that engaging discussions were few and far between, and the class ended up being more of a lecture. I also thought the essay formats (1 page) were very limiting and did not allow for thoughtful discussion or analysis of course topics"

                "Yes! It was intellectually challenging, but the workload was not high. Professor Koga challenges you to think outside of the box.",
                "Definitely! Even if you are not an experienced anthropologist or historian (Im not!), there is a lot to enjoy here. Low work, great professor, really interesting course material. I feel like Ive learned a lot and I really enjoyed it!!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Japanese history, East Asian international relations, or the politics of accountability in general. Although we mostly focused on how Japan confronted (or failed to confront) its imperial history, many of the questions and tensions presented in the class are applicable to the bloody history of the United States as well. As we discovered in the first few weeks of class, the U.S. was responsible for shielding Emperor Hirohito and empowering the LDP, resulting in cascading consequences that continue to this day, and yet we do little to confront the evils caused by our own imperialism in the modern day.",
                "no",
                "Yes! I would say if you are interested in the topic and looking to be engaged in the course, then absolutely! If you are just looking for a credit and dont have an interest in or a connection to the material, then maybe dont take this course."
