                "I learned a ton about the American Musical Theater in the past 100 years. Although the course sometimes felt like a whilwind, it was awesome being able to look at musical theater through an interdisciplinary lens. We spent a lot of time thinking about the evolving trends in musical theater, with influences from popular culture, the commercial industry, events of the time, etc. The course was both broad enough to give an overview of those trends, but specific enough to do really interesting analysis of individual shows. I developed the tools to write about and critique musical theater and expanded my thinking about the role that musical theater has in human culture.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: So many strengths in this class -- getting to learn about/listen to incredible scores, in-depth discussions with a great group of people, Professor Egan and his wide breadth of knowledge, etc. Listening to 2-6 scores a week can be daunting and requires a bit of time management, but it was the best kind of homework. Weaknesses: Not much to be done about this, but there were so many shows that I wish we could have talked about for longer, though as a once a week, one semester survey, that is inevitable. Maybe doing some informal and ungraded writing assignments about a few shows would be a nice lead-in into the bigger papers, but that's all I could think of re: improvements. I had so many thoughts about the shows that we studied and only so much that I could share and articulate on the spot.",
                "I wish there could be a two-semester musical theater history sequence to cover more shows.",
                "The only weakness this course might have had was that the pace of the course was so fast and it often was hard to keep track of all of the insights shared by my classmates and the professor. Otherwise, the course was awesome  great readings, insightful and provocative discussions, and well-organized classes.",
                "Strengths: The students in the class are selected based on their backgrounds and experiences Each student offers a unique perspective during class discussion. Dan is incredibly prepared, so classes are very organized and interesting. \r\n\r\nCons: none",
                "The course is seminar sized but structured like a lecture. Because it only meets once a week, there is a lot of material to cover, but it might be worthwhile to incorporate 30-45 minutes of open discussion each week.  While we engaged with the texts and with Professor Egan, there was little opportunity to engage with the other students, and I wish some component of the course were collaborative. Often it felt like the professor was posing questions in search of specific answers which didn't allow us to engage creatively and critically with the texts and the new ideas we may have brought to the discussion. The course also claimed on the syllabus to pursue critical perspectives on the often problematic history of American Musical Theatre, but unfortunately these discussions were often left for the last five minutes of class and treated as footnotes."

                "Yes!!! Probably the best class I've taken so far at Yale. Even if you don't know a ton about musical theater, this class can teach so much about how to look at theater and music, and it places everything into historical context. I came in knowing a few musicals really well but not much about the greater MT tradition, and I now feel like I could talk about any one of the shows that we covered for hours. The assignments rarely felt like work (mostly listening to musicals -- the exception being the papers, which were open-ended enough that you could pretty much write about anything), and the classes themselves were really fun and flew by so quickly.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who likes musical theater.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone with either a passing interest in musical theater or who is majoring in theater and has taken other Shen courses. It would be a shame to graduate from Yale without taking a course with Prof. Egan, and you will be exposed to so many muscials you didn't even know existed!",
                "If you are interested in the subject matter, you will find it interesting.",
                "100%. I applied for this class on a whim and it was easily the best decision of my first semester at Yale.",
                "If you are interested in musical theater, take this course! This class completely changed how I think about American Musical Theater. Take a class with Dan before you leave Yale!",
                "Yes. As a student of theater, music, or culture in general, the knowledge of the American theatrical canon gained in this course is well structured and comprehensive. Students needed to make a strong effort to have their perspectives heard, and be prepared to defend their points of view with contextual evidence from assigned readings and plays."
