                "I gained fluent knowledge of GSR data and how to read it for legibility. I became far more familiar with research protocols and how research is funded and approved. Working in this lab felt as if it was really preparing me to work in similar research settings in the future. I'm excited about the relationship that I've started to build with this lab and sincerely look forward to continuing to work with my team.",

                "Was responsible for conducting studies with children 6-8 y\/o observing qualities of childrens persistence, motivation, and learning. took part in weekly meetings evaluating L3s future research paths. helped create and design visual test stimuli used in studies with children day to day. analyzed data using R to observe correlations between specific test pedagogies and childrens learning experiences. developed skills pertaining to literature review and was able to grow immensely in how i hope to frame my future aspirations in the field of psych with the help of this lab's amazing mentors."

I think that the course itself allows for significant flexibility in terms of how you conduct your work, so I feel as if I certainly was able to accommodate my work really well with this lab. The only thing that I would find fault in is that this can be an incredibly intimidating path to embark on, but I was incredibly lucky that my lab was super supportive and wanted to see me succeed as an assistant. I felt incredibly valued and so grateful to be in this lab.",
                "Its always very good to have experience in research projects and this class was ideal for this purpose",
                "Everyone is amazing. Weaknesses are that I didnt join the lab until now",
                "had a great conversation during my last mentor meeting about this, so won't go into great detail but i just can't emphasize enough how much i appreciate how communication-oriented the LLL is! It has helped me become the best team member I can be and also given me incredible tools to use for personal and academic and professional growth."
