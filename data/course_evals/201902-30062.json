    "Strengths: This course was absolutely amazing and mind-blowing. I think this course should be a requirement for every student. I loved our discussions and Professor Camacho's lectures, where we connected historical moments to certain topics related to race. I liked our discussions looking at the present day, especially those incorporating current news items. This class does have its fair share of reading, but the reading is always very interesting and informative. We dispel a lot of the myths associated with the United States that are still taught in classes today, and I really appreciated this. This is honestly one of the most informative and realistic history courses you'll ever take.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the class was a little disorganized, and I wish we had been able to cover more topics in depth, but I understand that this was an intro course so we couldn't cover everything. Also, I feel like we could have covered more topics outside of the United States, but I understand that that would have been very difficult because of the time constraint.",
    "The duration was too short, leading the material to be extremely condense. Designating more time."

    "Yes. The professor was amazing.",
    "Absolutely! This class should be a requirement for every student. You will learn more in this course in two weeks than you've ever probably learned in any history course. American history is inseparable from issues related to ethnicity, race, and migration, and it really should not be taught separately. I liked that we looked at American history through the lens of marginalized people, those voices usually relegated to the sidelines. I think it was important in relating past issues to the present day.",
