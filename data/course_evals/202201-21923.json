                "Loved this course. Learned how to take a logical approach to ethics, build arguments that are valid, and write clear papers.",
                "I learned how to read philosophy papers and reconstruct their arguments. This was a completely new style of writing for me and professor Daigle was so helpful in introducing us to it.",
                "This class really helped me develop the ability to synthesize arguments in clear steps and analyze them in that form, rather than in large text blocs. It also taught me a great deal about different conceptions of animal ethics and the principles and difficulties involved in attempting to create a working framework. Great class!",

                "This course taught me how to thoughtfully construct and evaluate arguments, and also gave me a thorough overview of the current animal rights\/ethics literature. I feel as though the bulk of what I came away with, though, is a very improved understanding of how to create strong philosophical arguments.",
                "I gained a thorough survey to historical and modern questions in animal ethics. I also learned more about eudaimonist virtue ethics, utilitarianism, and modern non-analytical (mystical, literary, and empathetic) approaches to studying human and animal ethics and experiences."

                "I think the readings are really well chosen, the classes were well-structured, and Jennifer is a really upbeat and helpful instructor.  I think the structure of the classes was really the highlight, as we did a lot of different groupings and sizes of discussion groups.",
                "I loved the material and class discussions, but I felt that the class was pretty disorganized. Due dates, especially for papers, changed many times, but the syllabus posted on canvas was not updated to reflect these changes. Paper prompts were posted very late, and we got our papers back late as well. I felt that feedback on papers was often unclear. We were required to attend short meetings for our papers which was fine, but there was a paper workshop at the beginning of the semester that went well over time (it was like 2.5 hours). Similarly, class went over time almost every session, and we rarely got our promised break. I was more constrained in the structure of my paper than I've ever been in a philosophy class; we got paragraph-by-paragraph instructions on our papers. This would have been helpful for an introductory philosophy class, but felt very constricting for an advanced seminar.",
                "The strengths of this class was its structure! The handouts really helped me write the papers. No weaknesses",
                "This was a great class start to finish! The seminars were run really well and engagingly, and everyone was encouraged to participate in what were very interesting discussions. The material itself was really stimulating and diverse, and the assignments were clear and thoughtful, with clear feedback and very understanding reception of student concerns and circumstances. A must-take!",
                "The structure \/ trajectory of the course was really great. I also found the handouts extremely helpful, especially at the beginning of the course!",
                "Strengths: some great minds in that class who really took the arguments and wrestled with them",
                "There were genuinely no weaknesses at all.  The course was fascinating, engaging, superbly informative, and a lot of fun."

                "I would if you're interested in animal ethics - personally I am interested in animal welfare (have interned at some animal welfare orgs) and have enjoyed past philosophy courses, but found a couple weeks into class I didn't really care about which philosophical argument for better treatment of animals I thought was right, just that animals should be treated better.  soooo I would make sure you really want to look at the different arguments for animals",
                "Yes, the material is very interesting if you can deal with a bit of disorganization and are willing to stay after class ends 99% of the time!",
                "Yes definitely. Most of the student in the class were vegan or otherwise personally interested in the topic, which made for a really passionate and engaged environment. (Plus I got to meet a lot of likeminded students!) Was super cool to take a logical approach to a topic I care about so deeply in my own life.",
                "Yes! I think it is so important that this course is being taught. I dont think there is any other course being taught that addresses these issues so I really hope it is being taught again in the future. Professor Daigle is amazing and I learned so much from her. She always made herself available to students and is very understanding.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in animal ethics, even without any philosophy background. The discussions were philosophical, but also practical, and accessible to anyone with or without an extensive background in the subject. Jennifer is awesome, a great teacher, and very receptive to students' struggles and concerns. This is a gem!",
                "Yes, Animal Ethics today was a very well taught class with interesting readings and a fantastic instructor.",

                "Yes! Professor Daigle gives clear and helpful feedback to really facilitate growth.",
                "Yes! As someone who really cares about human-animal relationships, think this class is relevant to anyone with even the slightest interest in animal ethics. Also, I would recommend this to anyone hoping to improve their argument-construction abilities.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I've actually recommended it to any other students I talk to about it! I would recommend this course to anyone interested in philosophy, psychology, environmental science, or any area of biology or medicine that involves animal research."
