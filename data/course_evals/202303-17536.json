                "I really felt like this course challenged me to break the mold of going through the motions in Yale courses. It challenged me to connect STEM and the humanities in a way I have never considered and made me remember the passion that made me first interested in biomedical concepts and the real people it affects. You learn to think outside the box, or of how science could affect the world rather than what can possibly be invented. Professor Radin as a human being also taught me a lot about being grounded in shared humanity even when dealing with what feels objective and scientific.",

I gained new insight on the way we think about and talk about science, and the very valid critiques of some ways that science is practiced, regulated (or not) and promoted. I also had the chance, through my final project, to explore an area of my own life that I found challenging and think about it in a new and different way, which was very fulfilling.",

                "i think it was hard at first grasping the ideas of the course or how they were going to connect . but i loved how different this content was and i dont think i will ever get the chance to have taken a class like this ever again",
                "N/A",
                "The primary strength of this course is not having to worry about your grade - if you do your work and go to the discussion sections, you'll get an A. However, this can also be a weakness, seeing how few people actually came to the lectures and how it felt like less of a priority to me because I didn't have to worry about a grade.",
                "Strengths: space to think freely and creatively led to extremely meaningful reflections on my education, society, and life; the Otherwise Project allowed me to explore the significance of feelings; the range of topics covered in the readings and lecture gave me room to connect ideas together that I may have never otherwise realized\r\nNo weaknesses!",
                "ALL STRENGTHS: Prof. Radin and my TA (Dalena) are the best. The course really is meant to support you while you learn incredibly interesting topics on control, power, and authority (and as they relate to Michael Crichton and technology)",
                "Strengths- Professor. TA. Otherwise project\r\nWeakness- The amount of readings can be overwhelming",
                "Pros:\r\nI think that Professor Radin is a huge strength. Her passion for the subject shined bright this semester. Having no exams allowed me to truly absorb and think about the material in the way that I wanted to, not the way I NEEDED to in order to regurgitate info and pass a test. \r\nCons:\r\nUnfortunately with Zoom it was easier to disengage, but I hope Prof R. knows that this hugely helped accessibility, student mental health, and overall positivity. Sometimes the readings were tangential to larger topics which could be frustrating.",
                "The strengths are the TAs. The weaknesses are Professor Radin and the designs of the class.",
                "Strength: Prof. Radin and the teaching team, who were willing to take a risk and teach a course in a different manner than any other course I have taken at Yale. Weakness: majority of the class taking advantage of the course structure to not really do anything and still get the grade they wanted.",
                "Strengths were the super chill assignments, very understanding professor and TAs. Weaknesses were that some of the lectures were confusing and didn't really seem to fit together well. The first half of the semester was engaging but the topics got progressively worse. WAY too many readings. The prof wanted us to read entire books every other week, plus 3-4 other readings on top of that. You could tell that by the end of the semester no one was reading them. I'd recommend cutting down the readings by half so that people actually might read them",
                "I love Prof. Radin's lecture style and the content that she has brought together for the class. I appreciated that the course was about so much more than the works and life of Michael Crichton - it is about the larger global context of STEM and studying how technology has shaped our world and perception of the future, for the better or worse.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that was saddening was the low engagement in the course among some of my peers. I wish that they took the class as seriously as it was meant to be taken. The quality of the discussions in sections and general class engagement would have been much higher.",
                "Professor Radin's lectures were the highlight of my semester. She weaves a uniquely intricate narrative of the history of science alongside cultural themes of the late 20th century, all built upon the backbone of Michael Crichton's works. Strengths: the lectures, readings, reading responses, and flexible assignments. Weaknesses: discussion sections were sometimes dry if not very many students did the readings; part of me wishes that we had an opportunity for some sort of cumulative reflection or synthesis of the course content separate from the Otherwise project. My mind was blown every lecture, but I struggle to summarize the main takeaways from the course.",
                "I like the flexibility we were given with the work, specifically how we could use our feelings to guide our assignments - this is something I have yet to experience in a class. Sometimes, I found it difficult to engage because the course content could be quite abstract.",
                "To be honest, I really loved the flexibility that this course offered, although I concede that maybe it was too flexible in the sense that the incentive to go to class live was low. I went to most every class and saw the difference that it made when there was a full lecture hall versus a near empty one.",
                "Strengths: interesting concepts, allowed students to just learn and find curious topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish it was a bit more structured with topics/timeline",
                "Make this class a seminar. This is the guttiest gut I have ever taken at Yale, and I think it would really benefit from being a seminar. Almost a waste of a credit.",
                "Professor Radin was a major strength  it is unique to have a course that isn't premised around deadlines and student stress. That said, it was a tough balance in terms of creating incentives for people to engage.",
                "Strengths - reading material was varied and really interesting. The class puts the students' health as a priority which was refreshing. Discussion posts were flexible with their content. Prof Radin was really caring. Weaknesses - not many, just some weeks the reading was a lot more than manageable.",
                "The course was extremely interesting and low pressure compared to other classes at Yale. Even though this was a class, I felt like once I entered the lecture hall or section, I was taking a break by being in such a welcoming environment.",
                "Dr. Radin's lectures are amazing, so engaging and entertaining! The readings are fascinating, and when I had the time to complete all of them it was very fulfilling because of how they connected and built in unexpected ways. This is definitely a class where it seems extremely disconnected at first, but as you go along the patterns and connections start to emerge and at the end it's really satisfying to look back at where you've been.\r\n\r\nOne thing that could be improved with the reading schedule would be to spread out Crichton's works a bit more, so that they are being read earlier in the semester. Parable of the Sower was an excellent and topical read as well, but it came so close to the end of the semester that few people read it, so we couldn't really discuss it in section to the extent I would have liked, I would also have enjoyed watching more visual media associated with the weekly topics, whether that was some more of his films, or other documentaries or television shows that were connected in some way.",
                "Some may say that a weakness is the attendance and engagement, so perhaps making lectures mandatory and leaving all else unchanged could solve that problem. Maybe you sign in with the TA or fill out a QR code before each class.",
                "Hybrid format was great, needs to be a way to hold students that are not present in class accountable but otherwise it was good.",
                "Good",

                "I really enjoyed the lectures and found them extremely interesting. Professor Radin is clearly passionate about the topics in the course, and she had so many interesting facts to share. The readings were also good, however there were too many assigned each week to do all of them. Overall, I really loved the course though.",
                "no weaknesses. amazing course",
                "This course was very accommodating and flexible based on the needs of the students.",
                "This course was fantastic. Professor Radin did an excellent job making this course an opportunity to learn a great deal without having to worry about your grade being negatively impacted. Her lectures were very interesting and worthwhile to attend live. The sections were also very engaging and allowed you to express any view you had on that week's readings. Caitlin was a great TF. Lastly, the main otherwise assignment is a very rewarding one in that you develop your thoughts over the course of the semester and have the opportunity to tailor it to your passions and desires.",
                "Strengths: Joanna and the TFs (especially Estrella) HANDS DOWN. They are such a wonderful, supportive, communicative team and it was such a pleasure to have them this semester. The course is very well organized and easy to follow along, and the assignments were spaced out well. I got very clear, personal feedback on my assignments in a very timely fashion, and it was very easy to meet with Joanna/the TFs for office hours or outside of class."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was an incredible experience and I felt like I really learned something because I didn't have to scribble down notes every lecture and try to cram ideas. The lectures were well organized and the teaching team was receptive to feedback.",
                "Absolutely!! This was genuinely a life-changing course. I've always had my theories about the reality of fiction and imagination, and this course not only confirmed that those ideas are worth thinking about, but that they're actually extremely influential on a large scale. Crichton was our case study, but \"men of letters\" doing something \"profitable\" about \"science\" is something I see everywhere after taking this course. Can't recommend it enough! If you're interested in looking at history, literature, policy, artificial intelligence, medicine, public health, psychology, or anything like that in a meta way, this is the perfect class for you!",
                "YES, best course I've taken here at Yale, hands-down. The course content is extremely interesting, and the teaching team are incredibly supportive.",
                "Definitely recommend",
                "Absolutely. Although Prof R. is likely finished with her Crichton project, she is an excellent professor that really cares about her student's wellbeing and success. Seek her out at Yale and beyond! She is a once-in-a-lifetime professor and person. I wish I couldve spent more time in OH getting to ask her questions.",
                "No. This class was a lot like a Mega Church. There was a lot of buzz around it and big crowds, but it was spiritually empty. The professor spent the first 15 minutes of each class complaining about attendance or trying to talk about TikTok. Then in the rest of the class, she would vaguely mention the readings in ways that hardly engaged with their material. If you want a class you don't have to go to ever, I guess I would recommend it, but beyond that no.",
                "I would, but only if you wanted to really engage with it and learn from it. If you just want to get an easy credit, I understand (I've taken classes for that very reason too) but unfortunately it takes away from the quality of the class. If you really dive into the class and put some effort into thinking about what the class is about, you can really learn a lot or at least be challenged to think differently.",
                "Yes, very chill class. But you have to be willing to discuss difficult topics and engage in discussion sections",
                "Yes! Many people treat it as a gut but I would recommend that you actually do the readings and engage with the coursework to get the maximum you can out of it. The TFs and Prof. Radin are a treasure at Yale.",
                "Yes!!! It's definitely a low-workload course and it's one of those, you get out what you put in kind of classes. I did a handful of the readings and got a lot out of it. The questions Prof. Radin raised will definitely stick with me. I also enjoyed doing the Otherwise project. It wasn't intimidating and could be pretty much anything you wanted. It was refreshing to have a class like this especially senior fall.",
                "YES! While this iteration of the course will not be taught again, I would highly recommend anything taught by Professor Radin.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is a flexible class where you get to read a few cool novels by Crichton.",
                "Yes absolutely. Although it is my understanding that this course will no longer be taught which is sad. This course gave you the ability to explore thoughts about your life and \"biomedical futures\" in an academic sense that you wouldn't have likely had time to do otherwise.",
                "Yes. The lectures were interesting!",
                "Yes, it was very interesting and made me think about the world differently. Very cool class overall!",
                "No; too gutty to the point of brain rot. If you're a STEM major taking a heavy workload and are trying to get a 5th class for an easy A, this would be a great class to take, but if you are someone who is looking for an interesting class to take, this is not the one for you.",
                "Yesit was low-stress and the material was interesting. You are not going to get anything out of the class if you don't do the readings, participate in section, or attend lecture. Don't miss the opportunity to get involved.",
                "Absolutely! If the structure of the class stays the same... it was really beneficial to learn in this environment, free of pressure, and it brought up some interesting thoughts around biomedicine and speculative fiction that I would have never engaged with otherwise.",
                "Yes, Professor Radin is amazing!!",

It's also the kind of class that I didn't expect myself to enjoy so much (as I had never been a big science fiction person or, admittedly, ever heard of Michael Crichton before this class).",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone looking to examine their own relationship to science and medicine, and willing to think critically about why they believe what they believe. Although there are no real penalties for *not* doing the reading, I highly recommend reserving this class for a semester where you have the time to fully engage with the material (and attend the lecture even though it's recorded!) because in particular for this class, you really get out what you put in. And there is so much to get out if you put in the effort!",
                "I would. It allows you to read very interesting work and think about the world and technological advancement in new ways.",
                "I think I would. The course talked a lot about the history of literature and art in the face and in conjuncture with technological advancements of the post-WWII world which was honestly really cool to see where the culture was outside oi just the social and the scientific and how people in the broader society responded to it.",
                "Absolutely not, waste of 1/36 of Yale. Dont take if you want to think, want to be challenged. It would be moving in the wrong direction for you just about whoever you are",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, this is one of the best courses at Yale.",
                "Yes because it was interesting",
                "I would! Especially for someone who is looking to be engaged in a course that teaches you abstract information.",
                "Yes, 100%. The information was so interesting and Prof Radin really emphasized the importance of learning over cramming for a grade. I feel that I will retain what I learned from this class.",
                "yes. best course to take ever at yale",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student looking to learn more about themselves as we navigate college.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Radin is an outstanding professor who clearly cares about her students. The course itself is unique in the way it questions science and raises valid points regarding how dangerous it can be to the world. I have never quite had a class at Yale which, not only allowed but, promoted this level of freedom to question practically anything. The readings were often entertaining, and I am leaving this class with an understanding of a wide variety of topics I previously knew nothing about.",
                "YES. Loved this class so much. Please take it if you can get in!!!",
                "Absolutely! While it's unlikely to run again, it was a fantastic experience.",
                "Yes. It was a great introduction to Science and Technology studies--to reimagine how we interact with technology and how things might be otherwise.",
                "Yes, definitely",
                "Yes, it was a chill yet interesting and thought-provoking course where the lectures and readings each week would encourage us to think about various phenomena and aspects of the future. What you put in is what you get out of the class, but theres something useful and interesting for everyone."
