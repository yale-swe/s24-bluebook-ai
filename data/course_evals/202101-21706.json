With such a broad course, it is bound to happen that not every reading will interest every student, but I think Prof. Shanahan should identify the pieces that elicited little to no response from the class and try to replace those with more engaging scholarship.",

As a History major who specializes in U.S. political history, I was surprised to find that a solid portion of the material was new to me. As a broad overview of citizenship policy and inclusion and exclusion in American history, the class offers valuable frameworks and new angles for thinking through U.S. social, political, and legal history. The readings were often enlightening but occasionally dull or redundant. The term paper is a great opportunity to apply the course themes to a single case study or historiographical issue that you're passionate about.",
