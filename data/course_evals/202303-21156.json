                "Strengths: the course covered a lot of ground in terms of the diversity of the theories it references. Students get exposed to a wide range of thought across several adjacent disciplines. \r\nWeaknesses: the corollary to this strength is that the course felt a little all over the place. Many of our seminars were spent essentially listening to Prof. Wyrtzen share his thoughts and musings about the topic, and often not on the topic. As a result, the quality of class discussions was lacking and there were very few opportunities for students to engage in discussion with one another rather than just sharing their thoughts with the professors. It also took way too much time to get feedback on our reading responses, and the feedback was often very minimal. \r\nI wish there had been more of an effort to tie the different readings and theories together beyond writing papers that are supposed to place them in conversation with one another.",
                "So poorly structured.",
                "strengths: i like the seminar style where i get to talk to my classmates in small groups about what we learnt / hear from each other's experiences. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: felt that the course was too ambitious, and tried to study too much content. it was insane to keep up with the heavy workload each week which presented a new topic and 3 new readings that were 15-30pages long each PLUS weekly discussion posts. maybe tone down the discussion posts and have them be mandatory for 3/4 of the term.",
                "The strengths of this course was the seminar formatting, which allowed for students to dissect the readings together and come to interesting and often diverging conclusions. I also appreciated how the seminar was began with background information, which set up well-informed conversations. The readings were the only part that could be improved, sometimes they were a bit long, which may have detracted from students' ability to absorb and understand all of the material."

                "yes absolutely! my first sociology class ever taken and it was a great intro to learning how to think in terms of systems and society -- also as an EVST major, I quite enjoyed looking at the environment from a different lens",
                "This is an amazing course for introducing people involved with environmental studies to the world of sociology. Not so much the other way around.",
                "NO. RUN. This class is not engaging at all. I got no grades until the reading period.",
                "i would recommend this course if you are interested in having your perspective challenged from various angles as the course is very interdisciplinary -- global studies, sociology studies, geographical > environmental studies. i would not recommend this course if you are looking for a skills-based or values-based course. it is heavily theoretical and conceptual, and can be abstract at times.",
