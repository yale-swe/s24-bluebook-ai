Through this immersion, I was able to learn a lot about Japanese culture, language, and people, in a way I never thought I could before. I properly learned, and retained, new knowledge of grammar structures and kanji formation, and I was able to communicate new thoughts and expressions to my classmates!",

                "The course was structured to facilitate learning - I learned a lot every single week and the assignments were fun to do.",
                "Strong  format of course is strong, regular homework was engaging and challenging. Learned a lot, classroom environment was great for language learning and trying new grammar and words. \r\nWeaknesses - only thing i would've liked more of would be maybe vocabulary quizzes",
                "Strengths: Professor Stever was an amazing teacher. The course was well organized and I learned a lot.",
                "Overall, the material in this course is very strong and there's basically nothing I can think of that can be improved. Perhaps the one improvement could be to include more out-of-class collaboration. I think the entire class wants to get to know each other, they just need to be given a method to so. At one point in the year, everyone's just sitting in the same seats for the rest of the year so it's hard to get to know people from the other side of classroom. I think full-class activities, out-of-class activities, or maybe making people move seats throughout semester could make this easier.",
                "STRENGTHS: solid language class, you learn at a pretty fast pace but it's rewarding \/\/ WEAKNESSES: this class was oversubscribed the semester I took it (18 students in a class that should've been capped at 12), so I wish we got more speaking practice. Other than that, class was good",
                "It is very intense in that students have classes and homework every day, so I did feel like I laid a solid foundation of the language. Classes are usually very interesting. Feedback is very prompt.",
                "the small class size lent to plenty of time to practice my Japanese in the classroom. The teacher was very kind and encouraged student engagement."
