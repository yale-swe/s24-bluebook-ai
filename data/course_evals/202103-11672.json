                "Strengths: Interesting subject material, great TAs, engaging lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Balancing the final paper and final exam was tough; it would have been nice to have a graded rough draft for the final paper assignment, or have some other way of spacing out the work at the end of the term.",
                "Strengths: tons of resources for studying and it's very very organized.  The lectures are extremely clear and pretty engaging even when the content is a bit dry in nature.  The slides are perfect.  The class assignments are the right level of challenging.  The professor is very thoughtful and clearly cares about his students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  I think it's a little much for a lecture class in terms of weekly workload.  Two sets of readings, an ID quiz, two lectures and a section is a lot.  I also think the class should do away with either the final exam or final paper, or at least water them down.  These are minor complaints though.",
                "Professor Johnson is an amazing lecturer, he is so kind and knowledgeable",
                "Possibly the best course I have taken at Yale, as a philosophy major.",
                "Strengths: passionate professor and TFs, weekly quizzes that keep students on top of their studying, lots and lots of material. Weaknesses: lots and lots of material",
                "In addition to being very clear and fun to learn, this is probably the most engaging lecture course available at Yale. The course staff's dedication to teaching this is amazing. Prof. Johnston graded all our assessments personally (except for the quizzes, which were only checked by the TAs) and offered a lot of help with figuring out research questions, outlines, etc.",
                "good lecture",
                "This course covers a lot of material that can be quite interesting to students. However, so much material makes it hard to fully read and understand the course content while balancing it with other courses.",
                "This course is very well-organized and the material is well-presented. Weekly quizzes ensure that students kept on track of \"the facts,\" while the exams and writing assignments emphasize critical engagement with the texts. Discussion sections are also helpful for reviewing main ideas and applying them through different avenues such as debates and simulations.",
                "Strength: amazing instructor. ACJ is simply an incredibly professor, one of the most knowledgeable, passionate, articulate, caring and intelligent professors i have ever met.",
                "I really enjoyed this class. The greatest strength is Professor Johnstons lectureshe is truly an engaging lecturer and was so fascinating to listen to. I cant think of any weaknesses.",
                "This course was taught incredibly well. The only weakness was that lectures would go over very often (only because of how excited Professor Johnston was by the material), meaning we often had to watch additional recorded lectures to make up for this on our own time. This was somewhat time-consuming. I also think having a final research paper AND final in-class essay-based exam was a bit much.",
                "I had no issues with this course",
                "Lectures and readings were excellent and always pertinent. Perhaps, sections were not always needed and extra reading made them an additional burden. It would have been better to focus on the material from lecture in discussion sections as well. Also, research paper plus a final exam is a big burden.",
                "Strengths - you learn so much, the course material is genuinely engaging, great professor\r\n\r\nWeakness - workload is a little high if you're taking this just out of interest",
                "One very strong weakness is that there is a midterm paper AND a midterm exam right after (within days). The same with the final. It was extremely hard to finish both efficiently.",
                "Strengths: the amount of material about Ancient Rome you will learn is incredible, Professor Johnston really cares about the material, so you are confident he is giving you the best insights available. Weaknesses: the sheer amount of material can also be a bit overwhelming. You will likely not be able to do all of the assigned readings , and preparing for the exams can be daunting. Yet, in the end his expectations for the exams are quite reasonable.",
                "Strength: 1) The materials were very interesting. As someone more interested in 20th century history, I thought I wouldn't enjoy the course as much, but Rome turned out fascinating and very exciting to learn about. 2) I also enjoyed how we discussed not just the political and military history of Rome but also its cultural developments. 3) Professor Johnston is absolutely amazing. He is a highly engaging lecturer, and he is also personally engaged in every aspect of the course, which is rare with undergrad courses.\r\nWeakness: This may or may not be a weakness depending on the person, but the course was heavily loaded with information. The professor was very passionate and knowledgeable, but to the point that we pretty much never finished the lecture materials in class, and he had to make additional recordings in order to finish them. Personally I enjoyed learning all these materials and loved the additional recordings, but this could definitely be a pain to someone less interested in the class.",
                "the lectures were usually very interesting and thorough and i enjoyed them. once in a while it would feel like we spent too much time on a topic though and then didn't have as much time for other topics, i wish we didn't have to rush through the last lecture on the fall if the republic.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Johnston is an engaging lecturer, the material is interesting overall, and he was able to transition seamlessly from in-person to online throughout the semester.\r\nWeaknesses: Not totally sure what the point of sections was, had no real direction on final papers, and the readings were mostly unnecessary for tests and quizzes.  Also, no feedback on quizzes was a tad annoying.",
                "This class had very engaging lectures with interesting subject material and presentation. I thought the professor and TAs were great. Reading was reasonable and valuable, though occasionally a bit dry in my opinion. The only real weakness that comes to mind is that, because there was so much material to cover, we often wouldn't get through everything in a single lecture, so some content would get pushed to extended video lectures.",
                "The course is very well structured with supportive TAs and an enthusiastic professor. Professor Johnston's lectures are always engaging, and his choice to provide us with lecture handouts and the slides that he used was very helpful. The readings could be a bit overwhelming, however, and I think it might have been worthwhile to give more primary readings and fewer secondary ones.",
                "Way too much reading material, too many words on slides.",
                "The lectures are extremely engaging, but the readings sometimes are so long that they are hard to keep up (although not completely necessary to keep up with lecture)."

Republican Rome has broad relevance for anyone who's interested in the societies of Europe or the Americas since colonization (as well as Middle East\/North Africa). You only need to read the first political speech or opinion piece available to see that the Roman past still lives in our world. Regardless of the motivation for your interest (or lack thereof) in Rome, this is simply a wonderful class to attend. However, it involves a lot of reading (on the level you might expect in a serious undergraduate seminar) and a significant amount of writing with minimal prompts.",

It covers an immense amount of content at a good pace and you really come away feeling like you learned something. Professor Johnston is immensely knowledgeable and he clearly loves the subject matter.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It is one of my favorite history lectures Ive taken. As I said, Professor Johnston is not to miss and his lectures are always interesting.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to another student. This class was a delight and was not very difficult. You can easily get by without doing most of the readings if you so chose, and the class itself didn't have too much work. At the same time, it was highly engaging and the lectures were very interesting.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The lecture content of the course is deeply interesting and engaging, and you learn not only pure history but also the historiography of ancient Rome. As a non history\/ classics major, this was new yet fascinating to me to learn about. Professor Johnson is a wonderful professor. His lectures are enrapturing and really pull you into the subject matter. His is also a wonderfully kind person. This class was one of the most interesting and rewarding that I have taken this semester, and I cannot recommend it enough to other students.",
                "Yes absolutely",
                "Absolutely, Professor Johnston explains the material very well, and the discussion sections are engaging and helpful. If you want to learn about the Roman Republic, take this course.",
                "Yes, most certainly, especially if they are interested in the birth of Rome and in gaining valuable tools for engaging with history in a meaningful way.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course if you're interested in Rome and ready to handle a heavy course work!",
                "No personally I think it had too many midterm and final assignments, the lectures were also too long.",
                "If you are at all interested in the Roman Republic, you should take this course. It may be a grind at times, but it is worth it in the end.",
                "Yes if you are already really interested in ancient Rome. Professor Johnston is so knowledgeable and interesting! However he really cannot finish a lecture on time. After class he would often upload 30 minutes to an hour of supplemental lecture on canvas, in order to stay on track with the syllabuswhich was supposed to be for our benefit I guess, but just created more work. Also be warned, in addition to weekly readings on the syllabus, there are also supplemental weekly readings that are required for section.",
                "Yes! Roman Republic is both fascinating and exciting to learn about. We often do not recognize this today but Rome was a highly complex and sophisticated society, and anyone can learn a lot from its history. Professor Johnston is also absolutely amazing. I've never had a class where the professor was so personally engaged in the entire teaching process. Prof. Johnston was always accessible (and very helpful!) via office hours, and he was also really helpful with paper ideas and outlines. If you are looking for a class where you can always talk to your professor and not just your TF's, this is definitely the class! Do note the amount of weekly reading though. This class includes lecture readings plus additional section readings, which can certainly be overwhelming.",
                "Maybe.  If you are interested in Rome, it's a fun course to take.",
                "I wouldnt recommend this course. It was not as interesting or engaging as I had been told it was.",
                "Yes. I think this course does a great job surveying 7 centuries of Roman history. Professor Johnston presents the material in a way that is engaging and challenges traditional interpretations of the Romans. This course filled in some of the large gaps in my knowledge of Roman history, but it also made me think about how we should approach Roman history. The reading didn't feel overly demanding, but I'd advise getting as much of a jump on the two writing projects as possible.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who have any interest in ancient Rome or modern politics. Professor Johnston emphasized the continued use of examples from ancient Rome in modern politics. It is, however, a significant workload, so if you want to get the most out of the class, make sure you are willing to dedicate a good portion of your time to it.",
                "Yes, but only if theyre interested in Roman history and willing to take on a high workload."
