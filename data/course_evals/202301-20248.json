                "I loved the readings. This is the only class that I've ever done all of the readings for in my entire Yale career. The lectures complement the reading well, and I enjoyed sections. The papers were fun to write and there were lots of options to choose from.",
                "really interesting class, even though i am a stem major",
                "Strengths: Professor Freedman knows a lot about food. I also appreciated the freedom and flexibility given with the papers, which allowed students to follow their interests. Guest lecturers were super interesting and diverse, and really added to the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like a class called \"History of Food\" could have been a lot more interesting. Lectures are optional, which sometimes makes it hard to feel like what you're learning in class is important at all.",
                "Information was interesting and easy to understand.",
                "Very laid back course which also teaches you a lot about a topic not normally discussed within the classroom.",
                "Strengths - very interesting material, Freedman is fantastic lecturer, interesting material, relevant, useful, papers are fun to write. Weaknesses - while my TF was great, sometimes it felt like there was nothing to do in section and it was busy work for everyone just to \"check that box\"",
                "A strength is the wide range of topics that are covered, including societal issues and environmental ones. A weakness is that the lecture slides aren't detailed and they mainly show images without a caption, which makes it difficult to use the lecture slides when studying for exams.",
                "Great class",
                "It is hard to emcompass the food history of entire countries and I found it difficult to follow that portion of the class.",
                "Strengths: interesting lectures, not a lot of reading required\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "strengths: Prof. Freedman is an amazing lecturer and the class is interesting if you are interested in food. We also had very good guest lecturers that discussed interesting topics. The TFs are also a great source for writing the papers. Weeknesses: the class can sometimes be boring, specially at the start of the semester.",
                "None",
                "No weaknesses. Well organized with a manageable workload. Both the teaching fellows at Prof. Freedman, himself, seemed pretty approachable.  Lectures were engaging as were section.",
                "Interesting class and did not require background knowledge to follow along and stay connected with the class.",
                "Super interesting course material and really fun discussion sections! Loved the format of the papers, and the exams were reasonable easy.\r\n\r\nThe lectures were good but I think the slides could have been a tad more engaging, although Prof. Freedman is a great speaker. Have to be honest, I didn't do any of the readings, though, and I don't think I missed much.",
                "Very good, interesting lectures. Professor Freedman clearly cares about the topic and he is a very good lecturer. I wish some of the notes would be posted online, but in general, I really enjoyed the course.",
                "I enjoyed Professor Freedman's style of lecture and thought the information presented was most interesting.",
                "Professor Freedman is a very engaging lecturer and I appreciated the selection of topics. I also found the TAs to be wonderful in this class, and the ability to virtually attend lecture was extremely helpful during busy times. \r\n\r\nAs far as weaknesses, it is overall a very strong course. I think having structured materials would be useful for studying purposes, as the slides are mostly images, so it can be hard to keep track of what to study from each section. Maybe just a midterm and final sheet of big topics to focus on would be good, I felt a bit lost studying so I just tried to reread everything, which was probably not the most efficient use of time.",
                "The strengths of the course are Professor Freedman's lecturing style as well as the breadth of food topics that we covered (different cuisines, restaurants, and its relation to religion, race, class, gender, etc.)it felt really comprehensive. The weaknesses of this course are perhaps the ambiguity in grading and maybe the presentation slides could have had more information on them to make it easier to follow.",
                "I think this is a fine course for getting an introduction to the material, and there arent a ton of food specific classes at yale so i think this is a good start. I think some topics were more engaging than others and since we moved from one to the next so quickly sometimes it didnt feel like much more than surface level info was sticking. I think this class did the best for what it is, but sometimes it was sad that our section discussions were pretty surface level and not engaging, but yet section was mandatory every week. I also thought some of the guest speakers werent that interesting.",
                "This is a fun course that also taught me quite a bit about food in the United States over the past century. The course does cover food around the world at a very basic level. More depth about the history of food outside the US would be ideal, though covering that content in greater detail might be difficult given the semester time constraint.",
                "The large lecture format with smaller discussion sections worked for this course, and the recorded lectures allowed for me to stay connected with this course despite having trouble making it to class.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Freedman is a gem. An old-school professor whose lectures are filled with humor and self-awareness. Great lecturer, you can tell he's practiced a lot which makes for a very fluid delivery of information. Take a chance to meet with him outside of class, he is a pleasure to speak with and he has real interest in students' thoughts on matters related to and unrelated to this course's material\r\n\r\nweaknesses: none",
                "Only complaint would be the lectures could be a little boring sometimes",
                "The class is well structured, covers a lot of topics with a good level of detail and is quite relaxed, and friendly to non-history students.",
                "It would be better if the lectures were more organized. Some texts on PowerPoints would help instead of having images only.",
                "Strengths: Clear reading, great professor, interesting guest lecturers, fun section",
                "strengths - I liked Professor Freedman's teaching style and also enjoyed having occasional guest lecturers. I also liked the way the course was organized by region and year and how it took us through decades of historical landmarks that contributed to why food is preferred in some places and how spices/etc got to others.\r\nweakness - I would have liked more notes on the PowerPoint slides other than pictures and thought the class could have been more engaging in the historical sense of detailing more about specific cultures instead of only spending one class on each region",
                "More clear instructions on reading materials, it was sometimes hard to find the articles. More clear what was expected of us through the readings.",
                "Strengths: the course is very engaging and the content is super cool. Weaknesses: none",
                "It spends way too long talking about race & individual food items I think the food reform movements & the spice trade were the best parts of the class and I wouldve loved to have spent more time on them.",
                "Lecture is very engaging and interesting. Section was also very well lead.",
                "Strengths of this course is that Professor Freedman is a good and engaging lecturer. The course is also well structured, but I wish we could've gone more in depth of each topic.",
                "I think the lectures were really interesting and the guest lectures really kept me engaged throughout the semester.",
                "Awesome professor and good outline \r\nSections should maybe have more guided questions",
                "The big lecture format stifled the potential of this course. The lecture hall is also so big. It is usually only about 20% full.\r\n\r\nProfessor Freedman, however, is a great lecturer. I have immense respect for him because he is an expert of Medieval history but nonetheless is so knowledgeable about food history.",
                "Lectures are slightly disengaging/boring. Could be revamped to engage the students more.",
                "This course was very interesting although at times the lecture felt a bit long.",
                "i really liked the lectures, professor freedman is very knowledgeable and a great lecturer",
                "The recorded lectures help for classes that have to be missed. Professor Freedman is an incredible lecturer.",
                "Really good content and I actually appreciated writing the essays - were very helpful to dive into the material.",
                "Strengths: Provides a very broad overview of all of food history before focusing on Modern America. I really enjoyed the open-endedness of the essay prompts because I was able to write very interesting pieces I wouldn't get the chance to write in other courses.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think this course should be broken into multiple courses. There is simply too much history here for it to be one course. I would love to see \"History of Restaurants\" for example. I want to dive more deeply into the course material, but the lens of this course is simply too broad to facilitate this.",
                "No weaknesses. The class lectures were well-structured, thus facilitating better learning.",
                "The lectures were not the most engaging and the planning of the course didn't seem that connected/structured. However, the topics were interesting and hard to come by. I liked hearing about different ingredients and dishes but they were always just mentioned and not discussed.",
                "Strengths: Prof Freedman was very passionate about the course, and clearly very knowledgeable about the material. All of the TA's seemed very dedicated. I also appreciated the chance to hear from guest lecturers. \r\nWeaknesses: The lectures felt a bit disorganized at times, which made it hard to stay focused during class. Expectations for the content of the essays (especially the first one) was quite vague. I would have appreciated more specifics about what was expected.",
                "Discussions were thought provoking and assignments were easy yet engaging.",
                "I thought it was great how the class moved in mostly chronological order which made it easier to keep track of the progression of food throughout history"

If they are simply looking for an interesting class to take that won't put too much stress on them, I would recommend.",

                "Yes!",

                "Absolutely. I loved Professor Freedman and the amazing guest lecturers that were brought in. I learned so much and felt it was an enjoyable and informative addition to my courseload.",
                "This was a really fun class. Really just the 2 papers and 2 exams but you can cram for those pretty easy. As a big foodie, it was nice to just have a point in time during the week to just talk about food trends across time, insecurities, and I learned a lot of pretty cool fun facts.",
                "Yes, if you need a 5th class or you really want to study food, but i dont think this is the best class at yale.",
                "Yes! This is a fun and informative course.",
                "If this person is interested in history or food or both, I would recommend this course to them.",
                "Yes! Especially if you cr/d/f and can just focus on the learning, this is one of those courses that gives you a toolbox of facts and frameworks that you'll be thinking about long after it's over. My friends have enjoyed hearing me recount what we've learned in class. Two short essays + two exams. Very reasonable grading.",
                "Yes - very fun course with a great instructor",
                "Yes absolutely. You will never look at food the same!",
                "Yes! The content is incredibly interesting, you get freedom in what you investigate yourself through the papers, and it's quite relaxed. I strongly recommend the class to anyone.",
                "Professor Freedman is down to earth and spits facts during lecture. I like the prof a lot, and I think this would be a very very fun 5th class!",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, especially for a stress-free and easy history class that talks solely about food and how it shapes culture. Thought it was a great intro class.",
                "Yes! Its so good and worth it. Not a difficult class but really interesting! A perfect elective.",
                "This course was really fun and low-stress. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in food or history.",
                "Yes 100%",
                "I would recommend this course. The course is interesting and allows the student to study a very specific, unusual area.",
                "Yes, if you're looking for a good fifth class to take -- I think History of Food is a great class that will also fulfill a distributional requirement.",
                "I would most certainly recommend the course. It is very different to other courses in the university and allows for a new perspective in your life.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes! I think it is important to look at the complexities around food. It is unfortunate that food and intellectual discourse rarely converge in this country.",
                "I would recommend this course because I didn't really find any negative aspects of the course.",
                "Absolutely. I found the course material very interesting.",
                "Yes! Professor Freedman is a great lecturer and if youre at all interested in food this is a great history lecture to introduce you to historical approaches to the topic of food.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, it is the best course I have taken at Yale. I learned a lot and greatly enjoyed both the discussion sections and the lectures.",
                "Yes, great course with really interesting information.",
                "Yeah, it's interesting and covers a lot of subjects that you would not get the chance to learn about in other courses at Yale.",
                "I would recommend the course because I find the subject matter fascinating.",
                "This class is fun and worth just sitting in and listening. There aren't very many classes like this, and the guest speakers were cool too! However, I didn't find it the most engaging or novel class, especially as someone who cares a lot about food and cooking. I wish there were elements that tied to course to the real world more.",
                "Yes, but only if they are willing to engage with the course content on their own accord.",
                "I would recommend the course to other students because I believe it can be interesting to anybody. Food is part of all of our lives and I feel it is important to know about its past."
