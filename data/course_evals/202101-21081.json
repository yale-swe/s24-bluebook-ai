                "Strengths: Dr. Dash and Dr. Raskin are very funny and engaging. I was always 100% present, partially because I was afraid to be cold-called on but mostly because they made it impossible not to be interested. The material in class was accessible to non-STEM / econ majors for the most part, but sometimes I felt a little overwhelmed by all the moving parts. As a non-finance and non-STEM econ major with an interest in economic equity rather than financial models, the imposter syndrome was sometimes very real, but the professors did a good job of clarifying when appropriate and also challenging each of us to learn and apply what we learned as much as we can.",
                "Very much enjoyed the variety of speakers that spoke to the class and the class itself was fun and interesting. Some of the actual teaching that was needed to do the midterm/final felt a little rushed/sparse and made the projects harder. The final project also would have been better as a group project, which it was initially described as.",
                "I do not have much positive to say about this course, however, the weaknesses abound. From Dr. Raskin's abysmal interactions with students to the shallow investigation of topics across the semester, this class truly represents a failure in Yale's course offerings across the board."

                "I think this class started out really interesting and fun, but felt very repetitive and hence increasingly underwhelming as the semester unfolded. The subject matter is really interesting and seldom taught elsewhere in Yale College, so it's a really unique experience to learn about drug development / pharmaceuticals by two professors who are extremely knowledgeable and helpful.\r\n\r\nThis class also felt a lot like what I imagine a business school class or consulting case practice: reading case studies individually and reviewing the information together as a group. To me, this felt like it wasn't the best use of class time. That being said, the speakers that Dr Raskin and Dr Dash brought in each week were super interesting and educational and gave us great insight on what it's actually like to work in the field.\r\n\r\nFinally, I think the way the class is marketed as a mix of Bio and Econ is really interesting  it didn't really feel like we went very deep into either, but I respect the professors' decision to make the class accessible to students with varying degrees of background in either field. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I really enjoyed the class and would recommend it to anyone who is even remotely interested! The class is interesting, accessible, and taught by two funny, charismatic, and caring professors.",
                "I would recommend this class if you're truly interested in biotechnology and/or biotechnology investing. I personally am not that interested in either, but I felt that I learned many real-world skills/insights through this class that I couldn't get in many of my other classes. If you come in with just a general interest like me to learn more about medicine, however, a word of caution: the midterm and final papers can be very time-consuming and tedious, especially if you have no experience making financial models/reading biology papers about how drugs function physiologically. Because of this, I would recommend taking this class Cr/D/F if you just want to explore something new.",
                "Yes!!! Excellent economics senior seminar, probably one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
                "100%! One of my favorite classes I've ever taken. Professors were fantastic, classmates were chillers, work was manageable, and content was interesting. Guest speakers each week was also great.",
                "I would not recommend this course to any student at Yale. It is arguably the worst class I've taken at this university. The engagement with the various topics of the course is superficial at best and will do little to improve your understanding of them. Moreover, Dr. Raskin's condescending and obnoxious tendencies make the class insufferable regardless of your interest in the topics, and I would avoid the torture of sharing a classroom with him at any cost."
