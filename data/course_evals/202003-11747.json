Congling's teaching improved over time, and he is very open to feedback.",
                "This course was one of the worst classes I have ever taken. The lectures were very unorganized and hard to follow, and the midterm and final were unnecessarily difficult.",
                "Strengths: Instructor very clearly cared for the class and was very engaging, asking us for feedback throughout the semester. Also, if you've never seen complex analysis before, the subject is honestly quite amazing when you step back and look at some of the results that you have. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lecture style is probably not has proof-heavy as you'd expect. We went through many examples, but a lot of the proofs of theorems were only sketched \/ mentioned briefly, so I had to fill in those gaps.",
                "I think the book used was excellent. For better or worse, reading the book was the most efficient way of studying for me. I thought that the teaching however was subpar and It'd be interesting to see if other students share the same opinion on that matter.",
                "The course material was interesting. The lectures were disorganized and unclear, however, and I found myself having to learn mostly from the textbook.",
                "Strengths: Course content was very interesting, and I definitely feel like I have a somewhat thorough understanding of these introductory concepts now.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The classes were a bit disorganized, and sometimes lectures were difficult to follow. The multiple choice quizzes and midterm also didn't feel very helpful at all.",

Even so, be prepared to do a lot of self-study since the lectures aren't very clear (albeit, that could be in part due to the online format). The math is very cool, but I'm not sure it's worth the frustrations I would sometimes feel. Quizzes and midterms were multiple choice and just a few questions long (so grades get low very quickly and with simple mistakes, didn't really match the type of problems on the HW), and the take-home final was awful (interesting problems, but took a very long time).",

The teaching was rougher at the beginning of the semester but certainly improved towards the end to the point where I thought I was learning the material clearly. Anyways, if you're a math major you have to take this class, so just do it. In the worst case you'll learn from the textbook.",
                "It's tricky. If someone else is teaching it, it's probably worth a shot. Personally, I didn't get much from the lectures and was forced to reading the book as a primary source of information. If you're a math major, you probably have to take this but if you're a physics major just stay away from this course.",
