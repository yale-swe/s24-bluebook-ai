                "Learned more intensively about the methodology of political science research as well as important theories about the whole process of peace building.",
                "We learned about several different issue areas related to peacebuilding after conflicting states decide to negotiate a peace agreement. This includes but is not limits to issues such as foreign intervention and mediation strategies, ceasefires, democratization, and security and rule of law. Professor Brancati also really helped me develop my writing and critical thinking skills. In class, we were asked to critically and in a detail-oriented manner evaluate the experiments and methodologies of the articles we read, and apply that to our own writing.",
                "I learned how to digest dense academic papers and delineate their arguments. I was also able to learn how to critique the arguments of scholars by putting their theories up against real-world contexts.",
                "I learned about the conditions for creating & sustaining peace post-conflict. We looked at this through many lenses- e.g., how does the method of peace negotiation shape the durability of peace? I also sharpened my skills in analyzing & dissecting academic papers. We also were instructed to create an original research project for the final assignment, and this allowed me to work on skills in research, writing, data analysis, and literature synthesis.",
                "Really great training for writing a senior thesis - learned how to conduct research and organize a final paper; criticism of political science papers",
                "I learned about many of the major topics in political science, specifically those related to peace building (the role of peace keepers, DDR, ceasefires, democratization, etc...). I also learned a lot about how to critique political science papers and write your own."

            "comments": [
                "This class challenged my critical thinking skills and pushed me to write even better, more so than any other class I have ever taken at Yale (and I'm a senior). The strengths lie in the extensive knowledge Professor Brancati has on the subject of peacebuilding, and hearing her stories about her work with government officials to inform policy has been fascinating. She also centers the class around students learning, which deepened my learning in the class. One thing to keep in mind with this class is that it is a lot of work. There is a lot of reading and the reading takes time to digest and understand.",
                "The assignments of the course were very well structured to teach students about the fundamentals of writing a political science paper. Sometimes there were too many readings to really hit all of them in class.",
                "Strengths: readings were very interesting, extremely lively discussions in class\/ encouragement to participate, Prof Brancati creates an engaging environment for everyone\/ provides detailed feedback on all assignments so you know how youre doing throughout the semester, well-organized so that you get a comprehensive and clear look at quite a complicated topic \r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "S: Very well structured. Each reading and assignment is intentional, and I got way more out of class discussions in PB compared to other polisci seminars. You will also end the semester with a significant piece of work in the form of your final paper.\r\nW: The expectations of the course do not seem adjusted to the undergraduate level. Students are expected to produce graduate-level work, which can be challenging for those with less experience.",
                "The main strength of the class is the material. The readings really cover all of the major topics related to peace building in current political science discourse. They relate but don't overlap which makes the content really interesting and refreshing. The class was also heavily reliant on class participation which was really valuable both because other students made interesting contributions and because I felt like I improved my own ability to critique political science papers.\r\n\r\nI think a major weakness is Professor Brancati's approach to giving feedback. While she is highly responsive and gives extensive comments (both strengths!), she very much approaches giving feedback to students as if she were peer reviewing the work of other professionals in the field. She quite often shut down very good points that people made in class (especially when they fell outside of a narrow political science framework), could be extremely rude when making comments about the quality of people's work (outright saying that people's final posters were \"ugly\"), and just generally expected us to produce publishable political science work in every assignment we turned in (which meant scrutinizing every single sentence we wrote and trying to poke holes in our thinking to the extent that it was essentially impossible to meet her standards). While it ultimately is possible to be successful in the class, the learning environment was made to be quite stressful in a way that was honestly totally unnecessary. I would really only take this class if you're a senior in the major who's looking for guidance on writing a senior thesis or a grad student, and you have very clear expectations."

                "I would recommend this course to another student. I learned so much in this class in terms of the topic of peacebuilding as well as how to better approach writing political science papers. I would tell another student, though, that this class is a lot of work: there is a lot of reading and the reading takes time to digest and understand.",
                "I would recommend this course for anyone who wants a robust introduction into the political science major.",
                "Yes, really interesting topic which is looked at from multiple angles.",
                "YES, 100%. This course will not only give you a very useful\/ interesting glimpse into the literature regarding peacebuilding after conflict, but will also help you develop the skills you need to conduct your own original research. The classroom environment is very positive and engaging and I looked forward to going every week",
                "Definitely in preparation for writing a senior thesis or for those who really want to understand topics in peace building.",
                "Honestly, no. I really wanted to love this class, but it was made so unnecessarily stressful because of Professor Brancati's unreasonable standards. At the end of the day, I don't think the content is worth the workload and stress unless you are an upperclassman who knows that you want to become a political scientist as a profession or go to grad school for it.",
                "If you hope to delve into the peacebuilding world in the future, this is the best course to get an insight into all aspects of the field. Professor Brancati does not leave any areas unexplored. Every aspect of the field is covered in this class. Professor Brancati is a leader in peacebuilding academia and has a great grasp of all the seminal works. Professor Brancati is also a top political scientist, who provides useful feedback for all her students. This is a great course to understand the intricacies of political science research. Professor Brancati gives such extensive feedback and you are able to decipher what you have to exactly improve upon. She also genuinely cares about her students. I was hit by a medical emergency during the middle of the semester and she would always approach me during every class to see how I was doing. I cannot recommend taking a seminar with Professor Brancati enough!"
