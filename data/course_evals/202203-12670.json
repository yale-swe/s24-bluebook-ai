First, we learned about Aristotles opinions on what makes a good screenplay and then moved into more modern theories. I was able to break a screenplay down into acts, beats, and stepping stones. I was extremely happy with what I got out of the class. I feel like I have the tools to write my own screenplay in the future, or continue the one I started in this class."

                "It would be nice to break up lecture with more engaging activities. The two hour classes felt pretty long.",
                "I think a big strength of the course is the many steps that you take in order to get to the final product. I would have loved if these could have been stratified even a little bit more though just because the heavier steps of the writing and story building process did occur at rather stressful times in the semester.",
                "I wish it was less of a lecture format and we were able to talk through our ideas a little more. When we started to workshop all of our screenplays together, that was the most interesting class so I wish we were able to workshop our ideas a little more with our peers before that.",
                "Strengths: good curriculum taken at a pace that gives students the chance to fully comprehend the material; good feedback on stories and writing from class and professor; very knowledgeable professor\r\nWeaknesses: only enough time to get stories/writing reviewed by class at most twice in a semester",
                "strengths: Very wise, kind, and experienced prof. Engaging lectures.\r\nweaknesses: I think the course would benefit from a draft and final submission for each assignment. Each assignment builds off the past one. If you received feedback that very much changed the direction of your story, there was no built-in opportunity to submit and receive feedback on a new version of that assignment. It was just onto the next.",
                "I think a strength is that it is very beginner friendly. Anyone, even if you have little to none creative writing experience, can follow with the course.",
                "The workload is very manageable and broken a part so that assignments go at a good pace. I really enjoyed the days that we got to watch films and break a part the tools that the writers chose and the different elements of the scenes. We would workshop our peers assignments each week, choosing them at random. The collaborative energy in the class was great, and Prof. Price was a huge reason for that. I like that he used slideshows some weeks and came prepared with his own notes."

                "Yes I definitely would. I really enjoyed him as a professor he is extremely kind and understanding. He also has some really cool tips about what it means to be in the film industry if you are at all interesting in that!",
                "I would highly recommend this course. Storytelling skills are important for all people in all walks of life, and this class focuses a majority of time on this in particular. Furthermore, the creative writing component of the class is not only facilitated to improve students' creative writing skills but also serves as both a good introduction and intermediate course in screenplay writing. Also, it's very low-stress.",
                "Absolutely! This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Price is an amazing instructor, and if you're interested in learning about screenwriting in a low-stress, creative environment, I highly recommend this course.",
                "yes!!!! very fun, learned a lot",
                "Yes. It's a good class even for those not interested in screenwriting proper, but want to give it a go.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Price was amazing, and I was excited to go to class each day. He changes up classes week to week, so I would never be bored. I learned exactly what I was told I would be learning. Had a great experience all around."
