                "Strengths were Minhals extremely astute and helpful notes. Weaknesses were the entire class structure. We spent too much time looking over our peers work where everyone in class would be zoned out except for the person presenting. We should do more structured exercises rather than giving notes. I think this was a remnant from when Marc taught the course.",
                "The course was great at making sure we revised effectively. Looking at structure first was a great way to do that. Also, I think that workshopping your script every three weeks was very effective because it actually ensure that I was writing and not procrastinating as heavily as I would have with just one big deadline at the end.",
                "The seminar format is great, as was the way we went about revisions (breaking it up by act).",
                "The amount of reading each week could be difficult to keep up with at times alongside work for other classes. At this point in the process, it is pretty individually driven which is both a strength and weakness. Reading some of our pages out loud could have been fun.",
                "the structure of the course could be improved. I think students should be placed in small workshop groups. It's too difficult to keep track of every story, I'd rather do a deep dive into two or three stories and be consistent about working with those same people throughout the semester rather than having to read everyone's story and only vaguely understand on a surface level what they are going for."
