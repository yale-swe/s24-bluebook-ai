    "Great class for training oneself to think systematically about perennial problems of both philosophy and faith.",
    "I learned about the basic contours of the kinds of arguments from evil that are made, the typical responses, and, notably, the other philosophical controversies which must be raised in responding to the problem of evil. This last point was something that does not come up in these debates outside of this context, so I found its exposition here especially helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Class could be more engaging, usually it was just a handful of students who knew more about the material going in who did most of the talking. I also wish the readings were a bit more organized, it was often confusing what readings were assigned and what the logic was for the order in which we were reading them. The readings are really interesting though.",
    "The course material was extremely interesting. However, seminar was never really organized in going over that material.",
    "It was great to have a professor who had so much \"skin in the game\" and who personally knew many of the figures involved in these debates. This felt like a debate between people at times which was a nice element. The length and open endedness of the papers made them both challenging and rewarding, and I felt a sense of accomplishment after turning them in. Some improvements to the course might include collecting the syllabus centrally (it was at times difficult to find the readings easily), clearer organization of the topics to be discussed each time, and a better balance between student comments and the professor's exposition. There were times of course when things had to be explained, but oftentimes the class had little horizontal debate between different students. One student would get on a tangent about which they were passionate, but this often would just pull the energy to one corner of the room."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course only if you have a serious interest in ethics or philosophy of religion. I think that the title of the course makes it sound a bit sexier than it actually is. In reality nearly all of the readings are very dry and technical philosophy papers that are only interesting to people who want to learn about the various arguments that have to do with the problem of evil. That's not to say that the material is not interesting, but anyone who takes this class expecting some deep soul searching would be mistaken.",
    "The class was extremely interesting and thought provoking so I would definitely recommend this course."
