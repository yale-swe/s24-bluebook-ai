   "comments": [
    "I vastly improved in my ability to translate Latin and understand the meter. Underlying this improvement is an improved understanding of how parts of the sentence interact to form coherent meaning, and understanding how this differs in Latin prose versus poetry. I also gained a better understanding of English syntax, which has helped me improve the concision of my own writing.",
    "I learned how to read latin prose and poetry, while also improving my latin vocabulary.",
    "Besides some grammar review during the first few weeks, the main skills you develop are getting really good at translations!",
    "I learned a great deal about how to read Cicero and Latin poetry.",
    "I learned to translate latin at an exceptional level because of how well this class was taught. It was challenging but that challenge was necessary in order for one to acquire the skills necessary to translate latin at a high level.",
    "Better understanding of the mechanics of Latin poetry",
    "More Latin! How to read \"real\" Latin texts with a commentary, including prose and poetry. It's hard to pinpoint exactly where I was at the beginning of the semester but I think my reading comprehension and ability to untangle complex sentences has come a long way since then. My scansion also improved a lot.",
    "I learned a lot about Latin prose and poetry construction and composition. I gained a deeper appreciation for nuances and connotations of words in Latin, as well as the efficacy of different rhetorical structures. Taking this class also increased my Latin vocabulary tremendously.",
    "Meter and get way faster at translating. If you take it with Kyle, you really learn to appreciate the beauty of latin poetry.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths\r\ntranslating together in class\r\nenvironment that invited questions and didn't penalize being wrong but gave opportunities to improve\r\nhaving Kyle be incredibly encouraging and available and willing to discuss any questions about the test\r\nKyle's copious knowledge about etymologies and the reasons behind aspects of the text that do not seem to fit (breaks in meter, for example)\r\n\r\nWeakness\r\nat the beginning of the semester, we were assigned a lot of Cicero to translate which was incredibly hard to stay on top of because it was so time-consuming. We were consistently behind in translating in class because of this and i felt we had to rush to stay caught up with the syllabus, which meant I didn't understand the material, as well. Assigning less in the beginning and increasing the reading throughout the semester would allow students to be accustomed to translating after a long break and would also increase the workload as student's ability and comfort with translation increased.",
    "Not as much of a time commitment as L1 or L2, but it makes you work a great deal for what I think is relatively little gain. It could use a slightly slower pace in the future.",
    "One small weakness is that it is kind of repetitive -- we spend every day doing pretty much the same thing. However, I think this is necessary given the skills the course if focusing on. The biggest strength is that the course's intensive nature allows you to get really good at Latin.",
    "I was able to read a great deal of Latin and learned a lot, but the speed and rigor of the course was quite difficult. If more time had been allocated to teaching us grammar and showing us how to read it instead of simply translating it in class, I think I would have caught on quicker, but I learned regardless.",
    "Strengths: Irene as a teacher was the biggest strength of this course. She is not only highly, highly skilled in translating latin, but she was able to teach the skills necessary for one to translate latin in a very well-organized way with the daily readings of Latin.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I felt that classes felt tedious at some points during the semester as we often fell into the same routine of reading, quiz, reading, quiz, reading, exam, and it would have been fun to do latin exercises \"for fun\" that didn't come from Ovid or Cicero more often.",
    "I think the format of the course is as it should be. My only complaint is that we quickly fell behind the reading pace set in the syllabus and then didn't know how much to read for the following class. Being less familiar with the reading for class (because it had been prepared for the previous class and then partially forgotten) made translation in class take longer than it should, further exacerbating the problem. If Prof. Peirano could have assigned each chunk of reading based on where we finished class, this problem could have been alleviated.",
    "It definitely got monotonous at a certain point in the semester because the assignments were almost entirely the same, but I feel like my instructor Kyle did try to spice it up a bit at times, which I appreciate.",
    "Some formal vocabulary instruction would be helpful, since there are so many new words in the pieces we read that it's very difficult to learn them all effectively. The course was very effective in teaching the effects of words and rhetorical devices in poetry and prose, as well as understanding poetic meter. Class time can occasionally become monotonous, since every class is centered around translating that day's reading. However, Kyle (the TA I had for my section) did an excellent job keeping the material interesting and relevant by explaining the linguistics behind some words or relating the material to modern day."

    "If they wanted to fulfill a language requirement, get a better understanding of how Latin but also our own language works",
    "Only for the language requirement or if you REALLY like latin prose.",
    "Yes! If your taking this course after L1 and L2 at Yale, you will definitely be set up for success -- it's not easy by any means, but the small class size and engaging professor makes its a good time!",
    "Yes because this course taught me a great deal about Latin and how to read it at a faster speed.",
    "For someone who wants to learn Latin, this is without question the class to take. I highly, highly recommend Irene and this class.",
    "Yes, very interesting reading material and great professors",
    "I had to take it to finish the language requirement, which is probably the case for a lot of people who will take this class. If you are genuinely interested in Latin and willing to do a decent amount of translation before each class, I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, if you enjoy learning about the nuances and rhetorical styles of Latin prose and poetry. This class goes beyond mere translation of material. We spend a lot of time analyzing the way Cicero constructs sentences by choosing specific vocabulary and ending with certain clausulae, and how Ovid creates a certain effect by using Greek words in Latin meter. This class isn't too hard, though, as long as you keep up with the translations and review before quizzes and tests.",
    "Yep, take it with Kyle. He's great."
