    "I got a basis of understanding in astronomy and a general overview of stars. I also learned to better connect information to use in problems.",
    "I learned so much about how the universe works. I really liked how the topics of the course were structured.",
    "I learned about basic and fundamental astronomy and astrophysics concepts. I learned to think about stars and how the evolve in a different way and how to use physics concepts to explain certain phenomena in space.",
    "Everything fundamental for learning about stars and basic solar system\/galactic information. Good foundation for progressing in the astrophysics major. Syllabus is very accurate as to what specific topics youll learn. It is rather in-depth; itll be more quantitative\/involved than one may otherwise think.",
    "Key ideas, theories and concepts in astronomy",
    "The class made me taught me to do applied math in a fundamental manner. My only applied math experience was high school physics and this was a decent next step.",
    "I learned just how small and insignificant each of us really are (a good thing to realize).\r\nI also learned a lot about galaxies, relativity, the evolution of stars, and the evolution of science as a way of understanding space and light.",
    "Knowledge of astronomy, especially about stars. Newton's laws of motion, exoplanets, the life cycle of stars (as included in the title of the course), even a brief introduction to relativity.",
    "I obtained a lot of knowledge about stars, stellar physics, and the nature of star formation as well as some general knowledge of space. I refreshed my skills with algebra and learned how to derive certain physical laws.",
    "I learned about the factors that affect stellar cycles and how different factors affect and balance each other. I also learned about relationships I didn't know existed between different stellar properties."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The information was sometimes presented in a confusing way--more confusing than it had to be. For example, the slides often had a lot of text on them that was discouraging when I was trying to study for exams. But I really liked how there were often graphs and videos to help supplement the material--these were really helpful.",
    "I think this course was a good introduction to stars and astrophysics in general but it was very much conceptual and there wasn't much advanced math\/physics. It could be better if there was more math\/physics involved but I like how the course was a good overview of many different kinds of concepts. There were some concepts that were a little too basic (such as gravity) so I think an improvement could be taking out some of the really basic concepts, or at least going over them really quickly and then adding some more advanced concepts w\/ more math\/physics.",
    "I think this course covers the information well, and what is expected of you is clear. Perhaps more interactive portions of class besides a direct lecture would help drill information in a bit better.",
    "The lectures are were very in depth, and especially in the case of the more conceptual lectures they were engaging and interesting. If you can follow, theyre enjoyable. However, often the lectures are hard to follow because each slide is a massive block of text that is overflowing with information. Consequently, theyre hard to follow in real time and so the problem sets require lots of random equation hunting.",
    "The course was not particularly engaging during class hours to students, as it was purely lecture and questions were almost never asked if the teacher. This is in part the classs fault, of course, but nevertheless I believe more in-class problem solving and discussion would benefit students greatly.",
    "I believe that this course is presented ideally and needs no alteration. The subject matter is fascinating and taught well, the problem sets are reasonable and not too frequent, and the exams are completely fair.",
    "The content of the course is quite interesting, which helps make the problem sets engaging. There is a lot of material presented, however, that is unnecessary and thus the lectures feel very overcrowded and rushed.",
    "This course had a lot of interesting content, but it was sometimes difficult to stay engaged, as most classes were power point presentations with little variation in the types of media. We were introduced to important equations and relations, but we didn't do many example problems in class. I liked that tests were mostly content and theory based to ensure we had a good understanding of the processes and topics covered, and also that we got a lot of choice in what we answered in tests."

   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this course if it is a requirement for your major and if you are willing to spend a lot of your time on trying to figure things out on your own.",
    "Yes, if they were going to be an astrophysics major. I am not an astrophysics major and the course was very difficult for me. But I think this is a good course for someone looking to concentrate in this field.",
    "If you want an introduction to astrophysics, I think this a good class to take. It's a pretty easy\/low workload class but you end up learning quite a bit about how stars and other celestial objects form and evolve and how to measure certain astrophysical properties. There's a lot of information that you cover in this class, but you don't go that in depth for a lot of concepts (the math\/physics is pretty easy).",
    "If youre doing the Astro major, you have to, and its a good course. If youre just into Astro but dont want to do math\/physics, maybe a 100 level Astro course is better.",
    "If you feel you have above average comfort with math and physics I would say consider it. Comprehension is a struggle even if you do have those skills.",
    "I would not, simply because the lecture was so devoid of student participation. \r\nThe material is interesting and worthwhile, however, so were the class dynamic different I certainly would.",
    "Yes! Prof. Basu is a great lecturer and you will learn alot. I took the course purely out of interest and was very satisfied. This is a great class for a non astro major who is interested in astronomy and willing to do some math. There are certainly astro courses that are easier, so take this class if learning a lot is more important to you than completely minimizing the workload.",
    "I would! I think it is a good introduction to the field and teaches a lot of very interesting information that many students would enjoy learning.",
    "This was a very interesting class, and a great introduction to a lot of topics in astronomy and astrophysics. I would recommend this class to anyone who was curious about the topics, or cool applications of physics, and not just individuals who are considering the astro major."
