                "Both the professor and TA were very unclear about what the assignments entailed. Sometimes they would separately provide two different sets of expectations for the assignment. Every assignment guideline was just whatever they would say in class. You could very much tell that the TA and the prof didnt communicate well with each other. \r\n\r\nThe grading was also very weird. There were no rubrics and it seemed that they just took off points for whatever they wanted. They also provided feedback really late. Mistakes wouldve been repeated multiple times because the feedback was provided so late.\r\n\r\nThey provided resources as a basis for assignments, but then they would take off points for following that resource. In class the next day, they would discuss a structure they had never mentioned before (that didnt align with the provided resources) and elaborate on how they had expected this format.\r\n\r\nThere were a lot of unsaid expectations of the assignments that were not communicated to us, the students.",
                "Strengths- quizzes were fair. Weaknesses- workload was extremely high and I dont think I would be very confident in an in person chem lab.",
                "I thought this course was very well done.",
                "Strengths: The recordings of lectures and uploaded sample data removed the stress of preparing for a 4-5 hour in-person lab and allowed me to focus more on the theory and analysis components of the lab. I also found the regular\/consistent deadlines for EPs\/LNs\/PLs to be helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Given that this is a practical lab course, I found the virtual format to be somewhat compromised. It was very difficult to develop proficiency with the techniques and gain experience in a lab setting merely by watching videos.",
                "This course was thorough and demanding in terms of the writing component. However, it was not very organized. Every post lab was announced during lab, allowing for little planning ahead if we wanted to work ahead, and many were not graded fast enough to be able to know what to change for the next post labs. Nevertheless, the teaching staff was approachable and helpful.",
                "The expectations for assignments were often extremely unclear, and the grading did not align with the resources posted on Canvas. We would then lose a very large proportion of the points on the assignment due to small errors made. Furthermore, we would get feedback extremely late for some assignments and as a result have already turned in other similar assignments, and thus made the same mistakes on both assignments and lost points for the same item. We would also have one error marked on one assignment but did not receive feedback on the same error made on a previous assignment. This was extremely frustrating and there was a distinct lack of clear communication of expectations."

However, two labs a week means the workload is very high and (especially if you are taking lecture at the same time), can be difficult to manage at times.",
