   "comments": [
    "Reading a ton of top-tier pilots is really the most valuable part of this course. The more you read, the more you start to recognize patterns that are used by most writers\/shows. Having a space to workshop your own writing is also valuable.",
    "Learned so much about the process of writing a script, creative writing in general and the television industry. Feel like we really went through the entire process and this experience was very fun!",
    "For anyone serious about going into film\/TV in Hollywood or otherwise, this class is a must-take. You learn and complete a mock version of the process of getting a pilot into its final shooting form (you give mock pitches, do a mock writer's room, write the story area\/outline\/draft one of a pilot).",
    "Knowledge: Learned all about the television industry and the process from writing scripts on spec to serialization to production to showrunning. Learned what themes, ideas, characters, and elements work and don't work with screenplays.\r\n\r\nSkills: Developed my writing skills by applying them to a discipline I have never had experience with before. Learned meaningful questions to ask people in the television industry. \r\n\r\nInsights: Reasassed and ignited by passion for television and storytelling.",
    "We learned all about the writers' room in Hollywood and the writing and pitching process. We learned about elements that make a good pilot and a successful show. We practiced pitching and outlining and did many in-class exercises to serve as tools for writing.",
    "A well-rounded, analytical, and creative understanding of television writing! Very interesting and important skills.",
    "I learned so much about the TV industry, and what makes good, marketable TV. And I put together all the pieces of my own original series and pilot for the class, which was really valuable!",
    "There's so much to learn in this class: how the industry works, how to write a scene, how to create stakes, how to write, etc.. The only way to be a better screenwriter is to read and write and this class does a great job of making you to both."

   "comments": [
    "The class is very well runwe analyze new pilots each week, which Professor Tracy ties into lessons about structure in a way that feels insightful and not repetitive. The mock writers room\/in class writings are also super useful. I wish we had the chance to workshop our actual pilots in class, but they are only assigned as our final projects due after classes end.",
    "Material, professor, process are all strengths. Guests were also an incredible part of the course. Really no weaknesses that I can think of.",
    "- Strengths: Probably the only real-world class on TV that is taught at Yale\r\n- Weaknesses: Would have been great to get more in-depth feedback on each piece you submit",
    "Strengths: Amazing professor, really-great classroom community, positive classroom environment that allowed us to make mistakes and provide constructive feedback to our peers, felt more like we were in this together rather than a rat race, really amazing opportunity to speak with television-industry professionals about their careers and glean advice from them, tons of events after class that Professor Tracy would invite us to, Professor Tracy also provided detailed feedback on all our assignments and was willing to look at multiple drafts, prioritizes turning in quality work over just getting it in, felt very manageable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Tracy wasn't always able to meet face to face, but he would offer us the opportunity to speak over the phone if we wanted to. Would have appreciated being put into the faux writers' room a little earlier in the semester\/one-two more times.",
    "Aaron Tracy is a big strength of this class - he brings in a lot of guests with a lot of knowledge about Hollywood and media. Talking with them is one of the most beneficial exercises you can do as an aspiring writer. Tracy has a lot of industry knowledge as well which is wonderfully helpful. He has great exercises, chooses great pilots for us to dissect, and gives great notes. The atmosphere in the classroom is also a great strength. I made wonderful friends in this class and always had fun, which is not something I can say about my other classes. Everyone was passionate and engaged and the creativity was extremely inspiring.\r\n\r\nI think more peer feedback would be invaluable in this class! We had a couple of informal sessions where we helped each other with our outlines which was amazing. I'm not sure this can be built into the structure of the class and still be as productive, but when it comes to the process of pitches, story area, outlining, and writing, hearing more from peers is the only improvement I can think of for this class.",
    "It is a perfect course. Loved all discussions, all assignments, all projects. No weaknesses come to mind!"

   "comments": [
    "If you have any interest going into TV you should absolutely take this course. You'll learn how the industry works and come out of it with a strong writing sample. It'll also cause you to start watching TV analytically and recognizing devices that make a good pilot\/series.",
    "Absolutely!! Professor Tracy is amazing, the discussions you have are very fun and the subject matter is incredibly interesting as well. Super cool class if you have any interesting in writing for TV or just have an interest in TV in general!",
    "YES. Don't play yourself. Just take. WITH Aaron Tracy.",
    "YES YES YES!!! If you can get into this class, I would definitely suggest taking it. It changed how I think about and enjoy television, and it helped me realize that I actually want to try screenwriting after college. Professor Tracy is one of the most laid-back professors I've ever had but he is incredibly dedicated to his students. He's always willing to meet on campus or have a phone call and discuss your ideas, and he prioritizes quality work that you can be proud of over everything else. The classroom really built a nurturing community, and I learned as much from my classmates as I did from Tracy. Whether you're already writing\/producing work or you've never thought about television craft, this is the perfect class that helps you learn something, regardless of where you're starting.",
    "Absolutely! Aaron Tracy is wonderful and you will learn a lot from him. You will also read a bunch of great pilots, which I highly recommend watching afterward, and you will probably be inspired to do it yourself if you aren't already!",
    "Yes, 100%!!!!",
    "Absolutely! If you're interested in television writing, this is a great class to give you a strong footing in that.",
    "Yes, if you have any interest in writing television and want to learn from someone who is actually doing it. Make sure you make the most out of it and ask the questions and put in the work."
