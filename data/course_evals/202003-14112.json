                "I came to understand the encounter between postcolonial studies and urban studies as frameworks of thought. The frontloading of the semester with theory texts by Fanon, de Certeau, Roy and others helped guide discussions for the remainder of the class.\r\nWhat I valued beyond content knowledge was the opportunity to rediscover my love for novels and conversation, for learning that extends beyond a Yale writing assignment or a grade in class. I learned the ability to close read a literary text, situate a critic in their privilege and world position, draw connections that are flamboyantly disparate but altogether not impossible.",
                "I learned about reading literature and consuming films in the context of historical events and academic theory. This class constantly blew my mind about understandings of time, space, identity, and nation, using texts that were fascinating stories as well as quite informative. I think this class expanded my ability to critically place myself in a larger context, and place events in global human contexts. I also really enjoyed reading theorists and visiting ideology of scholars such as Fanon, De Certeau, and Ananya Roy throughout the semester. I think this class also opened my ability to imagine alternative futures and alternative understandings of the everyday (cities, space, place, time, citizenship).",
                "I developed skills in humanities research, and also learned a lot about basic critical theory pertaining to urban studies and other spatial studies. Not only did we learn about theory, but we also learned a lot about history and the context of cities in the U.S., Caribbean, and internationally.",
                "In this class we looked mostly at literature through the lens of urban space in a post-colonial city. Overall, I learned about how urban planning influences and reinforces colonial structures, and how to look at literature in this context.",
                "I learned different theories to conceptualize the postcolonial city, and then learned how to use these theories to evaluate and discuss pieces of postcolonial literature."

            "comments": [
                "The greatest strength was Professor Habchi, who is an excellent seminar leader. She created what felt to me like a perfect learning environment, without assuming too much background experience. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "It's pretty fast-paced, since we read a novel per week. The topics and the people in the class are amazing, though, so I think it's worth it!",
                "Strengths of the course are the selection of readings (novels!) and Professor Habchi's flexibility, insights, and support. It is rare to find an ERM\/history class at Yale that takes the same amount of time, care and attention with readings. Because the majority of assignments are novels, I was able to channel a uniquely creative approach to my discussions, presentations and essays. Professor Habchi was incredibly flexible and supportive as a mentor, which was very important during an anxious and remote semester. Professor Habchi offered many insights between students' ideas, the readings, and her own knowledge. I think this course could improve by removing one of the novels from later in the semester and introducing another set of theory texts. By the end of the course, students were referring back to the same theories as months ago. A new set of frameworks would help stimulate and unsettle conversations.",
                "Strengths: really cool readings, AMAZING and kind and brilliant professor, engaged + supportive + wise class. Honestly such a blessing. I don't think there were any weaknesses. Because so much greatness came from my fellow students and their thoughts on readings, it could potentially be an issue if you have a group that doesn't do the readings or something. However, because the readings are so important and interesting I hope that is never a problem! Really a joy to be in this class.",
                "The strengths of this course definitely are in its format around literature, which not only made the readings go by much more quickly, but also made it easy to draw in connections (historically or culturally) in class discussions, and use a different lens to our historical analyzations. The short class presentations also helped to facilitate discussion, and the texts read were engaging and clear.",
                "strengths: It was really cool to look at history\/colonialism through the perspective of literature. I found the topics of looking at how urban space affects colonialism very interesting. I really enjoyed the books we read, they were quite diverse, but all very fun to read. Prof. Habchi is very kind and understanding, and structured the class very well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have preferred to have slightly more background about the imperial cities we were looking at. I liked looking at literature, but at times I felt like I didn't have enough prior knowledge to fully understand how the cities we were talking about were created. That being said the discussions were still great.",
                "I loved the structure and flow of the course, as it felt very natural (starting with some essential theories and moving towards applying them to literature). I think there was an excellent balance of lecture\/background information and discussion, and the workload was just the right amount."

                "Professor Habchi was incredibly flexible and supportive as a mentor, which was very important during an anxious and remote semester. She made herself available during Zoom and before and after class. The course could benefit from a more serious enforcement of a five-minute Zoom break during the middle of seminar.",
                "I liked break out rooms, I felt the seminar discussions were good, presentations went well, Prof Habchi was always open to office hours. Once or twice Prof Habchi had us journal independently and I thought that was really productive as well as refreshing, being on zoom for 2 hours straight can make it hard to focus. \r\n\r\nIt was a shame the class conversations couldn't happen in person because I honestly learned so much from my peers, but thats ok! There's nothing that could've fixed that.",
                "This course was very successful digitally, and we were still able to have a lot of great discussions. In particular, I appreciated when Professor Habchi would split up the class into smaller groups to discuss certain sections of texts, especially harder theoretical texts, and then pool our insights\/notes together as a larger group."

                "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in urban studies, literature, or the intersection between these two fields. Professor Habchi is a great instructor who made this course very engaging, and you are able to learn a LOT about critical theory, urban development, and colonialism that might be overlooked or not as focused on in a traditional class examining history.",
                "yes! I am normally more of a STEM person and was looking for an interesting class to fill my humanities credit, but I ended up really liking this class, the readings, and I feel like I learned a lot. Especially if you are interested in urban planning or colonialism, I think you would get even more out of this class. Overall I found it very enjoyable. Prof. Habchi is extremely kind and teaches the class well.",
                "100%! Professor Habchi is amazing and I learned so much from this class that I could apply to other classes and fields of study. The readings and discussions were always interesting and so much fun, and it was the highlight of my semester.",
                "I really enjoyed this class and would definitely recommend it. Professor Habchi is so wonderful and the discussions we had in class were some of the most genuinely thoughtful and engaging that I've had in any Yale seminar. I think you would get the most out of this class if you've already taken some classes in postcolonial theory\/history and are looking for a course that focuses more on looking at these frameworks and histories through literature and other art."
