                "Primarily gained skills in working with pencils, charcoal, pastels, ink, and other mediums to create art. Also gained insights in a variety of techniques and approaches that can be used to convey meaning in drawing, such as tonal vs. graphic drawing, as well as the carefully-chosen use of color. This is a course where you will not have to explicitly memorize many of the skills you learn, but they will become muscle memory and you will find yourself incorporating these techniques without even realizing it.",
                "I learned how to use charcoal, pastels, colored pencils, and ink in new and more effective ways. I also learned about different ways of perceiving and conveying what I conceive through tone.",
                "As a beginner, I found this class super helpful for learning about basic principles of art like tone, contour, color, etc. and now I feel much more comfortable with observation-based drawings and sketching for fun! We also learned how to analyze\/interpret artworks and work with different mediums like charcoal, ink, and chalk pastels",
                "Basic drawing techniques (shapes, color theory, line\/shading, etc)",
                "As a STEM student who hasn't touched art in years, this course helped me pick up drawing again and feel confident about my skills. I've never worked with most of the mediums we used in class, and I became comfortable with all of them by the end of the semester. I think the class is not meant to be prescriptive in nature, but I still gained a good knowledge of different techniques that I could use to improve my drawing skills. The class also gave me a new way to approach art and changed how I view artwork around me!",
                "I learned basic drawing techniques, such as shading, tone, working with colors, and drawing proportions. I gained more confidence in my drawing abilities and was able to improve after receiving clear feedback from the instructor and TA.",
                "Knowledge of various foundational drawing principles, skill with charcoal\/pastels, and a lot more. I learned to draw by mapping out the foundations quickly and then going into finer details rather than focusing on the little details first."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Our amazing professor (Ryan) and amazing TF (Louise) were the main strengths. The use of different materials was eye opening and wonderful. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was a little more transparency and structure around each week's projects. Maybe more interim assignments would help us with the bigger projects!",
                "This course was awesome. Take it with Ryan!",
                "The in-class drawings were always very engaging, and we experimented with a range of tools and techniques. The course also offered a wide variety of things to draw, from models to plants to animals. Feedback on assignments and in-class drawings was helpful but sporadic.",
                "Strengths: Very exciting course overall one of the few instances during my time at Yale I've been excited to wake up at 9:30am. Also, this is not a very intense or demanding course, so very nice to balance out many of my other technical and rigorous classes with one that is more relaxed. The professor of this course is the most notable highlight Ryan is super nice and supportive, making this course very inviting and easily approachable, for someone like me who lacked previous drawing experience. Of course, this class will also be unlike any other course you've likely taken at Yale because it is extremely hands-on, and you spend the vast majority of your time learning by doing rather than by reading or watching (which is a breath of fresh air compared to many dry lectures at Yale).\r\nWeaknesses: I think it could be helpful to receive even more feedback. I enjoyed our group critiques of the projects we produced, but we generally only exchanged positive comments, and it would be helpful to receive personalized feedback from the instructor on the areas that could require improvement. That being said, Ryan offers a great amount of important insight on our in-class exercise, and that feedback was very useful and actionable.",
                "I really enjoyed having class time to draw and get immediate feedback from the professor and TA. I also liked how many different mediums, materials, and subjects we worked with over the course of the semester. I think the order of the three main assignments was a bit odd - I would personally have liked to do the self-portrait last after having the experience of the full class behind me.",
                "Strengths: - Ryan and Louise! Both of them are super knowledgeable about art and great at conveying feedback\/criticism in a way that's encouraging yet still helpful. It's pretty impressive how they can always manage to perceive and point out the positives of your work and also suggest future directions of where to work next. They recognize that students are coming into the class w\/different skill levels & backgrounds, and they really work to create a positive and low-stakes environment. Louise especially was so warm and wonderful, and she always had such profound insights during crits\/studio time that it was hard to believe that this was her first time TAing a course! - Very low stress, we didn't have much work besides the three main projects (and Ryan gave us class time to work on the last project) and we had a lot of freedom to do what we wanted - The figure\/model drawings were really fun, and I feel like we had a lot of them - We got to work with color, which I've heard isn't always the case with other beginner drawing classes - We didn't have to pay anything out of pocket; all the materials -- even the sketchbooks and pencils -- were provided, which was super nice \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: - sometimes class would run a bit late, but it was nice if you wanted more time to draw - it would've been nice to learn more formal techniques, the class felt a lot more free-form\/unstructured later on in the semester (but I get that some students might prefer that flexibility)",
                "The \"learn-as-you-do\" style was great as an opportunity to put in the hours and get better. However, I wonder if more time on theory might have helped me make more progress faster.",
                "This course is unlike any I'd ever taken at Yale; you get assessed on something completely different from exams, P-Sets, and papers. That is both a liberating and challenging experience. I say challenging to note that it can be outside of a lot of people's comfort zones. But most people, including me, seemed to adapt well. The course teaches you how to approach art in a new way; I found myself critically analyzing the styles of many artists after taking it. It also makes you confident about your skills. You gain a lot of ideas just by working with so many other people who approach the subject matter differently. At the same time, most of the people in the class were beginners; I never felt judged negatively but still picked up on many new areas of improvement.\r\n\r\nSince this class is meant to develop skills, so you definitely get what you put into this course. You could take it easy and not improve much over the semester or do extra work and benefit from it. The assignment can be challenging to ideate about, which I personally found fun. There aren't very solid guidelines on what you should or shouldn't do, so the way your art develops is up to you. I say that in case you expect to be drawing Renaissance-esque sketches by the end of the class--that will probably not be the case. But the class will help you understand how you can get where you want to be in terms of your artistic skills.",
                "Strengths: each class was very engaging! class would go by so fast because I was so engaged in whatever drawing we were working on; received clear feedback on major assignments; appreciated that we had class time to work on our final project; sketchbooks were fun to have\r\nWeaknesses: class would oftentimes run over time (especially when we would have critiques) so I would have appreciated better time management",
                "Strengths are the course has very little homework so students can completely focus on studio work in class, the relaxed atmosphere, and the teacher Ryan who gives live critique as we draw. We also cover a lot of material\/techniques, and the variety of subjects we draw is engaging and fun."

            "comments": [
                "YES! If you get in, take it. I feel like I hear a lot of students say it's a \"waste\" of a Yale course to take an art class, and I could not disagree more. I think the fact that we have the world's greatest art school next door, and that most students won't ever get to use its resources, meet its professors and students, and learn from its workshop style classes is a TRAGEDY. SERIOUSLY. I learned so much about the importance of art and aesthetic from this course, and would take it again and again if I could. It's also just fun and awesome to sit down and draw for two hours twice a week. You'll get stressed about it ONLY if you care so much about your work that you want it to be great. Which you will!!!",
                "Yes, I have heard it depends on your instructor, but I had Ryan Sluggett who was the absolute best.",
                "Yes - every class was always really interesting and fun. My drawing skills also improved over the semester, and I definitely gained a lot of practice with different drawing techniques. Ryan is also a great prof.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course, especially with Ryan. It is unique among all the classes I've taken at Yale because 99% of what you learn in this course is hands-on (drawing exercises), rather than time spent reading or watching other artists. This makes it very approachable, very fun, and a perfect break from other lecture-based courses at Yale.",
                "For sure! It was really lovely to get to use a different part of my brain and try something new. Its also definitely affected the way I see the world on a day-to-day basis  I think I look more closely and appreciate imperfection more now.",
                "Yes, especially for beginners! This class was something I looked forward to every week. It was fun and low-stress\/low-workload -- but I still feel like I got so much out of it -- before this class, drawing used to seem so overwhelming and impossible, but by the end of this class, I felt like I'd improved so much as a beginner artist. This class teaches the very basic techniques of how to draw from observation and also includes a lot of fun activities like grad student studio visits, basic printmaking, model\/figure drawing, a YUAG trip, and even drawing crazy taxidermied animals for a week. I'd especially recommend Ryan as an instructor because he's super encouraging, knowledgeable, and accommodating!",
                "Yes. It's fun and chill, and Ryan is a great teacher.",
                "I 100% would. I think every Yale student should take at least one art course before graduating to learn to think a little differently (that, and because the art school is one of the best in the country). This course is definitely on top of that list. Having artworks due rather than papers of P-Sets made the course so enjoyable. You work in your own time, which gives you a lot of freedom--you can get as creative as you want with your work, and get rewarded for it as well. \r\n\r\nWorking in the studio is exciting, and this class was almost like art therapy breaks from the rest of the semester. You also get to know the people in class since you spend so much time working around them and looking at each other's work. It's also amazing to see how differently people see and approach the same subject matter. It was really fun to finally take an art class and get comfortable with drawing. You also get a small portfolio of work to hold on to forever. Would for sure recommend it if you manage to get in!",
                "Yes!! Even if you have no background in drawing, this class is so fun, engaging, and rewarding! This class will increase your confidence in drawing and will teach you important techniques.",
                "Certainly, for those who already do art its nice to have a class specifically designated for drawing, and for those who haven't done much art, its a fun and easy way to get into it. If you go to class and put in the work and have an open-mind, you will improve and have a lot of fun."
