            "comments": [
                "This class just doesn't cover anything relevant to the real-world. It's math-heavy but explained without any math, as if the conceptual explanation makes more sense. It would be better if the professor used explanations involving derivatives, integrals, etc.",
                "I think the course really varies by instructor. The psets are helpful, but the speed of instruction varies. My section struggled a lot with the tests.",
                "There were few resources to supplement student learning; office hours were non-comprehensive and only given at inconvenient times. In addition, there was no peer tutoring or other types of learning outside of the classroom. No practice exams or problems were given ahead of midterms, so providing this type of review would've been helpful.",
                "I really feel that there were many possible strengths that I could take from the class. However, the professor made it really hard for any strengths to really shine. I can see how people can learn about economics from the class as a potential strength, however, Maria made it very hard to learn. Professor Saez is honestly mean at times to students, I remember that in some of her office hours, many responses to other students were uncalled for. Another weakness is that it is very hard to hear Maria during lectures, very often, she would just mumble a lot of her words, and it was content that was not on her slides. I found myself struggling a lot because this was my very first econ class. Many kids took AP Micro in high school and were doing fine on the psets as they had learned the material, but if you've never taken anything econ-related, you will have a hard time as the psets are not from the content taught in class. Basically, the syllabus says you don't need econ experience, but this only works in theory. Maria will also choose the worst possible times for office hours. She would often hold these Wednesdays, in the middle of the day, when most people have classes. Other classes give problem tests before a midterm or a final, Maria would just tell you that she did enough work on the slides and the psets and she wasn't doing any extra work. For the final as well, she made it impossible for people traveling. Most professors decided to waive the final and give students the choice to keep the grade they had. Maria decided to host the final, the day after all students were encouraged to go home because of the pandemic. I think that the course could be greatly improved by structuring it in a more friendly way for people who have never taken econ and take students' petition for test prep into consideration.",
                "I think the Professor does a really good job being thorough in her teaching -- the slide notes were remarkably helpful for me. The seminar format also helped me be able to engage in the lecture. That participation was skewed, however, and the class would have benefited from wider participation.",
                "Smaller econ sections, the seminar was basically just a smaller econ 115 lecture not a seminar, lack of discussing learning,",
                "I really think the major weakness of this course was the professor. Saez is clearly very knowledgeable about econ, but isn't able to teach in a way that makes sense to someone who has never taken any econ before, and she would get very frustrated when we weren't able to immediately pick up a new topic, especially when the idea seemed simple to her. A lot of this frustration came from the idea that she believes her slideshows have all of the information, and thus that is the only resource she provides. However, without explanation, these slides don't make a lot of sense, and thus are hard to study with. If she recorded the lectures where she gave that explanation, it could help with studying, but as of now, it just makes the slides very difficult to use, and studying very hard.",
                "Strengths: well organized into chunks by topic, the problem sets every week were a great way to review each chunk\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: besides the problem sets, there were minimal opportunities for practice questions, which might have been helpful for exams",
                "It was not taught like a seminar there was no room for participation. Didnt enjoy the course",
                "The course is lacking a strong TA system that could greatly benefit students for both PSETs, midterms, and overall understanding of course material. Recorded lectures would also be a very beneficial addition.",
                "Engagement to class and patience from Professor.",
                "Strength: good content \r\nWeaknesses: too much variety between sections, some people had final exams, some didnt, etc.",
                "Strength of the course is the breadth of topics. The weakness of the course was the over complication of the subject matter. The course pushed for complex problem solving rather than understanding the basics. The course could be improved by slowing down and spending more time making sure the class understands each topic and gets experience solving example problems before moving on.",
                "Slides could have been clearer (too many numbers with no explanation), could have been more practice problems",
                "Weaknesses: very few practice problems, therefore when it came to exams, found the questions to be more challenging since we hadnt seen those types of questions (or a variety of questions overall) beforehand.",
                "The content was quite dry and felt overwhelming the way it was presented to us in slides. It, however, helped me to develop my note taking abilities by using paraphrasing. The seminar class felt to be at a disadvantage to Econ 115, as it lacked the ability to go back and re-watch lectures that may have been too difficult to understand in class.",
                "The course is extremely difficult and could potentially be more problems. Kind of a lot of information thrown at us, with no roadmap",
                "I struggled to follow lectures in this course. The powerpoints were not clearly marked, and the professor often rushed through the material. I believe if there had been fewer rushing and clearer slides, students would have followed lectures. A strength of this class was the reviews of difficult psets in class and solutions posted to all midterms and psets."

                "Absolutely not.",

                "Absolutely not. The \"seminar\" is truly just a small lecture without the benefits of discussion sections and TAs.",
                "In my opinion, if you have to take this course take it in the larger lecture.",
                "I would be wary of which section you get because it can make or break your grade in the course. My teacher was certainly invested in our learning as they showed through their willingness to engage with us during office hours, but the tests still came back with very low averages. Overall, interesting stuff.",
                "I would not recommend this course to a student who has no background in microeconomics, as the content is not very engaging. In addition, I would not recommend this course for students who are not majoring in economics, as there are more accessible Social Science courses to fulfill a distributional requirement. In a cost-benefit analysis of the utility of the course, the cost outweighs the benefits.",
                "No, I would recommend the lecture rather than the seminar. With the seminar, you are stuck with your professor, with no other help. Friends who were in the lecture had a whole team of people other than the professor helping them. Also, the lecture gives a lot of practice problems before the test, which is extremely helpful. If you are to take the seminar, I would recommend other professors.",
                "Yes. It's important to have a fundamental understanding of economics, and this course did a good job at providing it. I think it's a skill ever citizen deserves to have, and proud should have.",
                "No I would recommend the lecture format",
                "I would not recommend this specific course to another student. If I could go back, I would have either not taken this class at all, or taken the large Econ 115 lecture as this class felt like the worst of both worlds. What I mean is that it still feels like a lecture class, with very little in-class engagement, but with the curve of a small seminar and without the additional resources provided in 115. I think the only reason to take the seminar would be an amazing professor, which Saez wasn't in my opinion. I would be interested to take a class with her that wasn't basic econ, but this was not a good experience.",
                "Yes! I feel that this course provided great foundational knowledge of economics that will prove useful in many other academic contexts.",
                "No I definitely would not. At least not with this professor. I think Econ 115 wouldve been a much better choice.",
                "I would be hesitant to recommend this course since the alternative class in the lecture has far more resources designed to aid students in learning e.g. discussion sections with TAs, recorded lectures, practice midterms/finals before exams, etc.,",
                "Absolutely not. I took this class because it was a seminar. I thought I would be able to ask questions in the class and have a good relationship with the professor. The opposite was true. This class was taught identical to a lecture. The professor read off of her slides in class. Students were afraid to ask questions. When they did they were rarely met with a good answer. Answers to questions consisted of, \"because.....economics\" and \"you should already know that\", and \"If you had been coming to my lectures\"- the student who asked the last question had been at every lecture and asked a question that I too was wondering. I sincerely wish I had taken 115. They had an abundance more of resources. 115 students had recorded lectures practices tests review sessions and sections available. While 110 had very limited resources. Office hours were held directly with the professor and were entirely unhelpful. I really felt like my only option was teaching myself with my only resource as the textbook. Econ was a major that I was very interested in coming into Yale to pursue. However, I feel that I can not continue on in the major. Mainly because of the overall negative experience and ruined economics for me. The thought of doing a Pset for the class makes my stomach sink. And secondly, because I don't think I actually learned enough in this class to continue. If I were to take maco next year I don't think I would know the proper background information required for the course.",
                "Yes because it has very useful content.",
                "Yes, good to know about these topics",
                "I would recommend the course but the profesor was difficult to understand and did not provide my outside practice materials. All course material are on slides that are posted. However the professor did little explanation of new concepts before moving on so I would recommend reading the textbook beforehand.",
                "I would not recommend it, as it seemed to me that the resources for the larger Econ 115 lecture class were much more abundant. There is more students in the lecture that could be of help. In hindsight, the discussion sections native to Econ 115 now seem to be more useful than the \"tight-knit\" dynamic that was promised with a seminar class.",
                "If they wanted to major, but this course has discouraged me and many of my peers to leave the economics field because the intro level is so hard",
                "I would recommend this class if a student is looking for an intimate classroom setting to learn economics. If not, I would recommend econ 115."
