                "I developed insights galore: all sorts of new ways of thinking about contemporary Russian affairs. Almost all of the knowledge was new to me. As for skills, I found my writing for this class didn't quite push any boundaries, the way I thought it might. My final paper resembled many others I have written at Yale, even if the content and scope was thoroughly new. Naturally the blame for this lies squarely on my shoulders. I thoug",
                "You learn a ton about Russian history and the psychology of Russian leaders and strategists. You also learn how to have \"strategic empathy\" and think through what American opponents value and why they take the actions they do, especially as this is informed by history. The class made me understand Russia's action for the past 30 years far, far better.",

Weaknesses: Class size was a bit large so discussions tended to be unwieldy; I would have liked to hear more from Prof. Graham about his perspective, as he is a real expert in the field.",
                "The course went from strength to strength.\r\n\r\nThe only real weakness is that in the mid section of the semester, when the reading and discussion became more focused, it was easier for the students who hadn't prepared presentations to disengage from the discussion. I wonder if there might be any way to force students to contribute.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Graham's mastery of the material is a huge strength. Not only does he know so much about the topic, he also was there for critical moments in recent Russian policy. There's nothing quite like having an academic discussion on a possible Russian partnership with America in 2002 have as a brief aside, \"that young diplomat was Thomas Graham.\" The Prof makes U.S.-Russia policy leap to life. The class is also very discussion-forward, so be prepared to have your thoughts engaged with and challenged, in a way that is fun and thought-provoking, not in a way that makes you feel caught off guard.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing major. Be prepared for class though, as you will need to be ready to talk about your opinions!",

It's definitely a class where you get out of it what you put into it. There were times when the class didn't go into as much depth as I would have liked, but it was a solid overview of the main issues in Russia policy.",
                "Yes. If the student has any interest in Russia, or contemporary foreign affairs, or a potential interest therein, then this is the course for them.",
                "Totally! Prof. Graham is a great lecturer who is very engaging, and makes the class absolutely a gem. It's not much work at all for how much you learn. If you have even a passing interest in Russia or American grand strategy, you must take this class. Class discussions are super fun and really broadened my understanding of U.S. foreign policy, as well as a better idea of why our adversaries use the strategies and tactics they do.",
