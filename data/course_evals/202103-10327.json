                "I learned how to access Yale's library online and use it to do research on a specific topic. I also learned better writing skills and how to improve my own writing. I learned a lot about environmental memory and the theory behind different types.",
                "Writing style, clarity, and organization. How to identify keywords and use them to guide discussions, especially between readings.",

                "Professor Hills English 114: Environmental Memory class has pushed me to become a clearer, more structured writer and thinker by not only requiring me to iteratively consider what I was saying and how I was saying it, but also why and how my arguments came together to form a more integrated whole.",
                "This course helped me develop better critical thinking and reading skills through examining a variety of different texts. I also developed stronger argumentative writing skills and learned how to incorporate insights from different authors in order to support a claim. In addition to this, I was able to gain a lot of knowledge about the concept of environmental memory, and how an understanding of it can help develop more thoughtful and inclusive uses of different environments.",
                "I learned so much about the fascinating topic of environmental memory and how present it is in our world around us --- so much so, that the class has literally shifted my perspective in how I see and remember my environment around me. I learned about what it takes to write great research-based papers, how to formulate solid defendable and contestable claims, and ultimately write in a way that is clear, persuasive, and organized."

Some weaknesses are the length of the readings that are difficult to digest, and the short amount of time we have between getting feedback on our first draft of the essay to when the final draft is due.",
                "One major strength of this course is the cohesion of the readings. I appreciated how thoughtful Anna was in putting together the syllabus and it was nice to develop new ideas and opinions as the course progressed.",
                "Strength is definitely the professor. She is extremely nice and cares about actually making you a better writer. We also got to go on some field trips. The small size of this class was a strength as I was able to actually build bonds with my classmates and professor. The weaknesses are that the readings were somewhat boring and I did not like the topic of this class. I thought that if we had a different topic, I would have absolutely loved the class.",
                "Strengths: Good selection of readings (and not too many), interesting discussions, helpful lessons on how to write claims and intros, peer review workshops, and specific and thoughtful feedback.\r\nWeaknesses: Some readings seemed less connected to topic.",
                "Strengths: very engaging professor, small classroom, lots of interesting books\/passages\r\n\r\nWeakness: Lots and lots of writing and reading!",
                "Professor Hills section of English 114 is an incredibly strong introductory writing class. It balances thought-provoking readings from a wide variety of perspectives with useful practice in structuring and defending an argument. This class has had a profound impact on my ability to conduct textual analysis across a wide range of challenging readings and draw connections among these sources through a more holistic appreciation of the ways these authors engage with similar ideas in different ways. Environmental memory  and memory in general  is a truly interesting and unique lens through which to view the world. Taking this class has changed the way I think about the places Ive known my entire life, various new environments I interact with on a day-to-day basis, and the impact that elements of modern culture have on the ways we remember historical places and events.",
                "This course centered around a very interesting topic which also provided many opportunities to explore further and make connections with other subjects. The selection of texts represented authors of many different backgrounds, races, etc., and even featured some works of fiction and a graphic novel. This made the class very engaging and allowed students to develop an understanding of environmental memory using many different sources. The writing assignments were also very engaging and provided room for creativity while also focusing on developing certain types of writing skills. This was overall a great course and I have no suggestions for how it could be improved.",
                "One of this course's strengths was that it allowed me to engaged with diverse variety of texts, mediums, and authors. In the class, we explored environmental memory in the arts from a visit to the Yale Art Gallery, in urban landscapes with a walking tour of New Haven, and in various historical and environmental texts through incredibly unique and fascinating texts by diverse authors. Another strength of this course was that it highly encouraged creative freedom and flexibility: we chose the topics\/texts to write our papers on and there was a creative final project that was very fun. Overall this course, while challenging at times, was very fulfilling. This course also rewards improvement and allows for real, substantial growth in writing style and technique. \r\n\r\nExpect a lot of reading in this course, but the readings are really interesting so it does not feel laborious."

                "For anyone interested in the environment I would 100% recommend this class. This class also made me a better writer with the high standards on each essay.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this to other students. The course was well organized and expectations were clear. This class was highly focused on Environmental Memory, but the topic is so wide-ranging that the class was always very interesting.",
                "I would recommend you find a english 114 course that you genuinely enjoy the topic. Also, look at some of the readings before choosing the class. If it has Anna Hill as the professor though, then take it!",
                "Yes!! I really loved thinking, reading, and writing about environmental memory and learning to see and think through different lenses while working on writing skills.  There was a good balance of discussions about the readings and the topic with lessons on how to write better (claim and introduction workshops were especially helpful).  The readings and workload are generally manageable and Anna gives great, in-depth feedback on first and final drafts.",
                "Yes. The course is very writing intensive but it definitely helps students improve.",
                "Yes! It is very interesting and engaging. I loved the small classroom and learned detailed lessons.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student  first and foremost because of Professor Hill  but also because the subject matter was truly fascinating, and the writing and other requirements helped me develop significantly as a writer and thinker.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student because it deals with a very interesting topic and provides the opportunity to engage with many great texts. I also learned a lot about the importance of history and memory in terms of environments and places and how an understanding of this can be an essential step in the conservation of current environments and acknowledgement of the way different groups of people have treated different lands. I think this course is a great way to develop a better worldview while also strenghtening argumentative writing skills.",
                "Yes!! I would 100% recommend this incredible course to another student, as I learned so much and was able to strengthen and sharpen my writing skills significantly. Anna was incredibly supportive and helpful, and provides detailed and thorough personal feedback for her students' work, which is incredibly useful in zeroing in on areas students should focus on to improve their writing. She facilitates excellent class discussions and all the texts and mediums we worked with were so different and exciting from what I have experienced before."
