                "I think there is a very noticeable, and inequitable disparity between the teachers that are in this course. There is a very large difference between someone who takes a class with the department head who not only writes the exams but also speaks clearly and can explain material well, and someone who takes a class with someone with an extremely thick accent and not the best way to explain content. This is not to say that people with thick accents cannot teach, only that if you take both these students at face value, one will stand out more than the other.",
                "Strengths: This course promotes collaborative work. Problem Sets and in lecture exercises are often collaborative, and during office hours, we are encouraged to work in large groups before we consult the TA's about problems we are stuck on. I think this is useful because we have a variety of ways to improve and learn. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Considering how often we complete problem sets, I think it is a weakness of this class that they are worth so little. It is our main way to practice the concepts we learn in class. Problem Sets can be a major reflection of growth, whereas exams are one shot, and we only get 3. Additionally, another weakness I found was that problem sets often go a while before they are graded, making it a little difficult to track your progress.",
                "The class time was very short, i think students might benefit from longer or more frequent meetings.",
                "Way too difficult problem sets that sometimes require you to learn the material yourself, the explorations were stressful rather than helpful. Review sessions were excellent."

Additionally, so many people take this class that you're likely to know a friend or two who are in it. The collaborative aspect of this course makes learning enjoyable for an otherwise challenging class.",

                "I found it incredibly interesting, but if you are not invested in math and would take the course simply as a prerequisite, I wouldn't recommend it. It's up to the individual, but the course itself is worth it"
