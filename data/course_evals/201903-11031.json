   "comments": [
    "Improved French speaking and writing abilities",
    "This course was great practice in analyzing literature, writing essays, presenting information and ideas.",
    "I think I developed a lot of stamina in reading French texts. I had never read such long books in French, so maintaining focus and keeping steady engagement was something I really worked on throughout the semester.",
    "I learned how to read closely and write essays in a more streamlined fashion.",
    "I definitely did more french reading than I have ever done, with the two enormous books that we read this semester. I also have never focused on 21st century literature, in French or English, and it was great to learn about the contemporary literary world in France. My French writing and speaking also definitely got better, thanks to Professeur Cadieu.",
    "This course focused on contemporary French literature, specifically two recently published 600 page novels. I learned how to read quickly, we were required to read at least 100 pages per week, while also paying attention to themes, grammar, and plot. Throughout this course, students prepared 1 presentation and wrote 3 essays, so I had a lot of opportunities to develop my thinking and ideas over the course of the semester. These assignments also improved my written French and analytical skills. This course was conducted entirely in French and so my spoken French in an academic setting also improved.",
    "I learned an enormous amount about the scholarship that has been done on very long novels, or \"le roman-monde\", as novels of great length are often called. I had never been exposed to this particular topic, and so each class meeting taught me something new and exciting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Good course; two wonderful books",
    "A very good course overall.",
    "I think the class discussions could be more focused than they were. What really fascinated me where the supplementary readings, especially the more theoretical writings of Murat and Samoyault. I wish we had delved into those more.",
    "The course was interesting, but I found that there was not enough class participation. I don't know if this was a result of Professor Cadieu's facilitating abilities or of the class (I'd guess the latter). The course could be improved by making the expectations for essays more clear.",
    "I thought everyone in the class was very engaged, and participated a lot (Prof. Cadieu is good at this). I also like the course-load, which requires different ways of practicing french and approaching the language-- analytical papers, presentation, glossary, and a final paper. \r\nThough the point of the class was to stick with two very long books, I think that this is hard to do in a college course. The reading became less interesting as the semester went on, and the discussion often felt similar from class to class because of this. I also didn't love how much we talked about the experience of reading-- I would have preferred more analysis.",
    "This was honestly one of the best French classes at Yale, I left each class feeling as though I had discovered something new and interesting. In addition to the 100+ pages of required reading, Professor Cadieu often assigned radio episodes, TV episodes, or newspaper articles so that in class we could connect the themes of the books to contemporary topics which furthered our analyses to arrive at new conclusions. At times, however, this structure of the class made it feel like I was learning more about extraneous topics rather than the novels we were supposed to be focusing on. I don't remember ever talking about the book purely to talk about the book, our discussion of the book was always a means to an end, a means to connect it to other themes or topics. If we did talk about the book, I do not remember focusing on the plot or character development. In some cases, this structure was useful because it allowed students who had not read all the required pages to still engage in class, but it was also disappointing for those who had read the pages and felt that it was futile as the book was often not discussed in depth. But, this structure also kept the class engaged because we moved between many different topics. I feel like my knowledge on French culture and the French literary scene developed alongside my engagement with the two novels.",
    "This course has many great strengths: Professor Cadieu is brilliant, she is very good at leading discussions, and the books are fascinating (especially Double nationalit). It doesn't have many weaknesses, but I do think the paper topics don't allow for a lot of creativity in terms of devising your own topic (this would be very easy to fix)."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, for any student interested in literature we don't always get to read longer works, but in this class we did and it was nice.",
    "If you have the time and willingness to put into the readings, then yes. But if you have a very busy schedule and are likely to put off the readings, I would not.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wanted to read contemporary books and immerse themselves in different literary worlds.",
    "I definitely recommend Prof Cadieu, as I think she really helps with the language without making that the sole purpose of the course. I also think she picks really interesting books and content for her syllabi, and she knows so much about all of them. She is a very tough grader (especially tough on the french), but her teaching worth it! \r\nI don't think I would recommend this course specifically, because I didn't like that we only read two long novels (though I was initially excited about this), and I thought too much of the class focused on literary culture, rather than the books' content.",
    "Yes! I would highly recommend this course to another L5 French student! This course taught me so much and my written academic French really improved, with help not only from the French writing tutors but Professor Cadieu herself as well.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The books are amazing, but be prepared to read a lot, and to spend a while coming up with a thesis for your paper (for some reason, I found writing papers for this class quite difficult).",
    "Yes, I would. Prof. Cadieu is wonderful and she truly cares about her students. However, I would take a closer look at the novels selected for the course. I hated one of the 2 books that we read, which made the second half of the semester very painful."
