                "I gained a fresh perspective about history and historical works. Both the readings and the way Prof. Semmel stirs the class discussions around them are eye-opening. It strengthened my critical thinking and writing skills. I met a few good friends in class.",
                "I learned about historical disciplines as well as how to effectively write.",
                "I now think of history and historical perspectives with a more open mind. I think it is a great seminar that gives you a foundation in the future study of history.",
                "The course introduced me to some of the questions and principles that historians face when researching and interpreting. There was a balance between the philosophies behind why and how we write history, as well as the more technical aspects of historiography in the digital age.",
                "How to critically analyze different approaches to history",
                "Learned about different types of history, and the meaning of the history profession.",
                "a lot of insight into the various schools of history that made me very confused (in a good way) about the right way to approach and treat history. it has also made me more mindful of my own casual use of history, and a great general preview to the field of history in general",
                "This course was a sort of meta history class, covering many dimensions of the questions of why and how historians analyze the past. It was an interesting overview of many of the debates that divide professional historians, such as the extent to which we can and should apply history to the present, what scales history should be studied on, how technology is changing the study of history, and whether counterfactuals have a role in historical scholarship.",
                "I learned a lot about different approaches to History.",
                "Learned how to think critically about different approaches/methodologies to studying history (including why we study the subject at all); covered topics such as microhistory, global history, counterfactual history, The Annales School, New Cultural History, the Thucydides Trap; read from influential historians like Robert Darnton, Karl Marx, Natalie Zemon Davis, and Fernand Braudel"

                "Readings were sometimes difficult to follow but the discussions were very interesting, and related to present-day topics.",
                "The course covered many different thinkers and historians. Reading works from disparate times, places, and cultures was very interesting and helped enrich our discussions. However, at times it felt the course lacked structure as we were bouncing between different centuries, continents, and topics of study.",
                "Strengths\r\n- Discussion based classes, very relaxed and conducive to participation",
                "The readings are interesting, although some material proved to be more relevant than others. There were few assignments, which has its pros and cons.",
                "it is a very interesting course and an interesting insight into professor semmels view on history as well. my only gripe is that class engagement seems to be at first very broad and then slowly limiting down to a small portion of the class, but that might be perhaps due to the amount of historical proficiency among the class.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting class discussions, and Prof. Semmel has a very Socratic teaching style that gives students ample opportunities to participate; class material was pretty accessible, with Prof. Semmel always making sure to define words or concepts of which authors assumed knowledge; Prof. Semmel is very compassionate towards his students; reasonable workload, with very few unnecessary readings assigned. \r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "Strengths: Professor Semmel is great, he's very understanding and genuinely one of the nicest people ever; there were moments during this class when certain ideas and concepts clicked that were particularly rewarding; some of the course material was very thought-provoking; the trips to the Yale Art Gallery and Beinecke Library were super interesting as well || Weaknesses: sometimes, class discussions could get a bit dull and directionless; though many of the readings were great (especially the more contemporary ones, like the articles debating the validity of the Thucydides Trap), some of them were very dense and difficult to get through"

                "Yes! Even if you are not an anticipated History major, it is a great foundation in skills that can be applied in many areas.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students, as the historiographic perspectives presented are broadly applicable academically. Especially for prospective history majors, this course will make you reevaluate how you research and consume works of history.",
                "Yes, if interested in history and willing to put in a few hours each week to do the reading material, you can absolutely get out what you put in",
                "Yes, definitely. The discussions in this course are more eye-opening than any other course I have experienced.",
                "yes absolutely! it is a brilliant introduction to the field of history in general, as well as the study of history.",
                "Yes, especially to students interested in taking more history courses later. Prof. Semmel is super nice, the class discussions are great, and I think this course is be extremely valuable in framing more specific history classes I take in the future.",
                "Not really. It was technically interesting, but I wish I'd done another first-year seminar. I think the only long-lasting thing I learned from it was that I don't want to major in history.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a nice general introduction to the discipline of history and how historians choose to study the past"
