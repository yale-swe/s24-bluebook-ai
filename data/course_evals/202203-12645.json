            "comments": [
                "I love how this course is project oriented as I tend to learn way more working hands on. The work was challenging, but manageable, and both ULAs and the professor were available to help. This class encourages working together and stepping out of your comfort zone to ask for help - something I wish more classes would teach as it is a valuable life lesson. As for weaknesses, I think the main one was having errors in the uploaded template as this made our homework assignments take much longer than intended. Moving forward, if the new templates that were created this semester were used, and the same assignments were required, there would be no issue with this class.",
                "This class, despite its faults, is one of the most interesting classes Ive taken at Yale and I think it has the potential to be an extremely solid class. The faults lie in disorganization, lack of materials available, and lack of supporting staff (perhaps graduate students) to support both Dr. Booth (to review his assignments for errors or to support him with office hours) and the students. I learned a lot, but there were a lot of hurdles because of miscommunication and disorganization, and I think having a kit of materials for the class and having grad student support for machine shop hours or for reviewing his assignments would greatly improve the course.",
                "Although the content was good, the organization of the course was a bit sporadic. There were many written pset + matlab script + physical prototype assignments lumped together all due in one week, which was difficult to manage, although deadlines ended up being extended and not very important by the end of course. I believe this course could be improved by the first set of lectures and assignments being focused on learning the material from Shigley (the textbook) and getting a understanding of the principles and doing problems by hand. Then, a second phase of the course could be an intro to the final project and some matlab teaching, where the corresponding assignments are the matlab scripts which apply the concepts from Shigley into solvers. Then, the final phase of the course could be using what we have learned to plan the project and have a much longer time to build, as well as none of the other assignments piled on top. With how the course was set this year, myself and many of my peers gave little to no thought on the physical prototypes in the beginning, which were completion based, which I think made the final project transition harder. I think not trying to have the students focus on statics problems, matlab, and building something all at the same time would greatly improve this course. Additionally, there needs to be a TF or more TAs who can check Professor Booth's matlab code before it is released in assignments. There were too many cases of the code having errors/bugs or incorrect variables.",
                "The course has the potential to be the best course in the MEMS department, but it's not there yet. Dr. Booth tries really hard and is great to talk to one-on-one but the course is disorganized and his matlab code has problems, leading to a lot of extra time sunk into the assignments. The course could be improved via clearer guidance on manufacturing prototypes and shorter matlab assignments. The matlab assignments, while intended to complement the building of the prototype, took up a lot of time and distracted me from the primary semester-long task of designing and building a chalk crusher. Actually making the prototype in the machine shop and B7 was fun (though time-consuming). The lectures were good, although they could perhaps be re-ordered so that students get needed info about manufacturing earlier on in the semester.",
                "The content of the course is very limited compared to the title of the course. We did not get much experience related to different manufacturing techniques or productions of different mechanical elements except for the last two weeks where every student presented one additive and subtractive manufacturing technique.",
                "In terms of strengths, I enjoyed that this course improved my confidence in machining things and 3D modeling. It was very satisfying to come away having created something that I designed and made from scratch. \r\n\r\nThis course has several weaknesses. The first is the lack of an actual TA. The ULAs were not as helpful as Dr Booth with homework, especially since only he could give us access to the B7 machine shop. With an actual TA, students would be able to get more assistance. \r\n\r\nThe second is the focus on MATLAB. The course has you create code that models the mathematical relations necessary for machine design, but the code templates were so difficult to decipher that most of my time doing homework was spent debugging rather than understanding. In the future, more examples in class and some problems to solve by hand for homework would improve understanding better than the MATLAB. \r\n\r\nThe last weakness is the timeline of the course. Dr Booth intended for the beginning of the semester to be more time intensive so that greater time could be spent designing our projects in the end. In reality, the pace of the course at the start was very overwhelming. Our first assignment was to put together a 3D printer and print several pieces within 2 days. Even though I started as soon as possible, I was not able to finish on time. MATLAB homeworks were similarly difficult to finish on time. Another issue with the timeline of the course was when we began manufacturing things. Our first assignment that required the machine shop was late in the semester, meaning we did not have much time to master those skills in order to use them on our final product. As a result, I did not get to machine as many of my parts for my project as I wanted."

                "No, I would only take this class if it is a requirement. I did enjoy many of the aspects/topics we learned about, but I feel it is a very time consuming course and if it is not necessary, one should stay away. I do feel Dr. Booth is a fantastic lecturer and would recommend him as a professor to another student.",
                "Only if you happen to always be free during Dr. Booth's office hours. That is the only time when you can spend time productively on the assignments, so you can ask him for clarification on his problem sets and code literally every step of the way. You do end up learning the content very well, but hunting for the exact equations he was thinking of each time is impossible, and his own code templates always had bugs that would grade your homework wrong, even if it was right, and only Dr. Booth himself could find them. If you try to work on your own, you'll end up spending hours trying to find out why your code doesn't work, and then receive a canvas announcement three days later with an \"updated tester code\" to use instead. Sometimes there won't even be an announcement: you'll have to get the debugged codes from a friend who went to the office hours!",
                "Yes, but only if you're committed to it or it's required. It's a lot of work, even though there are fun parts like getting a 3D printer and making stuff in the machine shop.",
                "This course is required for the ABET MENG degree. I would recommend taking this class if you want to build confidence with making things and designing projects, but be prepared for a very difficult course load. Also, you will get the most out of this course if you take initiative to build skills on your own ask for machine shop access early and attend office hours."
