                "The biggest strength of the course is that it is once a week and allows you to post any questions you may have about a section before class so the professor can address it. It would be a little bit more engaging if we could also have discussions in class among students instead of only a one-way lecture from the professor",
                "This was a great class. I wish there were Powerpoint slides to organize the discussion. Sometimes I felt lost in the middle of lecture and so having that structure would have been nice.",
                "The strengths are Prof. Flick's deep and wide knowledge of the book. It could be improved only with slightly more student engagement  because of the lecture format, some students had their cameras off on Zoom all term. The lecture format really didn't bother me, though; it is the best vehicle for Dr. Flick's knowledge.",
                "No weaknesses. Strengths: interesting readings, great lectures, Professor Flick and Nate the TA were both awesome.",
                "A weakness fo the class was the length of the lectures. Perhaps engagement would improve if the class was taught twice a week for less time as opposed to almost two hours at a time per week. A strength of the class was the course load which was very manageable.",
                "Very well structured for weekly engagement, without excessively time consuming assignments",

                "Weakness: the most boring class I've ever taken.\r\nStrength: not too much work.",
                "The weekly discussion posts were effective in allowing students to reflect on the readings and provide the professor with any questions that would be answered in class. Due to the large class size, it was difficult to promote small group discussion among peers."
