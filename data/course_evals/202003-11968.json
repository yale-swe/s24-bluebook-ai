                "I definitely left the class with a deeper understanding of disease biology and how to essentially \"tell the story\" of how people are infected and become sick by focusing on three main parts: the pathogen, the vector, and the host. Critical thinking skills were especially honed in on and I sometimes understanding the material required that you look at everything like a giant puzzle.",
                "This was a great course for me as a non-science major. It furthered my confidence with scientific articles and material; furthered my understanding of disease, vaccines, and the immune system; and also introduced me to scientific discussion, writing, and analysis.",
                "Learning to read scientific papers, learning to write scientific papers, learned more about vector-borne diseases, the immune system, and life cycles than ever before!",
                "I have to admit that this was one of THE MOST intellectually stimulating classes I have ever taken and the sheer amount of knowledge I accrued over the course of the semester was astonishing to me, my brother, my friends, and my family. I actually shocked an epidemiologist at NIH friend at how much we'd covered in just the first 6 weeks of the class as I was explaining all the topics we'd discussed. We started with the more generalized overview type things, like the most basic parameters that the WHO and various other scientists use to measure disease prevalence and incidence, and progressively went through the basics of malaria, Lyme, dengue, relapsing fever, and a ridiculous number of other tick-borne diseases, both soft and hard-bodied. We also did the basic biology of both hard and soft-bodied ticks and anopheles vs. aedes mosquitoes, in addition to their life cycles, host life cycles, and parasite\/bacterium\/virus life cycle. We did a crash course in immunology before going into the specificities of each disease and how the body responds (and how the intermediate and other hosts respond, if not solely human). Then we covered like 9 different types of vaccines, compared and contrasted like 40 different medications for malaria and Lyme treatment (there really isn't anything for dengue treatment), and ended with a panel discussion on our own chosen intervention along with a lecture on new treatment methods that were so current that one paper was published over thanksgiving break (dogs sniffing feet to detect malaria? soup that affords immunity? wild stuff). The amount of information never ceased to amaze me, to the extent that I'm correcting misunderstandings on vaccinations that are being posted on FB as the COVID vaccines are being administered. BUT sure it was a ton of information, but no it wasn't really worth it, I'm afraid, and because of the utter breadth and depth of the knowledge required to know, it felt worse than a gen chem or orgo or intro bio sequence class because study guidelines were not very clear and the whole class was graded on an average."

                "Strengths: The material itself was really engaging and Professor Belperron is so sweet! You will learn a LOT in this class without a doubt. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture was oftentimes a dry and it was pretty easy to zone out after the first 30 mins; I think that possibly shortening the class time would help this issue and make the class move along better. Quizzes were difficult to study for 1) there was so much material to know for each one and 2) piecing together the information to make a coherent \"storyline\" of the disease was pretty difficult to do. I think the order the material was taught heavily impacted this and a simple reorganization would greatly improve one's experience.",
                "Professor Belperron clearly knows what she's talking about, but still made sure she communicated information in a way that was straightforward and understandable. I appreciated the higher number of assignments. Regular quizzes meant I studied the material more deeply than I might have independently. Some of the topics we coveredlike the immune systemwent a little quickly, but I was grateful to have presentations available online to go back over the material.",
                "Strengths: amazing lectures (engaging, thoughtful, and super fun), very practical and fun assignments, liked that we had a final paper instead of a final exam, clear feedback\r\nWeaknesses: lectures can move a bit too fast, slides sometimes come up very late (sometimes not even in time for the exam), feedback can be a bit slow",
                "WEAK: I'm sorry but I detest the grading system. We all went into the first of three quizzes being like, pfft we'll all do fine. Nope. The averages on the quizzes were 85, 70, and 80, and the midterm average was a 77. There were 7 of us and yet all of our grades were all over the place; at least 4 of us were consistently disappointed with our performances despite hours and hours and hours of studying. We tried to study the big picture, but sometimes the details matter and vice versa. I always personally felt confident turning in my quiz only to find out that I completely missed the point of the question. This comes down to a few things. 1) there are now guidelines on what to study. The \"big picture\" is meaningless. If our understanding of the most basic of the science is incomplete, our comparisons are obsolete, and that happened countless times. 2) the questions were excessively wordy and the exam was via share screen with a word document, and you could either handwrite or type. Not sure why anyone would handwrite, b\/c shifting through windows was enough stress, especially when you had to email the quiz right after as Belperron began the lecture. 3) there was never enough time to finish anything and it always felt rushed. Looking at any of the quiz questions I was befuddled to the point where it was a struggle to pick a question to begin with b\/c I was afraid my answer would be utter garbage (and lo and behold, oftentimes it was because evidently I didn't get the question). And then I consistently felt anxious, rushed, and then stupid when I got my score back, not knowing why some questions I did okay on and on other I COMPLETELY MISSED THE MARK. It boggles my mind. Teaching philosophy = if you regurgitate everything, how have you actually critically thought and learned anything? Fair enough. But when the averages are that low and we all feel horrible after the assessments, well.. that's where I draw the line. This is a class intended for non-STEM majors. IT IS NOT A GUT AT ALL and after 37 college classes, this class I spent the most time on I have ever in preparing for quizzes, exams, or presentations (it took 8 hours of independent research, combing through impossible to understand studies, not knowing if your understanding is right, or what she's looking for, and then grading seemed incredibly arbitrary). The required readings were a waste of $80 too, b\/c not once did I ever open the physical book and never read any of the journal articles unless we had to write questions. AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD please get rid of the \"read this article and then write some questions about it\" requirement. That is the single dumbest assignment I have ever had. One article was 2 pages long. Well, I don't have any questions. So what am I supposed to ask?? Well it can't be simple. It can't be googleable. It can't be too short. It can't be anything but absolutely MINDBLOWING unless you want to get a subpar grade on the stupidest assignment. It didn't encourage critical thinking, and if anything just made me try to come up with the haughtiest question possible in order to be delivered not the grade I wanted (if you're looking for a 10\/10, she only gives those out every few years). The panel discussion also felt pointless. Only allowed 4mins max. to talk about your intervention even tho there's so much more to say, and then no one actually has any questions, so it became a lot of awkward silence. And even then, grading felt unnecessarily arbitrary. STRONG:  Belperron is brilliant. She's down to earth, kind, considerate, willing to laugh, an awesome conversationalist, excellent lecturer. She literally does research on this stuff, so she definitely knows what she's talking about. The paper was really well designed, and I have to admit that it was the only fun assignment. She held a review session from 8-10:30pm before the midterm, answered qs in the morn, and then held office hours before the exam. Understanding. Content is super interesting."

                "I don't think this class could have been better adapted for COVID-19. Sharing screen made it immeasurably easier to see the PPT and all the details on it, and the raise hand function made it less frightening when asking a potentially stupid question. Private chat allowed for private questions and public chat allowed for jokes, quips, and answering questions non-verbally. Office hours were less intimidating, and everyone had more time to come to the scheduled review session(s). Communication was more transparent, and discussions were more engaging because we could see each other's faces. Lectures\/leminars were also recorded which was IMPROVE: the way the midterm and 3 quizzes were administered just did not work for me. I felt rushed, confused, I had trouble reading the questions because she shared a word document with really really lengthy questions on it via the share screen feature, and I felt very disadvantaged. Same thing with the midterm. It was on canvas, but you couldn't type the answers on canvas. You had to write them in a separate word document, which just wasted precious time. But, if wifi problems ensued, she was so understanding, and allowed for late submission (which did happen a few times). Honestly, this class was probably better over Zoom than it was if it had been in person during a normal school year, so bravo."

I'd recommend that you have some type of motive to take the class other than just fulfilling the science cred; I took it not only because it was also a global elective (of course I was also interested in the material). This class is definitely a challenge, but not in the same way as other STEM classes which depend on regurgitating facts and complex calculations. Instead, you HAVE to be committed to re-reading notes and talking through the material with Professor Belperron and other students.",
                "Definitely! It's not a gutwhich Professor Belperron told us on the first day of classbut it's a really informative way to get your science distribution requirement, especially if you're someone like me who wasn't necessarily very comfortable with science before.",
                "Yes, given that they are serious about learning this subject! It is definitely not a gut, and she makes this clear from the beginning. But if you really want to learn and grow in reading\/writing\/engaging with science, then do so.",
                "I feel bad saying this, but no. It's way too stressful for what it's worth and you live in a state of limbo the entire semester b\/c you simply cannot calculate your grade. Everything (and I mean everything, including participation and even the paper!) is graded on an average, and then final grades are averaged, too. Someone could get a 98 when you got a 66 (when the average would be in the 70s, so obviously some students skewed the average up, which only hurt a majority of us) and you wouldn't understand why they did so much better, even though you studied way more and had better notes. There was so much material that it got overwhelming. First you had to understand the entire immune system from start to finish and then you had to literally be able to recount how the immune system responds to each of the 3 main diseases, relapsing fever, 5 other tick-borne diseases, viruses generally, and how it works in relation to 20 different drugs basically--that's an ungodly amount of information. But actually, that's not even the most important part. You need to mentally organize that information by comparing and contrasting, and relating to the \"bigger\/whole picture\" which I still don't know what that means. Quiz questions would be scenario based \"who would get sicker, baby or grandma\" after a very convoluted question (despite Belperron saying she didn't want to trick us, there were still too many ambiguous details and it was kinda ridiculous what we were expected to answer). Her goal is to challenge you, but there a comes a point in time when you just don't want to want to smack your head against a wall b\/c you feel so stupid that you consistently perform poorly despite feeling like you've internalized the information. The level of frustration I experienced is simply unimaginable. Now, what I will praise is her attention to detail, powerpoint usage, how quickly she responded to questions on Zoom (wow impressive tbh), and how well she ran class online. I was very impressed. She also had flowers and colorful clothing which made Zoom more bright and vivid which helped when we were talking about death and killing lab animals if they got sick (i.e. lab-bred beagles). She was incredibly accessible. Email responses were lightning fast, impressively detailed, and very helpful. If you didn't understand something, you could essentially stop her mid-sentence and ask-although sometimes I was left a bit more confused. But there were problems, too: exams\/quizzes are unwarrantedly difficult and required the retention of an unreasonable accumulation of knowledge. Some students just... zoned out. We started with 15, dropped to 8, and after the midterm, only had 7 students left (take that as you will). The science librarian and GIS specialist visited us (honestly not sure why for the latter, literally pointless), and not only was the meeting useless, but way too early in the semester-we weren't going to be using Endnote if at all until the end of the semester, so why would she come in Week 3, especially right after a really really hard quiz? TL;DR I felt stupid too many times, questioned my life choices, and hated the testing methodology and teaching philosophy, but Belperron is an amazing human and I wish every other professor at Yale was as kind as she was. We laughed, we joked, we did hard science, and she was genuinely friendly. I don't regret taking it only b\/c Belperron was so amazing. Just please fix the blatant problems. Please. I also really didn't appreciate that a prospective MCDB major was allowed to take this class when if you've taken any hard science at Yale, you're not. Grading on an average when you're inherently disadvantaged is not fair. (Oh: the paper has a component on \"grammar and spelling\" but I'm not sure what \"principals\" of malaria treatment are; seems like a double-standard for students when the prof is allowed to make typos...)"
