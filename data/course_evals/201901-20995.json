    "It was a continuation of German L1.  You learn new grammar structures, the other case (genitive), and towards the end you kind of review and solidify past skills you learn.  You also finally learn about food!!!! And I feel like L2 explored a lot more of German culture.  There was one week where we spent each day learning about a different German-speaking country, stats about them, and their unique customs.  I also loved the last topic that we spent on talking about a current issue.  It felt very relevant and it was interesting.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths:  Good daily exposure to German; Connect homeworks kept you on track and you had to read the book; daily exercises and practice helped improve my German a lot\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  Only 4 other people in my section - discussions were small, but at least everyone got to talk.  Our professor spoke in English and it was not a completely immersive environment.",
    "I liked the amount of conversation we have in class, but I do not really like the \"immersive\" nature of the textbook. I think that grammar could be taught in a more systematic and straightforward manner.",
    "I rarely got feedback on my submitted assignments. This bothered me especially because my grades were almost universally a few points lower than I expected, and I was never informed why this was the case."
