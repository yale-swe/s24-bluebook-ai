                "A rare look into the female philosophers of South and Southeast Asia, never before explored the people and the ideas discussed here.",
                "Above all: exposure to an entirely new world of philosophy (and the expanded epistemologies/critical inquiries that go with it).",
                "I learned a lot about close reading and even what the history of lots of old texts have been through. I was exposed to a lot of writings and literature and philosophy that I would have never learned about elsewhere, and it was so interesting to think about it in new dimensions with questions that were posed in class about life and theory.",
                "I practiced a whole new way of approaching texts, where we don't have a lot of preliminary context and instead need to define our terms ourselves, define our method and how we're using them on our own, and really challenge a lot of preexisting structures of thought in productive ways. Of course, I also learned about theories and ways of life in Buddhism and Hinduism, but more importantly, I learned a new way of being open-minded.",

                "Strengths:\r\n- set of readings are great\r\n- discussion based learning is great\r\n- guiding themes at the beginning of the class are helpful in drawing connections and staying focussed\r\n- the poems (therigathas and Shiva speaks) are brilliant \r\n- the experience in the class is very good, this is the most enjoyable class I have ever had in terms of quality of class discussion and instructor engagement\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- sometimes the connections between subsequent classes are not as clear\r\n- logistical challenges like confusion around where to find a reading on canvas versus library (but that could just be me being a clumsy grad student)\r\n- I wish there were more sessions, I left the class wanting more material to go through and more classes to attend",
                "- loved the choice of final (between a traditional research paper and a creative project) \r\n- really incredible discussions, although I do wish there had occasionally been a little more of a lecture component \r\n- could have been more clear with assignment expectations and received more written feedback",
                "Some of the strengths of this course are that it allows for people of lots of different backgrounds/schools at Yale to all discuss the same topic (and each bring their own important perspective to the class material) and is very communicative. The readings selected were very well-chosen and I also think the content itself is a strength of this course. The only weakness in my opinion / room for improvement is that sometimes I wish we were able to spend more time unpacking and analyzing the readings themselves. I enjoyed listening to the close readings that everyone did together as we read a passage during class, and wish there was more time to do this. Especially during the last meeting of the course, we read some beautiful poetry, and I think it would have been fun to do more of that throughout the semester. I understand that this was just due to the time constraint, though, and it would be difficult to fit everything in.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Very manageable reading load, but you also need to be personally invested to really get out of the texts as much as possible\r\n- Super well facilitated class discussions\r\n- The in-class handouts are fabulous and really augmented our reading assignments\r\n- The journal and periodic assignments permitted personal investment in the course, one I found incredibly meaningful.\r\n\r\nNot so much weaknesses, but considerations:\r\n- I sometimes felt a little lost in terms of tradition, time period, cultural influence, etc. I know it's tough to address all this, but I feel like I would have benefitted a lot from a little more lead-in.\r\n- Not all the students were equally engaged, and I felt disappointed that some students seemed disconnected from the texts, or didn't prepare the readings in advance. That being said, I loved all the diverse perspectives and knowledge from students across grad schools.",
                "The strengths of the course are the subject matter is interesting and the professor is passionate about what he is teaching. This allows students to be very engaged in what they are learning and discussing."

                "Absolutely! The course is great for anyone with interest in philosophy, feminism or Buddhism/Hinduism. The classroom discussions are mindblowing and it is a great place to exercise creativity and learn from peers. Prof. Kachru is very supportive and encouraging. He almost never dismisses an idea (to a fault) which I believe creates the safe space needed for everyone to express their thoughts freely. This is not to say that he doesn't challenge ideas rather that he takes a lens of curiousity that helps students articulate themselves better and open up perspectives that would otherwise be unaccessible. This was the best course of my life!",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! Professor Kachru is a wonderful professor and everything he teaches is a must-take",
                "Absolutely!",
                "This class was one of the highlights of my Yale experience. The topics covered were fascinating and relevant, and were made more so by the environment in which they were presented.",
                "Yes absolutely. I do think that students should be prepared to know that this is largely a discussion course and can sometimes be less focused on course material and sometimes other topics do arise and the class sort of goes with the flow. However, those who enjoy discussion and covering multiple topics from week to week would definitely enjoy it. The class felt like a very open environment and was incredibly interesting and eye-opening while also being a genuinely enjoyable, fun use of my time.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course, whether you're interested in a survey or in a more in-depth seminar; level of previous experience with these traditions doesn't really matter, it's more the mindset you approach the readings with. You definitely need to resonate with the idiosyncratic methodology of this course (read: you'll have to direct your studies more independently than in other classes and you absolutely cannot be detached), but if you do, you'll love it.",
                "Absolutely. This professor is phenomenal and connects well with his students. He keeps his class engaged just with how much he values what his students bring to his class and how excited he gets about the subject matter and challenging discussions."
