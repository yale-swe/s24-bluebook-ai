                "I liked the problem sets and their schedule. I also liked the lectures.",
                "the teaching is   and wayyyy too simple or what they demand of u on exams",
                "I was originally put with a horrible teacher who was very bad at engaging students and actually teaching rather than just talking.  I eventually switched to another teacher and he was much much much better.",
                "The way that Math 115 is taught is very cut and dry. This is not a complaint about Mihai, but just a general evaluation of the department. There are also a lot of filler assignments such as Explorations and surveys on study habits.",
                "Strengths: Very well-structured course, lots of office hours and peer tutors, lots of problem set help, exams are relevant to the course material. You are encouraged to collaborate with classmates.\r\nWeaknesses: The standard of instruction varies depending on which professor you get. The explorations are a constant stream of work and you are likekly to forget to do them. There are problem sets due right after breaks and before exams.",
                "Personally, I greatly dislike the explores before each class. If content for the next class was \"previewed\" at the end of each class period and then the explore was done, it may be different; but, as it was, the explores caused unnecessarily stressful going in without any instruction on the topic and gave me a false sense of security in each topic when actually learning them.",
                "Typical well structured calculus curriculum. Peer tutors and office hours are very helpful resources.",
                "Strengths: my professor was fantastic - probably the best Math 115 teacher employed by Yale right now.  I felt very supported by him and office hours were very accessible and helpful.  The peer tutors program, while not perfect, was also a great resource both for aid and for working with other students in the class that I am thankful to have had.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this course covers a lot of material very quickly, and at the beginning I had a false impression that doing the explorations, problem sets, and concept checks would be enough to grasp this material as we went along.  It was not.  I think that emphasizing that students spend time outside of class learning and practicing concepts if they want to succeed would help students who want to succeed but are not yet sure how to do well in the class.",
                "The availability of assistance in the form of office hours and peer tutoring were the only things that got me through the course. Some of the problems on psets were really confusing, and had very little to do with the rest of the course, and so going and getting assistance was extremely helpful.",
                "I think there needs to be recorded lectures for this course. I got extremely sick during the semester and had to miss so many classes then read the textbook/notes/khan academy because there are no recorded lectures. I don't think each section needs to be recorded, but just one would be so helpful because I was struggling so much despite meeting with my professor and going to peer tutoring and I think the lecture would've helped a lot."

                "No. Not unless you need it for a prerequisite or have some background in Calc 2. Professors will match the pace of the class to students who already know the material from high school, leaving you with convoluted answers to questions that don't help solidify the material or concepts. This class is less about understanding the mechanisms behind calculus and more about memorizing structures of the math you learn and being able to plug in accordingly.",
                "I got placed into Math 120 coming into my first year, but opted to take this class instead, just to review BC calc. If you do this, this class is absolutely a gut. I showed up to office hours once a week and got the Pset done in an hour. I showed up to lecture cause Mihai is great at teaching and it was fun to review. However, I understand that if this is your first introduction to calc ii topics, the pace is pretty fast and you should have a solid base of algebra and calc i skills. That being said, it is very doable and reasonable, so I would recommend it.",

                "Yes for those who are interested in taking higher level math courses.",
                "It is a prerequisite course for many STEM majors - a fundamentals, building-block type of class.  Would I recommend it for pure enjoyment?  Not necessarily.  But is it an important step on the journey to obtaining a STEM major?  Clearly.  Do not let this class intimidate you out of a major or career you are interested in.",
                "Unless you have to take this course or love math, then no. I went straight from high school AP Calculus AB to this course and it was an extreme challenge. All of my friends who took AP Calc BC breezed through this course though, so maybe if you took that in high school you would enjoy the course."
