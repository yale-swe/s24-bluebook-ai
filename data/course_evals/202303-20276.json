Yes, the class might not be hardcore science but it's so much content and sometimes it seems like you do need some science background in order to understand what is going on in the course.",

                "I overall enjoyed the content of this course but found certain assignments such as the quizzes and research projects challenging. While this is a course for non-stem major and I do believe the content was framed in a tangible way, many of our quiz assignments seem to test speed more so than actual knowledge. Furthermore, I did not feel that there was substantial support with proper methods to conduct scientific research which may be new to many in the class coming from a non stem background.",
                "Great structuring of the course",
                "Course instructor would not post grades to canvas. This made knowing and keeping track of my progress in the class extremely hard. I also did not understand her grading scale."

                "I would be hesitant to recommend the course. While the professor is good and it's on the easier side for science, the course is a lot and requires a lot of time in order to understand all of the content. The quizzes and midterm are also pretty challenging and you are never given enough time to finish them. If you are a humanities major looking to get a science credit, you might want to take another course.",
                "Yes, but it is not a gut for a science credit. This class was probably one of the more time-consuming classes this semester but you do learn a lot--it's a rewarding course for sure.",
                "Yes if you are looking for an interesting science course with real world global health impacts. However, if you are looking for a science gut or something with a manageable workload this is not the course. While the work was rewarding and the content interesting, if felt a bit much for a non stem major science course.",
                "Yes. If you have never taken a science course, I would strongly advise you to take MCDB 106. It will take some work but overall, you learn so much and the professor does a great job at structuring the course."
