                "Great introduction to topics and class but can use more mathematical questions.",
                "Weaknesses were that I think it could've been taught better but this was evened out by my strength of the course: the Peer Tutors. They were very helpful because they understood the material and they were only sophomores so they better knew how we think and learn and thus had better ways of explaining concepts to us than TAs, for example, did.",
                "Strengths: Detailed, Intellectually Engaging\r\nWeaknesses: Fast-paced, easy to fall behind, weird notetaking system. (Nilay's a great prof but his handwriting is hard to read)",
                "Some strengths of the course is the amount of support available. There were so many TAs and peer tutors to help facilitate our learning and help us with the problem sets. Some weaknesses was the lack of clarity for exams. The expectations were not always clear as to what was expected from us and this made exams very difficult at times.",
                "The course moves very fast. The midterms are long and there is not enough time given to complete them.",
                "Nilay is an amazing lecturer/I always felt supported throughout my learning.",
                "I really liked the lectures and Nilays teaching style. He was super engaging and made the class applicable to many different topics and majors. I really liked discussion sections as well. I thought the formatting of the course was well structured.",
                "Strengths: I believe I learned a lot of valuable information\r\nweaknesses: the slides were taught fast, and sometimes to was hard to comprehend and keep up with in class.",
                "Strengths: Manageable workload, lots of peer tutor hours, Nilay tries to make the class fun and engaging. \r\nWeaknesses: Nilay's handwriting is hard to read so reviewing lecture notes is difficult, lecture content was not presented very clearly, Nilay was not very accommodating when the recording system was broken, graders would take off points on exam questions without leaving any comments/corrections, 4 exams was too much (should've just been 3 midterms without the final), final exam was too long.",
                "Strengths: lots of office hours, well aligned with textbook, engaging for 250 person lecture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: always looking for specific trigger/kay words on exams",
                "The professor was absolutely amazing and very engaging.  The course was very interesting and the professor made an effort to have many real world applications when he taught.",
                "I really loved Nilay as a professor. He is definitely a cornerstone of the course and his teaching is one of its strengths. Honestly the course was run really well. I really appreciated that the psets mirrored the exam questions. I cant think of any weaknesses!",
                "I do not think it is clear how much of a workload and learning curve there is. I worked extremely hard in this class and it was based on a curve. While this seems like a good thing, many of the students (more than 2/3 I would argue) have taken upper level chemistry in the past two years (AP Chemistry, IB, etc.) and have seen this material before, therefore making the curve much smaller. This is unfortunate for the people who did not have the opportunity to take any college-level chemistry before coming to Yale, as the content is objectively hard; it is a much easier course for those who have seen this material before. Although Yale offers an advanced chemistry course, many opt into taking the regular version, which is extremely detrimental to the people who are completely new to the material.",
                "Strengths: the amount of in-person help provided through this course, whether thats scheduled discussion sections, TF office hours, review sessions, or peer tutoring hours.  Also the lectures were always recorded. Weaknesses: The class didnt truly incentivize me to go to lecture, and sometimes the lecture recordings were only released at the end of the week.  I also think some concepts were taught in a convoluted way, more complicated than Id been taught in high school.",
                "The material is taught at a good pace and in an effective way for understanding of the course material. One weakness was that there were often problems with the recording, wifi, and other technological issues at the location for the class.",
                "Strengths of the course were the content and Nilay's humor.",
                "This course is very much geared towards students planning on pursuing med school. It is not friendly for students who are simply there as a prerequisite for majors that are not as chemistry-focused. I am an Earth and Planetary Sciences major and found that the exams were comprehensive in a way that seemed gratuitous. I wish that a general chemistry course for non-chem, non-premed students existed.",
                "Strengths: NILAY IS AMAZING. Other strengths include the helpful TAs, the high number of peer tutors and office hours, the short but effective p-sets, the demonstrations/experiments.\r\nWeaknesses: Three midterms, not two. I personally think the third midterm is unnecessary. The discussion sections aren't all that productive.",
                "Nilay was a great instructor and did a really good job making the class feel engaging and exciting.",
                "Strengths: Nilay is an excellent lecture and the course was very engaging. The in-class demonstrations every Friday were a nice way to wrap up what we had learned that week. There's SO many resources and the P-sets are really designed to help you understand the material. Also, the TAs and peer tutors were really cool and helpful!\r\nWeaknesses: The class is structured in a somewhat strange way. Nilay goes through the chapters of the textbook in sequential order, which can cause some confusion.",
                "Strength: Nilay is an engaging and personable lecturer who teaches interesting and fun lectures. Weakness: If you come in with little to no chemistry experience it makes it very hard to grasp the concepts. To improve the course, there could be a more fair grading strategy (ie. drop lowest midterm score, higher midterm score counts more, etc.) to ensure students aren't discouraged by one bad score. It would also be helpful to open a section or tutoring program for students who lack chemistry experience.",
                "It requires a lot of memorization of topics that senior chemistry majors have told me they never used again. This part of the course felt somewhat unnecessary. I think a more full formula sheet, including things such as a list of common polyatomic ions and solubility rules, could be helpful in improving the course.",
                "This course is a great introduction to chemistry. It assumes no background knowledge, but manages to engage a wide range of students and student abilities. It covers lots of different topics, and manages to cover them all in sufficient depth to feel a level of mastery (given an introductory course).",
                "The strengths of the class were its engagement with students (highly aided by the professor) and the substantial support system available at all times of day through peer tutors, TAs, and office hours.",
                "The demonstrations on Fridays were always a highlight. Nilay was also a great professor. The abundance of resources was also really helpful. Achieve was especially helpful in teaching concepts because it gave specific feedback based on incorrect answers.",
                "A strength of this course was having weekly experiments to demonstrate the content that we were learning. A weakness was the difficulty of midterm examinations.",
                "Nilay is a true gem. I, like I'm sure a vast majority of the class, took this as a required prerequisite. I was not excited to take the course, but Nilay made chemistry fun. I learned a lot, and there was plenty of support to go around between Nilay and the fantastic TAs. Despite there being over 100 people in the class, Nilay always felt approachable. One weakness was that I didn't feel the required TA section was particularly beneficial for me.",
                "This course was overall very strong, the only weaknesses could be that the discussion sections werent very helpful",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Many office hours and opportunities interact with TAs and professor\r\n- Review sessions (wish they were earlier) and practice tests\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- The order of the course: The course was designed to talk about the basics of atomic theory in unit 4 even though I felt like it would be logical to learn it in Unit 1. It seems like the class is taught in chronological history rather than the logical understanding of general chemistry. \r\n- Problem sets were not really conducive to learning. A lot more calculations than concepts.",
                "The class was enjoyable however the lecture material never really coincided with the homework or test questions. I can say that I was not the only person feeling this way. Yes, the lecture gave us the basics but lecture material doesn't teach us how to solve a problem. The homework is basically another lecture but instead of reviewing through work, you are teaching yourself items that haven't been covered. \r\n\r\nGrading is something that should also be improved on an exam level and a course level. The exam graders are hypercritical of small details rather than the actual answer which doesn't really make sense. Also, final grading did not align with what was said to students throughout the course of the semester.",
                "My strengths were problem sets and the beginning material. My weakness was the fast speed in the second half of the semester.",
                "Strengths: The tests were written fairly, the TAs were very helpful, there was an amplitude of study resources, the engagement in class was high. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some grading on the tests was harsh and somewhat unfair.",
                "Strengths: Nilay was an amazing instructor. He made lectures engaging and usually explained concepts very clearly. Besides the midterms, the weekly workload was very manageable, and the Achieve assignments encouraged learning, not perfection.\r\nWeaknesses/improvements: Three midterms were a bit overwhelming, especially when the last one was less than two weeks before our final exam.",
                "I think that this was a good introductory chemistry course and I was able to keep up despite not taking chemistry in a while. The pacing was good, although I wish we could've gone more in-depth into some of the topics.",
                "Strengths:\r\nProfessor Hazari is a very engaging professor, and I enjoyed the lecture style format with the weekly problem sets. \r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNone",
                "OneNote notebook material was awesome - clear and easy to understand; summarizes key points",
                "Strength: each class our professor was engaging snd excited to tesch us. Notes were preplanned and posted on canvas that we could look at before class began\r\n\r\nWeakness: only about one practice question would be done in class and not alot of opportunities to ask questions",
                "A strength of this course is the abundant content material and study aids that are provided in preparation for exams. A weakness of this course is the teaching style of the professor where he is mostly reading from the lecture notes--at times, this was not engaging.",
                "Strengths: problem sets were formatted to help you learn, professor is fun\r\nWeaknesses: lecture was very fast and often confusing, had to go back an review topics/notes and do problem sets to understand",
                "The workload both from class lectures, problem sets, and practices exams did not translate to the much, much greater intensity of the tests. That said, it's an engaging and fun class.",
                "Well taught, some lectures were hard to follow however",
                "Good support and resource availability for students."

                "The only way I would recommend this course is if the person has seen the information before. I spent hours upon hours trying to understand this material. Importantly, I learned it. However, I did not learn it to the extent of the people who have seen this content before and were able to recall and recognize the information. Although I made great progress, it surely was not enough. Because of that, I would not recommend this course to anyone who has not taken higher-level chemistry.",
                "Yes, Id recommend.  If you need this as a prerequisite for STEM majors, Gen Chem is a good sequence.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to students who are interested in the field of chemistry, as it develops a good background of the subject in just one semester.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it is a necessary course to progress into higher level science courses.",
                "There's really no recommending this course. It is mandatory for many academic courses and thus is a necessary stepping stone.",
                "Honestly, if you're taking it with Nilay, yes. He's the best and he'll make Chemistry so much fun. If you want to have a deeper knowledge of chemistry, also yes. Be advised that the class is full of pre-med students and if you're genuinely excited about the science, you won't find many others with the same enthusiasm as you.\r\n\r\nIf you've taken AP or IB Chemistry, go to 163.",
                "I think it was a good introduction to chemistry, though you definitely need to be comfortable seeking out help on topics/information that you dont understand (either in the textbook or with office hours).",
                "Yes! It's hardly a walk in the park, but it isn't the worst thing ever.",
                "I would recommend this course if its required for one's major and if they have taken AP Chemistry or equivalent.",
                "Yes, I would. It is a very useful course for anyone in STEM, as it covers many fundamental concepts. The workload isn't that high, and the professor was great.",
                "Definitely. Whether or not you're premed, I think an overall understanding of chemistry is critical. Chemistry rides a nice middle ground between physics and biology and is very satisfying once understood. Plus, the teacher (Nilay) is great, and it is worth taking a class with him.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because generally I believed the coursework, the exams, and the grading were fair and the professor made the class fun.",
                "I would, for it was a very useful course to take. However, I may recommend Credit/D/Failing the course, if possible.",
                "If you're required to take CHEM 161, ABSOLUTELY take it with Nilay. I genuinely enjoyed the course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students perusing stem fields",
                "I would recommend this course if you have to take it. If you want a gut or try out sciences, this is not the class. I would only recommend if you have to take it and if you are a STEM major in natural sciences.",
                "Yes, because I enjoyed this class and learned a lot, along with fun class experiments and a great interactive teacher.",
                "Yes, it's a great introduction to chemistry and you will learn a lot. That being said, if Nilay isn't teaching it, the course might not be as enjoyable.",
                "Yes, especially if Nilay is teaching it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. I learned a lot and found it to be interesting, plus the professor and TAs were very supportive.",
                "Yes. The lecturer was engaging and informative.",
                "yes",
                "Definitely. Professor Hazari is a very engaging professor, and the class is a nice way to learn basic chemistry.",
                "Yes, material and lessons were interesting",
                "Yes, teaches quite a lot of stuff at a pretty fast pace but could be handled",
                "Only if you have to take this for a major requirement, there is alot of work and can be quite challenging",
                "Yes, since this a prerequisite for advanced science courses.",
                "Yes, it is challenging but you can do well if you put the work in",
                "I can wholeheartedly recommend Nilay's gen chem to other students. I learned a lot and loved being in class.",
                "It's great if you need to take chemistry for your major. If not, I would encourage auditing the class so that you can learn about the content without experiencing the stress of exams.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to students needing to take intro chemistry",
                "Yes good foundation and interesting topics."
