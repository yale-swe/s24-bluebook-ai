    "Loved it, I can actually understand elementary level Korean.",

    "We expanded on the skills developed in L1 in order to create a wider range of sentences to express a wider range of thoughts, abilities, and suggestions among other things.",
    "Further developed my Korean knowledge and interests in Korean culture.",
    "Advancement of skills in reading, writing, listening, and speaking of the Korean language.",
    "Korean",
    "I gained a thorough understanding of more advanced Korean vocabulary and grammar throughout the duration of this course. The discussion-based lessons have helped me develop more immediate response time to Korean dialogues."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lots of practice and verbal practice as well as fast paced listening practice. I wish there was more to read, but we don't know the language enough for that yet so what was there was amazing.",
    "The requirements (both day-to-day and overall) for the course were unclear at times, and it would take several attempts at clarification to understand them.",
    "Strengths include the large amount of skills and vocabulary taught to students that would be practical for daily use in South Korea, which is particularly important as many students in this course choose to apply for opportunities (such as the light fellowship) to study abroad in South Korea, and hence would require such skills to live abroad. The only major weakness is that due dates, assignment guidelines, etc. are sometimes unclear.",
    "Strength-wise, the \"daily\" nature of the course was very conducive towards in-depth language learning. The vocabulary examinations provided me with an opportunity to expand my toolbox of Korean vocabulary on a regular basis, and has really helped me become more comfortable with the language in the long run."

    "Yes! I loved the course, because it is taught efficiently but also in a fun manner. Not just grammar and vocabulary but actual application fro the get go.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in Korean language and culture. In this class I was able to develop my speaking, reading, and writing skills while also learning more about Korean culture through our cultural readings and the songs we sang in class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. It is not only an overall enjoyable course where progress is readily seen, but it Is led by an extremely capable and phenomenal faculty member.",
    "I would say that any student that has completed KREN 110 should definitely continue the sequence with this course. The pace is just as consistent and will definitely help you learn more about the language!"
