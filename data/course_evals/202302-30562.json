            "comments": [
                "I really enjoyed the discussions we had and the grammar was taught very well and comprehensively.",
                "Strengths: Course is fast-paced; tests are comprehensive and include all taught material. Likewise, curriculum is organized so as to coincide flawlessly with FREN 110/120/130 for students who have completed elementary and intermediate French at Yale. Instructor Ngame is approachable, intelligent, and cares deeply about his students. He facilitates class discussion with thoughtful questions, engaging texts, and thorough teaching. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While FREN 140 is, on the whole, better composed than 130, it too suffers from extreme disorganization. Students who have completed this course will agree that there was not a single night during which it was clear what assignments were to be completed for the following day. Classwork and homework consist in a patchwork of assignments from previous years, many overlapping or correlating only loosely with syllabus and Canvas page. Assignments frequently are inaccessible for students; e.g., syllabus instructs students to complete a review worksheet that is missing from Canvas, or assigns two chapters of reading when in fact four are expected by the instructor, or pairs a grammar review from 2015 with an answer key for a different worksheet written from 2019. Course would greatly benefit from pre-planning on behalf of instructor and department, rather than updating lesson plans and syllabus daily to accord with class progress. \r\n\r\nGrading in FREN 140, like that in FREN 130, is delayed. Most assignments were not graded until after the completion of the program. I did not receive a participation grade for the second week of the program, for example, until a week after the returning home. Late instructor feedback prevents students from adjusting their participation in the course, and in fact actively works against student engagement. \r\n\r\nClassroom building in Paris is wanting in facilities. The WiFi worked so poorly that it was inaccessible most days (a challenge when all course materials are strictly accessible via Canvas) and our classroom was building was small, dim, and did not have windows."
