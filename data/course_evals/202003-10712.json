There needs to be more help for students struggling I found it very difficult to get help when I asked for it.",

                "Strengths: The content was interesting, overall; some of the questions on the psets were interesting. Yihong seems knowledgeable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Several topics were just not taught in a way so as to make the content digestible and applicable for students. Like in the past couple of weeks, I felt that his explanations of the MGF and best estimate were lacking. More context, more examples, and more clarity would be useful. It wouldve been really helpful if hed slowed down and gave some more examples that are similar to pset problems rather than just putting out\/ solving for all these formulas without adequately explaining them. I dont think Yihong was an awful professor, but he certainly could improve, and to be frank, the course seems to get much higher reviews when Winston teaches it, so maybe he could make an honest comparison between his own explanations and Winstons, and use that to improve.",
                "I thought the class notes were good. This class is probably the worst math class I've taken so far. The material is ok; Nothing great but I didn't expect much more. However, the staff was absolutely terrible in my experience. First, the course manager thing was absurd in my opinion. Having this bureaucratic wall that pretty much doesn't let you email the professor makes solving a problem ridiculously difficult. You have to deal with the graders and things of nature and there's no higher authority you can turn to when you feel like you're getting mistreated. I don't know if the graders are grad students in math, but they sure did not look that way. It seemed to me like they had a set of solutions and went down a checklist instead of reading each proof individually. I had people take points off for all sorts of trivialities and when I asked what's up with that I was once told something to the effect of \"this may be absurd but it's absurd to all thus it's fair.\" In every pset I had to email the graders in order to get the points I deserved and after a while that took a toll on me. I don't want to have to write an email explaining how my proof is correct when I've already written a perfectly fine proof.",

                "S&DS 241 is a very hard course with Yihong. By that, I mean that the PSETs were quite difficult (and sometimes felt impossible without the help from friends or Winston\/Piazza). \r\n\r\nYihong's lectures slides are immaculate and the textbook recommended for this course is also very well written. As for weaknesses, I would just say that it was very difficult to keep up with two major exams and 11 PSETs. It was very tiring this semester considering the lack of breaks (except Thanksgiving).",
                "The problem sets were very challenging and there were not a lot of office hours sessions available.",
                "Strengths: detailed powerpoint notes, incredibly organized, and so much help with discussion sections and office hours. I really felt like the class was set up to help us out as much as possible. Weaknesses: sometimes the concepts were difficult to understand, the p-sets were sometimes difficult to work through.",
                "pros- professor Wu explains things clearly, course is well organized and expectations are clear\r\ncons- psets are SO much harder than examples from lecture, the fact that we had to keep our microphones and cameras on for a 3 hour final was ridiculous, not giving any credit for late work and only allowing students to drop one pset",
                "The class is a pretty comprehensive introduction to probability, and really has breadth on its side. Honestly, the unspoken fun of this course was the combinatorics. There were plenty of resources for students to ask questions and get help if they were feeling confused. Also, the textbook was amazing, and story proofs were unfamiliar but fun. Problem sets were also graded really reasonably. That being said, the material did feel pretty uneven. We started off really slow with probability axioms and the naive definition of probability and absolutely zoomed through crucial topics like the CLT. At times, too, the problems felt more like puzzles than applications. Problems often relied on finding the \"hack,\" which was cool and rewarding on problem sets, but very stressful for exams.",
                "This class jumped in difficulty after midterm and I feel like the support\/teaching didn't quite keep everyone on pace, but overall the course was well-organized and seems to lay the groundwork for further statistical learning.",
                "The class doesnt really teach the fundamental logic behind some of the courses contents which makes it hard to apply out of context in an exam.",
                "Strengths - great slides, well-organized, extremely interesting content, Winston's OHs\r\nWeaknesses - tough psets that really can't be completed without attending OH, Yihong is not great, Final was tough",
                "I think at times the lectures can be too fast and the explanation of why and how we got to solutions and conclusions were too rushed.",
                "More office hours would be better",
                "This was simply not taught well. I did not learn how to apply the knowledge I learned throughout the course to solve problems.",
                "strengths: really good office hours and support from Winston and the TAs, lectures were easy to follow, posted lecture very organized.  weaknesses: final exam felt pretty hard in comparison to the problem sets.",
                "A major weakness of the course depends on what Professor you get. While professor Wu is definitely smart, he appears to lack any real commitment to the learning of students. He bulldozes his way through his lecture slides and often skips steps in his proofs or work, assuming students will understand on their own. This makes the lectures very unengaging and often causes me to lack motivation to pay attention. Furthermore, the homeworks are often disheartening since the problems are extremely difficult and very hard to solve on your own(homework buddies help so much!). I usually spent 5-8 hours per p-set and more than once got frustrated enough to give up for that night. Although many of the concepts of the course are easy to grasp, the fact that the math or intuition required to solve many problems does not come naturally to people who haven't taken proof-y courses before does not help. At least the midterm and final are easier than the problem sets, but not by much,  and your lowest Pset is dropped. An upside is that although prof Wu is not the most clear or engaging lecturer, the slides are extremely helpful to look at on your own since they are very complete and clear. Also, the support from peer tutors and teaching fellows are very helpful since they can help guide you to the proper thinking, mindset, and math to solve homework problems or understand a concept. Winston, although was listed as co-teaching the course, was more of a course assistant. However, he was a tremendous help as he had review sessions\/office hours twice a week where he will re-teach concepts or help get started on homework problems. He is such an approachable person and is extremely knowledgeable on the material since he and prof Wu take turns teaching the course every year - definitely take the class if Winston is teaching!",
                "The strengths of the course for me were the professor (Professor Wu, who did the lectures, and Professor Lin, who did review\/homework sessions twice each week). Both were super clear and great professors, and the material was also super interesting.",
                "While the course is very logically organized I found it extremely difficult despite having taken all prereqs. More examples during the lecture would've been helpful.",
                "It is very difficult to pay attention for the full 75 minutes because it is a fully lecture course with pre-prepared slides. However, it does build off of itself well and provides a good foundation for each new topic.",
                "Strengths- format where Professor Wu does lecture and Professor Lin leads discussion section, the many office hours\r\nWeaknesses- sometimes skipping steps and explaining things too quickly in lecture",
                "It was very interesting content and well divided between the first half and the second half of the course. It would've helped to do a few more problems and examples in class. The discussion section was very helpful.",
                "Very well organized. If you put in effort to go over the lecture slides and read the textbook (the textbook is amazing btw), you will learn a lot! The only weakness is that there are too many people (in the beginning, over 220 students) and they all get too high of a score (some psets have a median of 100%)",
                "I liked how the problem sets were great for reinforcing ideas about what were taught in lecture. All the lecture slides were clear, and everything made sense!",
                "Strength: The dual professor thing is really helpful. A lot of office hours. Good lecture slides\r\nWeaknesses: Yihong was hard :(",
                "There's a lot of weight on the one midterm and on the final, would have been nice to have a bigger spread of the grades",
                "Plenty of office hours and good problem sets.",
                "The content can seem pretty straightforward from lectures alone; however, problem sets were often unreasonably difficult and so it was hard to gauge exactly how we were doing in the class.  The strengths are that office hours and TAs are always helpful when problem sets became overwhelmingly hard; the main weakness of this course is the lack of transparency, clarity, and frankly, compassion from Prof. Yihong Wu. Each time a student asked a question with regards to grades or how they performed on an exam, it was almost always ignored or met with an ambiguous response on Piazza. I hope in the future, if someone takes this class, they will be met with more transparency, especially if it is taught in an online form again. The class being on Zoom lectures that are recorded asynchronously, it's even harder to express concerns to professors or form studying groups with other students. It was a tough grind to get through this class.",
                "Strengths: I found the content really interesting, Professor Wu is a great lecturer, and Professor Lin's discussion sessions were fantastic as well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not much to be honest. The material is objectively dry without many applications outside of the math, but I still enjoyed that. I can imagine how others might not though.",
                "Weekly lectures were engaging and full of interesting content. Office hours were tremendously helpful, and the TAs always made time to answer questions.",
                "The class should spend less times on the proofs & more times on examples. I think that would have helped me understand the material better",
                "I think the course does a good job of teaching the necessary tools to pursue further study in probability and apply probability theory to other areas. If I had to speak of a weakness, the first half of the course was pretty slow. I felt like it could have been sped up a bit.",
                "The recorded lectures and TA sessions were really helpful to recap material and work through problem sets. The course was reasonably well-structured. The topics were arranged in an order that made sense and the concepts built on one another. A lot of the problem set questions and exam questions however, required a specific way of reasoning rather than simple knowledge of concepts. That way of reasoning could be developed mostly through practice of problems and not as much taught in class.",
                "I felt it sped up a ton in the last quarter of the semester. Overall, great explanations and examples.",
                "Strengths - Winstons sections\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Yihong is a very tough professor and rushes through the material. Not the best at explaining difficult concepts.",
                "There are a lot of office hours where you can get help for problem sets. Additionally, Winston's discussion sections were extremely useful for clarifying difficult topics and answering lingering questions from the lecture. Piazza also served to be a good resource to ask questions and learn from other people's questions.",
                "Winston is honestly the courses biggest strength. Without him, I probably would have flunked lol. Another strength is the textbook its super clear and easy to follow. Also Yihongs slides are good. A weakness is how fast we go in lecture and how much sophistication the psets and exams require especially after only being introduced these topics.",
                "Strengths: Material organized well, textbook often referenced but not necessarily copied from (good for other perspectives on topics), supplementary textbook\/course materials online\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very difficult, classes go very quickly and confusingly (likely due to the difficult nature and vast amount of topics), little opportunity for in-class participation\/discussion",
                "This course is not the best taught. Yihong is so high up in the stats world, which is great, but that means that most things at this level seem obvious to him (as he said just about every class). I don't feel like he moved anywhere near my pace, nor were things explained well. I'd recommend taking it with Winston if you have a chance, it's an entirely different (and much easier) class.",
                "Strengths: Yihong was a very good lecturer in my opinion, and he had cool examples to make the theory more interesting. Weaknesses: Not really.",
                "Lectures are a bit dry with Professor Wu, and problem sets got much harder in the second half of the course. However, I thought the slides in lectures were well-organized and we covered fairly interesting material throughout the course.",
                "I think Yihong was a solid professor - he was quite fast but his slides were great. The only problem that Yihong often made things pretty confusing and Winston would have to go over it in exam review sessions multiple times for people to figure it out (i.e. convolutions). The curve at the end was nice though.",
                "I think the course needs a lot more help giving insight into how to think. It was very different from any other math course I've taken and has little connection to statistics (which is why I thought I should take the class).",
                "Not enough tests to check understanding throughout the course",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Lectures were organized and easy to follow\r\n- Assignments were relevant to the course material and helped develop a deep understanding\r\n- Feedback on assignments and exams was detailed and logical\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Not any really",
                "Both professors were amazing at teaching. I loved the format where they split lectures and sections."

Other courses for example allowed students to ask questions in the chat box and the TA\/other instructor would answer if the professor doesnt see them. I would like it if this werent true, but the fact of the matter is that people find it harder to ask questions over Zoom, so making questions via chat accessible would help. Also if Yihong could stop saying this is very simple or this should be very clear before asking if anyone has questions, that would also probably help. Way to make whoever has a question feel dumb.",

A recorded Zoom lecture is detrimental to engagement and makes the class a lot more stressful and stale, especially with regards to not being able to work with and collaborate with other students. I completed the course without meeting a single student in the class.",
                "Winston's discussion sessions and exam review office hours were extremely useful for further understanding the content in Yihong's lectures. He had a whole alternate set of slides from when he taught the course last year, so he was able to fill in any gaps (though to be honest there rarely were). Also his Monday sessions he went over p-set problems and techniques which was super helpful. Yihong's lectures had very little student participation, which was actually really good for me as someone mostly taking the class asynchronously, but in person obviously I think this would be less optimal.",
                "Virtual office hours were very successful, since the TAs always had time to help answer questions one-on-one.

Honestly if I wasnt feeling pretty confident about being a statistics major, this class would have made me question it. \r\n\r\nOne note: I had a recurring conflict with Winstons section and I always felt like I was missing out on something super useful. Like someone explained his graph-based convolution method to me after the fact, and it felt revolutionarily clear compared to Yihongs explanation. Like so much more clear that it felt like an unfair disadvantage that I couldnt go to section. So if Winstons teaching, maybe take it for fun even if not for the major.",

This is evitable when you look at the practice midterms\/practice final exams. \r\n\r\nHowever, you will come out of this class after taking it with Yihong very strong at probability theory.

You are also introduced to some basic statistics formulas, which can be satisfying to actually understand. Basically, the class was pretty fun and interesting, but got super stressful around exam time. The midterm was super reasonable and reflected the material, but the final was a little iffy and felt more like a series of puzzles than a synopsis of the material.",

Aside from the 5-8 hours needed to complete weekly p-sets, I also needed to go to an almost equal amount of peer-tutor\/TF office hours\/classmate review sessions. I felt not very cared for as a student from the professor, and I felt like the material we were tested on for weekly p-sets were too-high level for the limited examples we were shown in class (while we often were shown examples, the methods of solving them were not always shown\/basic concepts were not taught well). In general it felt frustrating because it seemed like I needed to teach a lot of material to myself. If you absolutely need to take this course with Winston as a major requirement or because you generally don't enjoy happiness, then just be prepared for a very mundane and difficult time. You can definitely still do well in the course, but expect to put in a lot of effort and get a little lucky as well.",
                "Great class!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. There is just a lot of interesting material and a lot of interesting applications of it. The problem sets were tough but interesting, and great preparation for the exams.",
                "If you need it for the major\/certificate, this is the way to go. It's way easier when taught by Professor Lin and not Professor Wu.",
                "Yes. I love statistics and probability, so even though the engagement in this class was not amazing, I found it fascinating.",
                "Absolutely. Probability theory and the problem solving skills you develop taking this class are invaluable. Yihong Wu is so smart and knowledgeable and Winston explains everything so you can understand it",
                "This was a great course that was the right level of challenging while also exposing me to many new topics in probability and the proofs behind them.",
                "Yea, why not? I think this class gives you a strong foundation in probability theory. It may be harder when Yihong teaches it, but I think it was actually fun and interesting.",
                "I would! It's a great intersection of math and statistics, so I would recommend it for anyone interested in either. It's not too hard, but you still learn a lot.",
                "Yes if you are into stats. Pretty intensive but it was cool overall",
                "Only with Winston.",
                "Yes, it was a good introduction to calculus based probability.",
                "If you are comfortable with calculus and some linear algebra, you will likely be more or less comfortable in this course. Any previous experience with probability theory would be incredibly valuable, as Yihong blows through lectures and content incredibly fast. However, if you are semesters removed from a math class, or if you want to explore the concepts of probability theory without the difficulty of doing computation, this course likely wouldn't be for you. As someone who fits within the latter description, I personally struggled, especially without being able to form study groups with other students as would be possible during a \"normal,\" non-remote semester.",
                "Yes. Absolutely take this class if you like probability and statistics, and at least shop it if you're otherwise into math because you might find that you really enjoy thinking probabilistically (like I did) and then the class is just naturally super fun. It definitely isn't for everyone, since the material is objectively dry (it's quite literally all the mathematical theory behind probability - think the probability AP Stats unit under a magnifying glass), so if you don't find it interesting then the work would probably feel like a drag. I happened to really enjoy it though, and the workload isn't too bad: if you've done math competitions, the first half of the course is a breeze, and then the second half is just applying that stuff to continuous random variables, which uses calculus and such. This is necessarily harder if you have less experience, and you need to be able to do out tough integrals by hand because you can't use a calculator. But in all it was a very manageable amount of work, and despite horror stories on these reviews of Yihong's previous final exams, this one wasn't bad at all. Yihong is a great lecturer and Winston was super helpful in his discussion sessions; they complement each other well. And finally if you're thinking of majoring in S&DS, you pretty much have to take this class, so even if the above doesn't sound appetizing to you it is a prerequisite for basically every advanced class in the S&DS department.",
                "I would recommend this course if you plan to take another statistics class in the future, since many of the concepts seem to be fundamental to more advanced techniques.",
                "Not if it is taught by Yihong. He isnt clear when he lectures",
                "I would highly recommend this course. The concepts and tools taught here are extremely useful for any field in STEM, especially if you are thinking of pursuing graduate studies and research in areas like math and theoretical computer science.",
                "I would if they are willing to put in the work to develop a proper way of reasoning through the problems dealing with uncertainty. One needs to be on top of things to be able to progress through the class properly. The problem sets are reasonable and you can get help by going to the TA sessions.",
                "Yes! A nice slower start, lots or interesting material useful for many fields.",
                "No, Avoid Yihong at all costs.",
                "yes but not in online format",
                "Yes, it's important information. Although the questions (on problem sets and exams) are tricky, they do ensure that you have an in-depth understanding of concepts taught in class. Don't be too surprised if you can't figure out the trick to solve a particular problem on the exam and get stuck--it can be stressful.",
                "no not with yihong",
                "Would not recommend to a student not liking math, probability, or statistics. Would recommend to students who like and have experience with math, probability, and statistics.",
                "I would not highly recommend this course to another student unless Winston is teaching it. I just didn't feel like Yihong was able to relate to the pace or statistics background of an undergraduate. As such this course was quite hard and not very intuitive, and required a lot of self-teaching.",
                "Yes, I found this class to be an interesting introduction to statistics and I feel that by studying the theory I strengthened my background understanding.",
                "Yes, I think this is a great introduction to probability theory if you enjoy math and solving problems.",
                "Pretty solid for cs majors.",
                "No, I don't think that another student should take this course because it's too hard to understand and follow online.",
                "Only if they have to take it.",
                "Yes, although it's a requirement for certain majors, I would recommend it for anyone wanting to gain a solid understanding of the theory behind much of data science.",
                "The material is interesting and important, although I was not a huge fan of the style of instruction. If interested in the topic, I would recommend.",
                "Yes! The concepts were so clearly explained, and Professor Wu gave us such interesting and thought-provoking probability questions."
