                "Since we were a small class of 5 students, we had plenty of time to practice speaking Arabic to one another. I think we should lean more into that. Sometimes we would spend most class going over homework drills. I didnt find this review helpful. Since there was so much to review, I often didnt have time to process what I got wrong on assignments. Giving us an answer key that we can check our answers to as needed would be more effective in my opinion. We could ask questions in class or in TA sessions as needed based on those results. I think class time should be spent solely on speaking Arabic, trying to use the new vocabulary, and reading aloud. I particularly struggled with reading aloud.\r\n\r\nI appreciated grammar lessons as well. Oftentimes the teacher would ask us for topics that we needed help with and she would prepare lessons accordingly. However, we didnt always do this and we were sometimes tested on grammar topics we never went over in class such as the dual degree. \r\n\r\nI would organize the revised (3-day per week) schedule as such. Dedicate two of the three days for in-class speaking and reading practice. Take the last day and dedicate it to grammar. I know in the middle of the semester we had TA sessions every Friday, but those ended up being speaking sessions anyway as opposed to anything particularly unique. I dont think they were necessary."

                "I appreciated the break from Zoom by having us meet only three days a week as opposed to 5. However, the HW submission times were a little awkward. Homework on off-days was due at 12:00pm which was the middle of what would have been our meeting time. I would keep it consistent and have all HW due at midnight the day its assigned. It was a little challenging to keep up with the assignments. \r\n\r\nThe HW submission process could be improved as well. Most teachers set up zoom so that you can submit any file type for HW. This is efficient because it interfaces well with most applications that we use on our various devices. In this class however, we were to submit in a Canvas-generated word processor that could take in photos. But the process for uploading those photos is tedious especially if youre using a device that doesnt take pictures. Towards the end of the semester, that particular system started breaking down (apparently I had reached a file-upload limit) and I had to submit HW as comments which are not always detected by teachers."
