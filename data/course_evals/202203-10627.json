                "I learned a lot of Russian grammar, and we did a lot: I at least learned formalized grammatical concepts related to (adjectives, verb conjugation, verb aspect, verb tense, one of the cases, etc.) which helped me improve my Russian. While I spoke Russian earlier, I did not know any of these concepts or rules, and knowing these helped me improve my Russian skills and accuracy.\r\n\r\nBesides that, we read two small books in Russian, wrote two small paragraph essays\/summaries (depending on your language level) of the books, and made presentations on topics of our choice, which improved our skills in a variety of directions. Very much felt like I improved my Russian this semester. And we did so quite quicklyand completely in Russian! Great way to learn Russian grammar and skills if you already know some Russian!",
                "I developed my Russian speaking, grammar, and comprehension skills in a more concrete and advanced way. I learned how to improve my language-learning skills in a more technical way."

            "comments": [
                "I feel like this course could use a bit more direction in terms of what we are learning week by week. This is difficult because the Russian skill varies so wildly within the classroom as some students go in practically fluent while others just have Russian-speaking abilities. A strength of the course is that it does provide a great area to foster growth in the Russian language in an academic setting, which most bilingual students don't have access to.",
                "The greatest strength of the course is how it adjusts to each individual student. Being a heritage speaker can mean lots of things to different people, and means that students come with a variety of skills. I for example, was on the lower end of Russian comprehension and knowledge (mainly just spoke it, didn't really read or write much), but the professor does a masterful job of changing the assignment difficulty\/expectations to match your level, so you adequately push yourself, but aren't overwhelmed or thrown off the deep end. If you come with more limited Russian knowledge, the course can feel a little daunting at first because you're learning a lot very quickly, but I recommend to stick through it. THis course is very understanding and oriented towards helping you learn. Concepts you are tested on are fairly presented and you understand what you are expected to know, so can review and study for it.",
                "The level of engagement with my instructor was very high and I enjoyed the lessons that were taught in the class. I thought the textbook was a frat way to introduce us to the course. The only thing I think could be improved is the online interface we used in tandem with the course. \r\nI liked the online exercises in their format, but the website is still in its beta form and needs to fix its user interface. The website sometimes bugs and makes it hard to complete the assignment. \r\nI do not have any complaints about the instructor or the design of the course. I liked my Professor!"

                "If you speak Russian at home and have some reading and writing ability (not much, just a bit needed), I would recommend this class. A lower-level Russian would likely be too slow, and while this class sometimes has a tendency to go too fast through certain material, Professor Titus was very open to communication from the students and adjusted the syllabus as needed.",
                "If you already have experience with Russian and want an easier language class, I would recommend taking it.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who wants to continue their Russian studies but would like a more hands-on approach to language learning. I really enjoyed this course and if someone was asking whether or not to go through the heritage track, I would answer yes."
