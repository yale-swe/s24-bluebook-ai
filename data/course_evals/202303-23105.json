I went from knowing almost nothing about the world of finance to understanding different asset classes and how they are priced, how to build a portfolio and make investments, how to use derivatives when trading, and much more! The lectures covered a lot of material without making it overwhelming. The Portfolio Management assignment where we used a website to manage a portfolio taught me so much about the markets, portfolio composition, and report-writing.",

He was also always available to answer questions over email or to meet with students one-on-one to discuss questions on the material. The Portfolio Management assignment was a fantastic way to get real-life investing experience without any of the risk. It taught me so much about building a portfolio and also analyzing the returns/performance of that portfolio.\r\nWeakness: Honestly, not much. I wish we had more time in the semester to cover some more aspects of financial economics. Also, maybe it might be useful to have a lecture on different types of portfolios and securities before the trading period starts for the Portfolio Management project. That's very minor.",
                "Very interesting topics and it made me more interested in the area",
                "Strengths - Interesting material to people interested in finance, wonderful professor\r\nWeaknesses - TAs were not very responsive or helpful, course material could be better organized",
                "With no formal training investment strategies I thought the course was a really good introduction to investment strategies for an individual investor. I feel as though the class has taught me a great deal and I'm sure it'll stick with me in the future",

                "good",
                "I think we could have had more direction on portfolio theory part of project. I wasnt really sure what to do half the time. But the topics were important and the professor taught them in a great way.",
                "very good teaching",
                "The course is very comprehensive in terms of introducing students to the financial market. Hence perhaps too much information is included in the course. In fact, the professor did not manage to finish everything he planned to teach us by the end of the semester. If the course is better structured (maybe a little bit less content, or maybe a more efficient teaching method, although this semester has been very productive already), this unfortunate issue might be avoided. Overall, I think the course is very good.\r\nThe flexibility of discussion section is a major bonus. For students with a tight schedule (five courses and an on-campus job, in my case), mandatory attendance in sections is impossible. The fact that I can attend sections whenever I needed to and my schedule allowed tremendously improved my experience.",
                "Strengths: All of the topics we covered in class would be super useful for a career in finance. I thought that the projects were amazing experiences, one of which involved managing a simulated portfolio at real-time market prices and the other involving analyzing real financial data. I loved the professor and the course was well-organized - the lecture slides and practice problems + solutions were really helpful (as well as the optional textbook)."

If you will have a Roth IRA or 401k in the future, this class can help you understand how to grow that money for retirement. If you're preparing for finance-role recruiting, this class is also phenomenal to get a good understanding of the markets and securities trading.",
