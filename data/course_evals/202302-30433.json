                "I enjoyed the fast pace of the course, as it allowed me to study the topics in depth as I solved problem sets and studied for exams. The course could have potentially met for less time, as we would always take a 15 minute break and still complete the required material."

I think former course reviews tend to scare away students but I really think Prof. Smooke is reasonable and understands that 5 weeks is not a long time. I will say the last week/test was quite hectic and that material was the most difficult part of the course.",

Professor Smooke is a great professor and taking the course over the summer meant that I was able to focus entirely on the material and feel like I actually learned the concepts and their applications in the real world rather than simply memorizing a problem solving process for an exam and immediately forgetting it afterwards. I think that the pacing of the course was ideal to learn the material and feel confident and prepared to enter the fall semester."
