                "I loved the ongoing GoogleDoc that helped me track my writing progress and errors, allowing me to be in constant dialogue with Dina about any grammar or linguistic questions I may have. I also liked that anytime a student either didn't know a word, or used a high-level word unfamiliar to others, Dina put it onto a running vocabulary list that we were responsible for translating part of and choosing which words we wanted on an exam. A great way to grow vocabulary. No weaknesses. Fewer graded speaking assignments in this class than others, but because class was so highly discussion based I wouldn't have asked for more graded speaking assignments; my speaking and listening comprehension really grew in the course.",
