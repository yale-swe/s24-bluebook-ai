                "I became much more proficient at reading in French. I noticed that, by the end of the course, I could read and understand French literature at a quicker speed without laboring over the words. This course also pushed me to think about and discuss aloud important themes from the literature we read. I really appreciated our class discussions, as I've never had such deep conversations in French before. I also developed my French oral skills a lot through this class - at the start, I was extremely nervous to speak up because I wasn't confident in my speaking abilities, but through continual practice, I think I became much better at expressing myself in another language. This course also taught a lot of French grammar, which is important and useful, of course.",
                "You will improve your French vocabulary, grammar, and speaking fluency. Specifically in this course there is a lot of reading in French, and you will also spend a fair bit of time learning about French history and culture, which makes the daily class much more fun as it is not purely grammar and vocab.",

            "comments": [
                "While I understand that meeting often and substantial practice is essential for learning a language, the work load for this class overall could be reduced a little and the overall French retained would not change. I feel this would also ensure more quality work instead of a larger quantity of work.",
                "Strengths: A diverse selection of interesting readings from many different cultures, which led to lots of great discussions. Getting to make a presentation on a WWII topic of my choosing, which allowed me to conduct a lot of interesting research. We watched some great films. Exams were structured well. Overall, great class.\r\nWeaknesses: the pop quizzes were not so fun, but usually my professor would drop a hint about them ahead of time",
                "I think a strength of this course is that, more than any other French course I have taken, there is a lot of time spent discussing French and Francophone history and culture. This is a strength because it means that you leave each day really feeling like you've learned something, and it is not nearly as tedious as language courses that are solely focused on grammar. While there were parts of the course that I did not enjoy, I think they were integral parts of a good language course and I don't really think this course had any weaknesses.",
                "The course is well-structured and designed to facilitate rapid improvement and student engagement. Its a lot of work, but its worth it! Minor weaknesses: it wasnt always clear what material was to be covered on exams; material was sometimes rushed, with the course struggling to keep pace with the daily schedule in the syllabus; the audio exercises in the course pack didnt really help me improve my understanding of the material or listening comprehension"

                "Yes, I would! I learned so much from this course, and I improved my French reading, writing, and oral skills much more than I expected. Having class every morning Monday through Friday is a lot, but this course is definitely worth it. I really enjoyed the diverse selection of readings we had, which always led to interesting discussions. I thought the exams were straight forward, so I always knew what to prepare and what would be expected of me. Professor Bdoui is also amazing, and I think she definitely made this class as good as it was.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students because out of the three French courses I have taken at Yale, this one was by far the most interesting in terms of subject material.",
                "It's a lot of work, but if you want to learn more French this class will definitely teach you more French. So, yeah, would recommend.\r\n\r\nJust probably don't take it as part of a 5.5 credit semester, unless your other courses are on the lighter side (or you want to have a bad semester).",
                "Yes, just be prepared to spend time every day outside of class on grammar and reading. If you put in the work, its highly likely that youll find this course rewarding and see significant improvement. The exams are manageable as soon as you become familiar with the format, and the redactions (writing assignments) arent too bad either once you understand the emphasis on grammar."
