                "I learned so much about the world of fakes and forgeries, which was something to which I had never really given much thought. The class was also a great introduction to the field of classics and how classicists and other academics approach the study of classics. I think I also developed the skill of thinking analytically about a reading to connect it to class topics and other readings.",
                "Throughout the class, there was ongoing investigation and challenging of our definitions of \"authenticity\". At first, all of us had pretty black-and-white thoughts about what was fake and what was real; by the end of the class, we were able to identify far more nuance, especially concerning ancient artifacts and works. It's a great introduction to topics in archeology, classical literature, linguistics, philosophy, and art history; fascinating all the way. \r\n\r\nEach week we explored one example of a literary or historical fake. There was more discussion of literary fakery than I expected (pseudoepigraphy), but I enjoyed that as well.",
                "I improved my ability to read academic papers, and seminar-based discussion and research skills.",
                "I learned to ask questions I never would have",
                "I developed a greater ability to draw connections and make distinctions between case studies and present my knowledge in spoken and written forms.",
                "I learned how to critically examine information, even that which is presented as fact. Furthermore, I gained insight into the world of academia, through the case studies we examined and my own research project which concluded the semester. I practiced the skills of both writing and presenting, especially how to craft a presentation within a time constraint and how to thoroughly and concisely answer peers' questions.",

                "Strengths of the course are that the subject matter is SUPER interesting, the discussion format is pretty chill and it's fun to really interact with your classmates, Prof Valdivieso is AMAZING, the class was very well organized and the readings followed a logical progression over the course of the year. The only weakness I found was that some of the readings were quite tedious.",
                "Strengths: incredible professorvery kind and super knowledgable (knows like 9 languages). Consistent and fair workload. There was a midterm exam, 2 short papers, 2 final papers, and a presentation in total; ample time for all of them. Two visits to yale museums to see artifacts relevant to course material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Readings can be dense and quite lengthy, even if they are interesting. Occasional deep-dives into fairly niche topics (especially in philosophy) somewhat distracted from core material, but as a seminar course, the students are able to guide much of the discussion.",
                "My initial impressions of the course could have been more favorable, in large part because the topic of the first week of the course did not align with my expectations coming into it. That said, as the course progressed it got better and better as we (the students) gain a bigger repertoire of related topics to make connections and understand the forgeries in question.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the semester, I was slower to get engaged, mostly because the topics did not align with my expectations for the course. However, by the end I was very motivated. I wonder if beginning with what most people more generally take to be a forgery would help engage students. Otherwise, I wish we had the chance to do more forgeries! (Though I realize that there simply isn't enough time in a single semester.)",
                "I have no complaints about this class. The hands-on activities were amazing supplements to the in-class learning, the readings were engaging, and the assessments gave us opportunities to bring all our knowledge together.",
                "Professor was amazing 10/10 class no weaknesses",
                "This course is incredibly engaging and interesting. The readings were carefully chosen by Professor Valdivieso, who critically considered each text and our engagement with it. Brief presentations given to introduce us to the subject of each case study were exceedingly helpful, providing just enough context for the readings to be understandable but without overwhelming the class with information. Discussions guided by Professor Valdivieso's thoughtful questions were always productive and frequently energetic. The beauty of these conversations was their freedom: though the topic might drift from the original item in question into thought experiments and other examples, I always left class feeling an expanded understanding of the object of interest. The visits to the art museum and Beinecke library enabled real life experience with the subject. I found the paper assignments and final project highly productive, deepening my understanding and engagement with the material.",
                "The content is extremely engaging and the professor is also wonderful. Readings were engaging and never too long, and class discussions were also always great."

                "Yes! I would 100% recommend this course to another student. You'll come away from the class with a completely new perspective/mindset on forgery and just artifacts in general, which is really interesting. You'll learn about heists, conspiracies, fraud, and more fun stuff and it's really worth it.",
                "Highly, highly, highly recommend this first year seminar. The topics are presented approachably even if you are not well versed in classics or the related topics. If you are, this does not cover the typical introductory material to classics, and gives you new perspective on the field.",
                "Certainly. As a first year seminar, it is a strong introduction to scholarly read and writing, as well as discussion-style courses.. But even moreand perhaps most importantlythe topics of discussion are fascinating, providing additional motivation to come to class prepared and stay engaged throughout the semester.",
