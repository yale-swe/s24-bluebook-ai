                "This course could be improved by taking religious thought more seriously. It felt often like the default class attitude (perhaps in part a result of the composition of this particular group of students) was liberal-New-Athiest-y in a way that was intellectually unserious.",
                "strengths: LB is the most kind and caring professor, themes to every class, great mix of \"lecture\" and guided discussion, truly a wonderful space to think about life's deepest questions\r\nweaknesses: not much conversation between students (not so much a weakness as a feature)\r\nimprovements: not many but would be nice to occasionally review what we've done in previous classes and see what other students wrote about in their essays",
                "The course is amazing, and the more you put into it the more you get out. There was a lot of reading, and the essays were quite difficult to write, but the content is incredible for anyone (regardless of background/knowledge of the Bible), and Professor Brisman is one of the best professors I've ever had.",
                "Strengths: Professor Brisman, who kind, lively, caring, and blunt (in a good way). \r\nWeaknesses: None come to mind.",
                "The structure of the essays needs to be rethought in this course, as it does in most English courses. Thrice a semester, we submit an essay, receive some feedback on it a few weeks later, which, if we so choose, we may never look at. There is little chance to use the instructor's expertise to improve your writing.",
                "I really enjoyed the readings for the course, and felt they were almost always of manageable size. The seminars, led by Professor Brisman, did a great job of highlighting the important distinctions and historical context of each text, and ideas about the author(s) behind them. Class discussions were also often interesting and engaging in how they related to our contemporary lives: how modern politics resembles aspects of the Bible, or going around the room and asking each student what they thought 'morality' was.\r\n\r\nMy main feedback would be that I sometimes felt too much of class time was devoted to readings from the extracts and discussions on translations, when I sometimes would have liked to hear more about how my classmates felt about certain passages and the ideas contained within them. A lecture element is needed for this course to digestible, I understand, but I always appreciated the deviations from them (the discussion on morality) and would welcome more. Overall a great course, though!",

                "If you want to read a broad but thorough selection of the Hebrew Bible and Christian New Testament, then this class is for you! I was very curious but generally unknowledgeable about the topic going in, and felt I learned a great deal about these texts as a result--and how they were composed as 'a literature' by multiple authors over centuries. Professor Brisman is a great source of knowledge and class discussions were always a fun time!",
