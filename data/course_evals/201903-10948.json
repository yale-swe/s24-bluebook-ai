Professor Brisman is an incredibly committed, kind, and brilliant instructor who will guide you through some of the English language's most beautiful writers. The material also has the power to change your relationship to nature, revolution, and sympathy.",
    "Absolutely. I think every Yale student should take a course from Professor Brisman and every Yale student should dive into an era of poetry.",
    "One must earnestly enjoy both challenging reading and challenging writing, but provided that is the case, I would recommend this to anyone.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to be exposed to or interested in Romantic themes while also learning to read poetry like a scholar might."
