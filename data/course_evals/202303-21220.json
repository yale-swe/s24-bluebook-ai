                "Strengths: assignments were clear and fair, could take things in your own direction, lots of small group discussions\r\nWeaknesses: classes were quite boring sometimes as it was like a lecture format without slides or a clear progression",
                "A strength of this course is the wide variety of readings and topics it covers. It was easy to participate in class discussions and the class felt welcoming. An area for improvement is to make all of the topics flow together more cohesively. I feel like we jumped around quite a bit throughout the semester and it was difficult to find a throughline, other than the fact that all of the material was related to Spain.",
                "Honestly, I think the classroom layout made it very hard to enjoy this course. I think that if we were organized in a U shape, and in a smaller class, we could have built up some sort of a discussion dynamic among the class, but this honestly felt more like a lecture.",
                "The course is very interactive. Needs no improvements.",
                "Lots of discussion which was engaging",
                "I found most of the early material interesting, but I think the more modern topics lost my interest.",
                "I thought it was well organized",
                "I enjoyed the small group discussions each class to get to know classmates better and give everyone a chance to participate.",
                "The course was well-taught and engaging. The material outside of class was carefully chosen such that it was provocative yet an efficient use of time.",
                "Strengths: Very knowledgeable and engaging professor with thoughtful consideration of connections between syllabus themes and texts. The class was a good balance between large and small group discussions to allow for multiple levels of participation. Syllabus is very thorough and clear, which makes it easy to understand what is necessary to do well in the class. It is very straightforward, yet interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the structure of the class could get a bit repetitive."

I went in very nervous due to my ability in Spanish (I'm a native speaker but by no means the best in Spanish) and found a really welcoming environment that Professor Acosta promoted. I got the opportunity to really improve my Spanish abilities along with learning about fascinating topics in history and social studies.",
