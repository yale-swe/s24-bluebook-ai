                "The course is purposely unstructured, which allows for a lot of flexibility in the pace of work but a lack of rhythm. I'd say this is mostly a positive.",
                "I think your experience with this course will depend a lot on who you have as an advisor. It's helpful to have someone that responds promptly to your emails. It's also good to think about what this will look like for you structure-wise. People who work in a lab often have a much more rigid structure for conducting the project than many data science projects. Another huge challenge is getting access to data (for me, this took the better part of 2 months!!), so plan in advance as much as possible. My advisor was a subject-matter expert. They were incredibly responsive and helpful, but they also didn't have a lot of experience advising undergrads and were used to their students having more autonomy. If I were to do it again, I'd probably try to enlist two advisors: one that's a subject-matter expert, and the other with more of a statistics background. Something that's both a strength and can be a bit of a weakness is the lack of structure on the DUS-side. This is so that students can structure their projects to follow the standards in their chosen application area. This relies on your advisor having clear expectations with you, so it's probably a good idea to define those early."

                "Yes, would recommend. It's pretty fulfilling to complete such a project. However, here are some tips\/things to consider:\r\n1) Your experience with this course is heavily dependent on your advisor. Try to find someone that is responsive to emails and will be clear with you when you all set expectations. I met once per week with my advisor, which was incredibly helpful. If you are doing something in an application area, consider having two advisors, one subject-matter expert and one with more of a statistics background. I only had the first (they were fantastic!), but I found myself consulting with a lot of other people, faculty, and sources to clarify my methods-approach. I think having a dedicated point-person\/advisor for that would have been helpful.\r\n2) Create a timeline for yourself. It's really easy to try to put off work for this--but don't! Academic strategies has a thesis peer mentor group that you can sign up for that helps you with some of this (I did. They also helped with tips for writing a lit review and other fundamentals). It might be a nice idea for there to be an within-S&DS version of this, since some students might be running into similar challenges (maybe our department version could have tips for creating the poster and formatting the report). If nothing official happens, you could do this informally if you have senior S&DS friends also doing the project the same semester you are.\r\n3) Get your data EARLY! Getting access to the dataset I used took longer than I thought it was going to, which delayed the analysis for a while.",
                "Yes! This was a very rewarding experience but find an advisor that will be willing to help and fits your working style",
                "Hard to say, I didnt take 425 so Im not sure which is betterif you have a good project idea you should take this."
