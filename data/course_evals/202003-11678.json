The title of this course is no joke; you do actually come out with at least a basic understanding of a lot of topics that are marginally pertinent to your daily life. We started with algebra basics, and then we modeled exponential growth and decay, in terms of money and investments, nuclear explosions, chain reactions. We then worked with probability and solved things like the Monty Hall problem; we talked about lottery tickets, super computers, hackers. We pivoted to modular arithmetic, which was probably the coolest topic we discussed all semester, partially because I'd never seen it before, which was a fun way to calculate birthdays, seasons, random dates. And then we ended with basic statistics and sequences\/series to talk about mortgages. Out of all of the topics, probability was the one I feared the most, and I honestly can say that I don't feel so worked up about it anymore. If you're looking for something at least a little practical without making it too difficult, this is the class to take.",

I wish that there were more lessons instead of breakout room work as I would sometimes get confused on some questions. However, this was somewhat made up for as the professor would join each breakout room and ask if we needed help.",

                "Maybe switching up breakout rooms",
                "This class covers a lot of material, which is both a strength and a weakness. I feel like some topics we breezed right through -- in part because the class seemed to pick it up faster, but also because there wasn't enough time to really take a deep dive. A lot of topics we only cursorily covered, and while it's certainly interesting to get a taste of each and every thing we did in fact discuss, perhaps we could've spent more time on particular units, or went more in-depth. But then again, this is not intended to be a deep dive into mathematical processes, so I guess that makes it a strength, too. \r\n\r\nAnother strength was my group. After the second class, the group I was in was the group I worked with for the rest of the semester, which was fantastic. However, I'm not sure what my classmates perceptions of their groups were, so I guess group-work can really make or break the quality of the class. The class was also just really well taught, and Rachel is a true delight. Please take classes with her. She's a gem, and will actually walk you through problems and answer your questions. You won't be left in the dark, confused and maddened by numbers and formulas.\r\n\r\nThe textbook, however, is kind of useless. Only used it for homework assignments. Don't know why it's required if everything is explained in the class anyway.",

                "This class operated in a semi-flipped fashion. That means that we watched video(s) -- sometimes one video, sometimes two videos -- prior to the start of a new unit of the material, explaining the topic. The videos were top notch, and I mean that. Rachel clearly put a ton of time and effort into making the videos, and they were brilliantly fashioned with explanations, example problems, and definitions. What followed was really short quiz, which we could retake until getting all of the answers right, which was another plus -- not only did they reinforce the fact that you watched the video, they also wouldn't hurt your grade. The only thing is that when the videos' length approached 7-10 minutes, it felt like it was taking up a lot of my time, as I'd spend about an hour watching and taking notes, making sure I understood the material. \r\n\r\nWe also made use of the share screen function often, as well as breakout rooms to facilitate group work. Rachel had a way that she could connect her tablet, I believe, to Zoom, so that she could write in real time and we could solve problems together. The breakout rooms were how we work in groups every class, and the \"ask for help\" button would send Rachel into the \"classroom\" to help with problems and answer questions. All of this was very effective, and for the most part, very efficient. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I wished had been stressed was having videos on during the intended-to-be interactive lecture\/discussion portion at the beginning of class. I had my video on every class without fail, and I understand some people have personal issues with having their video turned on. But it also hindered participation; I felt that often I was of the only people actually participating in class and engaging actively with Rachel's very well-prepared lectures and explanations. I mean, you get out of the class what you put in, but it would've been nice to see more engagement on the part of my peers.",

Rachel Diethorn changed those feelings. If anything, take this class for the brilliance that is Rachel. She not only explains everything, she is helpful and kind. She clearly loves teaching the math, and the topics in this class are actually interesting. You also get an entire page for a cheat sheet on each exam, so there's no need to memorize anything. You can get help with homework problems, classwork problems, you name it -- and Rachel will actually walk you through the problems. I went to office hours and asked to do some additional practice problems, and Rachel sat there with me on Zoom and did them alongside me, making sure I got them correct. I really, really don't like math, but this was one of my most anticipated classes of each week. While not everything in this course is totally practical, some of it is; and even if you don't find yourself using all of the math and the tools that you learned in class after you take the class, you walk away with some pretty cool knowledge. Also, no final exam was a great addition -- and the final project was pretty creative, applying a concept from class to some real-world topic. It's also about the applications in this class.",
