                "Weaknesses: understanding some of the studies was difficult, and I would have preferred a small summary of some of the more convoluted studies in the notes for when I was reviewing. \r\nStrengths: notes were excellent, pacing in class was very good, class participation through polls was often enough to be effective, assignments were straightforward",
                "very organized and interesting information",
                "The grading of essays by the TAs was really hit or miss and there were obvious differences in the grading scheme used by each TA. Some were very harsh graders, while others were far more forgiving. There was also little effective feedback given on how to improve our writing, leaving us to just kind of wing it.\r\nThere were also way too many papers mentioned in lecture to remember the minute details of for exams and quizzes and I am not surely what there really is to be gained by doing so.",
                "This class is incredible, and I only have positive things to say about it. Professor Gendron is amazing, and her class was engaging and genuinely interesting. I loved how Prof Gendron set up her powerpoints (she clearly put a lot of time into her preparation) and used PollEv. The papers, exams, and project paper had really cool questions that helped me learn psychology on a whole different level by making higher-level connections and application. Even though I attended live lecture and took really careful notes, I still found the weekly quizzes a little bit hard.",

                "The one thing with this class is that lectures feel really long. I don't know if that can be avoided but it was sometimes hard to engage because of the length.",
                "strengths: very organized lecture, clear expectations for students, and a good grading structure\r\nweaknesses: no feedback on the second 2 response papers, could use more real life connections to the course material",

                "Strengths: good explanations, compelling material, easy quizzes Weaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: great professor who is accommodating, kind, and thorough. Lectures are succinct yet detailed and digestible. Notes are provided via PowerPoints and delivered nicely, and the format is great for live or asynchronous viewing. Tests are completely doable and do not require extensive memorization. Quizzes are simple and a good way to reinforce content weekly. Workload is manageable and content is extremely interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: survey of many concepts means any one concept is not covered in as much depth as sometimes would be desired.",
                "Strengths: Interesting content, very applicable, and the teaching team genuinely cares about the students. This is the only course where I felt enough effort was put into empathizing with students and actually looking for ways to accommodate those that were struggling. Maria Gendron and her team are fantastic. So grateful for their kindness.",
                "Really well organized and not too difficult, Professor Gendron is super accommodating too. I thought the material was really engaging, too. The papers are pretty manageable and sometimes fun to write (if you're not big on reading research papers, know how to pick ones that are short and easy to summarize). Honestly no big flaws.",

                "Dr. Gendron is a major strength of this class. She is the kind of professor that would make any class good  no matter what she teaches. But the class is wonderful too. She really knows how to adapt the class to student needs and build engaging slides that facilitate memory. For example, she always defines key terms clearly on their own slides so students can write them down. When things got tough on campus and in the world, she was flexible with deadlines too.",

Dr. Gendron and the TAs were very open to hear our opinions or suggestions throughout the semester.\r\nWeakness - I know there are a lot of people in the class so I understand in a way, but it took a while to release the grades for some papers and quizzes.",
                "Strengths: This course was taught in a very organized manner, with important terms and relevant literature all marked on the powerpoints. The professor also made sure to include summary slides throughout the lecture which was extremely helpful.",

                "The quizzes were impossible. The tests were good. Quizzes were impossible though.",
                "The strengths of the course are many! The professor is very engaging and passionate about what she teaches. It is taught in a way that is easy to understands and builds upon key concepts. Additionally, the teaching team was receptive to questions and feedback. \r\nIts weakness lies in the lack of feedback on response papers and exams.",
                "It would be more engaging in person",
                "I think this course provided an interesting overview of concepts, but sometimes quizzes felt very vague.",
                "I enjoyed the material and I think the readings and organization of the course were quite good. The lectures could get a bit unfocused though",
                "The strength of the course was the textbook as it provided a lot of clear information and it was mostly interesting. Also, I appreciated the feedback survey as they were helpful. However, the grading of the course was very disorganized and unclear. All the TAs seemed to grade differently and marked down for petty things. The grading was inconsistent and it felt like the level of work that I put in for each assignment was not worth the effort as the TAs harshly graded and marked down on concepts that I actually explained in the paper. Although I put in hours of studying for the course, the quizzes did not accurately reflect what was taught in the lecture and the book as many questions were confusing and some were not covered in the course material. The lack of feedback for our test answers was also detrimental to our learning.",
                "This course did not seem like a Yale-level course and unfortunately did not facilitate or necessitate much engagement. Topics were covered very generally, with more focus on the definitions of well-known terms (like \"discrimination\" and \"self esteem\") and the memorization of the overall conclusions of dozens of papers than on deep analysis of social psychological concepts. At times, I felt like I was in middle school. I wish this course was more like CGSC110/PSYC130, which was an engaging lecture that drew connections between concepts, made students think, looked at real-world applications, and provided a more in-depth study of a smaller number of papers. This is not a critique on the professor herself; she was kind and always open to feedback.",
                "Instructor was very flexible!!",
                "Very engaging material!",
                "The course was very interesting overall because it was easy to see how concepts play out in our everyday lives. The course was also very easy to follow and all materials were provided by the teaching team very effectively to help students succeed.",
                "Strengths: the weekly quizzes reinforced lecture and reading material and the other assignments were interesting ways to apply the concept we learned in class. The TAs were helpful and Professor Gendron is incredibly understanding and passionate about the subject. Weaknesses: none come to mind",
                "This course was very well run the engagement with students is phenomenal. Other courses should model themselves off of Dr. Gendrons course structure as well as her mindfulness and genuine care for students.",
                "Maybe it was the zoom format of the class, but it was hard to feel grounded in the class this semester. It was hard to ever know if I was on track with everyone else or if I was doing the class wrong and with feedback coming late and from different TFs each time, it felt hard to improve.",
                "Strengths: the content is very interesting. Response papers were really helpful in examining research papers. weekly quizzes helped with understanding the content",
                "Strengths: I absolutely loved how this course was organized. The rubrics for each assignment were very clear, and expectations were also clear from the start. The lectures were organized in a very helpful format (discuss a concept, introduce some studies that better explain that concept), and it was honestly one of the clearest lecture formats I've ever seen. I also loved the fact that Dr. Gendron included interactive elements in her Powerpoints. Zoom made focusing on lectures for long periods of time very difficult, but I never had issues focusing in Dr. Gendron's class. Weaknesses: I wish that the guidelines for the exams were made clearer beforehand. I really didn't know what to expect for the first exam. I liked that we reserved class time for review, but I wish that the TAs also held their own review sessions just so that we could hear things explained in a different way.",
                "I think the content was very interesting and Professor Gendron did a great of keeping everyone up to pace.",
                "Strengths of this course are its organization and the material itself. Learning about society is interesting and the way the interactions play out with other people is engaging. The course is also well organized so the material is not overbearing and its split up so that one topic tends to logically flow into the next. A weakness of the course is the Ed discussions. I never managed to use the Ed discussions but last semester I took a different psychology class that used a different program that was more accessible.",
                "Strengths include the organization of the course. A weakness is that feedback was either never given (we couldn't see the correct/incorrect answers of our quizzes), or feedback was vague (response papers, for example).",
                "It was very clear what work we had to complete and by when. The Ed Discussion was also very helpful in getting our questions answered.",
                "Only strengths for this class!!! It was wonderfully organized, and Professor Gendron is an amazing lecturer and a really warm and understanding person. She makes the course extremely engaging and geared towards facilitating student learning. This was definitely my favorite course of the semester.",
                "Strengths: The material was fascinating and presented in a broad overview but very understandable way.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too much work with not enough feedback. Assignments included weekly quizzes (out of 10) which we never got to see what we got wrong; 4 essays that were graded weirdly, and, personally, I do not think very well; and 2 exams also which we never got to see what we got wrong and what was the correct answer. The quizzes were okay in making sure we kept up with the course but even if you got a few quizzes with just 1 wrong (9/10) that was already a few 90% which brought down the grade. And god forbid if you got even just one quiz with more than 1 wrong. Also, I do not think I learned anything from taking the quizzes because I could not learn from my mistakes and see what I had gotten wrong. The same goes for the midterm. Additionally, communication on Ed was a little lacking especially in time-sensitive cases from my experience although generally Ed was a good resource.",
                "Professor Gendron was definitely a huge strength for this class. I really liked the lecture content and I though that the textbook reading really enhanced the lecture. The one weakness of this course was that the lectures were a bit long and covered a lot of content per lecture."

As someone outside of the Eastern Time zone, not all office hours were particularly accessible.",

                "I loved that most of the readings were online. I also loved that Dr. Gendron's Powerpoints were super interactive; online school made focusing on long lectures very difficult for me, but the interactive elements kept me engaged. The lecture format was also consistent every week, which provided me with a nice routine for this class. Online classes are already uncertain enough, but some of my other classes simply didn't establish a routine that would have helped students stay engaged.

As long as people were communicative with them, they were very understanding and would work with you.",

As a psych major it was just a bit redundant with my other classes who focus on the same topics in greater detail so i personally found it a bit dull, but if i have taken it as a freshman or sophomore i would have been much more engaged",

                "It's a bit more work than I'd like from a gut class but the material is easy enough that it was definitely manageable as a 5th class. It was my first psych class at Yale so I'd recommend it for anybody who wants to get their toes wet into the field of psychology",

                "Yes; it goes through all the basic concepts in psychology and helps you get a better grasp on why we might think a certain way. I think it's important for everyone to have a little bit of understanding about psychology of the human mind so we can be better people.",

                "Yes. It is a great way to survey a subsection of the very broad discipline of psychology. It'll help you learn if psych is interesting for you and if you like working with research, or if you prefer the theory/concepts. Professor is great and the workload and assessments are extremely fair, if not generous, and manageable.",

                "Definitely! One of my favorite classes at Yale so far. It was fun, interesting, engaging, and not too hard. Also Dr. Gendron is a gem of a professor. Would totally recommend. Also, you do NOT need intro psych or AP Psych for this class. This is very much an intro psych class.",

                "Definitely! It gives a lot of useful and relevant insight on information that can be regularly applied outside of the classroom which I found refreshing. Also, it was a low stakes environment to explore these concepts and allow yourself to apply them to your own life.",
                "Yes! I learned so much and especially during this covid-19 time, studying social psychology was very helpful.",

                "I would recommend this course to other students; it's a good survey course for those interested in social psychology or psychology more generally who would like to learn a little about a lot. But, given there are a fair number of little assignments to remember, I would probably only recommend to students who have a specific interest in the field rather than as just a fun, convenient course to take for fun/to shake things up.",
                "Yes! The professor is great and you learn cool concepts that are practical in the real world.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students. It is taught very well and covers fascinating topics.",
                "Yes, I would because the social psychology concepts were very interesting.",
                "Yes I would. Its a great course even if you havent engaged with psychology in an educational setting in the past.",
                "It depends. I would recommend the course because the content was very intriguing and highly useful, but the inconsistent grading is unfair for the students and could harm their grades and future prospects.",
                "Yes!",
                "If you need it as a requirement, genuinely want to learn about very basic social psychology, or are looking for a total gut (unfortunately).",

But I would recommend this, especially if you're a psychology (or something related like cog-sci) major, or if you're looking for a psych class that's somewhat interesting without too much work.",

                "Yes! This class is a wonderful introduction to social psychology. You will leave with a better understanding of not only how and why greater society thinks/acts in certain ways, but also with a more comprehensive understanding of how you as an individual function psychologically. The course workload is not too heavy and the material is as interesting as it is applicable to the (many) issues happening around the world today.",
                "Yes! The material is very interesting and applicable to everyday life. The assignments are also pretty fun and a good way to gauge understanding. All the TAs and Professor Gendron are incredibly invested and understanding. Would highly recommend!",
                "Yes! Professor Gendron is amazing and social psychology is extremely relevant no matter your major",
                "Nope, the professor and TAs dont rlly care about grading",
                "Absolutely! Maria Gendron is incredibly kind, patient, and understanding. The material itself isn't too challenging. If you pay attention during lectures, you'll definitely do well in class. In addition, I found the material incredibly fascinating and it was interesting being able to relate the content to my own personal life.",
                "I would recommend this course to everyone. All the concepts are very relevant and applicable to life.",
                "Absolutely! If you aren't a fan of how broad the intro to psych class is, this class really hones in on the field of social psych, which is broad enough to include many subjects but narrower than tackling the whole field of psychology in one semester. This class took my favorite parts of the intro to psych class and expanded on them.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students if they feel that they are interested in psychology and particularly if they would like to learn more about how interactions between people affect our behavior. They say if is recommended to take this class with another intro pscyhology class but it was my first psychology class and all the concepts were explained as if they were new so I never felt like I was behind others.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think the material is interesting to most people and the amount of different topics in society covered allow for a broad introduction to the field of social psychology. The workload is not as bad as some other classes and the amount of resources available if students need help is nice along with the professor and TAs being readily available to help.",
                "If you are interested in psychology and how individuals understand the world around them, take this course! The teaching staff is great and you will think a ton about what you learn.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone even remotely interested in psychology. Most of the topics we learn about in this course is applicable to your daily life, and the content is super interesting to think about.",
                "Dr. Gendron taught the course very well! I was able to learn about different theories and studies which I would relate to the real world. The class is very engaging in making you apply and consider the studies of our social behavior.",
                "Absolutely!!! Its an amazing class, and Professor Gendron is a wonderful lecturer and a really warm and understanding person. I had a lot of fun in this class, and all of the concepts I learned were absolutely fascinating.",
                "Yes, if only because Maria Gendron is a great person and professor as well as the actual material of the class is great.",
                "Yes! I thought is was super interesting.",
                "Eh? The content is very interesting, especially since the professor connects concepts to current issues and research. The professor is very kind and thoughtful (often pushing back or allowing more time for assignments after some of the tragedies that occurred this semester). However, the professor is not the most engaging -- she speaks very slow and very monotone -- so it's easy to zoom out, especially when this course will be in-person with no x2 play option. There are weekly quizzes and quite a lot of papers, but assignments are mostly short and graded easily. Not a total gut, but interesting content (particularly if you already like psych or understanding social interactions) with a lighter course load in terms of grading, but not in the number of assignments."
