                "Strength was definitely Prof. McGowan. He was a great introductory professor and I honestly wish I had taken this course earlier. I think it is very geared towards first years and is extremely accommodating to everyone's schedules. Our class did not meet during reading week but was initially supposed to. I think this is something that could be eliminated as it was definitely not necessary.",
                "Strengths are definitely the professor, Prof. McGowan! He is a wonderful critic and his advice and facilitated classroom discussions were all incredibly helpful. Another strength is that he required office hours meetings after every first draft, rather than just a few like other 120 courses, which made it so much easier to edit the final copy. I really loved that there was a consistently low workload, where you always know what's due and all the classes are tailored to crafting the particular type of essay. I really can't think of any weaknesses!",
                "I liked the layout of this class where we did readings and then discussed in class. This was very cool for me because everyone in the class had very interesting things to say about the readings.\r\n\r\nI think that the weeks when we did workshopping felt a little bit chaotic, and I also had trouble receiving feedback from peers because there was just so much of it.",
                "Strength was that we were able to really push our work further through the revision process. Weakness was that we spent a lot of time workshopping.",
                "A strength of the course was the abundance of feedback received from not only the professor but the other students as well. One weakness, I think was the time schedule. At moments there was a very quick turn around from when we needed to turn in an essay and provide feedback for three other essays.",
                "Incredible discussions and teaching. It would be nice to have more student-to-student feedback since we only peer reviewed two of each other's essays throughout the year, but I received great feedback from the professor."

                "Yes, especially if you are a first-year or sophomore. This is a great, chill, introductory course into creative writing and accepts people with all backgrounds in writing. Especially with Professor McGowan, the class time will go by fast and it is a great 9 am course to take.",
                "Absolutely!!!! 120 is a wonderful course that will teach you to hone your writing skills and craft a written piece that conveys exactly the tone you want. I initially took this course for a writing credit, but ended up falling back in love with writing!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I was able to develop my writing skills in a fun way that also allowed me to write about what I wanted to write about.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I know many students have experience writing the argumentative or regular academic essay, but creative writing is often a style that many of us never get to experience. This course not only allows students to explore their imagination and creativity but also learn about themselves through their writing.",
                "Absolutely. You get the most out of Yale by taking humanities courses, and this course is no exception. You'll learn to read and write like a world-class scholar.",
                "I loved this class and think it is great for younger undergraduates who want to take an english class at Yale. You learn a lot about personal narratives which could be a great segway in the future for writing pieces about yourself or your experiences."
