    "How to do close-reading;how to do citation properly; what is MLA; how to write introduction and conclusion. There are so many useful skills that I learnt through this summer that I can't list them all. I am grateful for what Professor Im has taught us.",
    "I learned a lot of general writing skills that will be helpful throughout my final year at Yale and beyond. In addition, I became more comfortable with essays in general. I had never written a research paper in college that was not scientific in nature, but this course taught me how to tackle them with relative ease.",
    "Learned how to write clearly and effectively. Readings were very insightful and interesting.",
    "I learned a lot about academic writing and how to write a research paper. There are so many skills, for example, citation styles teaching during the course."

   "comments": [
    "We have lots of class discussion and group work which I think is the strength of this course. I hope there would be more seminars than question-answer discussion.",
    "Being in the summer, this course was very constricted. I am sure I would have benefited more had there been more time to explore readings and topics to write about before diving into essays. Unfortunately, this is just the nature of summer classes and I am not certain that this can be fixed.",
    "While it was fast paced, I found the coursework to be pretty engaging, and the essays were actually pretty fun to write. The instructor is also really smart and provides excellent feedback on essays."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would. Professor Im is an excellent teacher who has patience and passions for what she teaches. Also, I really learnt writing skills that would not be taught is high school (especially not Chinese high schools) but necessary for college.",
    "I really enjoyed the material covered in this 114 section and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in the perception of pain, beauty, or anything having to do with the body. At first, I was skeptical, but I quickly grew to enjoy the topic; I found it quite relevant to the medical field.",
    "Wholeheartedly; it was a very engaging and enjoyable class and I learned a lot about the complicated politics surrounding the body, while improving my writing.",
    "Yes, absolutely! This course improves my both reading and writing skills so much! Although it requires a great amount of effort, everything turns out to be worth it"
