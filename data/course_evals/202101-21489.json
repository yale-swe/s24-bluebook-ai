I wish, though, that there was more student engagement encouraged to make the class more interactive. Also, there were no pre-class assignments in the second half of the semester which made in-class time less productive. I completely support the flipped classroom, so preparing before class was really helpful and I hope the instructors can do more to promote that out-of-class learning."
