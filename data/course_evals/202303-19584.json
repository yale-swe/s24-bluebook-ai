                "I learned a lot of biophysics in this course, specifically I learned about how molecules move and was able to intersect concepts I've learned in all of the introductory science courses I've taken previous and concurrently. For instance, I learned a lot about the connections between biochemistry and physics. Instead of learning general biochemistry principles about kinetics, I was learning why and how these principles were happening. Instead of only learning about specific principles, this course has taught me to think about these phenomenons from a different perspective: a physical perspective.",

                "Practical knowledge about how biochemistry research is done.",
                "I developed a deeper understanding of some of the basic concepts taught to me in other classes such as diffusion. I also learned a lot of new concepts in the course that underlies many topics covered in other courses. Lastly, I learned a lot about the experimental techniques that I may use in my career.",
                "I learned many fundamental principles of biophysics and spectroscopy. I also learned how to better conceptualize ideas such as kinetics and equilibrium.",
                "I learned a lot of important lessons and techniques in the field of biophysics that were especially helpful to keep in mind while concurrently taking MB&B 300, as I feel that 275 gave me a more nuanced/research-focused view of certain subjects like kinetics or biophysical techniques.",

            "comments": [
                "This course has done an excellent job creating a positive learning environment, which therefore allows for better student engagement. The course is well-organized and it effectively covers a lot of material. Having multiple professors instruct the course was a major strength as well. The only weakness is the order in which material is presented. At times, it felt random with little connection to previously discussed content. There was a lack of flow to the course.",
                "The strength of this course is that there are lots of resources. The peer tutors that led my discussion section held peer tutoring office hours that I went to weekly to better understand the course concepts as well as support on the weekly problem sets. Additionally, there were a ton of useful material and practice problems given in discussion and by the other TAs that were very useful and applicable on the actual exams. The exams were also all fair game and they were not made to trick students which I cannot say the same about other courses taught at Yale. A weakness of the course was the homework on Mathematica. As someone with no background in coding, the coding on Mathematica was very difficult as a student with no background in this. Although, this year, I found the peer tutors to be super helpful because they explained the basics of coding for me which I found very useful. Additionally, another weakness would be sometimes the lectures were difficult to engage with, but overall the course was very engaging and I am very grateful for taking this course because it connected the loose ends in various courses.",
                "Strengths: the first few units were interesting and engaging, and appeared to apply to real-life scientific questions\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of the program units (such as mathematica) were unhelpful. We had to code on mathematica despite not having any or little instruction on how to code. Would be better if we were given an in-class demo of coding basics",
                "The pacing can differ wildly, especially between the lectures of the two different instructors. But they are both effective and engaging lecturers.",
                "Some problem set questions were poorly phrased such that the only way to solve them is to plug numbers into equations while completely disregarding that it does not make sense and in fact is wrong, yet it would get you the \"right\" answer. That does not facilitate real learning and doesn't train any skills.",
                "This class should NOT have a required section. It was entirely unnecessary for my success in this course and was not an environment where I met/interacted with many new students. Optional section or just more office hours would be helpful for students who need it, but requiring section attendance was a major waste of my time. Most of the material in this class, particularly the second half, can be easily learned from the slides alone.",
                "The lectures included a lot of theory but practically no examples or problems, which made the problem sets much more difficult than they needed to be.",
                "This course does an incredible job of teaching difficult concepts that are not very intuitive. It also does a good job of balancing topics from theoretical to experimental topics. I also really liked how the course was structured from the grading to the exams as I thought the course was very fair.",
                "I enjoyed the psets and the lecture style overall. I thought some of the later lectures were a little bit monotonous however.",
                "The content of this course was fascinating but I felt myself less interested in the sections that were more just going through different techniques in biophysics research. Although I know that these topics are very important, the second half of the course sometimes just felt like different topiocs getting thrown at me one after another with little connection between them (whereas the first half of the course felt like it was building off of itself).",
                "Strengths: Instructors were amazing. Their lecture style was so engaging, and they broke down the content in an organized manner. They incorporated interactive activities, which are so rare to see in lecture classes, and were clearly very passionate about both teaching and biophysics. The content itself was also extremely useful, and my only regret is not taking this class earlier.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt the lectures could linger too long on simpler concepts sometimes, though I can see how they are useful in building up the basics. For instance, I felt we spent quite a long time on the idea behind simple diffusion. Also, the lecture content and the problem sets were very different at times, as the problem sets focused on calculations using equations that sometimes were not presented in the lecture. Also, if you have no coding experience, the Mathematica portion will take a long time to figure out.",
                "The strengths of the course included the professors. Both Professor De La Cruz and Professor Didychuk were very engaging. Their lectures were well organized and complimented each other, they were sincerely invested in the students' learning experiences, and always willing to support students.",
                "Amazing course! Loved every second of it",
                "Lectures were excellent (and particularly entertaining in the case of Prof. De La Cruz's lectures) and the combination of engaging lectures, psets, and discussion sections helped students develop an intuition (aka \"molecular empathy\") for diffusion and equilibrium binding (Adair's equation) and build a foundation for advanced topics like statistical thermodynamics. Especially in the first half of the course, I felt that we sometimes moved through material rather slowly. Although the instructors made a conscious effort to highlight what we needed to know for exams, there were times when concepts were dumbed down (since this isn't a 400+ elective) to the point that it wasn't quite clear what the main takeaways were. Having a second midterm instead of a cumulative final and a last pset to cover the fluorescence material helped reduce end-of-semester stress. The teaching team was great, and discussion sections and office hours were helpful for working through practice problems and clearing up conceptual questions. With regards to teaching, I wish that (1) the instructors themselves would have held occasional office hours during their half of the course and that (2) discussion section leaders would have used the same set of slides and practice exercises. That being said, the main weakness of the course is in my opinion the use of Mathematica -- something like MatLab would probably be more practical, and most pset problems involving Mathematica were nearly impossible to do without going to office hours, even though I have experience programming in other languages.",
                "This course was my first introduction to the MB&B major, and it was definitely a necessary foundation. I had nothing more than a vague idea of what exactly molecular biophysics was, but this course took that head on, broke it down, and then built it up in connection with the scientific fields I was more familiar with. It felt like the glue between the seemingly disparate topics I had covered so far in biology, chemistry, and physics, and it was satisfying to see them all come together in a concrete way. \r\n\r\nThe problem sets were mostly very fair and acted as a good review of lecture content where I otherwise may have gotten lost, which I felt in the few weeks when we didn't have any. The Mathematica, however, was irritating and time-intensive and ultimately left me frustrated and without any sense of having learned something. I feel like there must be better ways of showing us how to model without all the superfluous functions we had to learn to get to that point. Peer tutor hours could be a bit sparse but at the end of the semester once I could start attending I found them very helpful."

I took this course after having taken general chemistry, organic chemistry, and physics and I took it with biochemistry. I found it very useful in connecting the prior classes I've taken. I found it very useful because it examined biological phenomenons from a physical viewpoint of molecules. If you are interested in chemistry and physics, I would strongly suggest taking this course because it applies these concepts to biology!",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students, particularly MB&B majors and those wanting to go into research. I felt that it introduced biophysics to me at the perfect level and gave a very application-centered view of biophysics.",

The course had many resources including the peer tutors and TAs who were always available to offer support and answer questions.",
                "Yes, although I acknowledge that it may not interest everybody",
                "In my opinion, this course is a cornerstone of the MB&B major and distinguishes MB&B from MCDB for example, so I would strongly recommend taking it if you have an interest in MB&B. This course felt more chemistry/physics heavy than biology heavy to me, and the material taught is unique among undergraduate courses and helps lay a foundation to classes like thermodynamics and p-chem and MB&B electives. If you intend to take both MB&B 275 and 300, I would highly recommend taking them concurrently since they offer complementary perspectives on certain topics.",
                "This is a major course, so it is most likely necessary for you if you are considering MB&B. I wouldn't say this is a weed-out course, but it definitely acts as a primer to the major and gives you a good indication of what topics you will be pursuing if you continue. It was a very wide overview, but we also dedicated a lot of time to each topic we covered and gave them all a very thorough review. In that sense, it could feel quite niche at times, but this course definitely prepared me for the type of advanced learning I will encounter more and more often in my academic career. It's also not too difficult in workload, so I think it would be useful and informative for anyone who is even slightly considering this major."
