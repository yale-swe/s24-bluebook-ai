                "Strengths: prof jess has so much experience, humor, connections to amazing guests, and just good stories; writing a poem almost every week feels like both a lot and also not too heavy, we stopped doing as many readings and focused more on writing Weaknesses: communication with the professor can be challenging at times, need to be willing to flow with it,  he isn't mean about your writing but hes also not going to hype you up or give you excessive feedback. I did find most of his feedback useful!",
                "Weaknesses: almost no structure, low communication on assignments or grade expectations, etc. However, it was an exceedingly delightful class and gave us the freedom to practice poetic thinking \/ writing without strain.",
                "Weaknesses: Professor Jess is incredibly unorganized. He did not have a Canvas for the class until the 4th week of the semester, and it was clear that he did not know how to use Canvas or take the time to learn it. I also did not feel challenged by the class content or assignments, so I felt like a grew very little, if at all, in my poetry writing this semester, which is so disappointing and makes me wish I took a different class. Jess also provides little feedback on assignments (you really have to hound him for it) and is poor at email communication. He also did not try hard at all to learn any students name, and by the end of the semester, he could only name 3\/11 of us correctly.\r\n\r\nStrengths: As a Pulitzer winner and amazing poet, Jess sometimes gives good advice on writing and research. He also knows other major writers and organizations, so we had a few guest speakers come in throughout the semester. Lastly, Professor Jess is so unorganized that there ended up being barely any work assigned during the last half of the semester, so the class was easy.",
                "This was overall an amazing class. I was at times confused about the expectations\/the assignments because they seemed to differ from the syllabus, but I learned so much from my classmates and Prof. Jess.",
                "This course could benefit from more structure\/fidelity to the reading schedule on the syllabus. As well as a more structured approach to in class feedback for student's poems."

If you're someone who stresses out a lot about deadlines and not having information and not being able to contact the professor, maybe don't take it. But the opportunity to work with this professor in this class environment is quite unique and unlike many creative writing classes at Yale and you really feel like a writer",

                "Unfortunately, no. It is an easy class and A, but if you want to grow and be challenged as a writer, you will be severely disappointed. Look elsewhere!"
