                "I gained insight into the world of creative design and how it applies to the web development process.",
                "This course helped me to learn how to code in CSS and HTML, a little javascript, and how to use them in a way that aided our designs. The assignments and newsletter project really helped make me conscious of the decisions I was making, so that I could create a design that fit with the goal we had in mind. I also realized that design does not only apply to magazines and other paper media, but also to the web.",
                "Ability to build a website using html and css",
                "Learned HTML and CSS and was introduced to Javascript in regards to website creation. Also learned to think critically about the internet and its inception and the history of web design.",

                "Strengths: Many DIY works and many thoughts inspired during the course, and discussions communicate useful informations with each other, therefore learning mutually and get to progress better. The final works of everyone is impressive for a one-month-change.",
                "One strength was that it was very flexible. For the most part, you were allowed to work at your own pace. This subsequently furthered one's engagement with the course content.",
                "I'm really glad with how much we were able to learn and do things on our own in just a matter of 5 weeks. I would say there is a learning curve that everyone has to go through, and it may take longer for some, but I think we learned the right amount  and kind of material given the time constraint. I would say though that this course does spend a lot of time learning how to code, so I feel like it doesn't really get as deep into the design aspect of the course which isn't necessarily a negative depending on what the student taking the class is looking for.  Although when I was working on our assignments and project, I often had to do some things that weren't very systematic, so I sometimes thought I was doing something wrong or coding haphazardly, but I'm not sure if that's just how it is or if there's a certain way to do things. Even though this class was virtual, I think that if this class was in-person, it would definitely be more enjoyable, and our class could get to know each other better.",
                "Lectures could be shorter",
                "Perfectly paced course. Love how it was taught. Every homework assignment served a clear purpose inn preparing us not only for the final project, but to exercise skills and technique we learned in class."

                "Yes, if any form of programming is at least not repugnant for her. Because its in my opinion the rather simple programming skill yet rather more useful in the short term than C++\/Java\/others. Also, building a website is actually a persons review on his\/her personality and discover where his\/her interest really lays. A quiet person can build a quiet website and one who likes to have many hobbies will in turn try to put a lot on his\/her website. Its like a monologue and really very healing to take this course and dive in the construction for your little home in this grand digital world.",

Not only do you get the opportunity to do some creative design (which is a lot of fun), but you also get to learn about web development, website deployment, and the internet in general - all of which are of paramount importance in today's day and age.",
                "Yes absolutely if you're interested in website design and want to learn how to build one on your own. I wasn't really sure what to expect coming into the class, but I really enjoyed it! I do think that you get out of it as much as you put into, and since it's a summer class I would encourage you to do a lot that you can with the little time you have. Also I think that since the medium is the web, I enjoyed it more because it allowed us to use animation and add more features than with designing for other mediums, and Matt is a great professor. He really tries to share his interest in web design and is very helpful and accommodating.",
                "Take this course if you're not familiar with basic website development\/want to be more intentional in how you design a website.",
                "Absolutely. I came in with no web design experience and very minimal coding experience. I can confidently use all the skills I learned to create websites and think critically about web design.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn to build webpages, Matt is also very kind and patient, so you can come in knowing nothing."
