                "I developed the language acquisition skills to hold basic introductory conversations in Japanese, including self-introductions, navigation, family structures, basic adjectives, and simple compound constructions. I also learned the hiragana and katakana written alphabets and over 60 kanji characters.",
                "We learned a strong amount of introductory conversational Japanese. We also focused a lot on the Japanese pitch accent, which was extremely educational and helpful for producing authentic sounding Japanese.",
                "This course taught me the fundamentals of the Japanese language, such as hiragana, katakana, and 40+ kanji. We heavily focused on dialogue and conversation, so a lot of what we learned was extensible into the real world. We started from learning basic words such as greetings, and quickly moved up to active verbs and complex conjunction phrases. I specifically enjoyed and valued learning pitch accent patterns, as that is rarely taught in language courses."

                "Strengths: Variety of learning material; classroom conducive for community-building; great instructor",
                "We learn a lot by having class everyday and because it's a small class, each student gets a lot of attention from the instructor",
                "I was very impressed by the thoughtful consideration by which this course was designed and executed. It was an intensive course, but each assignment and project contributed to the learning environment of the class.",
                "I think this course is fantastic in just about every way. I have pretty much no complaints with the course at all.",
                "Strengths: My study schedule for this course was very consistent. I believe the structure of the course, with lesson quizzes every other week and class every day, forced me to study regularly and consistently. Therefore, it was easy to study for this course. I also believed I was especially strong at kanji and pitch accent patterns.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, I would fall behind schedule with content. Due to the fast paced nature of the course, one missed day could turn into a big problem."

                "Yes! I came into this course with high school background in Japanese. I had not taken Japanese in almost 4 years and I thought the class was a great refresher. Despite being in L1, this class definitely covers a lot of ground and you could hold an extensive conversation after just one semester.",
                "YES, great professor and great course- meets everyday but so worth it!",
                "Yes, this is an excellent course for Japanese language acquisition. The course workload is intensive, but well-worth the efforts.",
                "Yes. I think that if someone wants to get into learning Japanese that this course is fantastic!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to everyone who is driven and motivated to study Japanese! The course is extremely well structured and planned out, and Nishimura-sensei is fantastic at teaching. However, it was extremely difficult and, at times, unforgiving of absences or emergencies. The course moves really fast."
