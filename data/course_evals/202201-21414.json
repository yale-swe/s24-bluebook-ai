                "I learned how to write effectively and clearly. The course has increased my confidence in my own writing and taught me I can enjoy writing. It has taught me how to write in different genres.",
                "Interesting readings about Web3, mental wellness apps, etc. Enjoyed reading \"Empire of Pain.\" Cool guest speakers from different areas of the finance \/ entrepreneurship spaces, from an investigative journalist to a venture capitalist to a founder of a private equity practice. And of course, completed interesting, open-ended writing assignments that allowed me to exercise creativity. Environment of the class was open and relaxed.",
                "I learned a ton of about writing and non-traditional\/non-academic forms of writing (white paper, case study, creative nonfiction) that are popular in finance and adjacent fields that are not normally discussed in an English class where the focus is on literature. Each of these unites required a different tone in the writing style and ways of incorporating information. There was also a lot of discussion of the form in this writing (bullet points, spacing, etc.) that is often overlooked in academic writing because we are so used to following a standard format.\r\n\r\nWe also conducted a lot of interviews with professionals in finance fields, which provided an excellent opportunity to learn more about networking and speaking with people about their job experiences. I know networking gets a bad image, but meeting people and making connections is so critical to success in any field. It is an important skill to develop, especially in college as we prepare to enter \"the real world\"",
                "This course greatly improved my ability to write. I had taken ENGL 120 my freshman year, and I found ENGL 121, specifically in finance, to be a very practical addition for my career. Since I am working in investment banking this summer and potentially post-graduation, it was helpful to analyze financial documents, but more importantly to improve the clarity of my writing. I learned how to write more concisely and accurately, and think that I will take this skill with me into my professional life.",
                "I improved my skills in writing.",
                "This course definitely changed the way I approach writing in most of not all circumstances. Most of all this class taught me the importance of writing concisely and how to do that in most instances.",
                "I developed a taste for concise writing.",
                "I improved my writing skills by drafting a business case, a white paper, an investment memo, and a journalistic narrative. Through discussing the class reading \"Empires of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty,\" I gained insights on the elements of creative writing."

            "comments": [
                "This course was taught really well. I do wish that we could have done the investment memo unit.",
                "Strengths: we spent so much time on the writing process I really enjoyed it. Having outside speakers come in was really interesting as well. All of the material was also RELEVANT. Even though Professor Klemann has taught this course before, it is obvious that she updates the syllabus every year to account for new trends and ideas. Most of the non-academic writings we did were published since she had last taught this course with some even being published at the start of this year. That made it interesting and exciting. I also think Professor Klemann teaches writing very well. She encourages and actually rewards students for taking risks in their writing even if they do not work out.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think this course has any real weaknesses. I think one area of improvement could be incorporating student interest \/ discussion more? This may not be possible because it is a writing course, but a lot of the people in the course were very interesting and studying economics \/ going into finance. I would have appreciated hearing more about their individual experiences with finance \/ internships\/ course interests.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. Coming to class was always exciting because we did a variety of activities, from analyzing each others' writing, to writing workshops, to discussing a reading. I felt that I got to know my classmates and professor well by the end of the semester, which was important because I learned from all of them as I repeatedly edited my writing. While I appreciated the breadth of topics that we wrote and particularly enjoyed my final paper at the end of the semester, an interview, my only suggestion would be that the class be slightly more finance focused. I learned a lot about writing but did not gain a lot of new financial knowledge, which was fine by me. I also really enjoyed the various guest speakers that Professor Klemann brought in throughout the semester, and loved the book that she assigned, Empire of Pain.",
                "I think it is a very well taught and well organised course",
                "The course is very well organized to facilitate learning. Every topic seems to have helpful examples for easy understanding. Professor Klemann was readily available to answer questions and to chat outside of class."

                "Yes. This course is amazing. You will learn how to write for your job and yourself. Great course, highly recommend it and the professor is the best.",
                "A relaxed and interesting writing course that isn't as finance-focused as the course name suggests. I'm a STEM student who spends all day in lecture & completing problem sets, so I welcomed the time spent doing readings and exercising creativity for the writing assignments.",
                "If you are interested in the course themes, ABSOLUTELY YES! It is probably one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. It is organized so well and so genuinely interesting. I think the difficulty from this course emerges because you become so engrossed in the material that you force yourself to think critically about all these writing and style aspects that you would overlook in a standard English class.\r\n\r\nI could not recommend this course more to anyone.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was practical but also fun, and if the student is interested in finance, the course, including the guest speakers, will provide them with relevant exposure to topics that they will see in their career. The readings were engaging and useful, and I was proud of the writing that I produced this semester.",
                "Yes, taking the class has improved my writing and ability to write in different genres and situations.",
                "Definitely. One of my favourite classes taken at Yale.",
                "Yes, I found this to be a great course to discuss the social issues raised in the financial world with a group of students aware of the problems with capitalism, but who are also mostly entering financial fields. The result was a thoughtful and evenhanded discussion.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to improve their writing skills. Also, if you love discussions surrounding business cases, this is a fantastic course to take."
