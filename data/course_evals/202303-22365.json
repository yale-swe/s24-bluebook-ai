The biggest insight I took away was the necessity to go over whole topics on your own or else you will miss key concepts that will be covered on both psets and exams.",

                "The exams are by far the greatest weakness of this course. They are often unexpectedly difficult and demand a conceptual knowledge of the topics on another level from the problem sets -- the problem sets really shouldn't be harder than the exams. That being said, the pre-class \"Explores\" were very helpful and I have not seen them in other courses at Yale. It's nice to know the details of what will be covered before you even arrive in class.",
                "The Canvas explorations were very helpful, but the in-person teaching was not very engaging, at least in my case.",
                "The strengths of this course are the pre-class explorations/quizzes, the online videos, the organization, the peer tutors, the office hours, and the helpful outside resources. The weakness of this course is that it does not prepare you well for the tests and exams. The exam questions are almost always more difficult than anything we're ever exposed to in the course (online questions, PSETs, and class exercises).",
                "The strength of this course was the quality of a couple of the peer tutors in aiding student learning, often more than professors. The weaknesses of this course were its lack of communication, it's inability to consistently post psets early enough, and its lack of good professors that can at least disclose the necessary topics we'll need to cover on our own to be successful on the exam. Most of this can be improved with better communication, stricter guidelines for professors, and a curve to alleviate the stress of students who are simply trying to learn under such poor guidance.",
                "The lessons often seemed to lack context, and the problems we went over in class did not correspond well to the problem sets or exams. The online explorations were set to match the desired pace of the class, not the actual pace, so they were utterly unhelpful once we got a single lesson behind. I often received no feedback on incorrect problem set answers.",
                "My strengths were the problem sets and being on top of all the work. My weaknesses were midterm preparations.",
                "More individualized.",
                "The staff was extremely well organized, everything was very clear and laid out.",
                "A centralised note system would help if class missed/not understood",
                "The Math 115 course is not designed to really teach students who have never learnt Calc II before, but rather those who have already taken Calc II, there is not enough focus or guidance given to students when learning the material, but rather just a lecture and problem sets where the student is expected to understand the material perfectly off the bat. I think this is problematic when thinking about learning a new skill, and if more explanation was offered, not even at the expense of time, then I feel that a lot more students would enjoy and do better in this course."

                "Probably not, I felt that much of the topics were rushed and were not always taught super well.",
