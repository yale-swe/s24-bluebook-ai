    "I learned about important film concepts and the role of film in shaping and responding to memory.",
    "Thinking about films critically in their historical and economic contexts.",
    "I learned how German filmmakers dealt with their difficult history after the fall of the 3rd Reich, including many stages of grieving and denial. I learned a bit about the actual history of the 3rd Reich and the immediate aftermath but even more about how individuals dealt with it and how the culture dealt with it as a whole. I learned a lot about the impact cinema can have in shaping opinion and culture, and as a filmmaker how you can craft political statements into your work. As a viewer, I learned how to see through some rhetoric to think more critically about what the film is saying.",
    "I gained a thorough understanding of the intersection of ethics, history, and film. It transformed my perception of film, helping me see the subtle (sometimes explicit) ways in which narrative films act as a vehicle for politics and ideology.",
    "An understanding of post-war German socioeconomic and film history, as well as a grasp on basic film terms and analysis techniques"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: well-taught; small setting; plenty of opportunities to share your thoughts and respectfully disagree; workload was manageable\r\nWeaknesses: With such a small class, it might have been helpful to present on one more article of criticism",
    "Very engaging class environment, helped both by small numbers and efforts made by the professor to encourage participation.",
    "The course is excellent in organization. The presentation on a film and on an article are very good projects and the reading responses are helpful. Professor Hagens is the jewel of this course, he knows so much about the subject and is quite eloquent. He is also from Germany and can speak from personal experience at some points, which is invaluable. He has selected excellent films and very informative readings.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I would change is swapping out Rosenstrasse and\/or Sophie Scholl for other films since I didn't find them nearly as compelling or interesting as the rest, but I recognize the importance of including a Von Trotta film and films with female protagonists. If there are other options, Hagens would know.\r\n\r\nI also think there might be a little too much reading at some points, but I only say this because at points it was repetitive. I would not have Professor Hagens choose between a history reading and a breakdown of the film, since these are both essential parts of understanding the films.",
    "STRENGTHS: Professor Hagens is so kind and an amazing seminar leader. The structure of the course is incredible: You turn in one, 2-page film response every week and by the end of the semester when everyone else is stressing out about final essays, the students of this course are done. There is more work, but it is not stress-inducing. Watching the films was informative and, dare I say, fun. The content is dark but I appreciate any chance to justify movie-watching during the week. Hagens also has great taste in picking readings and I learned way more about memory studies and how memory impacts film and history than I thought I would. I loved this course. There were no weaknesses!",
    "Strengths: intriguing course topic; good depth in the list of films; plenty of additional readings that cater to all levels of interest\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the class period felt like it was a little too long and we were dragging on by the end"

    "I certainly would recommend this course to another student. Not only was the workload manageable, the topic was extremely interesting. I felt as if I learned a great deal about German history, filmmaking in general, and memory.",
    "Yes, but especially so if interested in history or film studies.",
    "Absolutely! Hagens is an incredible professor and you will learn a great deal from him. This was especially beneficial for us this semester, since there were only 5 students, but I imagine it would still be wonderful with a larger class. I wasn't particularly interested in German or Germany when I signed up to take it but as a lover of film and history and film history it was easy to become engrossed.",
    "Yes! Please take this course! It will completely change how you think about the power of film and how any depiction of history is shaped by memory and packed with ethical implications. This course ties together film, philosophy, history, and memory studies in the most amazing way. And the workload isn't that bad! It's a perfect structure that I wish more professors adopted. If you love movies and care about how we remember our past, take this course!",
    "I would recommend this course to anybody interested in European post-WWII history, especially those who are curious to view it from a unique angle like film. While this course is a film analysis course, the topic is specialized, so I would not recommend it to people looking to strictly build a film analysis foundation. People should take this course if they're interested in post-WWII era Germany and the socioeconomic complications it faced"
