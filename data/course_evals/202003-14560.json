                "This course was incredible! I learned so much about the built environment and how the world around me\/current day has been influenced by the past. I gained a better sense of how to look around me and see history versus passively taking in my surroundings. And through the project, I explored an area that I had never thought about pursuing before.\r\n\r\nHaving an in person option was also a lifesaver this semester. It got me up and out of my house\/isolation depression. Elihu hosted a walking tour of New Haven and I had the most fun that I've had at all during the semester.\r\n\r\nProf\/TA's always made themselves available to students when needed. They were good at stimulating discussion and I liked how they responded to student comments.\r\n\r\nNo negative feedback to give!",
                "Strengths: Professor Rubin and the teaching team's strong passion and enthusiasm for the course, the variety of speakers, and the open ended-ness of the assignments\r\nWeaknesses: going overtime often and sometimes the reading not correlating with the live discussion",
                "Professor Rubin is very passionate and knowledgable about the information he teaches which makes the class very fun and engaging for the students. Professor Rubin also invited lots of guest to class who have done so very interesting and important work so it was very nice being able to get to hear directly from them about their work. One weakness though was the structure of the class. Lots of time we would fall behind and all the assignments due dates ended up being pushed back a couple weeks because we were so behind.",
                "This is a phenomenal course. The strengths are the pace, material, guests, assignments, and professor. Prof Rubin was very understanding about our reading load and workload and tailored the class accordingly while ensuring that we were fully engaging with the material. This was by far my favorite class taken so far at Yale.",
                "Elihu cares about his students, also the scrapbook is a fun way to do the assignments.",
                "I loved the unique structure of this course! For nearly every lecture, we had a guest speak about their specific expertise in urban themes. Furthermore, we got to be extremely creative and create a scrapbook throughout the semester. The group project allowed us to explore a topic that we were particularly interested in and was a great way to end the semester.",

The diverse array of speakers that Prof Rubin brought in to speak during each class period always provided unique and interesting perspectives. \r\nWeaknesses: I think an important part of Urban Studies the planning \/ politics of cities which was touched on for sure but I would have liked to see more of it.",
                "Very engaging, great guests, interesting forms of assessments.",
                "I think everything about this class was its strength! It is so clear that Professor Rubin is very passionate about what he's teaching, which makes the class really dynamic and fun to engage with. Rubin is also just really smart! I thought he designed the class really well. He brought in such a variety of guest speakers that made every class different and exciting, and it really expanded the scope of my understanding of urban studies. I was very impressed with how, even though each class had a guest speaker, we still learned so much from Rubin himself. Rubin made this class the success that it is!",

                "The course was pretty easy to skip. I think this course was really a sample platter for urban thinkersa lot of interesting inspirational topics but nothing super practical, which I expect will come up in future URBN courses. The colloquium style was good, but again made it easy to engage in some sessions but not in others. The assignments are quite arts-and-crafty, which can be positive and negative, depending on what you want from this class. Overall, great easy course and helpful in determining whether or not Urban Studies is a good major for you. The optional discussion sections were extremely optional",

                "Strength was online portfolio. Loved how the assignments translated virtually. The virtual nature helped me encounter the world of digital humanities. \r\n\r\nWeakness was when internet collapsed on mobile zoom room. I loved how Professor prioritized learning about the city from being in the city, and I dont wish for that component of the course to go. As a remote student though, it was very difficult to not be able to hear due to unforeseen internet issues in the classs various field locations"

Guest speakers in the field of urban planning\/design definitely bridged that gap.",

He really pushed for student engagement and even created a way that students could join him in person for his outdoor live recorded lectures and other cool field trip events. He was real and honest with everyone about his own concerns for holding online class, which I think made everyone feel very comfortable and heard.",
                "This class succeeded during COVID-19 because of all the incredible guest speakers who, during a normal year, might not have been able to visit us. In that regard, Professor Rubin took advantage of the unprecedented circumstances to enhance the syllabus in really exciting ways. I also liked how Professor Rubin continued to host on-location, social-distanced lectures. Although I could not attend many of these outings because I had a class directly after Urban Studies, it was wonderful that the course was able to maintain so much of what it focuses on during a normal year: trips into the city itself. \r\n\r\nProfessor Rubin and the teaching team also hosted and promoted a variety of urban studies events outside of class, including three office hours per week, lectures, archive workshops, and digital literacy seminars. The opportunities were endless.\r\n\r\nThe downfall of online learning was that it sometimes restricted our discussions, as well as our ability to meet one another. I didn't speak much in class (or to other classmates) and wish I had done more so. It also made the final group project a bit difficult to coordinate, because we had such different schedules and time zones.",

                "Group projects implementation can be improved. It was hard to connect with people online.\r\n\r\nStrength was the online portfolio. The online assignments translated very well to a pandemic semester. \r\n\r\nAnother strength was that the teaching team organized several workshops with faculty\/staff as guest speakers for students to learn new skills or to brush up on skills that could amplify their work. These workshops were GREAT and provided much needed support for a virtual semester. Watched in person but also watched the recording multiple times for reference. Huge help."

I had so much fun in this class and recommend it to anyone looking to get a broad overview of the field\/explore the different components. The final project was a good change from the papers + exams I usually take; a way to get out into the world and think critically about the content. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes. I feel as if urban studies touches multiple social studies and its relations to the city. I felt as if I've gained a new perspective of my relation to the city and the subject is generally very interesting to learn about.",
                "Yes!",

                "Yes! This class is an incredible introduction to Urban Studies. I am a CS major and have taken a few architecture classes before, and this class is meant for everyone. As many of us plan on or have lived in urban environments, this class dissects the pieces that make up the urban space and provide important contexts we should all be aware of. The assignments are also pretty fun and creative!",
                "Yes!! Professor Rubin was really excited to teach this class which made it all the more engaging. The content was super interesting and has significantly shaped how I interact with and understand the built environment. The readings are really interesting but were kind of a lot sometimes so I can't say I read every single set. However, you get out what you put in so if you do take this class I would suggest doing the readings as much as you can!",

                "Definitely!!!! This class was so great and has made me interested in pursuing grad school in urban planning, which I had really never thought about before. Elihu is amazing- he is so passionate and thoughtful about what he is teaching and puts a lot of time into considering how best to include a variety of voices and narratives in the curriculum. Please take this class so that your understanding of the world and the dynamics of cities in our everyday life is expanded, like mine has been. \r\n\r\nI also loved the ongoing scrapbook project throughout the semester, which allowed for so much creativity and flexibility, so that students could dive deeper into their specific interests, but also push students to explore a variety of methods of urban planning critique. \r\n\r\nIt was also really cool that Elihu paired groups of students with point people from New Haven organizations for our final projects. It was really awesome to be able to engage directly with New Haven in that way and feel like the time we invested in our final projects actually helped to make a difference in New Haven. It was very cool to see everyone else's presentations too! And I liked that Elihu brought a lot of people together from New Haven to come to our final presentations. It made our work feel real and appreciated.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The subject material is fascinating, and the teaching team are among the nicest and most enthusiastic professors I have encountered at Yale. They strive to make each lesson engaging, and their feedback on each scrapbook assignment was so thoughtful and helpful. The events outside of class, including on-site lectures and various workshops, made the class a vibrant community that always seemed to have something new to attend or explore. The scrapbook assignments themselves were always fun and rarely stressful, thanks to the teaching team.\r\n\r\nI would especially recommend this course to someone who has never encountered Urban Studies or even thought to take it. Each week, I entered class not knowing what to expect, and I always learned something completely new and fascinating. The class completely expanded my worldview and my way of thinking. I cannot recommend it enough.",
                "Yes! wonderful introduction to the major, you learn a lot, assignments are relatively easy and self directed. there are a lot of readings- if you're not up to ~100 pages per lecture I would not recommend it.",
                "It can be a great, interesting fourth or fifth class or an immersive and intense one depending on how much work you want to put in.",
                "This course is an absolute gem. Professor Rubin, MC, and Katie were a fantastic teaching team who will guide you through an incredibly ambitious course and syllabus. Professor Rubin is brilliant, and his insights on longstanding issues in urban planning and the unique challenges we face in the aftermath of the pandemic were amazing to hear. Do be advised, however, that if you are taking this course after Professor Rubin's longstanding course on American architecture, that it will be a bit less organized, as the topics are more broad and it can feel a bit confused. Also, the guest speakers were a bit hit or miss  often times, the discussions struggled to go past the buzzwords and lingo of urban planning and really delve deeper. The assignments, while manageable, were very open-ended, which was kind of frustrating, but the upside is this yielded an awesome array of contributions from the class.  Still, these are minor critiques  overall, you'll get to take a course that is highly relevant and necessary in a supportive environment with a great instructor and classmates who by and large were very engaged.",
                "yes! super fun and engaging, elihu is a great lecturer",
                "Id recommend this to anyone thinking about an Urban Studies major. Rubin is a great resource and clearly established thinker in his field. If cities are at all on your radar in your career aspirations, definitely take this or another Rubin class.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! This course is fantastic! Its great because you can model the course to your interests\/major, making this one of the most flexible courses I've ever taken. The assignments, papers, projects, etc are largely open ended so you can really take any idea and run with it. Trust me, take this course, its well organized, the professor and TA's are amazing, its a relatively low workload course, yet the content is super rich and interesting!",
                "If you have any remote idea of studying cities, urban planning, architecture, ethnography, oral history, digital humanities, agricultural and food systems, political movements, or digital design, take the course!!"
