   "comments": [
    "My German skills grew greatly in this class, as I learned many new grammatical constructions (Future II, Past conditional, Passive, e.g.) and lots of new vocabulary. I feel my speaking skills also greatly increased, as participation in class was very encouraged and easy to do with the small class size of 6.",
    "I strengthened my reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension skills by taking this course. The variety of assignments made it easy to make progress on all fronts.",
    "I got to practice my German a lot, and meeting every day definitely helps. In terms of knowledge other than the language itself, I got to learn about the German geography and its surrounding countries."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "More time listening to native speakers either through films or short clips in class would help to better prepare for the listening portion of exams. Maybe even replacing the Quia assignments with more challenging audio segments could be more beneficial, considering that I always found the Quia too easy.",
    "I think this course is extremely strong overall, but the high level of engagement it requires is probably the best aspect. Every day requires lots of speaking and listening in German, and I could feel myself improving over the semester. The main weakness for me would have to be the online homeworks, which felt like busywork for the most part and didn't really seem to help me improve my language skills much, if at all.",
    "Overall it was a fantastic course. Six students was a great number because everyone was always involved in the discussion. However, I didn't find the QUIA assignments very helpful as most of the exercises were just matching or otherwise relatively simple. In-class activities and exercises were the most engaging and helpful. I would like to see more opportunities to practice listening comprehension, as that was often a challenging section on tests.",
    "Strengths: \r\n- Meets every day\r\n- Consistent types of activities for each chapter (short presentations, discussions, etc.)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Located far away. Maybe a more central location would be helpful so that students don't have to walk 15-20 minutes every single morning.\r\n- I wish we read more books rather than just short texts. I really enjoyed the \"Das Doppelte Lottchen\", but I hope we could have finished it."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. I always looked forward to the class and the casual yet very dynamic energy that my section enjoyed was very conducive to learning and productivity.",
    "Definitely. I think the class really helps you practice and love the language. After this class, my German definitely improved a lot from where I started."
