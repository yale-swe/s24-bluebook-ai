   "comments": [
    "I learned about the history of Franco's rule over Spain which was both interesting and useful. However, this class never fails to force information upon you that you neither want or need in order to truly \"enlighten\" you about Spain's culture. This may come at spending an entire day in art museums in Madrid rather than exploring the city or watching the sun go down as you try to finish a boring reading for a 4 hour class that really fills up with the worst kind of busy work and lectures.",
    "I learned a lot about the history and artistic culture of Spain.",
    "I learned the history of Spain since 1936 which made conversing with locals much easier. Whenever they referenced an event I felt like I, too, had grown up in the country and understood the significance.",
    "About the culture and history of Spain.",
    "I learned about Spain from the beginnings of the Spanish Civil War to its repercussions on life today. I also learned about culture (art, music, film).",
    "Knowledge of Spanish history, understanding of art and overall understanding of a foreign culture",
    "I learned a lot about Spanish history and can now speak knowledgeably on the subject.",
    "I learned a lot about modern Spanish history. Focused on reading and talking skills, and just genuinely a very interesting class.",
    "I learned more about Spanish Culture!"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Lessons about Franco, history, and war. Actually did help me have an understanding of the politics and historical reasoning behind what I saw in Spain. The excursions once we arrived in Spain were also great. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Making this class 4 hours long is unnecessary and unhelpful. It does not help over language skills since it is mostly a not engaging lecture that you are forced to listen to in order to do well on a 10 minute quiz the following Monday (this mostly tests how well you are able to remember the name of movie directors, plays, and other pointless facts)  Moreover, this class should focus less on art and music. All in all the 3 cultural classes that you will have in New Haven are a very forgettable experience. Nevermind how it is forced upon you in Bilbao with lectures no one is interested in and spending an entire day in Madrid in 2 art museums.",
    "The strength of this course is the focus on history. I loved learning about Spanish history before going to Spain. It allowed me to really talk to my host family abut their experiences for example in Franco Spain. I loved having context throughout my trip for the many things I saw. It made everything more appreciable. \r\nHowever, I will say the biggest weakness is the excess reading on art. Like some of the readings literally had pages of just artist names and their paintings. As much as I appreciate art, I think a lot of this was unnecessary and was more suited for an art history class. Like we literally had a \"Write an Analysis of an Artistic Piece\" assignment and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to do that in english because art is not of great interest to me. I think the excess amount of reading also made it hard to do the whole reading to the fullest extent. The professor lectures were absolutely useless and I learned close to nothing. Without the readings, this class would have been a complete waste.",
    "Readings are long but very manageable. Quizzes are killer, compositions are fair and require an average amount of reflection beforehand.",
    "I thought the guest lectures were very helpful and interesting.",
    "Great to take while studying abroad!",
    "Strengths- the information was presented in a very concise understandable way\r\nweaknesses- because we had to cram all the information in into 1 day (3 Fridays), it was a lot to memorize and retain. Maybe learning the info over a longer period of time with less material to cover each time?",
    "The first half of the course was rigorous: class was longer, readings were very long and hard, and quizzes made me stressed. I wish there was more advice given on how the format of the quiz would be so we could all be less stressed. I did like how we talked in great detail about the readings though. It made me less stressed about the course. \r\n\r\nThe second half of the course was in Spain and what a difference! We had no homework, did excursions to places and museums and also listened to lecturers at the University. I thought this set up was perfect. I actually enjoyed writing the compositions because they were about our experiences and gave me a chance to reflect. It made me wish we were required to keep a reflections blog\/log so that we can share\/get participation points as well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses was that I felt we never heard back about participation. It's a huge part of the grade but we never even got our participation grades from the first half the course so I felt nervous all summer about how I was doing in this class.",
    "Overall it was good, and I liked all the cultural activities we did in Spain. Sometimes in the readings they gave us lists of names or things like that that didn't help, but it was generally good.",
    "Very well organized! Both in New Haven and in Spain!"

    "No, but you will have to take it if you study abroad in Spain so prepare yourself for the hardest and most annoying gut of your life.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student considering the Bilbao program. Overall, I learned quite a bit about the history of Spain from the readings. Useless and utterly boring lectures are the only caveat. Obviously, being in Spain was incredible and taught me the most about Spanish cultures but I have to say the readings were solid intros to Spanish culture and I am grateful for them.",
    "It's part of the program.",
    "This was a wonderful place to practice the Spanish learned in the other classes while learning the interesting history that helps provide background on why Spain looks the way it does today.",
    "Only while abroad.",
    "Yes- good overview of Spanish history in a brief amount of time",
    "Yes, because it is required. However it is also,",
    "Yes because it was interesting and gave in an in-depth learning that I didn't have before",
    "Yes! Take!",
    "Yes! Very interesting and insightful class."
