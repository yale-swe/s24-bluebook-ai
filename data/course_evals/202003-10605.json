The class might benefit from more time for questionsprofessor Shin often asks for questions, but rarely gives students enough time to think of their questions and ask. Waiting for 5-10 seconds after asking if there are any questions (despite the awkwardness) would help here.",

The course is a great intro to logic (albeit a bit of a harder start to logic than 115)\r\n\r\nW - It would be a bit helpful to get a few more example problems during lecture (or after) to help students really understand what is going on."
