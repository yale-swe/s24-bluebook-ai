                "Strengths: we discussed and covered a lot of different topics, some vastly different but the course was able to weave it together perfectly\r\nWeaknesses:The syllabus was never clear on grading/ how much things are worth, so it was a constant gamble trying to figure out how much of your grade is at stake with any given assignment/ test. We didn't know how much the midterm was worth until dangerously close to the midterm, and we had no idea there was a final exam/ who would take it after the final project until he decided the day before reading period that some us would need to come in the next weekend and take a final. He told us who would be taking a final, during reading period.",

                "strengths: the topics we discussed in class were very interesting and had global implications \r\n\r\nweakness: lectures tended to be monotonous because information was shared in a disengaging way.",
                "Wish the NLP portion of the course was more serious (most of the assignments were just copying and pasting the professor's code (he literally called them copy and paste assignments....)). Also it felt like we spend a lot of time on infectious diseases (incredibly important topic), but for a course listed as EVST, I was disappointed that we only spent three or four class periods discussing environmental topics like conservation and agronomics (which is a shame bc those classes were by far the most interesting)."
