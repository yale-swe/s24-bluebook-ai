ECON 115 does a good job of covering a wide range of economic topics, and I felt that attending section and completing weekly problem sets aided me in internalizing the concepts taught in the lecture. While the course did move pretty quickly and I felt that I sometimes missed topics, I was able to rely on the textbook and other resources to fully grasp a concept. Attending office hours also helped bridge these gaps. I feel that I left the course with a solid understanding of basic economic principles. \r\n\r\nI also think that I learned how to approach a lecture-style class throughout the term. I got better at taking notes, learned better skills for reviewing slides, and began attending office hours when necessary. Overall, I learned what I needed to do as a student to get more out of lectures.

I was able to take AP Macroeconomics online my senior year, but I never got the opportunity to learn microeconomics or become familiar with how to draw the microeconomic curves. This course was very useful in that major-specific grounding in economics. I learned about perfect and irregular competition, how to draw supply and demand, and MC=MR as a principle.",

Even though we started out with basic economic models, we eventually broke down these assumptions and got a better picture of how complicated real world economics is! I also got some insight into cool economic policies and their pros and cons (such as taxes). And I learned to solve and interpret problems around all of this stuff with some really cool and simple MATH. We also had very cool discussions about values and how different people can have different views on the economy based on what they think is important - aka inequality, gov interventions, efficiency, etc.",

The content is fairly simple and the grading is very generous but i think it exposes people to the basic mathematical parts of economics. The focus much more focused with graphs, formulas, and math than traditional micro economics courses are. Theory is very briefly mentioned throughout the course and this is reflected in the tests and assignments which will at most ask a definition or a very brief explanation of a result. Even if, you have taken economics in high school (i took IB high level) I would still advise to take this course instead of the intermediate because there is still a lot of new content.",

            "comments": [
                "Slides were not consistently posted, made it hard to keep up with the information if we didnt copy everything during lecture.",
                "Less students",
                "The course was well organized, but it was difficult to stay engaged at times given that it was a large lecture.",
                "Unfortunately limited by the large lecture format, but section made it engaging. Curve is harsh but manageable. Good professor and well organised\r\n\r\nMidterms were unnecessarily rushed, wouldn't even say difficult just time constrained for no reason",
                "One strength was the availability of resources. It's a huge lecture, so in class it's hard to engage or get your questions answered, but there are a lot of office hours held and there are always extra resources on canvas. Another strength is the curve: the grading allows most people to do well if they really want to. One weakness: sometimes it would move pretty fast. If you don't understand one concept, it's really easy to fall behind on all the next concepts so you need to be active in making sure you do what you need to do to understand the last lecture before the next.",
                "didnt love teacher",
                "I think the slideshow notes and practice exams provided were helpful; however, I feel as if this course would've been better on a smaller scale. As it was a very large lecture it felt as if the professor was rushing through material and talking at us rather than explaining topics well.",
                "Strengths: I learned what I needed to learn\r\nWeaknesses: sections were useless",
                "The strengths are the p-sets and section materials that allow us to apply knowledge from the lecture into actual problems and questions. It could be improved in question writing though, as many times with Peer Tutors or at Office Hours they would read over a question in a p-set or section materials and say \"this question was written really poorly, but let's do it anyways.\"",
                "Moved quickly and didn't explain topics well.",
                "The massive lecture is not conducive to learning (not able to ask questions, Prof. Berry did not always give adequate time to note take).",
                "Strengths: good for basic econ training, some interesting topics toward the end of the course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures weren't particularly interesting, psets were not similar enough to the exams, overall just nothing special or meaningful",
                "The strengths of the course are the content and the instructor's ability to explain the material and graphs. Some weaknesses include the class size and the level of attention provided to each student. While I know that is hard to control, it can make it quite difficult to understand some concepts of the class.",
                "The lectures and sections were not as helpful. I felt like I had to relearn the material on my own.",
                "The exams way of phrasing really confused me. Even with studying a lot and going to office hours and getting feedback, I think because of the way exams are worded due to different professor teaching, I wasnt sure what the questions asked for and I was unable to understand what I needed to do even if I knew the concept. The TAs are amazing.",
                "more clear lectures, but overall positive.",
                "Not very engaging and it can be hard to pay attention with so many people in one lecture hall.",
                "Strengths: discussion sections\r\nWeakness: sometimes hard to follow and retrieve all the information in the lecture since it moves fast and it can be hard to hear everything. Wish the lectures were recorded so I could go back and make sure I understood everything.",
                "It could be improved by providing lecture recordings directly after class rather than at the end of the year because sometimes the lecture slides were hard to decipher.",
                "The lecture doesn't really help with the psets and sometimes he goes on random tangents that are a waste of class time. I wish more time was spent explaining the math and why it works.",
                "This course covers all the introductory topics. I felt that lectures could have had more example problems, so that we could see how the professor tackles each type of question.",
                "Strengths: The pace at which content was covered was comfortable, the sections are definitely worth the time because they teach you how to implement the concepts learned in lecture, the psets kept me on top of the work but weren't overwhelming. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The feedback on psets was weak, the lectures would be repetitive at times even when the majority of the students still don't understand the concept because the lectures always stayed at a higher conceptual level and never really had actual examples.",
                "strength - lots of support for students to succeed in this course (TFs, office hours, review sessions)\r\nweakness - material is taught relatively quickly",
                "This course requires a lot of individual attention and is poorly taught. Students are not adequately taught how to actually solve the problems on tests and problem sets. There is a large disconnect between the lectures and the problems given.",
                "Good course! Great grading and an easy-to-follow lecture. With that said, the graphs could be simplified on the lecture slides sometimes.",
                "Strengths: well structured, organized, lots of office hours\r\nWeakness: lack of examples during class",
                "S: fine curriculum, good recourses to study for tests.\r\nW: the lectures went far too fast and it was hard to understand the material when it was taught, only after reviewing with TAs and looking back on my own was I able to get the harder things, but I understand time constraints.",
                "Some TAs are subpar teachers. Lecture was good, a lot of material was provided",
                "Strengths: Good introduction to economic thinking\r\nWeakenesses: difficult to stay engaged in lecture-style course",
                "A strength of this course is the level of difficulty of the problem sets. The problem sets are challenging enough to prepare you well for the exams. A weakness is the peer tutors who run office hours. Often it seems that the peer tutors do not know the correct answers or cannot explain the answers. This course could be improved by requiring peer tutors to have a better understanding of economics and how to teach others.",
                "It would help to be able to understand how to apply the theory we learn in lecture during the lecture rather than on the pset.",
                "Weaknesses: A lot of content was crammed into each lecture, and classes were quite rushed as a result, making it difficult to understand concepts. While discussion sections helped with this, we often didn't get to discuss all materials allocated to sections, which was frustrating. \r\nStrengths: A good number of office hours were available regularly, which made it easy to clarify doubts related to PSETs.",
                "The exams were nothing like the psets??? Always felt like it was a curveball.",
                "It would be helpful if lecture slides were posted before class started -- often, I would find myself having to spend time after class catching up on missed slides. It would be helpful if I could have a distilled version of class notes beforehand so I could take notes on what is being said in class.",
                "The strength was definitely the office hours-- shoutout to peer tutor Josh Leffler. It could be with a more engaging professor and more accessible peer tutors who could potentially meet individually with students.",
                "The course is well structured and well organizing. I think the sections are a big weakness of this course, my TF was so bad nobody went to section, and would get actively angry at us, and many people don't like their TFs. But the lectures are quite good and Berry is a relatively engaging professor, and I think the general support for this course is good -- especially with all the different kinds of office hours.",
                "Strengths\r\n- lots of resources\r\n- basically impossible to fail\r\n- Didace was a great section leader and a great TA overall\r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n- For the love of God either decrease the number of graphs, or take more effort to explain the graphs.\r\n- Confusing phrasing for questions in the psets and in the exams. I have lost many points on exams due to the questions being too vague, and have spent much time in office hours trying to understand what the psets were expecting us to do.\r\n- the effort that the course takes to circumvent using calculus makes it very very frustrating to understand what is going on in the class, as the use of vague algebraic expressions makes the course much more difficult to understand",
                "Strengths: good professor and good material Weakness: could have released video lectures earlier in term",
                "Strengths: ECON 115 is a very streamlined course in terms of assignments and pacing. The lectures are comprehensive and include effective demonstrations/examples, and the discussion sections work well with the lectures to help reinforce concepts (and help with problem sets). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The pace of problems can sometimes feel a little rushed during discussion sections, which might just be a matter of which teaching fellow is present for a given discussion section.",
                "More example problems in the lectures.",
                "I thought a large part of the weaknesses of the course stemmed from an interesting teaching method. Topics like supply and demand curves - which are relatively simply to grasp - were given hours of attention time, but then much more difficult topics were given 30 minutes in one lecture. I have always struggled to understand the point of curves and delineating how many students can get A's and B's - if anything I think it fosters an environment that encourages cut throat students.",
                "I enjoyed the content, especially during the end of the semester (monopoly, game theory, etc.) I would say a weakness of this course was the lack of engagement between the professor and the students. I wish the professor was more engaged.",
                "The biggest weakness was the lecture slides. They are nearly incoherent in retrospect and have to be supplemented by external videos and the textbook to be understood outside of lecture time (especially because he does not post the lectures). Unless you are really good at absorbing lecture content in class, expect to be relearning everything outside of it.",
                "Strengths: The content is very interesting and relevant, Steven Berry is a funny and interesting lecturer, sections give good practice problems\r\nWeaknesses: Some topics may seem confusing (if not attending section) with as few as just two slides dedicated to them in class, lectures could have been organized better\r\nImprovement Potential: The current format (roughly) is for the second half of a lecture to introduce a topic and that topic to be completed in the first half of the following lecture, and so on. Completely switching topics mid-class and ending classes with confusion about an unfinished topic could be avoided if, instead, each lecture focused on one topic.",
                "strengths: good peer tutors\r\nweaknesses: no recordings until the end (so midterms are horrible to study for if you couldnt catch what he was saying in class, no laptops made it harder to record down oral phrases quickly during lecture",
                "I don't think Steven Berry should teach this course. He taught a lot of concepts, and the p-sets were a bunch of math, but there was no bridge between the two. This class made me question yale's policy of making all professors teach, because I'm sure he's great at research, but the instruction of this class was not great. Also, some of the questions on the tests were harder than any of the practice problems we had or anything we were instructed on, especially in the second midterm. Additionally, I think it is important to explain the concepts in words that aren't just econ words, and Prof Berry didn't do that. He would define something, and then later define the words in the definition, instead of building up on things we already knew. Also, many of the TF's aren't great and should have more instruction on how to make an engaging discussion session that actually teaches people things.  Overall, I have decided I'm not going to take an econ class at yale again.",
                "strengths: you meet so many first-years, you get to take a class with many friends. weeknesses: the lecture isn't engaging, the pacing of the class accelerated so much in the middle",
                "I mean it's a fine course.",
                "Very helpful with the peer tutors and I thought the review sessions up to the final were particularly helpful.",
                "Strengths: PSETs were well-applied and helpful for learning content, and exams were generally pretty fair (with some surprises thrown in there). Section was helpful if you had the right TF and flexibility was helpful for making the schedule work for you. Office hours were particularly helpful once you found someone who made sense to you -- I went to Josh's office hours to review for the midterm and final, and they were among the more academically beneficial hours I've spent throughout my undergrad experience.\r\nWeaknesses: not all TFs are totally effective at explaining content, and Professor Berry generally lectures with more complexity than you need for intro econ purposes so it takes some working out to simplify the content down to what you actually need.",
                "The course's primary strengths lie in the material and the sections. The material was fascinating, even on its own, and the sections were tremendously helpful in understanding it. I'd like to give a huge shout-out to my TF, Claudia, who--beyond being an incredibly nice person--helped me out greatly with her discussion sections. The lectures did not typically go over applications of the concepts, so the sections were vital for the completion of the problem sets. Professor Berry is a nice, funny guy, and his jokes were always a plus. However, this course did regrettably have many weaknesses. The problem sets were extraordinarily time-consuming, as they tested us on material we didn't go over in class, and oftentimes applications that we did not quite learn in section. The textbook and office hours were lifesavers. Also, I think the lectures would have been much more useful and engaging if they focused more on applications of concepts, rather than just the concepts themselves. The exams were difficult (more so because of the nature of curved classes) but fair. The course just wasn't as engaging as it could have been.",
                "Some lectures were quite boring and often jumped from common sense to confusing equations very suddenly.  I fell asleep in the lectures on days i wasn't particularly sleepy. PSETs were usually not too time consuming but sometimes worded a little weirdly. Midterms felt they would throw a few curveballs that were pretty curvy. If you can manage to stay focused the lectures are pretty informative. Did not feel the need to go to section all semester",
                "Good course for an introduction to microeconomics. Any student considering it should take it",
                "Strengths - very engaging professor. Psets were helpful for the exams. Lecture slides useful. \r\nWeaknesses - Very big class. Discussion sections not useful.",
                "Strengths are the office hours are super helpful, and the P-sets are quite short. Course is very transparent with grading and exams.",
                "I would have appreciated it much more if the lecture recordings had been released during the course of the term. It was definitely nice to have them as additional study materials before the final, but I needed this help when studying for the midterms and doing the Psets throughout the course as well. The slides are oftentimes not enough to revise.",
                "A strength of this course was that section and the many review sessions offered were very helpful for learning how to solve the types of problems on the psets and exams, but I felt that lecture itself did not do a great job of providing examples of those types of problems.",
                "The strengths its its organization on canvas",
                "The professor was the strength of this course, a weakness is maybe giving more practice examples of questions during lecture",
                "Engagement during lectures was quite low - Prof Berry is a great guy but not the best lecturer.",
                "It is very fast-paced and could be taught in a slower, more effective way. A solution to this could possibly be making it a MWF course schedule and slowing down the curriculum.",
                "Lecture wasn't very helpful",
                "The strengths were that it was a fairly organized course and you knew what to expect going in. It's an intro lecture that isn't incredibly exciting, but you know what's coming so it's not too hard to plan ahead. Sometimes the p-sets were hard to do from lecture alone but if you find a TA that you can learn well from than this isn't a make or break issue.",
                "At points the lectures are a bit confusing.",
                "The fact that examples are not solved in the lecture. I know this is meant for the sections but that is not very effective. It would be very helpful in the professor solved examples in class sometimes",
                "the course was good overall but could have been paced slightly better as content felt rushed right before exams.",
                "Lectures were, at times, drawn-out and overly complicated. However, overall, I enjoyed the content and overall structure of the course.",
                "Not sure how this can be improved upon but the lecture format of the course inherently makes classes more difficult to follow insofar as they are less interesting and students are more distant from the instructors. Some things that can be done to improve performances are to offer earlier access to lecture recordings for review, make sections mandatory, etc. Additionally, the review sessions should focus on topical reviews rather than purely going through test problems that were given to us.",
                "The strengths of this course are the pacing. I never felt like we were moving at an unreasonable speed considering the amount of content we needed to learn for the exam. The final exam was also pretty reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are tenfold, though. Absolutely hated how little the lectures actually did for my learning. Could be improved with more in-class practice problems and less emphasis on real-world/historical anecdotes that did little to enhance the concepts being taught.",
                "I think that the course could be improved by giving more examples when teaching rather than formulas so that we know how to apply them to questions. I think the big divide between what I learned and the tests is I didn't know how to apply the certain formula to the question. The weaknesses of this course is the time of the course was hard to stay fully engaged. Also, the section times were not exactly student friendly in terms of what I could get done. The strengths is that since it was a big class I could collaborate and learn from other students if I failed to understand a certain topic.",
                "The actual material is very good -- the support systems are weak, however. The class is really far too big to get any help within a meaningful time frame if you need it. Review sessions were out the door the entire week before tests, literally there was no room to sit even on the floor, sections were often similarly filled with people sitting on tables, TFs often had difficulty regulating their knowledge of economics to a sphere that would be helpful for beginner students and many times had to double back on concepts or solutions they had mentioned earlier. Ultimately, this class was a bit difficult to get something out of if you wanted to interact with the provided external structures, however if you have a good group of friends to study with -- which is the preferred solution for most within this class -- then you will do well enough.",
                "A strength of this course was the optional sections. We went over practice problems and cleared up newly learned concepts. A weakness of this course was the amount of time spent on topics that weren't really relevant to what we were learning that day.",
                "Strengths: Engaging lectures, strong application of concepts to real-world examples, and VERY helpful peer tutors.\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of consistency in slides, PSETs, & exam solutions (switched variables, error-prone, bad handwriting), no feedback on PSET errors.",
                "I felt pretty indifferent about this course. A major weakness is that sometimes Professor Berry would draw graphs on his iPad and the lines would be very messy, unclear, and the lines wouldnt be straight so it would be confusing.\r\n\r\nAlso, a lot of the slides are not self explanatory and attending lecture doesnt really explain too much either. I often find myself having to ask many friends to explain a slide and no one knowing what Professor Berry was trying to say.",
                "Strengths: Well-organized, obviously -- a course this large has to be. Prof. Berry has honed his lectures well and made the lectures always lively and engaging to attend. I'll definitely miss hearing from him twice a week. Weaknesses: The quality of the sections was variable; in mine, we often just went through review problems, but were always rushed on time, and so rarely got the chance to really delve into people's questions, even if everyone had the same one.",
                "The actual workload is not too bad but the teaching was hard to be engaged with. The lectures did not help a lot for studying the topics on the exams and there was a huge gap missing between the two.",
                "One of the strengths was the material being a good introduction to economic concepts and foundations. However, some lecture slides were posted late and lecture recordings were only made available in preparation for the final exam.",
                "A strength of this course is the access to many different educational resources. I think that through the combination of section, office hours, online resources, and lectures there were multiple opportunities to learn the material in different ways. I found my TF to be incredibly helpful and TFs and peer tutors were very open during office hours. I also appreciated the TF run review sessions leading up to midterms and finals. Finally, online access to lecture slides and old exams was additionally helpful. \r\n\r\nDue to the size of this course, I think a weakness was that there wasn't much collaboration with other students. In section and office hours, students were mostly silent and there wasn't much mutual problem-solving. I think student collaboration can be achieved by forming individual study groups, but I felt that some of the smaller spaces for learning (section and office hours ) did not facilitate collaboration. I also felt that it was sometimes hard to engage with lectures because there was such a large group of people in one hall and there wasn't much direct connection to Professor Berry.",
                "Lectures should be uploaded",
                "The course has a lot of resources to learn, and the material is very relevant. The course's biggest weakness is that office hours are completely packed, especially during midterm and exam season. I wish there were maybe more accessibility in terms of studying during this time,.",
                "One of the major strengths of the class is that there are so many resources for additional help. The peer tutors for the course were amazing and actually helped me understand the material better than both lecture and section. On the other hand, lecture was often times confusing and section felt unhelpful. In particular with section, most people stopped showing up because it can feel like another unproductive lecture, and thus a waste of time. I think section would benefit from a less rigid structure. For example, it could be used to help re-explain the concepts introduced in a given week rather than restricted to only the practice problems. Overall, the work load is consistent each week and, in general, is not very time consuming.",
                "A main weakness of this class was the variability in TA quality. My TA was not super engaging and generally not the best at explaining things (I think this can be hard at times for people who find certain subjects intuitive), and we would often only get to one or two of the practice problems each week. But, we had a substitute (Claudia) some days who showed up with PowerPoint presentations, broke down every single question, and stayed after to explain the topics. I wish there was a better vetting/training process for the TAs to ensure that all students can access the extra help they need.",
                "Strength: The material fits together well, and the end of the course is satisfying once you can see all the topics at once. Weakness: The lecture could be delivered more straightforwardly sometimes.",
                "The workload is easy to grow used to (one P-set a week, two midterms and a final, bi-weekly lectures, and weekly sections). It is not difficult to do well in this class if you go to lectures, sections, and study. That said, a lot of people don't. It's the sort of class that you have to put work into to get results.",
                "Strengths: Lots of support and well organized. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too big of a lecture, wording in tests and psets often confusing, and psets had wrong answer keys sometimes.",
                "Strengths - interesting course material\r\nWeaknesses - this class was not taught very strongly, lectures were hard to follow, slides were almost impossible to decipher after class",
                "Strengths: Prof. Berry is an excellent lecturer and provides a lot of intuition for the main results of the course by doing them multiple ways. He tries to avoid partisan bias and provides real world examples and empirical data when he can. He'll tell you what assumptions he's making and comment on whether he thinks they're realistic or not. He's great!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The first part of the course (perfect competition, consumer and producer theory) felt a little slow while the following topics were very rushed.",
                "If youre deciding between this course and the seminar version, you should take into account that so many people you know are probably gonna be taking this class and youre gonna be able to collaborate with lots of people in psets and studying and youre gonna make a lot of friends! I also loved Prof Berrys lecture style; even though economic concepts are not always that interesting for everyone, I feel like he did a great job in bringing the topics in an entertaining way, sometimes with very random jokes and pop/historical references. He was also very open for anyone to ask questions during lecture! Lastly, I think the course organizers did a really good job at separating the discussion of how economics works from a discussion of VALUES and how the world SHOULD be, so I never felt like I was being imposed a world view or another. Only weaknesses are maybe that its still hard to ask questions in a lecture of 400 people and even though discussion section offers a good chance to do so, it would be great to have the ease of just asking your professor whatever is in your mind during class. On that note, though, discussion sections were AWESOME and always helped me reinforce knowledge from lecture.",
                "The lecture slides were barely legible. Other courses supplement this by having TF slides that are well made.",
                "Students are offered lots of help and encouragement.",
                "Lots of office hours, assistance, and support.",
                "Strengths: the course lays a pretty good basic foundation in microeconomics. The TFs and peer tutors are great. \r\nWeaknesses: the lectures are extremely unengaging, the course is badly organized, and the way the class is taught makes the material appear much harder than it actually is.",
                "The structure of how work was given was a little weird but I liked the content taught and it gave a challenge.",
                "I think a strength was the peer tutoring, and a weakness was the sections. I learned a LOT from the peer tutors. I almost felt like if I hadn't gone to section, I was better off with the material because section confused me so much. I think that there should be video explanations for section materials to account for this.",
                "This course was successful in that it exposed me to basic and important ideas of economics. The office hours, when they weren't too packed, were good. I found the p-sets to be worthwhile and engaging. The exams from past classes posted on Canvas were super helpful in preparing for the midterms and final. However, I did not find the material or teaching super inspiring. As a whole, microeconomics feels pretty bland. As a teacher, I was not blown away by Professor Berry. Sometimes, especially when he shared anecdotes or real world examples, lecture was engaging. Many days, I found lecture dense, boring, and confusing. I used a pdf of the class textbook to supplement lecture and often found the explanations of course concepts in the book to be more clear than Professor Berry's explanations.",
                "Quite boring and simple course, mathematics included in it is basic and tries to explain optimization concepts in roundabout ways to avoid calculus but actually making the arguments involved much more convoluted and ugly.",
                "The lecture style with hundreds of students sometimes made it difficult to concentrate, but office hours were fabulous.",
                "Section, office hours, peer tutoring, and review sessions were all very helpful and appreciated resources. \r\n\r\nThe exams were often much more difficult and outside the scope of lectures, practice exams, section materials, etc. Having that content line up would have been more fair in my opinion, especially considering how the curve works in this class. Students who work hard to master the content should have a fair shot at an A, not just the most naturally-gifted students who can figure out tricky exam questions on the spot.",
                "Strengths were that the course was organized relatively well and there were lots of resources given to students.\r\nWeaknesses were that the lectures were not the best, a lot of self-teaching was forced if you want to do well, and not a lot of background was given despite this being an introductory course. I think as a beginner who knew nothing about economics, it was tough to follow because a lot of the basic concepts weren't taught, it was assumed that I should just know.",
                "It was very misleading in the lectures compared to the exams. There was very inaccurate information on the review sheets making it hard to study and the TAs were not on the same as the teacher. A strength was the resources to learn the class offered.",
                "Strength - the class content and the practice problems given before an exam\r\nWeakness - the curve made the class overly stressful given the relatively easy content",
                "Teach the material better and test on material we are actually taught.",
                "Strengths: Professor Berry's lectures were engaging & informative. Concepts were clear from class lectures, and the problem sets were helpful but not onerous. Weaknesses: It was not usually clear which part of the homework was wrong. I would have appreciated more feedback on homeworks. The midterm exams were too long for the amount of time allotted.",
                "The lecturer skipped over many key points very briefly, and section did not cover key materials clearly as it went too fast. Had to relearn a lot of section material instead of review.",
                "the lectures weren't easy to understand, and the slide organization made it difficult to recognize each concept/everything seemed to blend together. the sections did help a little more since I got to ask questions, but understanding the concepts were difficult given that you could finish all the psets just by going to office hours and not actually understanding anything.",
                "As someone considering EPE, this course did not sway me to keep up with economics nor did I find it very enriching. The course slideshows were not coherent with problem sets. It did teach me the basics of the economy as I had no prior knowledge, but I do not feel like Econ 115 is exactly coherent with what I expected based on the course description.",
                "I like the discussion sections once a week. A weakness of the class was definitely that the professor tended to cover the most difficult part of the lecture at the very end (last five minutes) of class and not spend enough time explaining it.",
                "This courses strength is its professor, its weakness is definitely its TAs. Section was often unclear and not engaging.",
                "Strength: Sections!! TFs were super nice and the review sessions were hit or miss. Crossan and Sam were my favorite section leaders who really got me through it all.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Barry. He can't teach a first-year dominated class very well imo because he often assumes that students has prior economics knowledge, so if you come from a background where you didn't learn any econ...good luck!!! go to tutoring because you will not understand anything!!!",
                "I believe that the strengths of this course are the community that the class fosters. Being such a large lecture, almost everyone I know is in intro to econ, and this community made it very easy to both make friends and also find a study partner in the class. However, one weakness would be not having section be mandatory. While obviously annoying, these sections prove to be very helpful in gaining a larger appreciation for the material, and I believe that making them mandatory would improve the entire classes learning experience. Additionally, the fact that the whole class is curved creates a type of negative competition that I believe can be toxic at times. Through this system of the whole class being curved, it makes it so that all my peers are my competition, which I did not enjoy and believed that it fosters this negative competition instead of collaboration.",
                "I wish there were more guided practice sessions, i felt as thought the content in the lecture did not 100% help me solve the problems in homeowrk and exams.",
                "The engagement with the professor during lecture was minimal, and the coherency of the explanations could have been better. Conceptually, almost every concept introduced in the course was simple and established from the bottom up -- but many of the explanations / solutions were very opaque and difficult to follow. \r\n\r\nI can understand why many people felt it was difficult to follow Prof. Berry's train of thought and rationale for why certain approaches were chosen. I think being able to understand why certain things are the true, rather than having to accept them as fact / memorize them makes understanding and appreciating the content much easier.",
                "The strengths were definitely the lectures and the T a sections which were very helpful in explaining all the concepts. The professor was very helpful in answering all the questions and I felt the problem is its had a very good selection of exercises that prepared us for exams. Overall we had many different materials to prepare us for an exam. The only weakness I would note were the exams themselves, they were all quite long and a bit tedious and difficult. But overall the class was very interesting interactive and helpful.",
                "I wish we could contact the professor in a more efficient way",
                "Strengths: a lot of content is covered that is important for economics students. Problem sets are pretty straight forward but not extremely easy and office hours basically solve them for you if you are having difficulty doing one.  \r\nWeaknesses: grading for problem sets was very inconsistent: I would basically have the same answers with people from the same office hours but for no reason at all I would get a different grade. Also, despite being recommended, the microeconomics textbook is useless as you can get all the information you need from the presentation slides. I would only use it if I was very confused with the content of the slides but still I would say that the textbook is unnecessarily complicated and wordy.",
                "Strengths: there are many resources available to you. Peer tutoring or office hours are available almost every day which is very helpful if you are struggling with a concept. I also found the discussion sections very useful for psets and just to get some extra applicability skills to the concepts that are taught in the lecture.\r\nWeaknesses: The lecture is and will always be huge. There is very little feedback when it comes to psets or exams simply because there aren't enough resources to give students an individual breakdown of what went wrong in an exam or pset. The concepts can be difficult to grasp initially especially if you have no familiarity with said concepts. The lectures are not very engaging and I didn't usually get a lot out of them.",
                "There were many opportunities to ask questions outside of lecture which was really helpful. It would have been great if Professor Berry posted lecture recordings in addition to slides so that we could review while content was fresh in our minds.",
                "weakness: huge class, so really limited interraction between students and faculty, a bit too fast-paced, sometimes repetitive\r\nstrengths: Steven Berry is a really funny professor, I'm glad I've had a chance to take a course with him, ovr helpful class, strong introduction to micro",
                "More problem set material done in lecture. The exams reflected the problem set difficulty in terms of questions, but doing the problem sets themselves was like going out on a limb.",
                "All of the additional resources like office hours and review sessions were extremely helpful and beneficial to my studying and understanding of the course. Overall all the expectations were perfectly reasonable and success is possible for everyone if they study and put in work.",
                "good",
                "This course provides a solid background for microeconomics. I think that the lectures could be made more interesting, discussion sections could be more helpful, and that the grading system is somewhat unfair.",
                "Strengths  Steven Berry is hilarious! His teaching was very engaging (for me, at least) and interesting for kids who like economics. The course teaches many useful and intriguing concepts that I use almost daily. I love economics though, it was very different for many of my peers. Steven literally acted out the Princess Bride to illustrate game theory. He did a stand up comedy routine to talk about Pareto Improving Trades, which made so much sense. He did a rap on the very first day of class. He is not a lecturer, he is a performer and an excellent teacher. I always left class thinking about something interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses  THE TFS AND PEER TUTORS. They get things wrong all the time. In one of the FINAL review sessions, the TF got so many things wrong (according to the solutions and basic economic concepts) that I just left. They cancel sessions randomly and when they don't, all the peer tutor does is just give answers and occasionally quickly run through the math without giving you the chance to figure it out or teaching you anything. I never went to a session that got everything right either. Sections are inconsistent in quality and many of the TF's were just confusing. My Pset scores dramatically improved when I quit going to section and peer tutor sessions, that's how bad they are.\r\n\r\nThere are too many people in this class. 452 students with this curve is INSANE. And this also puts a strain on resources, sessions are always full and you never have the chance to get 1 on 1 help. Also because of the curve, students don't help each other much. People are slightly competitive. When reviewing, I worked with a group of friends, but that was rather uncommon. People also talk a lot in lecture and it's distracting.\r\n\r\nThe math is weird. I get it, no calculus because not everyone knows calculus. However, calculus would have made more sense to explain some of the concepts. It wouldn't have hurt to just do a sidebar for the kids that took calc when explaining the concepts. Additionally, he doesn't explain the math too thoroughly in lecture because he has a lot of information to go through which is reasonable. I think sections are meant to teach us the math side of it? But they do such a bad job that you kind of just have to figure it out yourself.\r\n\r\nImproving  Interview TF's more thoroughly please! They were terrible!! And it would be handy if they all attended lecture because clearly some of them didn't as they had no idea what was going on. More peer tutors too please so that we can have more individual help from them and they don't spend their tutor sessions just giving answers. Something like how the physics department does their peer tutor sessions. Maybe split up the class into smaller classes. It's too big. Better TF's will fix the math and if he just really quick translated it into calculus when he introduced a concept that could be better explained with it.",
                "The lectures are often difficult to keep up if the student is trying to take notes, as sometimes the professor will go briefly over dense slides. However, Professor Berry does explained the material well during the lectures, and the lecture notes are very helpful to review.",
                "For me, the class curriculum flowed well, having access to lecture notes was crucial, and section was very helpful for understanding the concepts. The large lecture format can make it hard to stay focused. It would help if we received any sort of feedback telling us which mistakes we made on problem sets.",
                "The discussion sections with Daniela were extremely helpful, whereas the lectures by Professor Barry were super hard to follow and were way too complex. The lectures were too real world centered.",
                "Berry was an okay professor, I felt like I learned more from the peer tutor than him. This course definitely provided a good overview of microecon which is nice.",
                "strengths: berry was funny and would make people laugh in the lecture\r\n\r\nweaknesses: not a good intro course if youve never done econ before. i was so lost throughout the whole course and did loads of outside learning to understand terms and context but in the end the only thing that mattered was the algebra since all of the questions on the exams were some sort of algebra or graph. this was annoying because i would understand the real world context of what we were learning but had no clue how to solve them algebraicly. unfortunately nothing in this course made sense. lecture went way too fast so couldnt write anything down, but then they wouldnt post the lecture slides for a few days/week after so made it difficult to catch up. psets could only make sense vaguely in office hours",
                "Strengths: learned the material and now have a greater understanding of micro weaknesses: both lectures and discussion sections were not very engaging and could definitely have been improved",
                "Strengths: Very Comprehensive\r\nWeaknesses: Fast-paced with less support from TA's",
                "The manner of presentation of the material should be altered so that it is not assumed people in the introductory course have background in the field. Some focus could be shifted to reading the textbook as homework in preparation to lectures.",
                "Strengths: extremely organized. The structure of the class is super clearjust 2 midterms, a final, and weekly psets. Office hours are SUPER accessible at all times, and I really liked how organized Daniela and Professor Berry were (e.g. they posted the answer key to midterms and psets pretty promptly so we could check our answers after we got them back). I personally didn't think the massive 400-person lecture format worked for me; I think I would've much preferred the smaller seminar (ECON 110). It was just a bit hard to stay engaged in such a big space, where a lot of people were talking on the side/not paying attention. I think some of the concepts were cool, but other times it felt like the things we were learning didn't really have any application (like, we just needed to figure out how to plug things into formulas and do some algebra)though I do understand this is just an intro course.",
                "I think the lecture format makes it challenging for students to actively think while learning. Mini-quizzes or practice problems after each lecture would be helpful for students to retain the information they learn from each lecture. Something a lot of my peers and I talked about is that we did not know what we were learning about, for an intro-level course it couldve been broken down more with post lecture worksheets or questionnaires.",
                "One strength of this course was that were many ways to engage with the material in order to better understand it. For example, we would learn the material in class, we would have a problem set every week to assess our understanding of the material, and we had ample opportunity to go to office hours and review sessions to ask questions. However, on the flip side, a weakness of the course was that sometimes the worksheets we had in discussion sections didn't have the same types of problems consistent with those on the problem sets and exams, so I didn't find those worksheets very effective. One way to improve that aspect would be to use questions from old problem sets as the sample questions.",
                "Office hours are good. Lectures can be broad and not helpful.",
                "Weaknesses- The course assumes that students have a level of background in Microeconomics knowledge even though it is an introductory course. Concepts are poorly explained and therefore very confusing to students without knowledge of Microeconomics.",
                "Strengths: There are a lot of resources to help you understand the material. Although I had never taken econ in high school, I felt supported in this class. There are office hours almost every single day, review sessions, and practice tests. They even record the lectures and share them with students before major tests. For this class, if you put in the time and effort, you will do well because there are so many support systems. You just have to be able to utilize them. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The sections were not very helpful. Also, I often felt very confused during lecture because they teach the concepts more theoretically. The concepts taught in class often didn't make sense until the review sessions, which made studying for tests extremely hard. I think the best thing to do is to put more emphasis on actual problems from the p-set and try to go to office hours to understand them if you do not.",
                "The course held lots of office hours, which made studying a lot easier. I wish optional paper handouts or worksheets were given out though. I feel like the lack of worksheets made studying a lot more difficult than it should've been.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most students were indeed half-asleep during the lectures. It made me sad, but then again, staring at graph after graph for over an hour gets repetitive fast. In Professor Berry's defense, he was very energetic and had a fantastic sense of humor, but again, the enormous class size and admittedly boring course material hurt the classroom experience. My advice would be to either split the class up into 2 or 3 lectures taught at different times/by different instructors or make the lectures available online so students who know they won't be able to remain attentive all class could catch up online instead of taking up space in the lecture hall.",
                "I think Professor Berry is a good lecturer and made class interesting, but oftentimes I felt confused about how the problem sets and section materials were  derived from the lectures. I think longer section times would be helpful so that instructors have time to explain how the problems we go over actually use the theory we learned in lectures.",
                "It felt like there was too much information jam packed into each lecture and made it hard to absorb",
                "I found the varying difficulty of practice problems provided throughout the course in section, on problem sets, and on practice exams to be very helpful for developing a strong understanding. It was difficult for me to stay focused during lecture because I did not feel that the content was engaging, especially at the beginning of the term. Often times, I felt that I was robotically taking notes without truly processing any information.",
                "The lectures could be explained better. I attended most lectures but did not feel as I was learning much in class and had to re-teach myself the material.",
                "Lectures tended to be hard to pay attention to and could have been more focused on course material; they often seemed to go off topic which made it hard to focus on key topics and discern which information was important to know. The strengths of the course were the problem sets were relevant to key topics we were learning and not too much, there were a lot of available office hours, and there were many study resources available such as practice exams."

I did enjoy the Professor, however. It is just much too difficult a course to take unless its required for a major, distributional requirement, or other program.",
                "YES! It's not too difficult and will give you a great understanding of the concepts and terms but maybe not the math or process behind some things. It will make you a more informed citizen and even help you establish some political economic policy preferences while still being quite even-handed. Prof Berry's lectures can drag on a times but they do cover a lot of ground across the whole semester and I personally got a lot out of them. Also, while section is not required, it proved very important, as they taught how you actually implement or solve problems based on the terms, concepts, and graphs shown in lecture.",

Definitely go to office hours, because this is where many of the concepts from lecture are boiled down to what you actually need, and know that if you put the hours into this class you will do well. I think I walked in expecting it to be pretty easy and I was surprised to find that the content is more complex than it might seem, but it's all manageable if you find the study habits that work for you.",

                "Yes, good class and very necessary to take in terms of learning in life.",
                "This course is a bit frustrating, because while I would argue that the content of what is being taught is actually relatively interesting, (which I understand many others would disagree with, and have during past reviews of this course) it is ultimately assessed in a manner divergent to how it is presented in class. My ultimate assessment is that many of the concepts taught actually do help you see the world within an interesting economic framework -- whether it be in relation to firm pricing, insurance, societal loss via taxation, etc. -- it is ultimately a microeconomics class taught on a curve, where the people who understand the material prior to the class will do the best. In this manner it is not the most accessible introductory course, however it is generally well known that this is a course where you will simply have to ensure you can perform better than others in order to succeed. In order to best accentuate this curve, many of the exam questions will be difficult permutations of concepts that you were taught in class -- often exact opposite scenarios or economic ideas than what is taught -- so that people who have a generally strong analytical mind compounded with a good understanding of the material should do well.",
                "Yes, this course is a good foundation for not only other economics class, but other QR classes. Even though I will not be majoring in economics, the course was still very interesting and relevant to real life.",
                "Yes, this course is good for anybody seeking a basic introduction to economics, as the curve is generous, the workload is light, and the lectures can be engaging.",
                "Yes, I think that one can learn very interesting and important concepts that go beyond economics. I feel some of the concepts can apply to the decisions made in ones own life.",
                "I would honestly recommend this even if you're not an Econ major. I wasn't even tangentially one, and generally find economistic thinking somewhat problematic/questionable, but it was good to take this course and see how people who think like that think. It's smoothly organized and generally interesting.",
                "If you are willing to put in the work outside of class to teach yourself the topics, I would. I honestly really liked the class as an independent learner. It was also a major requirement.",
                "I would recommend it for anyone who has not taken any prior economics classes as the course lays a good foundation.",
                "This course is a gateway to many other economic classes at Yale, and I think that ECON 115 serves as a great introduction to the discipline. I would recommend this course to other Yale students if they were seeking to learn about Econ or if they wanted to take future Econ classes, yet I don't think I would recommend this course if people were trying to find a quick QR credit. This was among the first lecture-style classes I've ever taken, and I think that some level of personal interest is necessary to get the most out of this class. As such, if someone is interested in Econ and/or wants to take future Econ classes, this course is a great success. If someone does not have that personal interest, I don't think they would receive the maximum benefit from taking this course.",
                "Yes, I believe everyone should have basic knowledge of economics",
                "I definitely would recommend this course. It is fundamental to the economics major and, despite being a lecture, is very enjoyable.",
                "My recommendation depends on the person. Introduction to Microeconomics is a course with interesting content that requires a way of thinking different than in most other fields. Since the course is graded on a curve, Econ 115 is a solid option for a qr credit and in general a good class for a lot of people to take. However, the \"enjoyment\" and success someone will experience out of the class is really dependent on how much work they put in to actually understand the material.",
                "The subject itself is pretty boring, but it gives you a good foundation for understanding economics and the psychology of decision-making.",
                "I would recommend the course to someone else because some basic economic thinking seems important for being an informed citizen. It's also nice to have a huge lecture with a lot of the rest of the freshman class.",
                "Yes. Whether you plan to focus in economics or not, it's good to have a foundational understanding about how markets function.",
                "Not really, unless you have to and its a pre-req. Being graded on a curve sucks , and I have learned through this class that I am not actually a great test-taker. Psets are only 10% of your grade despite how difficult and time-consuming they were for me.",
                "Yes  but with another professor/ a better format",
                "I would recommend this course only to students who need economics for their major/as a prerequisite. I feel that a person who wants to take microeconomics for the sake/love of learning it would not walk away with what they hoped to gain.",
                "Yes. Although it's intro micro and hundreds of people take it every year, it's a really nice introduction to thinking with models/graphs/math and learning to phrase/answer social science questions in a precise and falsifiable way.",
                "Yes! Even though this was my first experience in a massive lecture class, I felt like the lecture & discussion section dynamic was great. I personally found the topics of the class VERY interesting - this is basically a class where you use math to explain peoples minds and behavior. If youre comfortable with using math to solve problems and youre interested in learning about how people make choices and how these choices lead to some of the central social structures of our world then this is the course for you!",
                "Yes. This is a pre-requisite for a lot of majors, but I genuinely enjoyed it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it really helps you look at interactions in a different perspective.",
                "Unless you really need an econ course for a major requirement or prereq, then no. There are better QRs and this class is very badly taught and poorly organized.",
                "If you just need a social science or QR I do not recommend this class only take it if your actually a prospective econ major. The grading is pretty fair just make sure to do well on the midterms.",
                "Yes, if you plan on being an Econ major or have the slightest interest this is a good start.",
                "I would only recommend this class if you like economics, or if you have taken economics in high school, or if you need it for your major. I would not take this class for fun, like I did.",
                "Yes, if you have any interest in econ or social science this is a great class to take, although it can be difficult",
                "I would, but not enthusiastically. I think it was a good experience to take such a large lecture my first semester, and it was fun to be in a class with so many other first years. Economics was a field I was eager to try out, and I'm glad I did so, even if I was not a huge fan of it. If you don't need the requirement for your major and aren't really curious about economics, there are definitely more exciting classes out there.",
                "If you have a choice, this course is way too easy and boring, use another class for your social sciences distributional instead.",
                "I would recommend to students looking to fulfill their prerequisites or prospective economics majors.",
                "To those who would like a better understanding of microeconomics I would definitely take this course. However, just know that there will need to be a lot of work taken outside of the classroom to fully understand the concepts before even beginning to work on the problem sets.",
                "I think it provided great skills needed for future use.",
                "Yes, with caution. It provides fundamentals of economics that lay groundwork for later on. However, the lecture environment is not very conducive to asking questions or clarifications. If possible, I recommend taking 110 for a more engaging environment.",
                "No. The tests have little correlation to practice material, lecture material, textbooks, and section material. The grade is therefore a test of intuition as opposed to actual academic ability or knowledge of material discussed prior.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. I plan to take more economics classes after this brilliant introduction and might even major in it.",
                "I would only recommend it to students that need to take it for the Economics major. There are better QR credits.",
                "this is a requirement for a lot of majors, but I wouldn't willingly take this course if your major didn't require it. it's easy to get lost and not understand the material. many of the ta's would also be confused or give the wrong information sometimes, which made it harder to learn the material. the questions on the exams were pretty difficult as well because it didn't accurately reflect the types of questions you solved on the psets.",
                "yes, this course is a comprehensive introduction to micro econ and, along with theoretical models, provides many real-world examples and incentives to econ to spark a greater interest in the subject",
                "I would recommend this course if someone does not like math and need a math credit, although I would not label this class a gut or easy A. But definitely will get at least a B for putting in a decent effort.",
                "I would recommend this course---I think it teaches you a good foundation for future economic studies. However, I wish there was a little more lecture time spent explaining applications to everyday life. In the beginning of the class, the professor advertised that ECON 115 would help you read the newspaper better, but we never practiced that skill.",
                "I recommend this course to those curious about economics. It is a great introduction and has lots of help available.",
                "Yes, it was a great course for intro micro!",
                "I would recommend it only if you need to take it and are interested in the course. Barry makes the test very hard for no reason, while not fully teaching the concept well.",
                "It is a large lecture class with optional sections. The lectures are twice a week, and while they can be very informative, many individuals struggle to stay focused for the full hour and 15 minutes. Additionally, a similar trend can be seen in the sections where a large amount of individuals show up the first few weeks before that number quickly falls off around the first midterm.",
                "No, I do not feel as though I have learned immensely in comparison to other classes.",
                "Yes, I would. It is a straightforward introductory economics course. As someone with no experience in economics or anything of the sort, I felt that the course was structured very fairly to give everyone a chance to get on board. The course is not particularly rigorous and there are various resources (both within the scope of the course and online) that can supplement your understanding from the lectures.",
                "Of course I would. But I particularly would recommend it with the same professor since I think that big part of the success of this class is the particular professor who taught it.",
                "Yes you learn the basic and the math behind economics",
                "Yes, I think it is almost essential to the Yale experience to take 115. Almost every other person I talk to has taken the class. I think the skills that you learn can be applicable with whatever career you decide to pursue, and taking the introductory econ classes opens a lot of doors for future classes. The class itself is pretty boring IMO, but when you get the concepts down and are able to apply them, it's rewarding.",
                "Yes! It was a helpful introductory course.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who has prior knowledge of microeconomics.",
                "yes, if you are interested in econ, if you already have some background, this could be a gut class for you, but at the same time a bit boring",
                "Take it if you want a general overview of micro econ.",
                "Yes. Foundational class for any other economics class. Always good to have some exposure to economics.",
                "Yes, it was a very good intro class and easy to do well if you put in the time and work.",
                "good",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if it is required for a perspective major.",
                "I would recommend it to a certain type of student. If you're passionate about economics and learning, you will get a lot from this course. If you don't care and spend your time in lecture on your phone, you'll waste 1/36th of your Yale education. You have to be willing to do the work and put in effort  yes, it's just algebra, but it's harder than you would think when it's combined with econ. \r\n\r\nWARNING ON THE FINAL/GRADE STUFF:\r\nI would only recommend this course to a student who is willing to study effectively or is willing to credit-d-fail or get a B. I was so stressed about my grade and the final, especially because of the curve and the lack of support for this class, that I legitimately went to the McGivney church (he invented? insurance) and prayed regularly about this grade and I'm not even catholic. I needed an act of God to get an A in this class and he blessed me in the form of Microeconomics by Goolsbee, Levitt and Syverson. USE THE TEXTBOOK, DON'T TRUST YOUR PEER TUTORS OR YOUR TF'S OR THE UPPERCLASSMEN THAT TELL YOU THE TEXTBOOK IS USELESS!!!! I got a B on the first two midterms because I just went over my notes and the review problems and nothing else. The textbook explains things so well and there are so many excellent problems in there so you can get lots of practice in. I spent reading week in the library going through the entire textbook and it was so helpful I got a near-perfect final which brought my grade up to A-. Had I reviewed like that for the midterms and psets, I wouldn't have had to spend over 70 hours dying in the library about econ and I maybe could have gotten an A. Lastly, I would highly recommend getting a whiteboard and a little dry erase marker for reviewing and doing the math. It was so much more helpful than a notebook for some reason I loved it. If you don't make the same mistakes I did, you will slay this course and learn so much.",
                "Yes, it is a very helpful course for students looking to pursue Econ or if they are interested in the subject. The class is not particularly difficult nor does it require a large time commitment.",
                "I would! I gained really useful and applicable knowledge about the world that I use every day.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you have already taken microeconomics before.",
                "You kinda have to take it if you want to be an econ major so...",
                "nope. unless you for sure want to do economics. i ended up credit/d the class and was so happy when i didnt get a D. i have never felt this useless in a class in my whole life before. it is one thing being able to understand the context of the economics, but a whole other thing learning how to read a long paragraph and turning this into a graph or using a formula to solve the questions. not sure whether it was just me but i put a lot of effort into this class and just couldnt hack the way to answer the questions. felt extremely discouraging",
                "If you're interested in learning micro economics then this is a good intro course. Otherwise, unless it is required for your major, there is no reason to take it.",
                "Yes if they are interested in learning more about the fundamentals of economics.",
                "Well, you most likely have to.",
                "Depends. If you're a prospective Econ major/it's a prerequisite for another major, then of course. Or, if you're not sure if you want to study Econ but want to give it a try, then this is a pretty decent gateway course. It's a fairly straightforward class, which can be very helpful as a QR credit for Humanities majors. The material isn't too challengingI think you can get away with not TRULY understanding all of the material and still get an A.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I believe that everyone should take an economics course to better understand how economics plays a role in our everyday lives, from the way we make decisions to how we budget our time.",
                "Yes, I would because it is a good introduction to how intro classes would be like.",
                "No unless it is required for your major",
                "No. Unless a student needs it for a prerequisite, they will not learn anything that will help.",
                "Yes, I think this is a course that a lot of freshman take so I would definitely recommend.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it really sets the basis/foundation of modern day economics in a community viewpoint.",
                "This course was taught well. It's a very large class which removes the opportunity to get 1-on-1 teaching with your instructors, however, its size ensures that you'll always be able to find another student taking the class to study with wherever you are. \r\n\r\nI would recommend trying the smaller class-size version of this course instead, if possible.",
                "If they are interested in econ or pursuing a major with economics requirements, I would recommend this class. Although I haven't taken the seminar option so I don't have much to compare it to.",
                "Yes, I think it's a necessary first-year class. Also a good way to get a QR out of the way early.",
                "Yes. I think this course is useful to determine whether economics is a good fit for a student and they find it interesting enough to study further."
