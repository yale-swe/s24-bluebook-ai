I learned what college assignments and exams are like just as much as I learned about elements and Enthalpy.",

                "The course is great for covering the basics of gen chem but it is obviously a very rushed course at only 5 weeks.",
                "Dr. Cooper was a great teacher, really recommend trying to get him. I liked how the lectures were live on Zoom to allow for interaction with the class. Dr. Cooper is a good lecturer and is very considerate in terms of being willing to meet to answer questions. The discussion section quizzes felt fair and also improved my learning. The Tophat textbook is nice because it's interactive and the Tophat homework was great because it could give you live feedback to help come to the correct answer. The practice exams provided were also helpful. The discussion section lectures were often not helpful though. Something to improve the course would be more practice problems reviewed in class. Exams were often difficult and sometimes very nit-picky with the concepts tested, but on some level, it just comes with the nature of chemistry being a complicated subject. Perhaps allowing test corrections could be helpful.",
                "Strengths: the material was taught in a clear and concise manner with somewhat easy-to-follow in-class examples, the professor is also very clear and is very accommodating and understanding! \r\nWeaknesses: the homework and textbook is based on an online service (you have to pay over $75 for it, no getting around it). For a class with so much material to be taught in such little time, it's definitely very understandable to use this service than to have hand-graded material with human feedback, but it's still frustrating at times doing the hw since you sometimes get very unhelpful feedback",
                "Strenghts: good textbook, good professor (Dr. Cooper)\r\nWeaknesses: unpredictable difficulty of exams, too much material in too short a time frame",
                "This course provided a lot of information, however not much time to absorb it.  This is most likely because this was the summer version.  There were no tests on chapters (besides 3 question quizzes) which made it hard to determine what to study and what you already have memorized",
                "Everything was squeezed into one month so there was no time to process it all!!",
                "The midterms were a major time-crunch. Several people I talked to, myself included, had trouble finishing them on time. Take this with a grain of salt, because I haven't had many stem classes recently.\r\n\r\nThe main strength was Prof. Cooper's cheery and consistent presence! Great teacher, and the breakout rooms for section were a lot of fun. The online textbook and hw was also very painless, and you get 3 attempts on every hw problem which was a godsend.",
                "I think that the material is presented in an understandable format and was explained really well by Dr. Cooper. I do think the homework questions are a lot easier than the exam questions, and I think it could be helpful to have more exam style questions on the homework. Additionally, I think there was too much time spent on the simple concepts and the complex concepts like Lewis structures were done very quickly",
                "The course was very fast paced (given the short time frame) but I was still able to learn"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the course really helps explain some of the basic mechanisms that make life work. You'll also get to learn some pretty nifty science experiments to impress nieces/nephews and cousins.",

                "Sure -- if you have to take chemistry, Dr. Cooper is a great teacher for it!",
                "This course is definitely fast-paced and there is a lot of information thrown at you, and there's quite a few things you have to memorize as well, so it was overall pretty difficult. If you're looking to learn general chemistry for the sake of learning it and you have NO experience with chemistry, I recommend you take the fall/spring version. If you do have previous experience, this summer course not too bad but it's definitely not a walk in the park (daily hour-and-twenty-minute lectures, very condensed schedule)",
                "I think taking this course over the summer was really overwhelming, especially when doubled with the lab. It's so much, possibly too much, material to get through in a very limited time. I would spend about 8-9 hours on chemistry a day, between lecture, discussion section, lab, and homework for both classes, and that's not including weeks we had tests that we'd have to study for. I would strongly recommend either taking this class during the year or taking either lecture or lab, but not both at the same time over the summer.",

                "Definitely take gen chem with Professor Cooper. He's the nicest professor in the world, really clear with his expectations, and very understanding with students. Take gen chem for fun, even if you're not a chem major or premed!",
                "Yes, if they want to learn chemistry. I'm coming from a humanities background, and I thought that it was a good experience apart from the midterms. Much, much better than high school chemistry, and I think about gases and electrons all the time in my everyday life now (not sure if that's a good thing).",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but I would warn them that the workload is high because it is a fast paced summer course, and so there is a lot to understand in a small amount of time. I would definitely recommend having some basic chemistry background before taking this course.  But it is definitely doable and there is a lot of help available.",
                "Yes, it was a good opportunity to satisfy my prereq while also learning valuable knowledge",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, primarily because it is an introductory course and provides a pretty good foundation for not only chemistry but all of the sciences. The course was also taught pretty well, especially given the extremely condensed time frame."
