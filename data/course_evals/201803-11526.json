    "I was able to develop the ability to speak Portuguese more effectively and carry on a fluid conversation. My pronunciation greatly improved.",
    "I have learned many language & writing skills in Portuguese through the lenses of Brazilian culture. I feel prepared to hold a conversation about a broad range of topics, such as music, politics, and art. In addition, my reading has also improved tremendously, and I owe that to the professors' emphasis on learning how to interpret cronicas, small & simple novels.",
    "I learned how to write and communicate in Portuguese, more advanced conjugations, and evolved my vocabulary."

   "comments": [
    "The professors charisma and attitude are huge pluses for the course. The only weakness I would point out is the course textbook. Its lessons are great and clear, but the passages within it are a bit difficult to follow and convoluted at times.",
    "The professor really does an amazing job at keeping the students engage with the course through creative and fun activities. Besides just learning, we get to form relationships with classmates by getting to talk to them as a way of practicing our Portuguese. The events outside of class are also very stress relieving, and allows you to put the language skills learned in class to social interactions outside of class. The class could be improved by having more of these events, which really  helped me to get to know my professors and classmates better.",
    "It was very well organized to be engaging and fun while teaching a lot of material.  I loved it."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend taking this course. Level 3 Portuguese is a step up from levels 2 and 1, but it is definitely worth it as it provides you with the tools necessary to speak the language well.",
    "Totally. The professors are incredibly passionate about teaching that it actually makes you want to go to class even though it meets everyday. You get to learn so much, while having fun and that is so refreshening in a stress-driven environment like Yale.  I loved this class and I am sure you will too.",
    "I would, it is a very doable class that still challenges the students and allows them to grow."
