                "Fundamental mechanisms behind semiconductor devices and quantum mechanics",
                "I honestly did not expect what I learned in this course. I was expecting a deeper dive into renewable energies, specifically solar, but I will say I learned a ton in this course. Material mainly covers semiconductor physics, quantum mechanics, and then some solar stuff. I would honestly give this class a name closer to quantum mechanics than what it is called.",
                "This class was super interesting, even if the concepts were sometimes a bit too abstract to understand. Professor Qiu is a fantastic lecturer, her lessons are very clear and easy to follow. We learned introductory quantum mechanics concepts (band structures, Fermi level, etc) and how they relate to electrical conductivity. There was an emphasis on semiconductors and their importance as we try to move on to better forms of energy generation. The class is hard, but I think it's just due to the fact that these are all complicated subjects and not a reflection of Dr. Qiu's abilities as an instructor at all, she's great!!!"

                "Prof. Qiu is very helpful. I think the format of the exams and problem sets are ideal, so I would continue doing it like that (open book exams). The only point that I would improve is the alignment of the exam content with the problem sets. Although the content covered in the exams is somewhere in the lectures, I would greatly appreciate being tested on content covered in the problem sets. Perhaps the problem sets could be a bit longer?\r\nI also would have liked to have some clarity on the letter grade to point total conversion before the end of the semester.",
                "The course is amazing. Dr. Qiu is an outstanding professor and helps you perform your best in the course. The workload was rather manageable, and the take-home nature of the tests is helpful given the complexity of the course material. The lectures were also super interesting and engaging. I cannot think of any possible improvements to the course.",
                "I found the topics to be extremely difficult to understand, but Professor Qiu made them easier to understand. Office hours are essential for this class."

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course material itself was very interesting and more in-depth than that in general courses. Professor Qiu is also an outstanding professor and works hard to make sure you understand the material. The material can lead to assessments being a little difficult, but the grading scheme is generous at the end of the course. I really enjoyed the course, and I learned a great deal.",
                "I would only if you are interested in the semiconductor industry. If youre looking for an easy elective for the MENG degree, this is not for you. If you actually want to learn stuff, then take this course.",
                "Yes highly recommend, especially if with Diana Qiu.",
                "If you're into quantum stuff and materials science, yes!!!!! Also yes if you're interested in theory, since the class is mostly theory."
