    "I got better at utilizing and understanding statistical tools to understand social issues.",
    "This class is facilities understanding real-life statistical studies. As a social-science major, this class could not have been more helpful in understanding the papers in my field.",
    "I learned more about stats, which I had no experience in before.",
    "The course is a refresher in quantitative analysis and statistics",
    "Basic statistics",
    "AQA is a great introductory statistics course. I gained a solid understanding of basic statistics and linear regression, and also feel fairly confident in using Stata. Still, the emphasis of the course is very much on theory and hand\/calculator calculations we only use Stata in section, and it isn't tested in the final.",
    "Basic social science statistics.",
    "I learned about the principles of statistical analysis . I learned about the basics such as mean, median, and standard deviation. I also learned about how to calculate a confidence interval and significance test for various forms of data such as small samples, large samples, proportions, etc. We learned about testing specific values, comparing two values, testing for relationships, etc.",
    "Learned elementary statistical methods: point estimates, descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, significance tests, comparing quantitative and categorical groups, linear regression and tests of independence. Applied knowledge to social science experiments\/analysis. Definitely went into more detail on the second half of the course.",
    "Learned Stata\r\nConceptual clarity regarding the quantitative analysis methodologies\r\nLots of practice provided hands-on experience that enriched the learning",
    "I learned A LOT in this class. Taking the final, I was actually pretty excited just thinking about how much I learned this semester. \r\n\r\nJT does a great job making the material approachable and interesting. I learned about statistical significance tests, confidence intervals, tests of independence and more. \r\n\r\nThanks for a wonderful semester!",
    "lovely intro to deep understanding of stats, significance tests, etc!",
    "I learned to perform significance tests, regression analysis and use statistical methods to make inferences about a population. I also learned to use stata.",
    "I've learned exactly what JT had promised we would learn on our first day. I learned about how to conduct, examine, and analyze research. I took this course because I may want to conduct research at some point after graduation, and I wanted to learn more skills than I would in a basic intro stats course.",
    "The main takeaways I gained from the course were my enhanced knowledge of statistical methods and a refined understanding of critically thinking research studies. The latter I find to be most important, as being an intended STEM major requires a great deal of evaluating research critically and detecting areas of improvement or questionable assumptions in prior work. This course helped me understand how to find such features and remedy them.",
    "GLBL 121 taught me various methods of statistical analysis and the key assumptions necessary for these tests to be used with confidence. I learned the principles behind statistical analysis and how to implement these principles to the social sciences using the statistical package Stata.",
    "I learned a lot in this class. Having never taken statistics, and being generally averse to math, this class was a very comfortable and accessible introduction to a really important field. JT does a great job at making the material understandable. I learned how to do significance tests and linear regressions as well as just general theories that are helpful for understanding research methods.",
    "As someone who wants to do social science research after college, I gained an incredibly diverse skillset that will be quintessential in finding success as a researcher later on. Learning about how we can form and take conclusions from hypothesis testing and confidence intervals was very useful because I learned how to take large sets of data and take something away from them. This course was wonderfully taught and I learned a ton.",
    "This course primarily taught me how to evaluate the accuracy of the data and the interpretations drawn from that data in a researcher's work. It taught me how to make inferences about large groups of people from small samples and evaluate dependency between two groups in relation to a specific variable. I learned a lot about data analysis and how to use recorded information from surveys to draw conclusions about a give population.",
    "Descriptive and inferential statistics. Mostly focused on significance test on large and small samples, gamma, chi-squared, regression. Heavy emphasis on theoretical understanding, this is not a class where you can get away with just knowing the formulas.",
    "I learned a solid foundation about statistics. I took AP Stats in high school and this class was mainly the same material. However, I feel like I actually understand concepts like sampling distributions\/significance tests on a deeper level.",
    "Working knowledge of Stata, application of statistical methods in social sciences with insights on the underlying assumptions to draw sensible conclusions and make refined judgments. It was supposed to be refresher course for me but it really helped me hone my basics in stats.",
    "Understanding the language of statistical analysis, especially in the contest of social science. Familiarity with terms and concepts used to assess research.",
    "I learned what statistics was and how that relates to the real world and policy-making decisions.",
    "I learned all the basics of statistics: descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, significance tests, and regression.",
    "I took away an understanding of basic statistical tests for social science material with which I can either conduct tests myself or better understand the papers I read.",
    "You learn basic methods in statistics such as significance tests, chi squared analysis, regression analysis, and gamma tests. The methods are pretty straight-forward and you learn a little bit of theory behind each model as well.",
    "I learned a ton about the basics of statistical methods and became familiar with Stata. I feel much more equipped to read and evaluate research with this knowledge.",
    "You're probably taking this for global...so does it really matter what you learn?",
    "Stata and other technical skills",
    "basic statistical patterns and learned how to use stata.",
    "Introduction to statistics through application in psets and in class, mostly in a global affairs. Learned how to do basic coding\/stats in Stata",
    "You learn basis statistics.",
    "I learned how to use Stata. I learned lots of different methods of finding and interpreting statistics depending on different circumstances.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of statistical analysis, including some of the theory behind statistical techniques; I learned a variety of actual statistical techniques (confidence intervals and significance tests for means, proportions, chi squareds, gamma, etc.); I learned the beginnings of how to evaluate others' statistical work; and I learned how to use Stata to carry out statistical commands.",
    "Stats stats and stats and critical thinking about stats.",
    "This course helped create a solid statistics foundation from which I can grow.",
    "Different statistics methods and some of the reasoning behind them",
    "I learned how to read statistics on Stata and how data is interpreted",
    "Ive learned how to run various statistical tests used in social sciences. I feel like Ive learned content that is immediately useful to me in research and wish Id taken the class earlier.",
    "Basic statistics knowledge that is actually very helpful",
    "Basic statistics and Stata syntax",
    "I learned a lot about statistics and statistical methods.",
    "I learned basic statistics and how to use the statistics coding program STATA.",
    "A wide understanding of basic statistical techniques, especially the use of confidence intervals, significance tests, and STATA.",
    "This course provides a good basis for statistical analysis and thinking. From the basics, you learn all the way up to linear regression. JT seems to cut out a lot of statistics that would not be relevant to someone studying global affairs or political science.",
    "Basic introduction to statistics with heavy emphasis on how to interpret data.",
    "I learned basic stats analysis as well as the underlying theory used to explain why we conduct tests in the way that we do.",
    "How to deduce info of a population from a sample, how to use stata, comparing groups, means and proportions, etc... many skills!",
    "Learned a lot about the application of statistical methods to real life data. Makes you very aware of how to consume data put out my statisticians.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One big strength is JT. He's a really engaging lecturer and a helpful professor. However, the TFs were not particularly helpful.",
    "The strength of the course is JT's lecturing--he really makes the material understandable and easy to learn. The weakness, though this could be due to this particular year, was that towards the end, we sped through certain lectures and it was harder to grasp that material.",
    "Good intro course, at times moved a bit slow in class.",
    "The main strength of this course is definitely Professor Thomas! He makes class interesting, brings up relevant examples, and makes a huge effort to know every single person in the 100+ lecture! He also believes in fair midterms and exams, so expectations are very clearly laid out. It did feel like we rushed through some concepts and went really slow with others, but on the whole, lectures are easy to follow and the exams are fair.",
    "Strengths: JT is an all-around amazing guy who is very kind and makes the class interesting and fun (which is difficult to do because it's literally statistics). The material is presented fairly clearly in class through the power points, etc. The material is very applicable, especially for global affairs\/ social sciences people. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The support for the course was very weak. TFs were often confusing or vague in their answering of questions which made it VERY difficult to study for exams. The Psets were released very sporadically with different time limits and some were very long and redundant. In general, you had to really fight to get right answers to questions. The course wouldn't release right answers to psets, but then on our psets we are marked off points without being told what we missed, which doesn't make a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nIn general, I think this course should have a Piazza so students can ask questions whenever and receive answers virtually\/ more review sessions before tests held by JT himself.",
    "I was disappointed by this course. If I think about how much I learned over a 3.5-month period in other courses relative to AQA, it's so much less. We seemed to get so behind. If you have to move problem sets back by weeks, repeatedly year after year, something's up. Professor Thomas is a good resource, but I just think the class could be so much more than what it was.",
    "Strength: The teaching method of the professor is excellent. He explains the concepts many times and that is helpful in better understanding. The course is structured perfectly and the flow of the course is also perfect.",
    "I struggled in section because my TF was not very approachable.",
    "strengths: comprehensive psets, amazing teacher\r\n\r\nweaknesses: we didn't learn as much stata as i would've liked to considering i bought the program; very specific wording is required to the point where sometimes it feels better to memorize and mimic the professor's language than understand the concept",
    "Strengths: JT, very useful content, highly applicable.\r\nWeakness: grading of psets felt a bit subjective and not much feedback.",
    "Strengths - JT! He really cares and takes the time to answer everyone's questions in the 100 person + lecture course. The highlight is certainly his \"Life and Times\" stories before every lecture. \r\nWeaknesses - no clear feedback on the PSETs.",
    "Strengths: Very well taught, highly engaging professor, stress-free environment, instructor answered questions very thoroughly and made himself available, well prepared for examination, applicability of skills outside of classroom\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Course pace was a little iffy at times and could have been faster in the initial statistical skills and slower in the more complex statistical methods sections.",
    "The course did a very good job of covering a variety of methods of statistical analysis and their basic assumptions. Professor Thomas injected levity into his lectures and made learning about a subject matter that I am not confident in more interesting than I expected coming in to the course.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved through an additional review session before each exam and occasional (biweekly) summaries of the statistical methods that we learned, particularly in the second half of the course when we went over a number of significance test with different assumptions.",
    "What can sometimes be dry statistical topics were explained very well and JT's contextualization of statistical tests made them easier to understand and analyze.",
    "The strengths are easily the lectures. JT is very engaging and Ive been able to learn the most in lecture without having to address the textbook. The weaknesses are section and the problem sets. Section is not engaging. The problem sets are often very tedious and it is hard to see what the aim of doing the problem sets are. That being said the problem sets are very helpful in making the student apply the theories from class. I also think that one of the weaknesses is that we use Stata instead of R. I think we should be using R even if there is more of a learning curve because that would be more helpful in professional settings.",
    "AQA is one of the few classes at Yale that I have legitimately felt like I will revisit in the real world after graduating. The skills taught in this course are essential for anyone that wants to social science research, so that is definitely a strength. The tough part about this class is that it seems fairly chill in the first 2 months, and then it ramps up VERY quickly and becomes pretty intense without much build-up. Professor Thomas does warn the class that it is going to get difficult but the difference in difficulty between the midterm and the final shocked me. So if you take this class, do not be fooled by the first month and be prepared for when it gets a lot quicker and trickier. Also, the teaching fellows did not give clear feedback on the problem sets and would only put a mark if you got something wrong without writing what it is that you did wrong. And since Professor Thomas doesn't release problem set solutions, it became a guessing game and it was not easy to figure out what went wrong. Other than that, I really enjoyed the class.",
    "A strength would be the amount of practice done after certain material is taught in class. The problem sets are a great way to use the theory learned and apply it in practice. Having said that, however, some of the problem sets for this class have taken unreasonably long amount of time to finish. Moreover, evaluation of a student's work is very dependent on the way an answer is phrased which can be upsetting in the cases when you know the correct answer but did not explain it in the way the teacher expects it to be explained.",
    "Prof. Thomas did a good job keeping students engaged, explained topics well, and I enjoyed his lecturing style. However, we often fell behind and due dates were unclear\/postponed.\r\n\r\nThe biggest flaw of the class was definitely the sections. There was a huge disparity in experience based on which TA you had, with some students getting awesome extra help, review, practice problems, and quick responses to questions on the p-set and others mostly having to figure out the material on their own.",
    "I thought Professor Thomas did a great job of trying to really teach us the concepts behind the statistics and not just how to do statistics problems. The weakness for me was the sections\/stata portion of the class. I went to the first few sections and found them extremely pointless and I never felt like I learned stata at all. Every week, I would just look up super quickly how to do certain commands and never actually learned how to utilize stata. I think Professor Thomas could do a better job at teaching the Stata in class or at least creating a standardized stata curriculum for the sections. Also, another weakness was the feeback on the Psets. Professor Thomas did not post all the pset responses and expected us to look at our pset corrections to see what we missed. However, often times the questions I missed on the pset were just marked down without any explanation of what I did wrong. I think the class could be further improved by either posting all pset answers or providing actual feedback on the psets.",
    "Strengths: Excellent teaching methods, very encouraging and approachable Instructor, thorough coverage of the stat basics, great course to get started into Stata. Overall, it's a great course in statistics with focus on social sciences. \r\nWeakness: Syllabus could be expanded. Regression coverage a quite 'light touch'.",
    "The lecture slides and textbook together provided a nice overview of the concepts, and the problem sets served as good, albeit tedious and confusing, chances to practice the concepts. JT is a fun lecturer, but often took way too many questions, diluting the information and hindering the actual learning of concepts.",
    "This course is really great because it covers a lot about statistics within a really short amount of time. On that same note, it was kind of sad that we didn't get to explore certain topics in more depth because of what we needed to cover.",
    "In terms of the strengths of the course, JT is a great person - you can tell he really knows the material he is teaching and keeps students very engaged (which can be difficult to do - statistics is not the most exciting subjects). He starts every class by telling a personal story about his life which is always super funny. During his office hours, he is so helpful and tried to get to know every student's name in the class. In terms of the weaknesses, I found it hard to stay engaged, which resulted in me zoning out for many classes. Because of this, I allowed myself to fall behind, but the course's structure doesn't facilitate the \"catching up\" process. I wasn't able to make it to JT's office hours every week, and didn't have the best TF (if you take this course choose Brian he's the BEST). There was no Piazza for the course, which would have been INCREDIBLY helpful.",
    "Professor Thomas is a very engaged and caring professor and his lectures really helped me grasp the material! Overall, the distribution of content over the semester felt a little unbalanced- we had a lot more content in the second half than in the first. However in individual lectures, I always felt like Professor Thomas was very in tune with the needs of the class and would not rush through concepts if we were confused.",
    "Strengths are that the concepts are straight-forward and Prof. Thomas does a nice job explaining them both in technical terms and then in more digestible vernacular.  Weakness is that Prof. Thomas at times can be too thorough, causing the pace of the class to be a bit slow at times.",
    "JT is one of the best lecture professors I have ever had. He is funny, engaging, friendly, and manages to make a topic that can easily be taught in boring ways interesting and relevant. To improve the course I would suggest potentially having the work of the psets broken up so that they are shorter but due more frequently. When there was more than one week between psets I would come to lecture and pay attention but start falling a little bit behind in understanding because I wouldn't be reading the textbook or practicing what I was learning until the pset came around. To be fair, I should have been reading the textbook as assigned but it is hard to motivate when most of the info is said in class. Overall though, this is an awesome class and I'm so glad I took it.",
    "The pacing was all off so that the last half of the course was way too packed and rushed. The psets were too often tedious and repetitive, often taking 8 hours. For any student that hasn't had stats before, learning the material at the pace of this course was very hard. JT is cool and a good lecturer but it was just too much to try and comprehend at the pace of this course.",
    "Strengths: JT does a pretty good job of explaining the theory behind most of the concepts. Content usually lined up with the textbook pretty well. \r\nWeaknesses: PSETs were unpredictable in length & sometimes you would do the same type of problem multiple times, which isn't really necessary in a stats class where once you know exactly how to go about one type of problem, you know how to do every problem like that. \r\n\r\nAlso, he needs to release the solutions to psets before midterms\/final exams. The TAs aren't thorough enough in their grading for that to be the only available resource for correctly answering practice problems.",
    "Needs to be better structured- especially pace wise.",
    "Very strong course overall, but the repetition of it could be improved.",
    "Strengths: JT is a great teacher and the subject matter is useful. Psets are generally challenging but doable and prepare you for exams. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The biggest thing is that I thought the midterm and final were graded in such a particular way (especially qualitative questions that required specific wording to receive points) that it rewarded you for rote memorization from the textbook, rather than actually having an actual grasp on the subject matter.",
    "The class is very well organized and Prof. Thomas is amazing - however the discussion sections could probably be improved.",
    "Strengths: JT! The legend! In the flesh! Literally makes a boring subject super interesting and fun. Lots of student engagement. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Loonngggg psets. If you're shy like me, speaking up in class can be really intimidating which can be a setback especially if you're trying to establish a presence in the classroom",
    "I think this course needs to be seriously reorganized. The PSETs are not graded thoughtfully\/clearly -- and so you have no idea what you did wrong\/right, and then answers are never posted. Furthermore, you can't see the box plot for PSET grades on Canvas, so you have no idea how you are doing relative to your peers. There are also no past exams or useful practice problems posted prior to exams or any answers ever posted to know what type of answer the graders are looking for when it comes to the theoretical answers. In the class, it is also incredibly hard to follow when JT switches away from the actual slides to start drawing on a blank screen. The TAs are also not super helpful generally. We also don't learn Stata, but rather just learn specific commands we will forget in a week to hastily finish a problem set, so I don't see the purpose of that entire part. This was was overall a poorly structured course regarding super important but mostly dry material taught by a super interesting\/compelling\/engaging\/kind professor.",
    "Strengths: JT is a great professor. Brian is a 10\/10 TF. The textbook was very straightforward.\r\nWeaknesses: None of the other TFs were good except for Brian. JT and the other TFs should have more office hours. There weren't enough resources to help with PSets.",
    "I think the class was very cohesive insofar as psets corresponded very well with the lectures and sections, and we could trust that if we were going to be asked a question on the psets or exams, the answer would be in the lectures slides on canvas. Also, because of the nature of the material, the class built on itself throughout the semester, and JT did a good job of continuously reiterating some of the fundamentals as we went along. I do think the course could have benefited from some solution sets to all the psets.",
    "Sometimes slow, we would be behind on syllabus. Too much time answering students' questions, which were often repetetive.",
    "Some of the problem sets were very long while others were very short. It would be more consistent if the my were more even. Also, both the midterm and final are very heavily weighted. Perhaps introduce another sort of assignment like a project or our own study which requires us to apply the statistical tools we learn.",
    "Strengths: JT is a wonderful lecturer and a wonderful person \r\nWeaknesses: Stata is an annoying part of the psets, the psets were ridiculously long sometimes, and section was not organized well \r\nI think that if the psets were much shorter and we had one due every week, it might help us review the material on a daily basis and figure out our weak spots. Section should also be a space where we can do a few practice problems and ask questions about concepts so that were not clueless when it comes time to actually complete the psets. \r\nAlso, when it comes to figuring out what we got wrong on the psets, I was told to ask the person who actually graded the psets but its difficult to ask someone you dont know at all and someone whose schedule we dont know. It would definitely be better if our own TAs graded our psets so we could ask them directly.",
    "Strengths: started from the most basics of stats rather than starting at a level that assumed everyone had taken stats in high school, used real-life examples in homework and during class\r\nWeaknesses: the professor, the disorganization, and the waste of 30 minutes of class time just answering questions when they would soon be answered later in the lecture or in the course",
    "JT is an excellent lecturer and he engages with the students very well. The materials are taught well and the exams are fair. On the other hand, the sections felt less organized. Often times, the section materials would not be posted to Canvas on time. I felt that the TAs didnt do a good enough job communicating with each other.",
    "Like any lecture, some of the classes seem like you are just trying to get through the information  but JT does all that he can (really, all all all that he can) to make the class interesting, engaging, and to allow everyone to understand what is happening",
    "Problem sets did not improve understanding and were quite tedious.\r\n\r\nThe lack of clear feedback on problem sets and exams and lack of solution sets required much independent learning and uncertainty regarding course expectations",
    "The strength of this course is that it taught us an applicable subject and it wasn't overly difficult. The professor was funny and very approachable, and his quirks during class such as his stories at the beginning of class, or his jokes about falling asleep, etc., and his efforts to always make the material applicable, interesting, useful, and even funny, were much appreciated! You can tell that this professor really cares about teaching us, and is a very kind person. His office hours are useful and he has many opportunities to meet, and the class and exams were at a good level of difficulty, where it was challenging but not unreasonable. \r\n\r\nSome weaknesses--the professor tended to belabor easier points or topics at the expense of more complex ones. I felt myself zoning out several times as the professor would repeat the same points over and over, usually on easier topics that most of us learned in basic high school math. Then, he would run out of time over the more complex points, and rush over them, which we would miss. This wasn't very effective. Also, when students would ask questions, he would often ask the question back to other students. This on principle is a good idea, but didn't work in practice in a large lecture hall, as the original question or point would get lost or convoluted, and it was difficult to follow the train of thought. Overall, the largest weakness was organizational. We frequently ran out of time for subjects, and homework would also not get handed back in time, not allowing us to learn from our mistakes. The expectations for responses in this class also weren't standardized (eg. for long-answer questions), which led to confusion. Also, we often didn't learn the required STATA or required material to do the p-sets, which also led to confusion and difficulty that could have been easily cleared up\/wasn't beneficial to our learning. These last two points might have been in the domain of the TAs, however, and not the professor, though the professor could have clarified expectations for responses\/answers\/p-sets.",
    "The class was very organized and Justin Thomas was an amazing professor.",
    "The homework was extremely time consuming and rather difficult, but it also did a very good job at teaching the concepts and helping us retain information. The professor and TAs were also readily available to help with it. STATA could've been covered a little more during lecture since TAs didn't always cover it very well. Aside from this, it was a rather enjoyable class, and JT is good at teaching things in a way that makes a lot of sense!",
    "This class provides a great overview of statistics and JT is a good professor who is extremely fair and kind. You will learn a good deal in this course and all of the information is very applicable to other courses and everyday life. WEAKNESSES - The PSETs were often released late and you had less time to work on them. Furthermore, getting information back on your tests and psets was a tedious process.",
    "Strengths: well organized, JT is a fantastic and engaging lecturer who really cares about his students, problem sets are not weekly, exams are fair",
    "The material is taught well by JT, but the most important material, the theory, is only said aloud during class and is nowhere to be found on the slides. It is crucial that you are a good note taker to do well in the class. This class is also quite unorganized, the TAs hardly understand the material, JT is incredibly inaccessible and almost never replies to emails in a timely manner, and the feedback is unclear. Problem sets take almost 15 hours to complete and TAs write one or two lines of feedback at most. Moreover, no answer keys are provided, so it is impossible to really gauge how well you understood the material. Grading is also really behind. For example, I have yet to receive my final grade and they were due for all of Yale University two days ago.",
    "No weaknesses. JT is an amazing, clear, and fair professor. He made the class engaging and fun. Love the life and times. Brian chung TF was amazing too.",
    "Psets can be super long and repetitive. JT is amazing and makes the material super interesting even though its nature is not.",
    "The strengths were the lectures and how JT managed to keep everyone engaged. Something that could be improved is increasing the availability of office hours.",
    "The strengths are that the notes are well done and I think the classes were paced well. Weaknesses were that the TAs provided little help and there was never really a clear guideline on what sections were supposed to be covering.",
    "Compared to other introductory statistics courses, this course teaches you how to code with Stata which other classes do not. The pace and structure of the class are very good to facilitate student understanding of the material. One weakness of the course is that because there is so much material to cover per lecture, sometimes the class won't finish a lecture's material in one class period.",
    "I believe that the course started a tad too slow, but ramped up quite significantly. The material could have been more spread out.",
    "The lectures are very good and engaging; I thought the TFs were quite poor and didn't really answer my questions. The exams were so-so but I would've liked more review sessions for them. JT is the bright spot of the course; he's a great lecturer.",
    "I honestly loved this course. Im not normally one to feel very comfortable in STEM courses but the progression of course material was really helpful. The fact that we kept using the same concepts of confidence intervals and statistical significance but with new methods was really intuitive.",
    "The professor is extremely engaging and cares a lot about each of the students understanding the material. However, the sections were not so helpful.",
    "Strengths were the lectures and that the problem sets correlated well with what we were learning in class. The only weakness was that I wish the TA office hours were more structured",
    "There were interesting examples and it provided useful skills. The homework lacked clear feedback or available model answers.",
    "I think this course was weakened by its focus on depth rather than breadth. Many points were hammered home too much, and we tried to get into really weird theoretical places that I think ended up confusing students a lot more than helping them understand the material. Stats is hard to teach because you don't just want students walking away with formulas, but also don't want to overwhelm them with theory. This class tried to strike that balance, but I think ultimately came up short. However, JT is a genuinely awesome guy and I really enjoyed his style of lecturing, even if at times it was overwhelming and theoretically confusing.",
    "The strength of this course is that it's the best it could be given that statistics is generally a dry subject. The kinds of real data we apply theory and learning to is really interesting  often related to social patterns and political issues. Besides, Justin Thomas is a great professor, explains things very well and is overall just a super cool guy. Of course the class was boring a lot of the time and required a good amount of time to do the psets  but this is what one expects when doing a statistics class. But it's often pretty interesting and is taught very well, which really says something considering the material is hard to learn and not inherently interesting. And you'll leave feeling like you've learned A LOT in just a semester, and these are skills that I think are really important for almost anyone in today's data-driven world."

   "comments": [
    "If you need a QR, it's not terrible but it's not great either. I would recommend it relative to other stats courses though.",
    "This class is AMAZING!!! I am a student who really dislikes STEM classes. I have never felt confident in STEM classes, but this was an exception. JT is a phenomenal professor who lectures in a way that is very accessible to non-math oriented students. Would highly recommend to any other student. The midterm and final are very similar to PSETS, there are no surprises.",
    "I think there are better stats classes at Yale, but if you have to take it it's not horrible. The psets really vary in the time it takes to complete them, which can be frustrating. But the midterm was fair.",
    "Not really, unless it's required for their major.",
    "If they need it for GLBL or another form of requirement then yes, but it was not inherently all that interesting.",
    "I think most students taking the course are taking it for Global or EP&E requirements but I would recommend it to all students! The material we cover is very relevant to any consumer of research and statistics, and the class is taught in a way that is accessible to all majors.",
    "Yes if you're interested in the global affairs major. If you are interested in stats in general, there are probably other statistics courses that are more holistic or applicable to other fields.",
    "If you have to take it for Global or EP&E, then you have to take it. And it's still a fairly good QR credit. But honestly, the class was disappointing. If you're actually interested in statistics or data science and you want to learn it effectively and efficiently, this might not be the class for you.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Take this class for an AWESOME way to learn about statistics in social science research.",
    "YES! i have taken AP stats and stats 230 and yet this class was the first time i truly understood stats deeper than surface level formulas. jt is a great professor and thoroughly covers all material.",
    "Yes, the content is highly useful and the professor is fantastic.",
    "Yes! Just be aware that the course picks up after the midterm. It was fairly easy-sailing until then, but after the midterm, and starting around pset 4, things certainly pick up! Also, I do recommend it even if you don't have to take it and are not a prospective global affairs or EP&E major. I am a history major - and a senior - and quant is certainly not my speciality, but I've learned a lot and I don't regret taking it! Definitely learned practical skills that I am excited to apply after I graduate.",
    "Definitely would recommend. The instructor is highly engaging and motivated, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning in part due to his character. The course captivated my interest due to the applicability of skills and due to the instructor.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in applying to the Global Affairs major, or anyone who has a general interest in understanding mathematical analysis as it applies to social policy. Conversation with peers have suggested to me that GLBL 121 covered theory and the inherent assumptions behind various methods of statistical analysis in more depth than the introductory statistics courses offered at Yale. To me, this was extremely useful as while conducting a significance test or a similar statistical method can be done using basic commands in any statistical package, a computer will not understand if the basic assumptions of the test have been met.",
    "Yes, it is a great way to learn some important and useful statistical tools which are relevant to many fields, especially in the social sciences.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any students at Yale that are interested in digesting research but are not interested so much in math.",
    "It is a required course for students who want to study social sciences. When it comes to recommending it to a student who wants to gain a good basic understanding of statistics, I would probably recommend another stats class in which more time is being spent exploring each big concept in quantitative analysis.",
    "More interesting than an intro stats class, JT is great. Hopefully TAs are better next time.",
    "Yes! If you are new to statistics or have the little background this is a great course! I took AP Stats in high school and the material covered in this class is pretty much exactly the same. However, I feel like I now have an actual understanding of the statistics we use in the class and could apply it much better to real world issues if needed. If you are looking to learn stata, however, this class will not teach you anything unless you go out of your way to learn it.",
    "The course starts with the basics of the sampling and normal distributions and then keeps building on brick by brick with each assumption and reasoning behind the assumptions, discussed and explained in detail by the Instructor. The discussion sections are more relaxed and allow one to get comfortable with working on Stata. The workload is decent and allows fair consolidation of the concepts. There are seven to eight problem sets, each has a stata section, midterm, and end-sem exams, but overall it is quite manageable.",
    "As someone who isn't a global major, I do feel like I gained a better understanding of the concepts used to analyze research, which I will definitely encounter and benefit from in future courses. The class was pretty disorganized and the problem sets could be painfully tedious. If you're a prospective global major, then you don't really have a choice. If not, then know what you're getting into, but there's no reason not to take it.",
    "Yes! I really think that this class is very important for anyone who wants to get a basic understanding of statistics, but also understand how it relates to the real world.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're a global major (because you need it) and if you need a QR that isn't too bad. While I took the course, I thought it was really difficult, but realized in studying for the final that it's not bad at all. Plus, JT is great. Just know that statistics as a subject field isn't the most eye-opening, exciting thing but JT really tries his best to make it so! If you're looking for an intro stats course, this is a great one to take.",
    "If you are interested in pursuing a social science field, especially if you would later like to do research, this course will cover the basics. It is a good introductory course with strong teaching.",
    "I would recommend this course to students looking for a QR credit and a solid introduction in statistics. I had no prior knowledge whatsoever of stats so this course was great to establish a solid foundation.",
    "I never thought I would enjoy or get so much out of a QR. JT is the best stats professor at Yale. I feel like I've learned skills that I can actually apply to my major (poli sci) and I think I am much more equipped to read and evaluate research. Doing well in this class isn't hard if you do the work. The psets can get very long, especially if you wait until the last day and didn't learn much stata in section, but they are all manageable. My biggest tip: before the exams, read the textbook chapters as review. People that can execute the formulas perfectly well can get really marked down by definitions. If you read and take notes on the textbook and note the conceptual stuff (their are always a few qualitative questions on exams, like on the psets) it is really not hard to do well. I suck at math and did well in this class.",
    "Yes- only if it is a prereq for your major. Otherwise, take econometrics.",
    "If planning or taking Global yes.",
    "Yes, if you need a QR and are in the social sciences, this is a doable course that is actually useful.",
    "Yes",
    "I mean if you wanna do global, you gotta do it; like all the other prereqs, it's a lot of work but I've been told it'll all be worth it in the future so that's something. The midterm and final are ROUGH. You definitely need to work hard on the psets to pull your grade up, but they're pretty straightforward if you pay attention in class. If you're on the fence between this class and another, I'm telling you it's worth it solely b\/c of JT. DONT BUY THE TEXTBOOK ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY",
    "I would definitely not recommend this course unless you need it for the credit. JT is a great lecturer, but the material is dry\/the course is not well organized for learning\/the TAs are not super helpful.",
    "Yes and no. I would recommend this class to students who have the time to put in the work to understand the material well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone looking to learn some stats. This was my first stats course and I took it just because I wanted to learn statistics, and JT makes the course very accessible while ensuring that you really are learning a wide range of useful concepts and techniques. Also, I found the Stata component to be really cool and useful, and definitely not all introductory stats courses --in fact I think few stats courses in general other than maybe methods in quantitative soc--will teach you Stata.",
    "Yes, I would. This course is essential to any students college curriculum, regardless of their subject of study. It teaches you how to think critically about the data that ingest everyday through the news and media.",
    "Yes, if you plan on applying to the Global major and if you want to do some research in the future. This course was a great introduction to applied statistics and I will definitely remember the concepts Ive learned when I read research papers in the future.",
    "Only take this if you need it as a requirement for a major, PLEASE do not take this just for fun or for some intro; go to intro to stats instead. The professor and the TAs didn't communicate very well and the problem sets were HORRIBLY long and tedious",
    "If you want to conduct research in any capacity, this class will lay the foundation for you.",
    "Would recommend it to anyone who needs basic stats knowledge",
    "No. The course, especially as one where wording must be precise and concepts contain much nuance, requires clearer forms and methods of student feedback.",
    "Yes, I would if you need it for your major, or you're interested in learning international relations-applicable statistics.",
    "Yes if they are trying to become a Global Affairs major. If not, it was definitely very challenging and there could be other classes to fulfill a QR requirement that could be more interesting.",
    "Yes, if you need any kind of statistical knowledge - which you likely will if you'd like to do any research or a senior thesis. It's a clear and fun way to understand the basics.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who is interested in global affairs and political science. If you are someone who is very interested in SDS, I am sure there are better intro classes. Overall, it was an informative class with a wonderful professor.",
    "Yes. If you need a stats requirement, I highly recommend taking a stats course with JT",
    "If you are applying to be a Global Major, yes. If not, take a better organized statistics course.",
    "YES 100%. Super useful course and JT made me love statistics. Everyone should take this course.",
    "Yes! If you want to learn statistics this is the best introductory class to take.",
    "I would recommend if the student wants to learn the basics of statistics in a way that ties together math with policymaking.",
    "Yes! It's challenging but I felt like I really learned a lot after each assignment. Statistics is a useful tool in your toolbelt no matter what you do. JT is also hilarious and very helpful at his personal office hours.",
    "Yes, even if you are not a global affairs major, this course is a really good introduction to statistics for the social sciences.",
    "Yes, to gain a basic and thorough understanding of beginning statistics",
    "Yeah, JT is a great professor and he teaches statistics in a way that is really easy and intuitive. I didn't love the exams, but you'll have crappy exams in every stats intro course so you might as well take it with JT.",
    "This course really made me love statistics. Its a very kind introduction to seemingly dry material. JT makes the material feel real and interesting. I definitely recommend to all students, not just global.",
    "Yes, you will learn what you signed up to learn. Professor Thomas makes the material, which is frankly quite dull, engaging.",
    "Yes I would recommend this to anyone interested in further understanding data analysis through statistics",
    "JT is an engaging professor and GLBL121 is a good introduction to quantitative analysis that is required for global affairs.",
    "If you have to take this class, take it -- if you don't, there are other stats classes or QR credits that might do you better. Ultimately, I think the teaching assistance was abysmal, the feedback was essentially non-existent, and with the exception of J.T.'s office hours, additional help was hard to come by. While I love J.T. personally, and while I really enjoyed his stories, I found the class unnecessarily complicated and theoretical, to the point where I didn't really get what was happening at all and every lecture just felt increasingly confusing and abstract.",
    "I would be careful about taking this course unless you want a rigorous introduction to statistics. Be aware that feedback can be unclear and incomplete depending your TF."
