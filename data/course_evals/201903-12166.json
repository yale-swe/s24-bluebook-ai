    "This was my first German course ever, as I only knew how to talk German but not how to write, and it was everything I could have asked for.",
    "This course helped to solidify my confidence in written and conversational German, especially with adjective endings and usage of the genitive case.",

    "The study of multiple different cities in the German speaking world made this course thoroughly enjoyable, and really brought the cultural aspects to light.",
    "I feel like there is a lot of \"busy work\" homework outside of class, and I feel like I would have had more time to personally study the things I actually needed if I had not had to do the Quia and the Journal and the Journal comments etc. I am not sure if these really helped improve my German.",
    "The structure of the course and the teacher (Thorsten Wilhelm) were perfect to engage me in course. I was always happy to get up and go to class in the morning."

    "For sure. Anyone who is interested in German should take this if they hope to become much more fluent",
    "If you want to get better at German, definitely take the class. I think Yale has great language courses, and my German is really good considering I started learning it two years ago!",
    "Definitely, this was my favourite course of the semester. Very engaging and even fun with a small class size.",
    "Yes. Thorsten is amazing; a super easy person to learn from, accessible in and outside of class for endless questions, and capable of conducting a class that was lovely to start my day with every day. The material was well-distributed over the semester and it was fun to learn about different German cities and the arts. The final project and two short papers are quite easy and the workload each week was doable but not busy work in that it wasnt helpful. The grammar throughout the course is palatable as well."
