                "Professor Quint's class further developed my close reading, writing, and discussion skills, giving me insight into how to view literature that was as fascinating as it was instructive. His feedback was very detailed, and helped not only with the structure and prose of my essays but also with the methods of analysis I was using.",
                "My close-reading skills and writing efficiency are tremendously improved. I can finish a huge amount of reading and put together an essay much faster than before, and I learned how to use textual details to support my thesis. Ive came to know the classics of the Western Canon, how they influence each other, and how they still influence us today.",
                "This course has taught me very valuable close-reading and writing skills. It has also provided me with insights into the most important literature that the ancient world has to offer.",
                "Professor Quint is masterful at teaching; this course taught me close reading to a level I have never done before. I do not think I will ever be able to approach a piece of literature the same way again.",
                "A close reading of ancient and medieval literature; works include the Homeric epics, parts of the Old and New Testaments, Virgil, Ovid, Dante, Greek tragedies, Sappho, etc.",
                "I learned how to think more analytically and form more sophisticated and organized arguments. I greatly improved my writing skills in this course. Professor Quint's wealth of knowledge and wit made each text we studied vibrant and exciting. Through him, I learned how to read a text not only for information, but for deeper meaning. I learned to consider both the text itself and the historical background surrounding its creation when analyzing pieces of literature.",
                "Critical thinking, close reading, intricate textual analysis, writing skills, knowledge of literary devices, engagement in the seminar environment.",
                "I learned so much from this course. Entering college, I thought I knew how to be an English student. I spent high school at the top of my English classes, reading books mostly for plot and being proud of the fairly shallow analyses I could come up with. I wrote 5 paragraph essays where I came up with a thesis first and crammed all my evidence into that idea. And I thought that was doing it well. DS Literature taught me how to be a true reader and changed my entire framework of thinking. Reading on such a deeper level, understanding the purpose of every word, the structure, the connections across works. On the second day of classes David Quint told us that the difference between literature and reality is that in literature, every single thing exists for a reason. I will carry that mindset with me throughout my time in college and the rest of my life reading."

                "The three-week essay structure seems to serve to break up the course content more than it does test it. I feel like the emphasis on the essays made me at times feel disengaged from that week's reading.",
                "I think DS is the best Yale can offer for first-year students interested in the humanities. Although the pace of the program doesnt allow you to go too deep into the material, I found many lectures highly inspiring and most discussion sections extremely fruitful. Overall, DS provides a solid foundation for whatever you hope to pursue later. \r\nSometimes DS sections have different pace so that the timing for lectures is not always perfect. For examples, once the lecture came after we already finished discussing the book in seminars. I wish the program overall could coordinate this better. Also, sometimes I wish the lectures could provide more historical background instead of diving directly into the texts. Most of the time, I have to do it on my own in addition to the already tremendous reading workload.",
                "I loved the literature track of DS; it was my favorite, and I can't think of any improvements!",
                "Perfection.",
                "Strengths: strong sense of camaraderie with fellow students and Professor Quint. Classroom climate was relaxed, warm, and engaging. I learn a lot in every single class. No class is ever boring. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of.",
                "Its very engaging, because we get lectures once a week from world renowned scholars and then also get to break the texts down further with our peers and brilliant professors. Its a very surface level dip into the specific canon of literature it aims to cover, but I believe thats the intention.",
                "While this is maybe unavoidable with Directed Studies, I do wish we could have gone more in detail on some of the texts instead of racing through so many. We had many class discussions in which Professor Quint had to move us along faster than he would have liked, informing us of how much more there was to cover. It also made the task of reading everything in time for class, for me personally, almost impossible, forcing me to prioritize and not always finish the readings which held me back from appreciating some of the texts the way I wish I could have."

                "Absolutely. While Professor Quint will unfortunately be retiring this semester, DSand DS Literature specificallyis a fantastic way to build skills necessary to succeed as a student of the humanities at the college level.",
                "I would recommend DS wholeheartedly, but ONLY to students who are truly interested in the content itself. If you merely came for your strike of ego (for the admiring look you get from your non-DS peers when you say you are doing DS, and trust me, you do get it), you really dont have to do this to yourself. The workload is not insane. In fact, its pretty expectable and manageable. Still, it is A LOT. If I didnt enjoy the content, I wouldnt have made it through the semester. That being said, DS is definitely a highlight of my first semester. Ive enjoyed it so much both inside and outside the classroom. Ive made my best friends in the DS community. Im so glad I chose to take it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Not only are the skills and knowledge learned from it valuable, but the class is fun and engaging.",
                "I would recommend Directed Studies in general to many students, and the literature track was my favorite. Professor Quint is retiring, and I feel so lucky to have had him during his final semester teaching.",
                "Yes. without doubt.",
                "110% YES! I honestly don't know what I would've done if I didn't take DS this semester. DS is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to read books you otherwise would never get exposed to. The DS community is constantly looking out for students and providing us with a myriad of resources to support our learning. The books, the lectures, the discussions, the professors, the students, the essays, the exams, the learning, the sense of community and camaraderie -- all were amazing.",
                "Absolutely. Rarely do courses offer this kind of a broad look into the great works of western literature with the ability to discuss them in small group settings.",
                "I would, but it is a very high workload and very high stress. I think students should know that the constant pressure of weekly papers does significantly impact freshman year. However the insight I gained into how to read, understand and appreciate texts, express my ideas in class and through my writing, and the life lessons I learned from the books themselves, are invaluable. I woke up excited to go to this class and to do my reading for it, even if it was a bit daunting at times."
