    "This class made me consider more seriously the use of the word fascist as an insult, and it made me evaluate whether contemporary political trends point towards a fascist direction or not. Hint: there are no right answers!",
    "I learned a lot about fascism which I had never learned about before. It was really a fascinating and in depth study of the topic that applied it in many contexts I did not expect.",

   "comments": [
    "I wish the grading had been more transparent\/frequent. I haven't received grades\/feedback since before spring break, when we had only submitted 2 of 6 reading responses. For this reason, even after submitting my final paper, I have no real idea of how I did\/am doing in the class. However, I think the class placed less emphasis on assignments overall and more on engagement in discussions and thinking through the concepts. I much prefer this model of learning, that puts learning before grading, but I also would have liked to at least have some idea of my progress.",
    "too many long ass reading responses",
    "The single biggest strength is the complexity and length of the readings. The readings are super dense, and oftentimes I feel like I was reading for quantity over quality. I found myself having to skim more often than doing close-reading. Other than that, the class is fascinating and Aaron is a super insightful instructor.",
    "I wish we had had more opportunities to get feedback on our reading responses because we wrote a lot of them, but I felt that I had relatively no way of knowing if I was making progress in the course or how my ideas and responses could have been improved.",
    "I really enjoyed the class overall and thought we had a good class dynamic.",
    "Excellent syllabus with insightful readings every week. The workload is sightly heavy with 6 long reading responses due throughout the semester, but all in all manageable. It might be better to have symposiums spread throughout the semester rather than crammed all at the end so we have a change to know each other better beforehand. That said, I love the format of the symposiums."

    "Yes! Aaron is a great seminar leader, and I absolutely loved the three student-led seminars at the end of the semester. I felt that we were really able to take charge of our learning as students, and class was super fun. I was excited to come to class every Monday, and the two hours always went by so fast because everyone was so engaged.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this course, just know what you're getting yourself into. The readings and reading responses can be lengthy, but they are SO worth it. I looked forward to this class every Monday, and it felt like everyone else in the class felt the same way. Discussions were always fruitful, and I got the feeling that if class were longer, we would still have plenty more to say. Aaron was a great discussion facilitator, and he always made mention of things that we hadn't even considered, prompting even more complex conversations.",
    "I really would!",
    "Yes. This course is critical to how I view the world and my place in it. It forces me to question my underlying assumptions and shakes me from my comfort zone of passivity when I engage with the world. The content we learn does not just stay in the classroom but follows us wherever we go. Definitely recommend."
