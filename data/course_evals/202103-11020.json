This course sets a very firm foundation if you plan to pursue French further. The professors are lovely and the small class size made for a conducive learning environment.\r\nSections meet every day, though, and there is homework every day so the time commitment is very high.",
                "A strength is the variety of ways the content is presented. I enjoy learning through the video because it makes the concepts in class seem less abstract as we see them used and analyzed by French speakers. In the workbook, these concepts are elaborated on, and in class our conversations and lectures allow for clarification and further questions. A weakness of the course was at times the pace, since some weeks would have two chapters to cover and other would have one. Weeks with two chapters were harder to ask questions about since there was double the content.",
                "It's taught entirely in French, which can be very confusing to learn.",
                "This is a very fast-paced course, which is a strength in that you learn a lot of material. However, it can also be a challenge to cover multiple (dense) chapters per week.",

The teaching method is very effective for learning the language and gives students the ability to ask questions on the subjects they are interested in.",
