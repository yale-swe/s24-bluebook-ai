   "comments": [
    "Learned about different types of modal logic, the mathematical differences between them, different interpretations of their meaning, and problems surrounding the use of modal logic in philosophy.",
    "I developed a better understanding of philosophical terminology and symbols. I learned how to incorporate them into my own arguments and my own writing. I of coursed learned a lot about modal logic. I had not been introduced to this sort of logic before this course, but I now believe that I have a solid grasp on the subject matter.",
    "Modal Logic deduction.",
    "I learned to perform modal calculus and I learned about the philosophical debates surrounding modal\/quantified modal calculi",
    "An understanding of the complexities of modal statements, especially as to how they relate to classical logic and what particular metaphysical and epistemic consequences they have.",
    "A good background in Modal theory and skill in formal logic.",
    "I learned a lot about philosophical argument structure and about how logic works on a deeper level than I'd thought about before.",
    "You learn exactly what the course name describes: modal logic.",
    "This class teaches you about necessity and possibility in a way that's both rigorous and informative. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a *necessary* course for philosophy majors, but a lot rests on what's \"necessary\" and \"possible,\" especially in metaphysics and metaethics. If you're planning to take classes in (or doing further work in) those subjects, taking this class is a great idea. It will enrich and clarify your understanding of modality, something which can often be a fuzzy and elusive topic otherwise.\r\n\r\nAlso, Sun-Joo is amazing."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: course notes, sun-joo is a great and knowledgeable lecturer.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: its hard to stay engaged for 110 mins straight",
    "Sun-joo organized the material well, and provided great notes to guide us in the learning. She also does a good job of lecturing and answering questions during class. Would've been nice to see some more consistent homeworks throughout the semester, as there were very few assignments, but the assignments were good and did test our overall understanding of the material.",
    "I think that this class as a seminar is a strength. The professor does an excellent job of providing weekly lecture notes that allow students to focus on following along in class instead of rushing to scribble notes down. I think that the professor does a great job of engaging students as well tho I think that a slightly smaller class and more discussion involving students would be appreciated.",
    "A TA would be helpful. So would a textbook.",
    "It does not always feel like there's a ton of continuity between the lectures, psets, and readings, but they're overall engaging.",
    "As always, Porfessor Shin's organization and clarity are both very much the strength of this course. Perhaps more discussion of papers in class would have been more ideal, both to justify the fact that this class is a seminar and to have interesting discussion about the philosophy behind modal logic (which would have helped for the final paper).",
    "Very well taught and interesting.  Honeworks were fair and helpful but a few of the questions were somewhat tedious.",
    "This is a really strong course in general. Good mix of writing and problem sets.",
    "This class was given as a once a week 2 hour lecture.  I think this should have been twice a week as a one hour lecture.",
    "This class was excellent. As with all her classes, Sun-Joo typed up and distributed easy-to-follow lecture notes which covered everything you could need to know. And when it came time to write papers, she provided an excellent guide to choosing a topic, as well as links to the relevant papers which you need to read and cite. She makes it easy to be a good student, while still holding you to a high standard.\r\n\r\nAnd she also teaches hard material, at a good pace, well. If I have one criticism, it's that this class was a seminar, but opportunities for discussion were limited. Despite her well-intentioned efforts to prompt conversation, this class wasn't really taught in traditional seminar style. Part of that is just the limitations of the subject matter, and part of it is that she's a natural-born lecturer, and an excellent one; leading discussion doesn't come naturally to her, I think. That said--an amazing class all around."

   "comments": [
    "I think you have to be pretty interested in the material, but if you are then you will probably like the course, as it provides a fairly rigorous examination of modal logic.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in philosophy, math, or linguistics. The mode of thinking in this course is applicable to these three subjects.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in modal logic and its applications.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to somebody who has an interest in logic. Otherwise, the material would probably not be very interesting to them.",
    "Yes! Prof. Sun-Joo is great at what she does!",
    "I would recommend Professor Shin's classes to anyone, major or non-major. To understand the attempts that were made in analytic philosophy to pinpoint what exactly is logic and how to codify it is to understand the potential of human intellect. Also, a modal logic class is a very interesting boundary point between pure logic and the beginnings of linguistics.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in formal logic.  If you like Sun-Joo's other courses you will like this one too.",
    "Yes. It's a very interesting field with important implications on how we think about truth.",
    "You should probably take any class with Sun-Joo.",
