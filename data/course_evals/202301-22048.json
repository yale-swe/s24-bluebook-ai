                "A detailed understanding of a peerless period in Iberian history, including of customs and artistic conventions that may have been imitated but never quite replicated in the centuries that followed. A focused approach to close readings of poetry, and a great appreciation for their translation and music across different languages.",
                "History of Jews in Muslim Spain, development of secular Hebrew poetry, major Hebrew poets of the period",
                "I learned a ton about the Hebrew poetry in Muslim Spain, but I also learned about the process of translation and what it means to write a poem or read a poem.",
                "I learned so much about poetics and analyzing poetry, traditional forms of Arabic and Hebrew poetry (and their engagements with scripture and other sources), as well as the history of Andalusia.",
                "This course introduced me to an entirely new body of literature and poetry, introduced me to literary theory, and also gave me important historical background.",
                "Anything and everything about the great Hebrew poets of Al-Andalus.",
                "I knew pretty much nothing about this region or subject matter coming into this class, but I learned so much about the political circumstances of the time and how to approach writing and talking about this unique form of poetry. I came away with a good understanding of the recurring themes and references and the defining characteristics of the genre as well.",
                "I learned a ton about this generation of Hebrew poets and a ton about poetry in general: how to read it, how to write about it.",
                "I've developed my intuition to approaching, reading, and talking about poetry",
                "Deep understanding of Andalusian culture and poetic genres of Hebrew poetry from 10th to 12th centuries. Insight into the culture of ambiguity and hybridity which characterized the convivencia. Attention to the problematics of the idea of convivencia and its ultimate demise. A really great model of how to be engaged with social context and history while also completely obsessed with the aesthetic vision and universalism of the time: context was not subordinated to the background or seen as determining anything.",
                "This class was a well-rounded, intense, and fruitful study of Andalusian life, culture, and literature in the Middle Ages. I walked away from this course with a solid understanding of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian interaction in the Iberian Peninsula, and especially an understanding of Jewish scholars, leaders, and poetic innovators' role in society. This course also taught me how read poetry with clear context and with an understanding of the literary conventions of the time.",
                "I learned so much in this class -- Professor Cole runs the seminar brilliantly.",
                "This course introduced me to the rich poetic culture of Andalusia and the captivating verse of the Hebrew poets who lived there. It made me a better reader and a better thinker."

                "My shortcomings on this front are my own fault, but I would've liked to be held more accountable as it pertained to the non-poetry readings in the course. I found these easy to skim and still show up the class ready to discuss and actively participate  not a cardinal sin, but perhaps a benefit I could've reaped with extra guidance. In any event, this was an excellent course and the above is a marginal improvement that could be made.",
                "This course is amazing. To be honest, I can't think of much to improve it. The readings are fascinating, and I love that the course includes a lot of historical context to help you situate the poems. Professor Cole is one of the best professors I've had at Yale. All the assignments were helpful as well, from the midterm to the presentations to the final. I also really appreciated that Professor Cole gave such detailed feedback on all our writing. The only weakness is I wish we had more time for discussion.",
                "I think this course was near-perfect. Professor Cole is such a good instructor that the only fault I can find with the course is when he lets the students teach at the end of the course while I understand the pedagogical value of the exercise, the fact is that we all are much worse teachers than he is.",
                "This course is near perfect; Peter Cole has it down to a science.\r\n\r\nThat brings me to my only area of improvement. Cole is great at leading this seminar, and I think that ceding leadership of the class to student presenters in the second half drains some of the energy from the discussion. I understand the attempt to empower students to take charge in class, but I think discussion is stronger with Cole at the helm; if the main goal of the class is to learn and develop our understandings of the poetry through dialogue, Cole is best at facilitating this discourse.",
                "I thought this course was incredibly run. I do think by the end of the thirteen weeks, seminar momentum had slowed down. The presentations were helpful for keeping things energetic, but I wonder if there might be an additional other strategy to keep momentum goingperhaps guest speakers, more lectures, workshops, etc. Overall though , I found the class incredibly engaging and would absolutely reccomend it to any student. Moreover, the feedback  on my writing I received from professor cole was some of the best I have ever received.",
                "Incredible discussion. Deep learning both in discussion and outside the classroom.",
                "I think this was a great class! Professor Cole is amazing, super knowledgable and available to his students to talk about anything. We got through a ton of poetry and the workload was definitely manageable. Sometimes, I felt that the class discussion was a little disorganized and we weren't quite able to get through everything that we set out to do, and in these moments I thought perhaps there could have been a little more structure/direction. However, I think this is definitely a recurring theme in seminar-style classes just by nature of their format, so I don't think it was particularly a weakness, rather than just a general observation.",
                "This class was amazing. The main strength was definitely the in-class discussions. Everyone was engaged and came to class with lots to say, I often wished we had more time to keep talking. Professor Cole was also supremely organized and we were able to cover a lot of poems every class while still going in-depth into a few of them.\r\n\r\nThe assignments were good as well. I appreciated that the reading responses were in different formats throughout the semester. The take home, Canvas test was interesting and not stressful, which was very appreciated in the midst of midterm season. The readings were manageable and fascinating.\r\n\r\nHonestly, can't think of any weaknesses. I was worried at the beginning of the semester that the class would be too big, but it ended up being fine.",
                "This is hands down the best course I've ever taken in my four years at Yale -- Professor Cole is an incredible and sensible person, both in and outside of the classroom. He put so much work into every single detail of the course, from the lectures, to the discussions, to the assignments and the final paper.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "The syllabus was expertly crafted. I enjoyed the first several discussions, before presentations started, much more because I appreciated Coles insights on the poetry.",
                "The strengths of this course are the instructor, class community, content, and structure. The course work is built in such a way that allows you to have a strong historical background in what we are reading to better understand the poetry itself. The small assignments at the beginning were necessary practice in reading the poetry and the feedback we received helped improve our reading. The class discussions were also incredibly diverse as everyone came from a different background, thus approaching the poetry from different angles that only fueled the fire of the conversation.",
                "It's a great course. I can think of very few ways of improving it. I would say that the I found the quality of discussion in the student-led presentation-based classes at the end of the semester to be lower, so maybe I would recommend having larger presentation groups and fewer sessions in that model.",
                "This course is structured very well, with a greater amount of historical context at the beginning of the course and deeper engagement with the poetry towards the end. I think Professor Cole does an excellent job of introducing people at all familiarity levels to the subject matter."

                "Yes. Take this course. Even if you think that medieval poetry is going to be boring or old, it's not; even if the Bible isn't your thing, the poetry is so worth it. I genuinely looked forward to class every week because the community was so positive and productive.",
                "I could not recommend this class more highly. Getting to learn with Professor Cole is one of the greatest joys I've had at Yale  he is warm, funny, caring, brilliant, and everything you could ask for in a teacher. I was not particularly immersed in the poetry world before this class, even, and he sparked a love in me for this poetry that I will carry with me for a long time. That's all you can ask for from a humanities education, if you ask me.",
                "Yes! For anyone interested in poetry, poetic forms, or Arabic-Jewish history, this course is a stellar choice. Be prepared to be pushed in seminar: this is not a course where you can sit in the shadows and just soak up what others say. Cole really makes everyone engage, and has high standards. But from this orientation you learn so much!",
                "Absolutely, and without a doubt.",
                "Easily one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Reading and analysis at a deep level. In this class, Poetry is both a beautiful machine that can be analyzed and a spiritual vessel that must be felt.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student! It's about a subject that you may never learn about in another context, and Professor Cole is absolutely the person you should learn this material from. The poetry is really unique and beautiful, and even though I don't read a ton of poetry for fun, I really enjoyed the practice of engaging with what we read in this class.",
                "Yes! This class is amazing. Even if you don't know much about the subject, about poetry, or about Jewish history please take this class. It's so engaging and Professor Cole is a great teacher.",

                "I would highly recommend to anyone interested in understanding Judaism on a deep level or engaging with poetry.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to anyone who loves poetry and has an interest in Spanish history, Jewish history, and culture, or Islamic studies. It teaches you how to read poetry and understand literature in a way that will be applicable not only to this subject but all other areas of literature.",
                "Highly, especially if you have a background in Arabic, Hebrew, or poetry in general.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in Judaism, history, or poetry. There is no one in the world who is better situated to introduce students to this material. It is a true privilege to have been able to study and think with Professor Cole.",
                "Absolutely, if you are at all interested in the material or the era (although no prior knowledge is necessary). Seminar discussions were challenging and inspiring, and this has been one of my favorite classes Ive taken at Yale.",
                "Take this course! Professor Cole is an excellent, very inspiring professor and a lovely human being. Discussion was always rewarding and thought-provoking, both on account of PC's skill at steering seminar discussion and the contributions of other students (I was lucky to take the course with a group of very smart and motivated students)."
