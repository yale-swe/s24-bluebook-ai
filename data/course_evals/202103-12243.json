The class covers topics and lessons that are very practical for basic communication needs in a foreign country. \r\n\r\nBecause the class is exclusively in Chinese, there are time when I (and other students) would not understand something and not be able to clarify the point with the teacher.",
                "I think this course was very well put together. I felt like the smaller group setting for the classes was really beneficial to help each teacher connect with the students and help them focus on individual strengths and weaknesses in their learning. I think the course does not need any improvement as it is.",
                "Strengths: great teachers, broad support system, very well organised, frequent and varied assessments.\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked a more systematic approach towards working on our pronunciation. We all realised it was lackluster, but there was no real space to work on it. This does not mean that we should allot class time, but perhaps the offer of an additional tutorial for those wanting to work on their pronunciation might be a good idea."

                "Yes. The course is VERY well organised and it is frankly impossible not to greatly improve at Mandarin if you actually complete all the assignments. That being said, this is a high workload course. I would definitely advise you plan the rest of your schedule and its relative workload around this course rather than try to squeeze it into an already packed worksheet."
