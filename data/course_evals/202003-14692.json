Apple dispute), and for each one, we learned about what intelligence was gathered, which entities\/agencies\/departments were involved, and what factors led to the final outcome. The Intelligence Community is extremely complex, but I now have a better understanding of the secret stuff going on behind the scenes. I also learned how to write an intelligence memo, which was one of the assignments.",

I learned about intelligence failures, different types of intelligence, various intelligence programs and cases, terrorism and counterterrorism, changes in the intelligence community\/intelligence agencies post 9\/11, artificial intelligence, disinformation campaigns, and much more. I gained a strong foundational knowledge on core subjects relating to intelligence and learned how to think more critically to analyze these important topics.",

                "All strengths, no weaknesses. This is my favorite course at yale. Take this course.",
                "I would have appreciated longer pre-recorded lectures that gave more context to help understand the readings and participate in class discussion. Each topic could have been linked more clearly to the next one, also. I liked the lecture and section setup.",
                "I liked the format this year, where class was more discussion based and we watched pre-recorded lectures to get the bulk of the \"learning\" out of the way. My one wish was that Ted posted the lectures a bit earlier, maybe a week and a half in advance, since I wished I could have watched them over the weekend for the coming week.",
                "Strengths: amazing guest speakers, interesting lectures that are relevant to present-day policies and news\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "Strengths: This class was great! Professor Wittenstein is a very friendly and engaging professor. He has so much life experience related to intelligence, so he's super knowledgeable. The workload is very very reasonable (midterm, final, memo assignment, weekly readings, choose 1 week to come up with questions based on the readings). Its a really chill class and would be a great 5th class. Professor Wittenstein also invited several interesting guest speakers. This year, we heard from Fiona Hill, James Clapper, among others.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are basically no weaknesses! If I had to think of one, I would say that some readings were incredibly long (they are huge government documents ex: the 9\/11 Commission Report), and not all of the material was covered in class or on the exams. Professor Wittenstein does highlight the main points of focus in his lectures, but it might help to indicate the important sections of the reading on the syllabus as well.",
                "Strengths: everything! Everything professor Wittenstein does is with a specific purpose. Because everything is so meaningful, the class is so worthwhile and you truly enjoy the learning experience. The readings are very manageable, especially compared to other classes that expect you to read 200+ pages a week. Here, the weekly readings are usually significantly less, but still enough that you feel you are gaining a lot of new information. Also, the readings are very timely and super interesting! There were also pre-recorded lectures (I am writing this eval during COVID Fall 2020) which I really appreciated for two major reasons. First, they were not very long. Some couple be 8 minutes, or 12 minutes, or max 15 minutes usually. Maybe there was one or two 20 minute videos. Because they were relatively short, you didn't feel fatigued watching them and so you could actually watch them. With other classes during COVID they would record super long lectures you wouldn't even be encouraged to press play. With Ted's lectures they were relatively short and interesting. He also usually highlights which part of the pre-recorded lecture he wants to discuss in more detail for the live class. I found this very helpful in preparing how you wanted to contribute to the class discussion or what to focus more on in the readings. Secondly, I like how the pre-recorded lectures were actually supplemental and were a necessary contribution. Some other professors would just repeat what was said in the pre-recorded lecture in the live lecture. That was not the case here. The short pre-recorded lectures provided a great foundation or starting-point, which Professor Wittenstein used to dive deeper with his students in the live lectures. They were a great use of time, which I really appreciated. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the timing of the final exam can be better. If you choose the final exam option instead of writing a paper, the final exam opens Wednesday afternoon and closes Friday afternoon during finals week. It can be a bit of a time crunch to write 3 essays in 48 hours, especially if you have to prepare for other exams or have exams during that 48 period as well. I think there should be a download option starting the Friday afternoon of Reading Week so students can have more agency of when they can take the final exam. Writing the final exam was fun for me, because I learned so much and could write a lot about any of the topic options. However, it was a bit rushed because of the timing.",
                "Strengths: Professor and TFs were great, interesting material and great guest lecturers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Would have been way better in person :)",
                "Weaknesses-- the Prof often called on the same set of students and would have a handful of students speak multiple times a session, even though other hands were raised on Zoom. \r\n\r\nStrengths-- supportive Prof and TFs, great guest speakers, interesting and real-world section set up (presenting memos, asking Qs based off memos etc.)",
                "strengths: good discussion of material; enjoyed the short prerecorded lectures\/discussion in live session model; great guest lectures\r\n\r\nweakness: breakout groups always felt rushed and the discussion question assignment was rarely discussed given time constraints; perhaps reconsider timing structure of class",
                "One particular strength of the course was its thematic and chronological structure, which allowed the information as it was presented to be slotted into these larger networks of ideas.",
                "The course was very well organized and incorporated a good balance of interesting guest speakers with lectures by Professor Wittenstein. Each lecture was well-delivered and the content was interesting as well.",
                "I thought it was a great class. Professor Wittenstein and the TA's worked hard to make sure we got the best experience possible, and the only thing holding the experience back was the difficulty of engaging with sections over zoom.",
                "The strengths of this course are a very attentive professor and TAs. The virtual lecture format wasn't the best because in-person is always the best but Prof. Wittenstein still made the course engaging. The only hiccup was that sometimes it took some time for my TA to answer emails.",
                "Professor Wittensteins knowledge and the guest speakers he brought were incredible!",
                "Prof. Wittenstein's prerecorded lectures were really great for facilitating learning in this course. It was like getting the executive summary before going into class, where we would elaborate on the topics. I also really liked how we had discussion section every time. My TA, Anat, was wonderful and led a great discussion that maximized our time so everyone could contribute.",
                "Professor Wittenstein does a great job organizing the course so that each lectures builds on the previous one, especially when learning about the how the current Intelligence Community is structured. Additionally, he really cares about his students, offering a lot of time to get to know him more than just as a professor this was really special.",
                "The class is very interesting and well organized, with thoughtful readings and fascinating guest speakers. Professor Wittenstein did a great job of facilitating class discussion and lectures were more discussion-based, with the pre-recorded lectures serving as background material, and I thought this setup worked well.",
                "Strengths: Professor Wittenstein is very engaging, motivating and always open to hear all ideas. He is very knowledgeable and delivers very compelling lectures that are always different. Particularly enjoyed how he allowed for students to come to his backyard on Fridays to have intimate discussions. Weaknesses: Wished for a smaller class.",
                "Professor Wittenstein is a great lecturer, and he really made the course material clear and accessible. Every lecture felt so involved and engaging. The course was very well organized by unit and by lecture to make topics easier to learn, discuss, and understand. The course readings were very interesting, and covered the content from a variety of perspectives - they were always a fun read. Also, having guest speakers was a highlight of the  course - they were all so fascinating and really added to what we were learning. \r\nI can't think of any weaknesses."

                "I really appreciated the opportunity to attend live, in-person lectures as it was my only in-person class. This helped my engagement in the course tremendously and I always looked forward to attending class in-person.",
                "I really liked how Professor Wittenstein used class time for discussion rather than pure lecture. This was especially helpful during the pandemic since Zoom lectures can get boring very quickly. Because students were encouraged to talk, I felt more engaged, and the class ended up being like a leminar. Professor Wittenstein recorded a 20-30 min-long lecture for us to watch before each class period. Each 75 min class period was then split into 2 parts. The first 55 min were for class discussion. We reviewed the material from the pre-recorded lecture\/readings, asked questions about that material, or answered new discussion questions posed by the professor. In the final 20 min we broke out into discussion sections with the TAs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this class was cross-listed as a graduate school course, so there was a socially distanced, in-person option with Professor Wittenstein. Virtual students could still participate since everyone, even if they were sitting in the lecture hall, logged onto the class Zoom call. I unfortunately could not attend the in-person lectures, but I think that was a nice option to have. Being in-person is always more engaging than a being online. \r\n\r\nI plan to suggest this to all of my professors: professors should encourage a culture of cameras on. For this class, everyone had their cameras on at the beginning of the semester. By the end, however, only a handful did, and this made the class less engaging. As a student, I know how desirable it is to turn off the camera during a Zoom call and just listen to others talk. However, I also know that when you do this, it is so easy to just zone out and maybe do other things on the computer or walk around the room. Im definitely a more active listener and participant when my camera is on because I feel that others are aware of my presence, kind of like when youre sitting in a lecture hall. I know that professors cant force students to turn on their cameras, but maybe if professors ask students to do so at the beginning of every single lecture, more students will feel encouraged or compelled to do so. Maybe the constant reminder will make turning on cameras into a habit. As soon as one student turns off his\/her camera, everyone starts doing it, so my hope is that professors can try to stop this trend.",
                "This class was the most accomodating for COVID and also had the most realistic expectations (see earlier commente). Some classes think: overworking=learning a lot. But that is not the case here. Students learned a lot without having to sacrifice being overworked! \r\nThe class had manageable readings, relatively short pre-recorded lectures, and meaningful live discussions. Additionally, the class was organized immensely well. First off, all the readings were posted on Canvas way before the first live meeting, so you could download them and get a feel for the content. Additionally, the lecture slides and lecture videos were posted in sections, so maybe 3-4 weeks of lecture material would get uploaded at a time. These uploads were very organized and timely, somtimes 2-3 weeks in advance! This gave students a lot of flexibility and agency which was great for time management. This class was the most organized class I've ever taken; and this is especially important considerint the uncertainities of COVID.",
                "Zoom breakout rooms each class made it much more interactive",
                "Virtual office hours and Zoom course set up were great for this course.",
                "Pre-recorded + live session discussion was good model; enjoyed breakout sessions at the end of class (kept me engaged)",
                "This class navigated the COVID situation better than any I experienced or heard of. I especially appreciated the hybrid synchronous\/asynchronous model, which additionally allowed for lecture time to include more student engagement and for discussion sections to be conducted during class time.",
                "I thought the course was successful in adapting to the pandemic, I especially appreciated the opportunity to participate in in-person lectures. Although it was hard to hear the in-person students while online, I thought Professor Wittenstein did a nice job restating each question and making the combination of in-person\/virtual lecture as efficient as possible.",
                "The split-class format made engagement difficult as sometimes it felt like there were two parallel classes happening at once.",
                "Prof. Wittenstein did a good job making the course a hybrid in-person and virtual lecture. Students in person and remote could pay attention the same, I just think that when students in-person speak, Prof. W could turn his mic off and the student could turn theirs on, because that would prevent Prof. W from having to repeat the question or comment.",
                "I really thought that Professor Wittenstein made a great effort to engage members of the course through the pandemic - he offered a hybrid in person model which allowed some students to actually go into lecture. However, I thought that his use of breakout groups could be improved - there was never really time to discuss key course concepts and they didnt work well in a hybrid model.",
                "Prerecorded lectures for preparation were a total hit, we loved them. Also, I liked the inclusion of discussion sections every day to keep us engaged.",
                "Professor Wittenstein did a great job adapting the course to learning during the pandemic. The pre-recorded lectures were a great way to communicate information, allowing students to watch them on their own schedule. This meant that we could do a more seminar format during lecture. The only piece of feedback that I would have about learning during the pandemic is on the format of the exams. Both the midterm and final were take home essays with a 48 hour window to complete the exam, but Professor Wittenstein said to not use the entire time (don't pull an all nighter etc.) and that it was meant as a curtesy. While I appreciate the additional time and know that it only comes from good intentions on Professor Wittenstein's part, this creates an issue for students who have many things going on during those 48 hours. For example, due to how my schedule fell this semester, I had every single one of my classes within that 48 hour window, which meant I was working on the essay during the night, right before it was due. I felt like I was not able to spend as much time on the midterm as other students in the course. Some alternatives have worked well in other virtual classes of mine. One is to have the exam be available for 48 hours, but restrict the amount of time students can work on it (I believe this is an option through canvas). This gives students necessary flexibility but still standardizes amount of time spent on the course. Alternatively, give a longer time window, perhaps even a week, to complete the exam. Again, I have to stress that Professor Wittenstein worked extremely hard to adapt this course to the pandemic and I know that this 48 hour take home came from a place of understanding.",
                "I really appreciated the breakout rooms towards the end of each class session as it allowed for us to discuss in smaller groups the larger topics from lecture and the readings.",
                "During the breakout group sections we never really had enough time to fully devote our attention to the week's memo or Canvas questions, let alone discuss what had been brought up in class earlier, but this is really a function of the pandemic's influence on the course design. Otherwise, the pre-recorded lectures were a great addition, and I thought the structure of the midterm and final was very fair.",
                "Most definitely the hybrid concept was a success. For virtual engagement, I thought breakout rooms were executed well, although my breakout room never had enough time to cover both the memos and the topic posed in class.",
                "Due to mostly online learning, the course was switched to having about a 20-30min lecture pre-recorded to watch sometime before the scheduled class time. Then, during class time, you could attend in-person or virtually, and it was formatted like something between a lecture and a full class discussion. While this might sound hectic, it was *very* well fascinated, and allowed us to talk more about concepts that we were interested or confused about. I really enjoyed this format, and I felt it made the content a lot easier to understand and made the live portion of the class all the more interesting."

                "This is the best class I have taken at Yale. I branched out by taking this class (I have taken a lot of easier classes), and it was so worth it. Professor Wittenstein does a great job of giving background and explaining events. He has a wealth of information and is really kind. He is engaging and asks tough questions, but is very kind if you don't know the answer. He had interesting and socially distant hangout sessions where you could ask him anything.\r\n\r\nTAKE THIS CLASS. I did the readings (usually never do) because they were interesting and it paid off.",
                "Yes.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! Even if you're not familiar with the topic, it's a very interesting class to take. We had so many amazing (and prominent) guest speakers, which really enhanced my experience in the class. The readings sometimes were pretty long and heavy, but lectures helped a lot to figure it all out. On a separate note, Prof Wittenstein is so knowledgeable and just amazing!",
                "Yes. Very helpful and relevant for anyone pursuing a career in intelligence, law, or the military.",
                "Yes, the course was really good. I learned a lot about intelligence and many of the issues facing the intelligence community",
                "Absolutely. This is a class that I consider to be the ideal 5th class. It is not that much work and you are almost guaranteed a good grade, but at the same time, you want to pay attention during lecture because the subject matter is so interesting that you continue to be highly engaged in the course throughout the semester. I took it as a senior STEM major and am so glad I did.",
                "Definitely! This course is suitable for you even if you're not a global affairs\/history\/poli sci major, and it provides a lot of interesting background on US foreign policy",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class!! If youre even remotely interested in intelligence, national security, government, foreign policy, the FBI, the CIA, the DHS, etc. then you should take it! We use a lot of interesting, historical events as case studies, in order to understand what makes something an intelligence failure or success. I had almost no knowledge about the Intelligence Community prior to taking the class, so I really enjoyed learning about the various types of intelligence, common challenges faced by intelligence analysts, reforms made to the IC after 9\/11, etc. I definitely think that I gained a new perspective on current events and will start analyzing them like an intelligence officer does. Professor Wittenstein also invited several interesting guest speakers to the class: Fiona Hill, James Clapper, etc. It was such an amazing opportunity to hear about their life experiences, and the guest speaker always related to the topic that we were discussing for the week! Professor Wittenstein is super friendly and engaging lecturer, and the workload is very low (midterm, final, memo assignment, weekly readings), but you still learn a lot. I don't think you can find a better combination for a class!",
                "YES! 100% my favorite class at Yale. This learning experience was so enjoyable and made me feel like a Yale student. I didn't feel discouraged or intimidated by the workload. It is not an easy or simple class by any means; but at least you are not drowned by so much work that you get discouraged halfway through the semester. Through Ted's class, you truly look forward to doing the readings and engaging with the material. You become a better critical thinker and student. Also, a lot of imporant themes emerge in this course, like the intersection between ethics, law, policy, and technology.",
                "Yes!",
                "For sure! If you are a GLBL major, or even if you are not, this course gives you background in how the IC functions that can\/ will be important to understand and also asks you to apply major take-aways from previous IC happenings to current and future problems.",
                "Yes; interesting content and the professor is engaging and knowledgeable",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to any student with even a passing interest in the reality of the intelligence community, which is so often portrayed (to varying degrees of accuracy) in the media. I would further recommend it to students of history and international affairs, as intelligence collection and use is generally neglected as an area in which these events occur, in favor of studying diplomacy or military history. Finally, I think that even those without an interest in any of the aforementioned areas could benefit for the course, as it is a study in a particular sort of analytical thinking that is not often taught explicitly.",
                "Definitely! This course was very well-organized and made me think in a different way than my other classes had. Although it was a grad student political science course, the students in my section were all undergrad and majoring in various subjects, so the class was welcoming to students of all backgrounds. The course was incredibly well-organized in a way that facilitated a great learning environment.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Wittenstein makes this course interesting and accessible to all students.",
                "I would! It's not a ton of work, and all of the readings are very necessary and very enlightening. Coming from a non-GLBL and non-PLSC background, this course really helped get me up to speed on the goings-on of the intelligence world. 10\/10 would recommend.",
                "Id recommend this course who has an interest in learning about the key intelligence challenges the US faces.",
                "This course is a great course for those who want to learn the history of the IC, and want to expand their knowledge of espionage beyond what's shown in movies (most of them exaggerate aspects). I'd also recommend this course to anyone who was curious about the Mueller investigation, and the other investigations under Trump's presidency as this course was great at teaching us enough background then diving into these very contemporary topics so we could understand exactly what went on. I enjoyed this course very much, and would recommend it.",
                "Yes! This course makes you think critically about American foreign policy and the role of the Intelligence Community. It is a fascinating subject for everyone regardless of major, and I have already recommended it to all my friends.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. In addition to learning so much about the structure and history of the Intelligence Community, I learned about how this plays into many of today's events. It is really great whenever I hear about different aspects of the Intelligence Community in the news, and I understand what it means and the different nuances of it. The course was organized really well and Professor Wittenstein drew many connections between the different parts of it. Also, Professor Wittenstein really cares about the students in the course and provides them with ample opportunities to get to know him, as well as to hear from a range of key individuals in intelligence.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in understanding how intelligence agencies-- the CIA, FBI, NSA, DNI, etc-- operate, and how events like Pearl Harbor and 9\/11 have affected U.S. intelligence. The course is broader than I thought it would be, with more of an emphasis on history and politics, and doesn't really focus on specific espionage tactics, for example.",
                "Yes, I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in government and national security. The guest speakers in this course are incredible and you'll likely never have exposure to a specific class on intelligence like this one.",
                "YES, 100%! This class was awesome, and I absolutely loved it. The content is incredibly interesting and important to know. Professor Wittenstein is a great lecturer who is so committed to helping students learn, making the readings and course engaging, and bringing in guest speaker who really provide new and fascinating perspectives. I always looked forward to showing up to class, and I feel as though I'm leaving with lots of useful knowledge and skills."
