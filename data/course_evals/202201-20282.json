                "In this course, we gain a deep understanding of biomedical data analysis, from math to stats to engineering concepts. In particular, by delving into not just the way in which we conduct analyses but also why we conduct them, ENAS 549 has expanded my excitement about and critical approach to experimental design. From simple Taylor expansions to OLS\/WLS to ODEs, this class has undeniably changed how I will use and explore designs and analyses going forward.",

                "The strength of this course is the joyful material, the fantastic teachers (both prof and TF), and the organization. The weakness is that a lot of different material is covered, so it could be hard to predict the difficulty of each unit. However, the course has support systems in place to mitigate this challenge, including recording each class, posting all lecture notes and code, providing supplementary readings (in really fantastic textbooks!), and providing access to both the professor and TF for questions.",
