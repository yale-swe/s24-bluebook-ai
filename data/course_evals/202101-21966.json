Personally, I would have preferred to talk about some movies more in depth rather than watching and discussing as many as possible. Moreover, while we talked quite a bit about spelling towards the end of the course, I would have liked to receive more advice on academic writing."

                "YES take this class! Shiri is a national treasure, remarkable in her commitment to shaping the course to what individual students need. (I've literally never had a professor that so reliably implemented feedback. That's really something that I didn't see a lot in any of my other classes, even if those professors were great in other aspects.) Naama, the TF, is also an absolute joy to talk to. This class will: improve your written and spoken Hebrew, make you deeply sad because of all the sad movies you watch, make you deeply happy because of the intellectual level of the discussion. This class will not: make you incredibly stressed (there's a bunch of work but Shiri is very nice about extensions etc). My year the class was an even mix of heritage speakers and students that learned Hebrew at Yale, but I think it didn't really generate too much inequality, because people were simply good at different things. But everyone had interesting approaches to film analysis!",

                "Yes. It is a demanding L5 course. If you are flexible to changes in course structure and are willing to put in the time (at least 1 film per week, discussion post, extra events,etc), then this is a fun class to take.",
                "I would recommend the class to people who want to learn more about israeli film or improve hebrew in an interesting way",
