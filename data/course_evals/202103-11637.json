Developed a strong introductory understanding of the technical elements of sound design, including recording equipment, audio editing, cueing, speaker technology, and working with MIDI. Learned about the theatrical design industry and sound's position within that.",
                "I learned the ins and outs of the trade and craft of sound design; how to navigate the field as a working designer; how to approach a text and communicate with others in the production effectively about your vision for the sound; more skills and techniques for developing sound on DAWS"

                "Strengths: The assignments in this class are so fun! It's basically all the stuff you'd think to want to do as practice using DAWs or practice making random sound stuff for kicks, and there's a lot of variety in the kinds of projects assigned. Nathan is incredible at leading a discussion, leaving room for students to critique each other, and finding the beauty in anything that a student presents. \r\nWeakness: Not sure that this is a problem, but everyone in the class this semester was really good at the stuff that the class demanded. It made for a great workshop for all of us, but it might have been intimidating for those looking for a less-steep learning curve. Another non-problem is that the class meets for a long time (4 hours) every week - I appreciated having a lot of discussion/sharing time, but it can be exhausting during tough weeks.",
                "Strengths: This course expanded my thinking about theater and sound in so many different ways! I hear sound differently in my daily life now, and have a whole newly developed lens for watching and reading theater.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many. I could maybe have used some guidance on how to approach the readings. It might be helpful to specify more clearly how the readings are organized (eg by theme or by their relationship to the current design project), especially if the order of the readings changes throughout the semester."

            "comments": [
                "Absolutely! I had essentially zero theater experience before taking this class, and I had a great time thinking about sound in the theater. If you have a music background, especially one involving audio editing or composition (it helps to be familiar with DAWs but is not required), this class is great fun. The class mainly consists of a project every week or every other week, and critiques with classmates. The super cool assignments push you to be creative but are meant to stimulate discussion during critiques rather than stress you out to be perfect. Nathan is so genuine and knowledgeable and helpful and supportive. He loves sound and can find beauty in anything that he hears.",
                "Definitely! This course broadened my knowledge of sound design, definitely, but also is incredibly applicable to many other aspects of theater-making, art-making, music, and life in general.",
                "Yes! Nathan is a wonderful professor."
