                "A (pretty detailed) overview of the formation of Eastern European states and their relationship with Christianity, other neighboring states, Western European imperialism, the Ottoman Empire, as well as notable figures, marriages, wars, conflicts, and events that happened from about 800 to 1914.",
                "The course focused on the history of Poland from its creation to its various partitions in the late 18th century, the rise and fall of the Hapsburgs, the creation of modern nation-states (especially in the balkans) and also briefly touched upon the histories of other slavic nations such as Russia and Czechia.",

This material includes a range of historical trends and ideas, including the shift from empire to early modern states and the rise of nationalism in Balkan republics.",
                "I learned how global trends, such as industrialization, the renaissance, Enlightenment, and romanticism, shaped statehood and politics in Eastern Europe. I also learned a lot about the nature of European empires and how they evolved over time into the political system we know today. Although this course wasn't exactly relevant to anything else I am studying, I do feel that I learned a lot that is applicable to other subjects and it was very engaging regardless.",

                "Strengths: The lectures felt cohesive and well-structured even without slides, and Professor Snyder really knows his stuff. I felt like there was a nice balance between emphasizing important themes and trends and giving the sort of logistical detail of history. It made a massive amount of history (and a lot of it really distant history) feel accessible and relevant and important.\r\nWeaknesses: The readings were somewhat heavy and dry and often felt somewhat disconnected from exactly what historical details\/frameworks\/themes we focused on in lecture. It's also a lot of history so studying for the exams can feel somewhat overwhelming, especially if you didn't know any of the basic history beforehand.",
                "This was my favorite class I took this semester. I knew pretty much nothing about Eastern Europe especially pre 1914 before I took this class and now I feel like I am very knowledgeable about a variety of countries and topics. Professor Snyder is a great lecturer and I think everyone should take at least one class with him; he is an expert in his field and has interesting lectures. I really loved going to class and taking hand notes (no laptops allowed unless you have an accommodation) because it was like I was listening to a cool history podcast or something. There were definitely lots of readings and we didn't always cover the material from the readings in lecture, but they were never a complete waste of time and I always learned something from them (even if at times they were dry). I think the weakness of this course is nothing to do with the course itself but with the TFs, because I didn't really learn anything from my TF. I do wish Professor Snyder could have used a microphone when he lectured because at times it was hard to hear him when he spoke in a normal voice over the podium. I do appreciate the lecture notes he gives out before class with a term list and an outline, but sometimes we wouldn't get to all the parts of the outline or all the terms so it was a bit difficult to remember what we covered and didn't when studying for the exam (also, handwriting notes makes it easier to miss things).",
                "Strengths: Timothy Snyder is one of the best lecturers that Yale has to offer. If you do not end up taking any classes with him, please do a favor to yourself and listen to one of the many podcasts that he has online. His lectures were truly engaging and he made me fall in love with the material. As a STEM major I found the course really easy to follow, although I would have appreciated some physical presentations from the professor. Additionally, the exams were very fair, having no particular surprises and my TA was very fair in his grading. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have appreciated some more visual input during the lectures, such as pictures and maps of the things that we were discussing. Also I found the three guest lectures to be very dry compared to the stellar sessions provided by the professor. I would have also appreciated to have the option to take the exam online in a proctored environment so that we would be able to right more in a shorter amount of time.",
                "Strengths: engaging lecturer, well-structured lectures, good TFs\r\nWeaknesses: too much reading, disorganized section, unapproachable professor",
                "This course's lecturer was fantastic and extremely engaging, overall my experience in the course was very positive. I believe the reading load could be culled a bit, for at time the reading seemed only tangentially related to our discussion, but overall the class was taught very comprehensively and thoughtfully.",
                "I think the lectures are very well organized and follow a logical, if not chronological structure, that really creates a narrative out of the content, which makes it much more digestible. The handouts were very useful both for following along with the lecture and reviewing for exams. I feel that the exam structure really sets students up for success and I appreciate that the expectations for the exams were made very clear. The reading was very heavy and didn't always feel necessary to understanding the lectures, so I didn't do very much of it and regret spending so much on the course packet. The guest lectures seemed thoughtfully selected, but I did not find them very engaging or useful to understanding the rest of the content. Overall though, I think this course is excellent and very interesting even for non history majors\/students not necessarily interested in Eastern Europe.",
                "Snyder's lectures are amazing. Light workload (no papers!)",
                "Strengths: Prof Snyder's lectures are amazing. It's really nice to take notes by hand instead of on a laptop, and it was a great experience to concentrate for 50 min without distractions. The course also only has 2 midterms and a map quiz, and no cumulative exam, so it's manageable. \r\nWeaknesses: the reading packet is huge and hard to get through.",
                "Great lecturing and enjoyed section. I think the readings would be better if they were primary source-based (a few were) rather than sometimes redundant in-depth summaries. Primary source would lend themselves to better discussion in section and just generally be more interesting I think.",
                "The course was great at packing a lot of info into your head, and the low number of assignments (map quiz, midterm, final) meant it was very manageable time wise during assessment times.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the reading level for this class is just not sustainable and I know very, very few students who did even half of the assigned reading  and not for lack of trying. It was unfortunate as this detracted from an otherwise very interesting and doable course.",
                "HIST 263 taught me a ton about a history I would've probably never explored without the course. The breadth of the course was truly astounding. Professor Snyder's lecturing was definitely a strength of the course; I was always engaged and found his lecture style to be unlike anyone else's. I think the testing component of the course could've been improved, though: the material covered on tests wasn't always clear, as there were often terms\/people on our lecture handouts that Snyder never mentioned in class (but maybe mentioned because lecture moved so quickly), so it was usually a guessing game with a few of the lesser-known terms (as to whether they would appear on tests). Also, the first midterm was graded incredibly harshly. I'm not sure if this had to do with the professor or the TFs, but I don't think students who studied for genuinely weeks on end with 70+ pages of study guides should be rewarded with failing\/barely passing grades on the midterm, especially if no information on the median\/potential for a curve was addressed. Also, the expectation that students should finish four-term IDs, a short essay and a long essay in 50 minutes (all while achieving TFs high and often unrealistic detail expectations) was super stressful. It felt like I was putting in a ton of work to understand incredibly complex history just to bomb the tests for honestly unknown reasons. Despite working harder than I've ever worked in a course, I didn't feel particularly rewarded for taking such an academic risk.",
                "Professor Snyder's lectures were captivating. That's why I signed up for this course, and I was not disappointed. Those lectures were complemented by a great teaching fellow, Nathan, who always ran an engaging section. \r\n\r\nI would have appreciated the chance to use my iPad to take notes during lecture, for simplicity's sake. For somebody who struggles with organization, any of the distraction of a screen is far outweighed by the benefits of being able to consolidate my notes in one place, and use colored pens, highlighters, etc. without having to carry around and organize an array of pens each class.",
                "I loved this course.  Professor Snyder is a joy to listen to- he is incredibly coherent and weaves together the information we are learning beautifully.  Sections were fine - I'm not into history and it's not my major, so I was really in the class more for the lectures than the sections, but they offered another look at the material and were a great way to figure out what we needed to study for the exams.  The exams were also super reasonable in terms of layout and content.",
                "Lectures are amazing, readings are sometimes less relevant and not particularly geared towards the exam",
                "Strengths were definitely lecture. They were engaging and I never missed one.\r\nThat being said, if a student missed a lecture there was no way to make it up. Also, sections were a little disorganized.",
                "Professor Snyder is obviously knowledgeable about the subject matter, but it didnt seem like he was very invested in the course. Every lecture was given with no visual aids and no mic, so it was just him far away on a little podium behind a piece of paper. It made it very hard to follow all the detailed information given. I had to Cr\/D the class. If you like memorizing random Lithuanian grandmothers and Ukrainian nobles, go ahead. Not the type of lecture just anyone can like.",
                "Midterms were super focused on making sure you remember the exact dates of specific events which hurt a lot of people's grades",
                "The readings could be more focused, lighter, and less expensive. A hundred dollar packet of PDFs, on top of 3 books, is a bit exorbitant, I wish they were available online. I had to visit Bass library to complete the readings.",
                "The lectures are magnificent.",
                "The strengths of the course were the engaging lectures and weekly discussion sections. The small amount of graded assignments made it difficult to get a gauge for my performance in the class, but I got good feedback from the exam.",
                "A strength was that it was very thorough and interesting all the way through, especially with the guest lectures that were sprinkled in. A weakness was the organization - in some cases it was difficult to follow the many storylines and contextualize the lectures whilst listening to them. Everything clicked after going over notes, though.",
                "Snyder is a great lecturer. He has engaging material that picks up after the first midterm. Communication between Snyder and the TAs appeared to be a little lacking.",
                "strength: course structure is underpinned by a theme of the origin of modern nations, it's not stated explicitly but is nevertheless visible. Hence it is not only a course on Central and Eastern Europe, but also gives students concepts that are universally applicable.",
                "Strengths: Awesome professor (Prof. Snyder is a great lecturer), interesting course content, great TFs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Guest lectures were a bit weak, some of the readings felt unconnected to lecture"

                "Yes! I learned a lot of new history and it connected the dots of a lot of history I already knew (for context, I went through the US school system, so most of my knowledge of history is centered around the US and Western Europe). It really made me rethink my understanding of state formation in Europe, the history of Christianity and Judaism, and the emergence of different nationalisms in the later part of the course. I also thought Professor Snyder did a great job of tying the history we were learning to bigger questions (like thinking about what the world would look like if the Mongols hadn't had to turn back in 1241 in terms of the power of Western Europe, European imperialism, etc. or thinking about empires and nation-states and what that means for our present). Professor Snyder's lectures were great! Engaging and cohesive and cramming a shocking amount of detail into 50 minutes.",
                "Yes, if you're looking to expand your knowledge on Eastern Europe and are good at remembering timelines and dates and historical events and people. I didn't struggle in this class at all but I think I really like making timelines and finding out what fits with who where. A lot of people in my section had never taken a history class before so the traditional format of IDs\/short answers\/essay in a 50 minute class period was really daunting for them, so unless you are prepared to study in a very history-major way, then I'd maybe advise you to take a second look at this class. But if you do take this class, you will learn a ton from an amazing professor.",
                "Absolutely. This is a course that could be easily followed by any student at Yale. No prior history background is required and the professor makes it very easy to follow all the dates, names and events through his lectures. Even though this course only focuses on Eastern Europe, you will develop a wide perspective on world history and will find yourself thinking about various big questions.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student if they are willing to do the work to understand the class.  The class is structured with one midterm and one final exam, and cramming for either of these will be detrimental to your grade.  That being said, the reading does not necessarily need to be done before class and only a brief overview of is necessary to participate in section.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Even though I had no prior knowledge of the subject, I found it really fascinating and clear to follow. Although the lectures move fast, they are definitely the most captivating I've heard at Yale so far and I think the fast pace is very much worth it.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, if you have any interest in eastern Europe or its history, or if you want to learn from Professor Snyder, who is a great lecturer.",
                "If you are interested in Eastern Europe, then definitely take it. Even interest in Europe generally will be quite satisfied by this class. Synder is a fantastic lecturer, though he does go quite fast be prepared to write (no computers allowed) really quickly. It's not a gut, howeverthe reading quantity alone ensures this, and the midterm\/final does rely on the readings so no easy total skips are possible. If you keep up with the course and put in a fair (but not overwhelming) amount of time, you'll enjoy yourself and find it interesting.\r\n\r\nOverall, take it if you can handle a lot of info and a fair amount of reading and if you like the subject!",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are interesting in Eastern European history. Professor Snyder is an amazing lecturer who makes each class a delight to listen to. The TFs are also great in further explaining the dense material in section.",
                "I would! The early lectures can be overwhelming, given their high level of detail and my lack of instinctive familiarity with the region (as opposed to Western Europe), but I did develop a good foundational knowledge of Eastern Europe's history and development and am glad I took this class. Professor Snyder is a terrific lecturer with an evident deep command of and passion for the material he is teaching. It was gratifying, at the end of the course, to realize how much I had absorbed.",
                "Yes!  I loved Professor Snyder, anyone with a mild interest in European history should take this course (while the primary focus is Eastern Europe, I learned more about broad European history as well).",
                "Yes, very interesting and also very manageable while still being interesting and enjoyable",
                "I would recommend it to someone who has a passion for history, but it is not for those that feel lukewarm abt the subject.",
                "Not unless youre genuinely very interested and like reading history, because its not very engaging during lectures and you really have to find the enjoyment in the material. Prof Snyder knows his stuff but talks fast and detailed with no visual aids or anything, so furiously take notes and know details.",
                "The grading was rough for the tests but Snyder is a very interesting lecturer. No PowerPoint slides or resources besides a terms sheet made studying a bit more difficult however, especially if you missed part of a class.",
