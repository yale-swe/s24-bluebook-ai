                "Professors are fantastic, and the TA's are incredibly helpful. Very fun to attend, with a great selection of films. Sometimes (on account of the weekly presentation format) there can be too much of fellow classmates talking and too little of the teaching staff (professors + TAs), which is a shame because the teaching staff is incredibly knowledgable.",
                "I think many of the weaknesses of this course can be chalked up to the virtual semester. I believe that there were too many people in the course for it to be taught successfully, and the amount of people vying for attention just lead to an overall lower level of engagement. \r\nThe strengths of the course are its teachers and TFs. They helped guide conversation and forced students to approach the films in new and interesting ways.",
                "This class has a great curriculum and two excellent professors. Unfortunately, it was not structured well over Zoom to promote students' learning. Too many people were accepted into the class, especially a lot of graduate students, so on top of an already decreased level of engagement over Zoom, it was difficult to participate naturally in the discussions. I think these problems will be fixed in person, but most people only spoke when it was their week to give a presentation.",
                "I think the choice of films for the course was very good. They were very diverse and were all excellent in different ways. However, I do think more modern films would maintain engagement in the class. Also, having students presenting 4 times over the course of the semester is unnecessarily stressful. I think the class shouldve just been broken up into groups of maybe 15 and had smaller discussions about the films each week.",
                "It felt disorganized at first bc the professors didnt know how to translate the class to a virtual format. But they took our feedback into consideration and made huge changes that improved the class",
                "I thought that the course was great in that we were asked to present on multiple of the movies during the semester, and the presentations helped me dive into the movies more and allowed me to practice my close analysis skills. A weakness I'd say was that the class was a little too big making it hard to participate in the discussion.",
                "I definitely think the size of the seminar was perhaps too big but regardless, the discussions were facilitated very well. Professors and TAs were so caring and dedicated",
                "Strengths: absolutely amazing professors and TAs. They wre the kindest, most wonderful and understanding people throughout the course. The films we were required to watch were also a strength as they were quite diverse and introduced me to so many films that I otherwise would have never encountered. Weaknesses: its format. Halfway through the course, they were still changing the way we were doing a class. It was difficult structuring a class with about 40 people around what was meant to be a much smaller discussion seminar. At first, everyone had to do a presentation every week on the movie that was assigned. It evolved into rotating groups for presentations. Also, some readings were not provided and we had to get them elsewhere.",
                "You learn how to authentically engage with film on an 10000000 IQ level. Moira is also a complete gem and expanded the boundaries of what I thought I knew about cinema. The discussions were so interesting that they often carried over 2 HOURS after class had finished, with many students staying behind to witness the nuclear-grade analyses that were being discussed. Sadly, however, this was quite unfair to the many students who had other time commitments. This course seriously hits.",
                "Wonderful and engaging professors. It was a large format for a seminar which meant that several people dominated the discussion. I would have liked the class to be smaller",
                "Strengths: A syllabus of amazing films. Weaknesses: It was a seminar taught like a lecture! There were so many people in the class that it was almost impossible to meaningfully \"participate,\" which was made even more difficult by the fact that the entire class was on Zoom. I wish they had just split us up into two classes rather than smush us into one giant section.",
                "Over zoom, it could be a bit difficult to get large class engagement for over 50 people. Class presentations were a nice way to facilitate class participation but at times presentations took a lot of the discussion time of the class.",
                "Due to covid, there was the need to adjust to find a good way of structuring the class, but after finding that way, things worked very well. There were not too many opportunities to gain feedback as there was only one paper to get feedback on: the midterm with the final later on that may or may not have feedback, the class is over so im not sure if we will get it later or not. Other feedback was simply people saying nice point during your class presentation.",
                "The regular seminar format of this course is a strength. However, the large class size and zoom seminars made participation difficult. The teaching team is knowledgeable and passionate about the films and readings and that comes across in each class. In person screenings and discussion will be great for this class."

Again, I'm unsure if this would have been the case for FILM 320 normally. Because of COVID, there were no arrangements to watch any of the films as a class together. If there was a way to organize class-wide film screenings, that would greatly improve the class.",
                "Group presentation organisation outside of class lacked some structure, and the 10 minute rule on class presentations was often hard to fully monitor. However, these problems were mostly resolved by the end of the semester.",
                "Watched the films independently instead of group screenings",
                "The class was simply too big for anyone student to feel like they could participate meaningfully. In fact, I often felt like I was in a lecture taught by my fellow film majors for the first half and an \"idea showing off contest\" for the second half. Online classes are tough, but by combining the numbers of a lecture with the format of a seminar, Close Analysis of Film made online class even more difficult.",

The conversations in the chat and out loud allowed for interesting discussion and participation, but could sometimes be confusing. It took some time to figure out the format and structure of the weekly presentations which led to the class feeling inconsistent over the course of the semester, but it got better as time went on."

A large proportion of your grade is participation, but it was almost impossible to participate with so many people together on the Zoom calls.

I think I would've had a completely different experience if it'd been in person, so I'd probably recommend it to another student as an in-person class. It was just extremely disorganized at first as they tried figuring out how to adapt to the Zoom format. But honestly, I ended up really loving it.

Wins the prize for best and coolest Prof\/TA\/Student combination of any course I've taken--grad students bring PhD level information to discussion, and some grad art students even created original works based on the absolute MASTERPIECES we watched.
