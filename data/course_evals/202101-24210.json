And we learned about colonization and colonies and what that means!",

                "The course had many interesting and helpful readings and we had many brilliant guest speakers. We had considerable freedom with our presentations and final essays, so we could explore our interests. The course had a wide breadth but I still feel like I learned a lot. However, we did not have many discussions and it was often a lecture and occasionally off-topic. I think it could be improved by adding more structure and making sure everyone knows what is going to happen in each class, such as planned activities or a new class format. The reading load is also quite heavy, though we don't always end up discussing everything.",

                "The course draws from many readings by scholars who are actually Kurdish, and there were great guest speakers who led insightful discussions with their research. There were a lot of readings, though they will probably be cut down for the next time the class is taught. Despite this, the readings never felt like they were pointless, and the fact that there weren't very many assignments made it manageable. Overall, the class was really amazing."

                "I would. It was a ton of reading, and that was tough, but it is seldom you get the opportunity to take a wonderful class with a professor such as Mehmet Kurt.",
                "I would absolutely take this course. It's probably the only class available in the US that so comprehensively examines the Kurdish people and decolonization. In certain countries, people can be sent to prison (or worse) for teaching or taking a class like this, and the fact that Professor Kurt can combine scholarship with lived experience is really valuable. Take this class if you can! Even if you have no prior background in Middle Eastern studies or Anthropology."
