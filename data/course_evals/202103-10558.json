At the end of each lab handout, there are a bunch of labs at Yale that are involved in similar research that week's lab was focused on. I think this is a great resource for those who are looking to join a lab but don't know where to get started.",
                "Yes!!!! I loved this course a lot. I loved my TF and Dr. Moreno's teaching. They are both phenomenal in their work and they truly know so much. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about lab methods. The lab reports are an upwards hill to learn but once you get past it, it's truly so rewarding to learn and write. Come to class prepared and you will do well.",
