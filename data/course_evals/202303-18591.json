I certainly became a better writer, planner, and organizer with his help. This class helped me really hone in the topic of my thesis project while taking tangible steps to plan its actual completion.",

                "This course was an extremely important step in framing my mental map of my senior thesisI see why it's required. I learned how to formulate my question and, most importantly, summarize it succinctly! As we were continually asked to present our thesis in constrained waysfrom short abstracts to 5-minute presentationsthe core of my research in my project slowly emerged as a sculptor carving out clay. The readings in this class, while sometimes a huge burden to complete, are deeply valuable if you take the time to close-read (which you won't always have as a senior, let's be honest)."

                "Strengths: dedication of professor and teaching team to meet and provide weekly feedback \r\nWeaknesses: the class moved really quickly in the first half and quite slowly in the second, I would have loved more of a balance and flow throughout the semester and more active incorporation of the advisors in the process",
                "Strengths: interesting readings, cool variety of speakers, TFs and Professor Dugdale were very engaged and willing to help students, the way Professor Dugdale runs his class inspires you to want to submit your best work",
                "The strengths of this course is that it really pushes you to be rigorous in your own research and use your time well outside of class. Beyond assignments and readings for the course itself, it requires that you continuously push along your own project on your own time. Another strong point of the course is Professor Dugdale. The timeline he created for the course and the way he encouraged us to think about how this project will ultimately exist in the world really elevated the stakes for everyone and encouraged people to want to work hard for a good final product. That said, the workload can be quite a bit at times, so prepare to invest time in readings, weekly responses, the incremental assignments for your thesis, and all the research and admin work that goes into starting an independent research project, especially if you don't come into the semester with fleshed out ideas on what you want to research. The format of the course should be shifted slightly so that the class meetings are less lecture style and more group workshop style.",
                "Strengths: Professor Dugdale cares deeply and will not let you off the hook. He'll keep pushing you to refine in a way that feels initially frustrating but you look back on later with gratitude. The class is deeply communal, which elevated my engagement in the course and gave consistent, evolving precedents to work off of for some assignments that I didn't know how to approach. Both Professor Dugdale and Alberto (our TA) were very available to discuss and ridiculously intelligent, cutting quickly into the most important elements of what you were showing them. TRUST THE PROCESS!\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes opportunities for participation in a class period would be low, which made me a little sad as I consistently worked hard to prepare for it. For instance, we didn't discuss the readings many times, despite them being such a large part of the time spent (although I suppose I should've paid a little more attention to the Canvas discussion pages for that sort of discourse). Sometimes the readings didn't feel connected to the work at hand in a concrete way. One might expect the readings in this course to be about, say, architectural theory, and while there was some of that, most of it was about the process of doing work through research, writing, and seeing. I appreciated them nonetheless."

                "You gotta take this course if you want to do a yearlong thesis, and I'd highly recommend it. It's one of the most unique courses I've taken at Yale and I cannot imagine doing my next semester of research without it. Honestly, the lessons I've learned in this course have already and will likely continually impact the way I approach formulating and presenting ideas, even for simple essays."
