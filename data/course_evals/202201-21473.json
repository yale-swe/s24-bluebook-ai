Not only do the lessons introduce useful grammar and vocabulary, the grammar exercises and word usage sections are a great learning tool. A weakness would be that, at least when complex grammar structures are introduced, it would be useful to have some instruction in English so we can actually figure out how the grammar patterns are supposed to work.",
