   "comments": [
    "Basic 3D modelling, rendering, experience design. Think critically about medium.",
    "Learned basic Unity and Maya as well as how to think critically about objects meaning and place in 3D virtual space.",
    "Gained some skills in Maya and Unity.  I also developed a better understanding of 3D art in context and as an emergent art-form.",
    "3D model build-up basic knowledge;\r\nessential maya and unity skills",
    "I learned how to create realistic 3d models of objects and spaces, how to 3d print those models, and even how to incorporate 3d models into navigable spaces through a computer game format as well as through virtual reality. I also gained a pretty rudimentary understanding of the techniques used to  make video games and 3d CGI movies. This class exposed me to the overwhelming possibilities that are achievable through 3d modeling and virtual reality, and sparked an interest in this field.",
    "This was the first art class I took at Yale, and it really inspired me to start thinking about new technologies and visual media in a new way as an artistic medium. In terms of technical skills, this course lets you become fairly proficient at Maya and Unity, but most of the learning is done through working on the final projects and self-teaching where need be. You learn what you need to in order to complete whatever open-ended project you decide to work on.",
    "Some understanding of working in Maya and surface overview of creating VR and 3d experiences in Unity"

   "comments": [
    "I think this course is absolutely necessary for any student using 3D medium in their work. Something really great about this course is that there simply aren't any others that really focus on such material at Yale. In terms of how the class was actually run, I thought it was a good start but there could be some small improvements. The professor gave a couple of examples of other artists that used 3D modeling in creative and innovative ways, but I feel like we could've gone into more depth on some of them and it would've been fun to let students do their own research on a 3D modeling artist and then do a presentation of why that artist had used 3D models in a creative way.",
    "I found the coursework engaging and interesting although the class was somewhat disorganized.  I found many of the discussions interesting, especially the visiting artists.  I would have preferred more of a focus on at-home learning in terms of Maya and Unity, as opposed to the in-class lectures, which I found somewhat unhelpful.",
    "One of the key strengths of this course was the freedom to explore whatever aspect of 3d modeling\/animation\/virtual reality interested us most. It was fascinating to see the different routes that students from various backgrounds took to create meaningful projects. Also, having in-class workdays where we could ask the professor and TAs for help or guidance was super helpful in gaining a more nuanced understanding of the softwares we were working with and the ways we can get the most out of them. \r\nCan't think of any weaknesses!",
    "The course felt a little unstructured, and featured only 2 small assignments outside of the midterm and the final. There was also very minimal actual instruction in 3D modeling (most of which was through an assigned Linda video tutorial)."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student if you are interested in a space where you can learn more about basic 3D modeling and Virtual Reality Devlopment\/game development for unity.",
    "If you are interested in 3D or digital art, then yes.  The final project is a great opportunity to explore some aspect of technological art and design.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning how to use software to create 3d models, animations, and navigable virtual environments. Justin is a super helpful and understanding professor and is pretty funny too. The workload isn't a lot and you really get a lot out out your assignments if you put in the thought and effort, not to mention you gain some pretty cool skills.",
    "Yes. You pick up technical skills while engaging in a very rewarding experience. If you have any interest in art and exploring 3D media's place in it, this will be a great experience.",
    "It was an interesting class and fun to experiment in Unity and Maya, but if you're looking to be actually taught 3D modeling, this is not the class for you (just watch a Linda tutorial like we did)"
