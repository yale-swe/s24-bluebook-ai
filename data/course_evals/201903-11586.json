   "comments": [
    "Learned about how gender influences politics with a lot of empirical research - a nice complement to the constant stream of news about the 2020 primary",
    "Empirical analysis and overall better idea of reading research based social science papers and the elements in them",
    "I learn so much about quantitative political science research methods as well as the status and representation of women in politics. Became a more efficient and critical reader and writer.",
    "More information about women in politics and how they are extremely underrepresented",
    "I learned the difference between substantive and descriptive representation and the methods employed by political scientists in measuring women's representation, stereotypes, and knowledge about female representatives.",
    "I developed my research method knowledge and ability to close read a variety of journal articles. Professor Aldrich's syllabus does a great job of making the course work manageable while very interesting.",
    "Gained considerable knowledge and insight on all topics outline on syllabus",
    "This class discusses political science research that primarily looks into why there aren't more women in office. Student-led discussions and written responses let you further process and analyze quantitative findings and implications.",
    "I learned a lot about the current political science literature on women in politics, especially within the United States. We discussed the meaning of representation (what it would mean for women and \"women's interests\" to be represented by government officials); differences between men and women in political knowledge, participation, representation, and preferences; how\/when gender stereotypes affect voters and women running for office; female candidate \"supply and demand\"; how different party and electoral systems impact women's election; and differences between women and men's typical political careers and governing strategies. This class isn't so much a \"gender politics\" class about how gender constructs impact politics and public policy so much as a \"women in politics\" class about female politicians, so I would keep that in mind when you're shopping. I think that in the past this class has been more comparative than it was this term, since the readings tended to skew towards American politics, but we did read some comparative articles. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the substantive focus of this class, I think it also gave me a good introduction to political science research methods. Almost all of the readings for this class were published political science papers, and Prof. Aldrich was really good about talking the class through how to read a paper and giving us the opportunity to discuss the different research designs that the authors used, without assuming any prior knowledge. (This is not a stats class, though, so we didn't go extremely far into the quantitative methods used in the papers--it was more that we got an overview of them in order to understand the paper than to be able to do such analysis ourselves). The major assignments in the class were either three short essays or your own research design (basically a research proposal where you came up with your own question, wrote a literature review, and described how you would conduct the analysis).",
    "I learned how to somewhat analyze basic quantitative political science. I also got a decent overview of the (quantitative) political science literature on women in politics. NOTE: heavy focus on Western\/European parliaments, studies and politicians"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Aldrich is wonderful, discussions were good towards the end of the semester\r\nWeaknesses: some readings werent great and early class discussion was awkward",
    "This course was so well taught. Readings were really interesting and Prof. Aldrich is a great instructor who makes seminar a comfortable environment. Only improvement was that I wish we didn't spend so much time going over concepts related to research design.",
    "Strengths: the journal helps to keep you engaged in course material",
    "Strengths: discussion-based format is good, particularly the fact that students decide the topics of discussion (usually). \r\nWeaknesses: the course is filled with busyworkfrom articles that we read and never discussed to meaningless reading responses, I rarely felt that I was doing work that actually furthered my understanding of the intersection of gender and politics. Also, the course's title should probably be changed, it's about women in politics, not \"gender\" writ large.",
    "One strength is Professor Aldrich. She is so dedicated to the class, her students, office hours for extra help, and the course material in general. Another strength is just the course material in general. It's fascinating and important to look at politics from a gendered lens to see how the US political system needs revamping. I think one weakness could be a discussion during class could run more smoothly and include more student's voices. Student discussion leaders monitor the discussion and they should really have the floor in order to facilitate dialogue between the class.",
    "Encouraged engagement and great feedback\/feedback process",
    "It's a seminar and hard to get into if you're not an upperclassmen. But the small size lends itself to good, open discussion. If you speak up in class and do the readings, the material is actually really interesting. Specific concepts in political science research are also explained. Sometimes the readings were a little too dense for my personal taste, but in class an overview of the main idea of each piece was more or less fine.",
    "Prof. Aldrich is definitely a strength of the course. It's clear that she cares a lot about her students and their learning, and I appreciated how she put a lot of thought into the syllabus and made efforts to incorporate student feedback into the course. She's very approachable! \r\n\r\nI think that the empirical focus of this course is also a real strength. I've started to feel that a lot of the courses I've taken in the Political Science Department are very theoretical, so I think it's really good that this course made use of empirical research papers in order to teach the material. This seems to be missing from a lot of the other courses in the department, so I found it helpful for gaining some insight into political science as a discipline, at least within this subfield. \r\n\r\nIn the future, I think the class could benefit from slightly more theory at the very beginning of the course (to explain concepts like intersectionality for students who haven't encountered them before, but not taking up more than a week or two), removing a few of the articles that were slightly redundant, and perhaps adding a little more about quotas along with some of the other comparative material. Prof. Aldrich took suggestions on the last day of class, so I think that these are things we all talked about and that she'll probably keep in mind when designing the syllabus for next time!",
    "This course is a great first political science seminar if you are a first year or sophomore. Andrea is a very encouraging and friendly instructor and a pleasure to be in seminar with. If you are nervous about being in your first seminar, this one is very good\/easy place to start. But, if you are a junior or senior, this course is probably not for you.  Conversation was often stagnant\/ not stimulating. I didn't feel that I learned anything new or mind blowing in seminar from our conversations that couldn't already be gleaned from the readings. Overall, seminar itself was very mediocre. Readings were interesting but also repetitive and sometimes dry due to the heavy quantitative focus. Unfortunately, I think focusing on quantitative political science is the biggest weakness of this course. There are so many interesting conversations to be had about feminist theory\/critical race theory\/media\/etc. and politics, yet this course does not include other forms of literature. Andrea is very receptive to feedback, however considering her specialty is quantitative political science, I doubt this course could become what I was really looking for.",
    "Strengths: Professor Aldrich is so knowledgeable in this area and an active researcher herself, so we  learned from both the material in the papers and from someone immersed in this kind of research herself. The syllabus was great (though sometimes a bit much, especially when the books assigned were a bit repetitive), and you get a pretty self-selective group of ppl who really want to learn about gender and politics, making the class discussions engaging. The journals were also a lower-stress way to see gender\/politics play out in our own lives, and I loved the real-world feel of it all. Would definitely recommend using the journals again, but maybe engaging in other mediums like movies\/plays\/current events.\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion leader selection. It was by random appointment which works in theory, but in practice people continued to be engaged until they became discussions leaders, after which they stopped really doing the readings\/paying attention, leaving the brunt of participation\/reading to those who hadn't been chosen as discussion leaders yet. I'm not sure how to remedy this, but maybe doing some kind of class-wide participation activity every week might be good."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes - interesting perspective on contemporary politics, and workload isnt insane. A great political science seminar if your semester is otherwise crazy.",
    "Yes - If you can't stand empirical research relating to social science then maybe not since some of the readings are slightly dense in that matter but overall the course is very interesting and Professor Aldrich creates a very comfortable and engaging discussion setting",
    "YES! The readings are super interesting and enlightening. Andrea is one of the best instructors I've ever had - she's so kind and approachable and makes even shy students feel like they can contribute in seminar.",
    "Yes, I think that this course is great at expanding your knowledge and actually teaching you what scholars are saying about the underrepresentation of women in politics",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Gender & Politics is a fantastic course that offers a great overview of many different ways of thinking about the role of gender in politics. It also offers a great exposure to working with more quantitative methods of political science.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this course to another student. Professor Aldrich is very well-meaning and kind, but seems pretty insecure in her teaching which provides for some awkward classroom dynamics. This was particularly ironic given the course's subject. It's simply too broad a topic to engage meaningfully with in a semester, and other professors probably do a better job of investigating it through other lenses in their courses.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to someone else. The interesting subject material, great professor and bagels and coffee in the last class were a plus!",
    "Yes this is a great course",
    "Yes. The bigger questions this course addresses is really important and it's interesting to apply the findings we read for this class to real current events in politics today.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class if you're looking for one of a few different things: (1) exposure to research on women in politics; (2) a good intro to political science research (especially if you're interested in seeing how people use survey data and quantitative methods to operationalize concepts) and opportunity to come up with your own research proposal (as long as it's related to women in politics in some way); (3) a chill seminar with a responsive professor. Prof. Aldrich's own research seems to lie in the overlap between women in politics and comparative parties and electoral systems, so she's definitely knowledgeable about the field. I haven't taken her seminar in the spring on parties and electoral systems, but I would imagine that the setup of the class is somewhat similar and it would also be a great class to take if your interests align with the topics in that class.",
    "It depends what you want out of the course. If you are into quantitative political science about European\/US white female politicians, then this is for you. Not difficult and interesting at times. Otherwise, I would not recommend this course. Seminar discussions are dry and boring. They are also led by students which I disagree with as a teaching style. Students do not know how to properly lead a Yale seminar conversation to be interesting and engaging enough (me included!).",
    "Yes! \r\nStrengths: Professor Aldrich is so knowledgeable in this area and an active researcher herself, so we  learned from both the material in the papers and from someone immersed in this kind of research herself.
