                "This course taught me a lot about seeing various topics from different perspectives, whether it be ethics, truth, morality, etc. I learned a lot about how the humanities and sciences intersect and interact with each other. Furthermore, I learned a lot about various cognitive biases during the presentations -- I really enjoyed them and found it fun to learn from my classmates.",
                "Aside from knowledge in ethics and philosophy, this course provided me with an entirely new perception of the medical field. I now understand medicine as an innovative and technical, yet personal, career path that I am tremendously excited to pursue.",
                "I learned about the intersection between medicine (typically perceived to be STEM-heavy) and the humanities, and how doctors think and approach their practice.",
                "Developed a lot of critical thinking skills and a new view on medicine and the sciences that involves the humanities",
                "This course took us through literature, as well as the philosophy of science and medicine in order to express the fully \"human\" side of medicine. The course taught me much about the human-ness of the healthcare profession, and also gave me a chance to read Russian literature and philosophy of science. It was the perfect humanities course, and gave me a much better understanding of doctors.",
                "I learned a huge amount about how doctors think, which is very good to know in the case that Im ever in the hospital. I also learned about cognitive biases and how to prevent them.",
                "How to analyze readings, knowledge of medicine and more.",
                "This course offered a wonderful perspective into an aspect of medicine and medical practice that is often not widely talked about, that of humanity and humility. It allowed me to understand aspects of the medical field, from its uncertainty to its plethora of cognitive biases, through engaging with readings from poets, philosophers, and doctors. It provided me with an opportunity to write essays with a strong personal aspect and assess my own experiences through the lenses of the main ideas of the course. Overall, the course was an amazing experience that allowed me to understand that field of medicine on a deeper more meaningful level."

                "I think that some strengths of the course are Dr. Morrison's experiences/stories that he gives to the class, his ability to lead a conversation while staying open to various opinions, the variety of readings that we had, the variety of guest speakers (some of whom are quite well-known) we heard from, and the papers which allowed me to reflect on medical experiences within my family from a different perspective. Furthermore, although this perhaps is not specific to the course, I think we had really interesting conversations in this class which I quite enjoyed.",

                "Amazing course, would be better in person but other than that was super engaging and well done",
                "This course was very well taught- it was a seminar in which readings were done before class, and classtime was spent either in discussions or with guest lecturers. The guest lecturers were great and really increased my engagement with the course. I also enjoyed the readings, and the two papers were fun to write.\r\nI cannot find many weaknesses.",
                "I loved this course. The readings, especially the books, were fascinating. I would suggest that in the future, we spend a bit more time on the supplemental readings and discuss how they connect to the larger themes of the  class. I would also have appreciated a bit more direction about the paper assignments. That being said, these are small complaints and overall I absolutely adored the class.",
                "Amazing, no weaknesses.",
                "The course was overall taught fantastically. Dr. Morrison is one of the kindest, most passionate, and excited instructors I have ever had the privilege to have. His energy and commitment really makes this course what it is. Even though the pace of the course can feel fast during the summer session, the readings are manageable and offer structure and context for the main ideas of the course. When it comes to anything that could be improved, it would maybe be a bit more conducive for the flow of the course for the sessions to lean a bit more towards discussion amongst the students and Dr. Morrison, as there are so many incredibly interesting ideas that are brought up and very little time to talk about everything. Overall, this course was phenomenal, truly incredibly taught!"

                "YES! This course is amazing for any field, but particularly for those interested in medicine. It gives you readings that stare right into the heart of the human experience, and really leave you wondering what it means to /be/ human.",
                "Yes! The information is so so important for everyone to know, whether or not one wants to become a doctor.",

                "Yes! Yes! Yes!",
                "Absolutely, especially if they are premed or considering medicine as a potential profession. This course is absolutely incredible and Dr. Morrison is one of the best, kindest, most passionate, and most considerate instructors I have ever had. Learning from him and talking with him feels so organic and exhilarating. The course really showed me that the anthropocentric approach to medicine is absolutely essential. The readings and discussions allowed me to truly see what the meaning of medicine is and what the role of physicians is within the profession. Highly highly recommend this course!"
