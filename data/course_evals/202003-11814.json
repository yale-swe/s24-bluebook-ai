                "This course, more so than the other two DS courses, seemed to have more \"filler\" information in the readings that we were assigned but never really talked about in discussion. I wish we could have more specific sections to read and focus on, so that I could spend less time reading and get more from the texts.",
                "This course has a very high reading load which was stressful. I am a slow reader which meant I often didn't finish readings and was then less involved in discussions than I wanted to be. But when I had finished the reading and was fully engaged, I found our discussion questions fascinating",
                "Lectures were generally good, but many could have used more general information and scaffolding. With all of the close reading, it is easy to lose the big-picture and providing that in lectures would have helped. Professor Schillinger's introductions served this purpose well. \r\nStrengths: a supportive but challenging seminar environment with rigorous discussion, smart and passionate peers, and amazing texts.",
                "Like any DS course, too many books and not enough time spent on them, but this is the general goal with DS so its acceptable. More clear essay guild lines would be cool.",
                "I think going virtual stood as a huge impediment to my learning experience. It could not be helped, of course, but I would hope that when covid ended there would be a huge emphasis on the in person elements.",
                "The strengths of this course were in its ability to transition easily to an online format. Seminars felt personal and engaging. The readings, which would have been done personally even during a traditional year, were fascinating and wonderful texts.",

                "Yes, even if they don't think they would necessarily be interested in ancient history and\/or politics. I was not expecting to enjoy this class as much as I did, mostly because I didn't even understand what \"Historical & Political Thought\" meant. Give it a try! It's great.",

                "Yes, I think DS gives a historical background to tons of content and everyone should know it.",
                "To someone considering taking this class I would say to be aware that the co tent and discussions are 90% based in an ancient times and there are not a lot of chances to make modern day connections. Of course there is a richness of discussions that can be had about those times and those ancient writers but if you were looking for a class that would emphasize connecting the past to the future there is not much of that in this class.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. The course fosters a great sense intellectual curiosity in students and grants first years a unique ability to write personally engaging papers on relevant topics. Although the readings may be of a higher level than students have experienced before, it is well worth the challenge.",
                "If they are interested in a discussion about politics that goes even deeper than simple political theory, then yes. The insertion of morality, religion, and philosophy into our discussion of political thought made the class challenging and interesting."
