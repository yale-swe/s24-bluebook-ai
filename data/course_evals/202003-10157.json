                "Not always enough examples done in lecture to understand the homework.",
                "The course is well structured and the lectures are clear. However, the course seems to have taught different stuff than in previous years which made provided review material from past years not very helpful",
                "The course was organized very well and I loved how Prof Kim visualized the content with real-world examples from his work at Pixar!",
                "PSETs were very helpful for understanding, loved Professor Kim's historical tangents and demonstrations of the material in his own movies\/work. Weaknesses: massive jump in difficulty on final",
                "Strengths: Very well taught. Prof. Kim explained concepts well and also presented examples of these concepts being used by actual computer scientists in cool ways so the content never felt irrelevant.   Lectures never felt dull. \r\n\r\nThe problem sessions were really helpful and got me through this course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's a math class and math is hard :'(",
                "I really wish this course had had some more practical examples.  While the professor occasionally showed some notation we were learning in a paper, that wasn't really sufficient to demonstrate that any of the material was actually useful.  I would have much preferred if we had seen some real examples of code that solved some problem using the math we were learning.  I had mixed feelings about the various pieces of history worked into the class.  While some amount of it would certainly be useful, we spent very large portions of certain classes discussing history and context behind some concepts.  I would have preferred that history be scattered into much smaller pieces throughout the semester than in large chunks at random intervals.",
                "A strength is that the class introduces you to a wide array of topics, which helps to identify potential classes you may want to take in the future.\r\n\r\nThere are many weaknesses. For starters, the lectures covered a lot of additional information that never came up on homework or assignments. Also, I found it difficult to get help from the TAs, as most of them didn't seem like they really wanted to help you through the problem. Also, the class is weighted very heavily on the final exam (45% for us), which I think is a bit much and makes the hard work you do throughout the entire semester not all that important in determining your final grade.",
                "The fast pace of the course took some getting used to, and at times the amount of time spent on each topic felt a bit unbalanced.",
                "I thought the class spent too much time on the history of the math. While it's interesting to note that the names of theorems or branches of math do not reflect or credit the original inventor, that's not what I wanted to learn in this class. I would have liked to have focused less on the history and more on the actual content of the course.",
                "I loved how Prof. Kim talked about practical applications of the course material in computer graphics, which I thought were really interesting. I also enjoyed the historical discussions of mathematical formulae. I think a potential improvement is to provide more examples of how to solve problems using the theorems (instead of just the theorems) during lecture.",
                "The material was taught well and there were lots of available resources for doing the homework. Lots of examples are done both in class and through the homework which helps reinforce the material. But, the material itself is kinda dry.",
                "Strengths: recordings, homework and exam organisation\r\nWeaknesses: going through the course material in a rushed way",
                "Strengths: Professor Kim is really engaging and funny and goes out of his way to make the content digestible and relevant to the class. He always provides super interesting context to the material that we're learning and is clearly knowledgeable about the course material. Weaknesses: None.",
                "The class was very well taught. The only weakness is a lack of support. I think the TAs would often refuse to look at our pset answers or even help us approach the questions. In practice, this made it very hard to ask for help at all. One TA, however, was helpful because he would hold weekly problem sessions where he would solve similar problems like the questions on the pset. This allowed us to have a model to follow. Otherwise, there wasn't that much support.",
                "The fact that you cant check homework answers before turning in the assignment is frustrating. Even if you explain your approach to the problem to the course assistants, a lot of the grading comes down to the finer details as well, meaning that it was impossible for me to do get even get close to a score of 85% on my hw assignments. The distribution of points is also very overwhelming: the fact that the final is worth 45% of the grade, especially during this online period, puts an even greater strain on students (at least thats my thought).",
                "Strengths: Professor Kim did an excellent job explaining concepts. His explanations were clear and easy to follow. Additionally, the course material was presented in a way that made the practical applications apparent. For instance, Professor Kim explained the geometrical interpretation of matrix-vector multiplications and showed us a graphical representation of such multiplications. This was helpful in demonstrating how linear algebra is applied in computer graphics. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The grading breakdown placed heavy emphasis on (timed) exams, with 30% of the course grade from the midterm and 45% of the grade from the final. Personally I think that I would have learned the material better if homework assignments were more heavily emphasized (perhaps slightly longer assignments for a greater portion of the course grade), or if there were three \"lower-stakes\" exams. I found myself doing \"strategic studying\" and \"strategic test-taking\" for the exams. That is to say, when I studied for the the exams, I found myself asking \"on which concepts might the professor want to test us, and how will he do so?\" rather than \"how can I gain a deeper understanding of all of these mathematical concepts?\"",
                "I really enjoyed this course with Professor Kim. The content was paced nicely and Prof Kim always makes sure to ask if anyone has questions. The only weakness is I there are definitely too many people in this introductory course that already know the material which is unfortunate and frustrating, but I'm not sure what there is to do about that.",
                "The content in class was explained very well. However, sometimes I felt lost when doing the homework assignments, which were typically much more difficult than in-class examples. Office hours were generally unhelpful as the TAs could not provide specific guidance. The problem session, on the other hand, was very helpful, and I would have benefitted from more sessions that covered examples similar to the homework problems. The speed seemed to be much quicker in the second half of the course as the content became harder to follow.",
                "As stated before, this class seems only to care about breadth rather than depth, and I sincerely doubt I would be able to use any of the topics covered in this class for anything meaningful as a result.",
                "The first part of the course is very easy to follow. The second part requires more attention to detail",
                "Class was strong",
                "Tests were very different from the homework assignments. Step by step walkthroughs during class were often non-existent or insufficient to be able to accomplish the problem sets and tests.",
                "The course was well organized",
                "The help hours were very helpful especially when stuck on pset questions. TA's were not allowed to help with psets directly but they guided us through similar problems which was usually enough. The rubrics for the psets are sometimes very harsh though.",
                "Although it moved at a brisk pace, this class was paced very well for an intro-level course. The concepts were ordered at a decent level of difficulty, and I always felt as though I was moving up at a constant pace. There were numerous sources for the aid of all kinds, and the class structure enabled different types of studying strategies. I enjoyed the liberties that were granted in this regard and it helped me be more successful in this class.",
                "n\/a",
                "there's a lot of things we didn't prove; we just went with them. I understand that the proof may go over our heads, so maybe some sort of informal proof for the things we just take for granted would suffice.",
                "The lectures were interesting and the content of the course was relevant to various branches of computer science. However, the pace of the class was often pretty fast, especially when trying to cram linear algebra into the end of the semester. Also, I rarely found the ULAs very helpful, as they often seemed more concerned with not revealing solutions than helping students with their approach to homework problems.",
                "Strengths: Course was well organized with examples to facilitate learning. Assignments were well designed for course content",
                "The professor was a great lecturer: clear, articulate, and always open to questions from students. The weekly homeworks were reasonable for the most part, but it felt like going to the review sessions were necessary if you wanted to do well on them. On the weeks I could not make it I tried going to the TA help hours, but those were never very helpful to me. I stopped going to those help hours since I knew I was not going to get much help or even clarification. At least the few times I went, the TAs seemed unwilling to walk through the practice problems they had been provided with, so they ended up trying to help verbally without giving away the answer which was not very helpful. If anything, overhearing the misunderstandings happening when the TAs were trying to help other people were more confusing. The help hours were very unstructured, but it is possible that improved later in the course when I had stopped going. Otherwise, the lectures and textbook were very helpful for the homework, and those questions were good preparation for the exams. The exams were challenging but not impossible, so it was good balance.",
                "I really enjoyed the style of Prof. Kim's lecture notes, as well as the way the lectures were recorded and posted in PDF format. These three things combined I found to be a very strong attribute for the course, and helped me succeed in it tremendously."

Professor Kim was also sympathetic to students' concerns and the teaching staff was accessible over email or during help hours.",

                "Office hours were never helpful. Oftentimes the ULAs weren't able to help with even general concepts to help us through problem sets. The justification for that was that they weren't allowed to disclose answers, but that was majorly not what students came to OH for.",

As with other classes, the midterm and final exams were allowed to be taken at any point throughout a 24 hour period. Additionally, our professor created an alternate exam format for students with additional needs registered with the office. Both exams were done in an open note, open internet format, with the only caveat being that no human aid was allowed. \r\n\r\nThere were many avenues to submit assignments, and this was also done exceptionally well. I was able to transition to another submission method that suited my needs better with no issues. Our teaching fellow and TA's were always available, and in particular, our teaching fellow would lead two 'problem sesssions' where he would go over problems similar to the ones in that week's assignment (or exam). All in all, it was made very easy to have a successful semester in this class.",

                "The use of live virtual lectures and available recordings afterwards was very successful.",
                "The only issue I had was the online help hours. They could have been more organized and overall better. Or, at least the weekly review sessions could have been recorded and uploaded both for future reference to those that did make it to the live session but more importantly as a resource for those that could not make it to those sessions. That would have been very useful, given that the help hours were never as helpful as the review sessions for the homework.",

                "I wouldn't suggest it nor would I advise against it. It isn't easy, but it isn't hard. It isn't useful, but it isn't useless. It's extraordinarily neutral in nature.",
                "It was a decent class but probably would only recommend if you need it for CS or you just really want to learn CS concepts",
                "Yes, decent course",
                "If you are a CS major, then you have to take it",
                "Yes, especially for first or second year STEM students. It covered a lot of fundamental concepts that are used in every math class and probably many others! Professor Kim was fantastic as a professor. The lectures were interesting and engaging, PSETs were not too bad but still gave good practice (+ gives you a chance to learn LaTeX) and exams were very fair.",
                "Yeah! I'm not a very mathy person (needed this class for the CS requirement) and this class was still decently enjoyable. Plus it's really important content.",
                "I would highly recommend this course, and anything taught by Professor Kim, to another student.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the math of computer science. I feel more comfortable with mathematical notation and certain CS concepts",
                "Yes, especially with Prof. Kim! Even though it's required for the major it was still a pretty interesting and fun class! I met some cool friends and learned interesting types of math.  I would also recommend this for anyone who wants to fulfill a QR because I think discrete math\/linear algebra (and the way they're taught in this class) are nicer than calculus and this is way less stressful than CS50.",
                "If it were an optional course, I probably wouldn't recommend this to a CS student who simply wanted the skills to go and code for a living.  This class was often much more about the math and theory behind some very abstract concepts in CS.  I wouldn't say it was directly applicable to anything.",
                "Yes, but only because I've heard that Math 244 is worse. CS majors are required to take one or the either, so I'd advise a student to just take this course and do their best.",
                "Good class! The psets were pretty enjoyable, and we basically covered a new branch of mathematics each week. While we couldn't cover much depth in any one topic, I feel like I have enough of a foundation to further explore these topics in the future.",
                "I would recommend this course. I think Professor Kim cares about the students and is invested in helping them learn. The class felt well organized, and it moved at a good pace.",
                "Yes, it was an interesting course with engaging lectures.",
                "You're probably taking this to fulfill a requirement, but it's still a good class to take. Professor Kim takes the time to explain the material and go through examples thoroughly. The material is a little dry but still useful to know for CS. The homework isn't too difficult if you understand the examples from the lecture, and the exams are pretty fair.",
                "If you know what sets and matrices are, and if you know how to use induction proofs, then no. If you have very basic math knowledge and want to learn more, then maybe. But be prepared to be rushed through many topics.",
                "If you want an introduction to proof-based mathematics, I think this course is a really nice way to start! Would definitely recommend to anyone interested.",
                "Yes, Theodore Kim is a great teacher and he made math (a subject I hate) bearable.",
                "No, avoid this course at all costs. Even if you are interested in CS, which you likely are, you will be far better off taking the math-version of the course (which I believe is  MATH 244, but I could be wrong). When solving the Psets, you are quite honestly on your own, as you cant check your work with the course assistants. And the fact that the final is 45% of the course grade will likely put an immense strain on you, during the weeks leading up to finals week and that week itself.",
                "This is a required course for the Computer Science major. That being said, if a student wants to learn more about the basics of discrete mathematics and how these concepts are applied in computer science, I would recommend this course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course if it is with Professor Kim. I feel like this content could very easily have been horrid with a different teaching approach. I'm a half stem person and I found most of the content pretty interesting, but some portions a tad sleep inducing. This is for sure a credit\/d kinda class if it's not for your major. The average grades were pretty high throughout the course. The homework grading was at times, unnecessarily aggressive.\r\n\r\nAlso, for poc, taking a computer science\/stem course with a non-white professor is something that is so very necessary so I extra recommend this course to any poc students.",
                "Overall, it's a good course that's required for computer science students. The second half of the course seems to move faster, so pacing could be looked into.",
                "I would definitely recommend Dr. Kim and this course to any CS major. He gives a great overview of proofs, linear algebra, boolean algebra, and graph theory, and the problemsets are hard but fun. 10\/10.",
                "Absolutely not. I took this course with Professor Kim, and I would say that it is probably the the worst course I have ever taken in my life. You will not learn anything in this course in depth enough to actually be able to use it at all in your life - besides maybe how to use LaTeX. Perhaps this would be different in person, but Professor Kim was very detached from his students, and often did not respond to emails in my experience - important ones, too, such as ones in regards to grades. He is a very 'strict' teacher, so make sure you pay attention to the wording of every little question and request that he asks of you, as if you are anything but exactly literal in your response, you won't receive credit. Only take this course if you are a computer science major and NEED to take it. Even then, take it with a different teacher if you want to have anything but a semblance of hatred for discrete mathematics.",
                "Yes if required for major",
                "Yes, I would but I struggled with the problem set grading.",
                "Yes. Interesting class",
                "Yes, the psets sometimes felt like puzzles and were very satisfying to complete and the exams were pretty reasonable. I learned a lot about applications of Math in CS as well.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The class is easily accessible, both inside of and outside of the Computer science major. It is a great beginner class for proof-based math, and the pace is comfortable enough to follow along, with help being consistently easy to access at any point throughout the day, even for students outside of the North American time zones.",
                "n\/a",
                "yup if you wanna do CS as your major. It's necessary. If you're just doing it for fun, then knock yourself out.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in computer science, as lots of the topics covered are very relevant to CS.",
                "Yes, it helps build a solid foundation for some higher level CS courses and helps learn the basics of proofs.",
                "Yes, I loved getting an introduction into more logic and proof based math.",
                "Yes; if they were required to take it. The knowledge seems a bit specialized if one wasn't interested in math or computers, but considering it was a required course I found it much more engaging than a typical math course, and I like how Prof. Kim would occasionally stop to make a brief note about the history of some mathematical concept as it evolved throughout time."
