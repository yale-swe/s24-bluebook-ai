Broadly, this class transformed the way that I understand racism in this country -- this is knowledge that all Yale students should gain during their time here.",
                "This was one of the most important classes I've taken in my entire life. I learned more than I have in any other semester long stretch. The class was well structured to take a multidisciplinary approach to racism. I learned about the history of the term, the social science behind it, and developed a language for talking about it.",
                "This course helped provide me with new lenses of analysis and theoretical tools with which to understand what racism is, how racism operates, how we can diagnose it in the real world, and, consequently, how to begin working to correct it.",
                "understanding the depth and impact a definition can make. insight on the world. the difficultly in doing something right and having it produce long lasting positive effects.",
                "A deep and complex understanding of how deep racism runs. We don't just learn about what racism is. But we learn how it functions. You will learn what the stakes are, how important a definition is, and how it affects every single thing in its domains (there are many domains). You will have some writing and reading. But it will come naturally if you can be specific when talking about racism. This class is deep, it hits hard, there are times where you will leave the class and just think about it over the walk back to your dorm. This class is possibly the best taught class and one of the most important classes at Yale.",
                "How to analyze what is and whats not racist.",
                "I learned how race can be defined and different definitions of racism throughout recent history. I learned how to synthesize several definitions to come up with my own definition racism. I learned diagnostic techniques and vocabulary to recognize and diagnose racism in the world. I gained a more nuanced perspective on race and racism.",
                "None. As a Black person in the class this was very much a regurgitation of experiences felt and personally didn't feel helpful in any way possible.",
                "I developed a more specific vocabulary and a much more in-depth understanding of what can be classified as racism, as well as what does not fall under this classification, predominantly in the United States. The class encouraged me to develop my own definitions of racism using the literature and what I believed my understanding to be, which was enlightening.",
                "This course was very helpful in providing a foundation for concepts I was already familiar with.",

                "Good practice reading through psych and stats studies, especially for humanities majors who don't really deal w\/ quant stuff on a regular basis. Good historical groundings for lots of contemporary racial dynamics, studies about racism in different domains\/levels and through different processes.",

                "Greater insight on how defining racism influences interventions; the challenges of demonstrating causality of racial disparities; how to consider the stakes of diagnosing something as racist\r\n\r\nI also learned a lot about various research methods and how to construct a compelling argument with writing.",

                "I learned how to critically analyze readings and discussions by taking this course. Through the midterm and final papers, I learned how to craft a coherent and convincing argument. Most importantly, this course expanded my awareness on racism and its consequences and implications on different aspects of our lives. I became more aware on how to acknowledge the flaws and limitations that my ideas introduced.",

                "Diagnosing racism, learning how to communicate with others",
                "This course is the most valuable academic experience I've ever had. Thinking critically about what racism means on a fundamental level, and the consequences of those definitions, has reshaped my academic trajectory. This class gave me the tools to frame conversations about racism in both academia and every day life in a completely new way, as well as interpret and criticize data, research, and sociological findings to do with demonstrating racism.",
                "I have learned how to read social science papers and think critically about race topics.",

                "Gained knowledge to make my own definition of racism using class materials",
                "I learned about the many different method and ways racism could be expressed (implicit vs explicit), especially at different levels (micro, meso, macro)",
                "This class exposed me to the ways racism is so deeply ingrained in our society and the tools needed to not only understand our history and the legacy of racism but also what can be done to combat it.",
                "I developed the knowledge that all studies and papers should be read with a critical eye. I learned what can and cannot be concluded from studies.",
                "I learned different definitions of racism (e.g. Racism as prejudice, law, ideology, pathology, etc.). I also learned how to critique these definitions and how each of them is incomplete, given different situations.",
                "This course is an overly-complicated way of explaining racism using dense sociological studies with many many flaws in their methodology.",
                "I developed the vocabulary, theory, and knowledge about racism in different domains. The class also encouraged me to develop my own definition of racism through the midterm and apply it through the final.",

                "I learned how to give words and substance to the ideas I already had about racism in America.",
                "learned effective ways to think about and confront racism. learned strategies, theories, and methods for determining if something is racist.",
                "I learned how to define racism, which was not an easy task, and how to think about racism scientifically and psychologically.",
                "Understanding of how racism functions in society, basic knowledge of part of the history of racism in America, ways of thinking about what racism\/what is racist.",
                "In this course, I learned perspectives for interpreting and combating racism. I learned to think about problems in the world and evaluate solutions. Through this course, I was able to work on a final essay evaluating racism in a topic that I've been meaning to work on even before this course.",
                "How to form my own definition of what racism isor perhaps, of how the definition of racism changes depending on the scenario.",
                "I learn how to talk about race\/racism in an academic context and I feel better equipped to defend my arguments",
                "I learned so much about diagnosing racism, being careful with how I evaluate situations. and making sure the language I use is conveying what I want to speak about. I learned something new in every lecture, and I know that it can be applied to my future classes and interactions with peers.",
                "This course completely changed my perspective on academic and race in life. I was worried at first that the course would be too broad or delineated from a single point and Professor Goff tied every lecture together so well. I loved this course and would highly recommend",
                "Unfortunately a great deal of the course felt like common sense and did not present much new information or unfamiliar concepts in the way that I had hoped it would after shopping it. Still, it's important material to know and Dr. Goff is a very engaging lecturer, so it may be worth taking the class just for that reason if you have the space in your schedule.",
                "I learned how to put words and statistics to the feelings of racism.",
                "It helped me broaden my understanding of race and racism. It helped me think critically on this matter that plays a crucial role in the American society.",
                "This class provided a comprehensive set of skills that students can use to come to conclusions about different definitions of racism and how to apply those various definitions to different scenarios, both hypothetical and in the real world. I found this class incredibly useful for providing a base of knowledge and resources on which to base arguments and conversations having to do with the topic of race. This class was organized in such a way that there was a solid foundation for every argument that was made and students were able to come to their own conclusions based on the information provided, but in a way that prioritized the voices and perspectives of people harmed by racism.",
                "I was able to better understand racism and they way it exists in America; from breaking down ideologies, myths, and different historical events that helped shape the development of America's unique 'brand' of racism.",
                "This course is by no means exhaustive, but it allows students to understand what is involved with racism in the USA, to dissect problems of racism and to begin thinking about solutions. It helped me develop critical thinking and writing skills. We learn how to dissect a text to find the intentions of an author and their implications. It also is a good introduction to some social science methods and good research practices.",
                "This course supplemented much of the coursework Ive taken in ER&M\/critical race studies classes and it helped to solidify the foundation Ive developed.",
                "how to develop a very diverse-in-strategy approach to investigating a topic that is very large and extremely hard to pin down. A mix of psych, humanities, and other social science helped see a fuller picture even though the class only hits the broad concept of racism in a survey form (as emphasized by prof. Goff). I learned a ton about covert effects and problems that can manifest themselves in complex ways. Very eye-opening. without this class, it was admittedly very difficult to engage with race-based issues. The pitfalls and limits of stats is harped on heavily, which was very helpful moving forward as a social scientist in general. Hall's work on ideology was also life-changing for me as I think about things in this world.",
                "I developed many skills and was especially inspired by this course. There would be moments at times that I would wish the lectures would be longer because they were so intriguing. This was my favorite class of the semester and I highly value what was taught.",
                "How to research a topic of your choice, methodologies involving racism, having the vocabulary for how to talk about racism.",
                "I learned a lot about how to interpret and be critical of data. I feel like Ive learned how to pick apart common arguments used during discussions about whether something is racist.",
                "I learned about different scholarly theories of racism and ways to analyze a topic using the those theories we learned about in class. I also learned different examples of how racism can present itself in various example case studies.",
                "learned that the definition of racism and what counts as racist evolves over time; learned to be precise with terms such as \"racism,\" \"prejudice,\" and \"bias;\" experienced how to have respectful and productive discourse regarding racism; inspected the intersections between race and other categories that can make people vulnerable; learned that \"woke\" does not equal \"correct\" or \"beneficial;\" my critical thinking skills are noticeably improved",
                "I learned a lot of vocabulary regarding how to define racism and more. I am able to speak on micro agressions and personal experiences with more knowledge behind the encounter",
                "I first learned how to create a definition of racism using historical and contemporary definitions. I then learned how to argue that something is racist.",
                "I learned how to analyze research papers and how to define key terms in society. I learned how to approach things with an open mind and how to truly listen to my peers.",
                "More than any other course I have taken at Yale, this class fundamentally shaped how I engage with the world. Just as Professor Goff emphasized they would, his lectures over theories and domains of racism have influenced my perception of education, art, sports, politics, healthcare, the built environment, and beyond, critically granting me the words with which to address these dynamics. This class taught me to take nothing for granted, as we questioned even successful and well-intentioned initiatives to expose their flaws and improve them for the people they impact. Unlike any other class at Yale, this course underscored the stakes of what we were learning to give me a newfound urgency and appreciation for the purpose and application of all my studies. I cannot emphasize its impact enough.",
                "I learned about the challenges of defining and diagnosing racism in the real world. I learned strategies and vocabulary for engaging in conversations about topics related to racism.",
                "It's really interesting to learn about how racism can be researched and quantified because people listen to numbers. So learning about all of the ongoing research that's surrounding the effects of racism has been so relevant and important."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Interesting and important lectures, FANTASTIC TAs and discussion sections, and interesting readings. Not too much work if you budget time for the readings and plan out your essays in advance. I felt like I learned a lot. I also felt that the class was welcoming to people at different points in their racism education...I can imagine that some students would worry about feeling like they know less (or talk about racism less intelligently) than peers. If that's the case, don't worry -- this is truly an intro class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't have a whole lot of comments...although I wish that there was even more opportunity to have discussions! Discussion sections felt far too short...it might be interesting to add something to the class that would allow for more engagement.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Goff did an excellent job presenting the material in an accessible way. I frequently felt the stakes but never felt hopeless. The readings were not too extreme and were often very engaging. Overall, the class did an excellent job.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, it felt like some conclusions were not neatly reached. That's to say I felt unsatisfied at times with where a conversation ended. It felt like more work and discourse needed to be done. I'd also add that throughout the course, we're told that definitions of racism are not agreed upon. I think it would benefit from a shared class definition following the midterm, especially to help facilitate the discussions in the last two weeks.",
                "The course had a number of strengths and Im honestly not sure if it had any weaknesses. Professor Goff is a very funny and engaging lecture who has also evidently cares deeply both about his subject and his students. Beyond his strengths as a lecturer, he also selected a number of very interesting and important readings, two very intellectually stimulating and unique essay prompts, and a subject that is imperative to understand and to teach in todays political climate. I dont think I have anything bad to say about it.",
                "Strengths: Engaging and brilliant professor. Well-organized and crafted syllabus. \r\nWeakness: none",
                "some of the readings were a bit dense but professor goff broke them down in class which made it better",
                "Strenghts: TF's are there for you. Dr. Goff is there for you. Classmates are there for you. You get to have these real conversations. The lectures are the best thing in the world. For other classes you might want to watch the recording. For this class you want to go every day. Weaknesses: sometime the readings will leave you confused, you might not understand something and that's ok because you can't really 100% \"get\" racism.",
                "I think the second half of the semester was not as interesting as the first but I liked the papers",
                "Strengths - Professor Goff is amazing! He is an incredible lecturer and really cares about the course material and his students. Everyday in lecture he would show us something that completely blew my mind. I also appreciated how invested he was in our experience in the class and he often emphasized that the work we do in the class and the things we learn have real-life consequences. He also bought all of us insomnia cookies for the last lecture. He's also hilarious in class which provides some relief in a class that deals with such a heavy topic as racism. Weaknesses - none though he often goes through lectures a bit too fast but they are recorded so you are able to watch them back later.",
                "Personally, I don't know who this course would be good for. If you are Black or POC, your life is repeated for you. If you are White or part of a dominant culture, you are educated with numbers and studies and it's hard to understand real implications.",
                "Strengths of the course: The reading materials were comprehensive and weekly section cleared any misunderstandings as well as expanded on the concept of the week. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses of the course: The due dates of 5PM for critical questions and larger assignments were more stressful than helpful, and I believe a deadline of 11:59PM on those days would make more sense for the current educational structure (predominantly online assignments).",
                "The content is very engaging and Professor Goff is by far one of the best professors I've had in my time at Yale, so the lectures and readings themselves never felt too much like work or tedious at all. I think one of the weaknesses is just that there's no real way to know how you are doing in the course academically because there's very few assignments and grades aren't really posted\/aren't a focus of the course, so that can be a bit annoying to deal with if you care a lot about your GPA. A more structured grading system could improve it perhaps but grades also aren't really its focus.",
                "No weaknesses only strengths",
                "I think this course might be really grounding if I had never taken a class about race before, but it often felt as though the lectures and readings for the weeks were not clearly linked which made for a sort of dissonant class experience (sections felt a bit detached from the lectures). I thought the assignments could have been more productive and interesting, but they became a bit difficult to write because it often seemed like Professor Goff gave unclear rubrics with different amounts of questions to answer and it was stressful to feel like I could be knocked off several points for being more subtle or inexplicit. Often, I felt I was sacrificing fluidity in my writing to answer questions more plainly\/make unnecessary separate points. \r\nThat being said, Professor Goff is an outstanding lecturer. He really cares about his students and it is refreshing to have a professor who understands that grades are not the most important thing especially in the context of what we're learning.",
                "Strengths- important conversations and topics were covered, engaging lectures\r\nWeakness- none",
                "Professor Goff is a very engaging lecturer!",
                "I felt like this class was really fast paced but I dont think thats a fault of the class but more of just me becoming acclimated to college courses in general as a first year. The readings and discussion during lectures and discussion sections really helped me make sense of the material we were learning at the time.",
                "The lectures are very well done and the TAs are very devoted to helping students. \r\n\r\nI did not find submitting discussion questions to be a helpful in my learning.",
                "Well organized and structured. Consistent assignments and you always know what to expect. Prof. G. is an incredible lecturer.",
                "One of the weaknesses of this course was that the large size of the course prevented further engagement between the professor and students. Office hours were quite limited, particularly around the deadlines of the big assignments. The biggest strength of this course was perhaps the discussion sections, which were very open and cultivated productive discussion on important topics.",
                "The course could be improved by changing the deadlines from 5:00 pm to midnight.",
                "heavy readings-maybe less reading and more conversation focused on one reading",
                "This class was fantastic in basically every way. The readings were fascinating 95% of the time, and lectures were some of my favorite times of the week. I always looked forward to hearing Dr. Goff's lecture that day and came away with insights and questions.",
                "I wish the course had more discussions on racism in and on more POC communities than the Black community.",

The TFs are amazing as well, and encouraged deeper thinking on everything we learned from the readings and in lecture. However, the midterm and final papers were very open ended, and I wish I had a stronger writing background before taking the course.",
                "The course readings were quite dense",
                "The course was very engaging and very well organized. I felt we were able to cover so much material in a meaningful way.",
                "The strengths are the breadth and accessibility of the course  it's easy to take coming in from any level. Sometimes, the sections were not enough to truly dive into the material and discuss it fully.",
                "I wish Prof. Goff had talked about how we might apply the various definitions of racism during the White Injury and Abolition classes. Throughout the course, I was a bit confused about how we could definitively call something racist or not. I think it's unfortunate that we don't go through the exercise of diagnosing something as racist until the last two weeks. Also, I think we could have spent more time talking about how to diagnose something as not racist and\/or talking about what things are definitively not racist.",
                "This course is made for white kids whose only experience with racism is in a classroom. The professors lectures are incredibly elementary (we once spent a whole day learning that Hollywood movies influence beauty standards and that politicians in DC influence laws) while the readings are, on the opposite end, incredibly dull and dense. One study took 50 pages to explain that white people associate Black people with monkeys. Any Black person who has lived in America for five minutes can tell you that.",
                "I loved the different points of view of the different disciplines of what racism is.",
                "Lectures and sections were really captivating. And I felt the workload was good although it was a lot of very difficult thinking.",
                "No weaknesses. The class is the epitome of what pedagogy should be. Dr Goff is brilliant and makes the class feel deeply personal. Its truly a learning journey",
                "Prof Goff was excellent and this felt like a very well informed and structured survey course",
                "The lectures were sometimes unfocused and I had a hard time understanding what the common thread between all of them were. I really really enjoyed the readings though and thought they were pretty interesting",
                "The course is well organized and well-designed.  I have no suggested improvements.",
                "Strengths: Essays and readings are challenging but make you think\r\nWeaknesses: Assignments on Canvas were a little disorganized, submission portal often not posted until near the deadline",
                "Strengths: Strong lectures from Dr. Goff! They were very funny and witty and I enjoyed them a lot. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course structure itself left a lot to be desired. We were asked to do discussion questions every week, which is perfectly normal. But in a lot of other classes, the discussion questions are sent in the day before section, not on Monday at the beginning of the week. So I would have to gloss over the readings just to get these questions in by Monday at 5 pm, even though my section was later in the week, and I didn't have time to fully engage with all the readings. Furthermore, the way that we engaged with the readings was very frustrating. Maybe I'm just too used to sections where we start off on a point, and then naturally flow from there until we either need to hit another point or we run out of things to say, but sections for this class were essentially another lecture, rather than a moment to actually discuss things. It felt much too academic, especially in a class where I expected things to be a little bit more personal.",
                "I really enjoyed the discussion sessions",
                "This class was strong because the lectures were very interesting and pretty engaging. Professor Goff is very funny, and he also allowed us to participate in class by asking us to raise our hands or share. One way this class could be improved was I really feel like we spent a lot of time diagnosing racism, which I liked, but I also would have liked to spend time talking about how to attack racism, or what we can do about itl.",
                "Some of the readings were a little bit hard to get through (like the kang reading) so much to the point where even in section we didnt get through it or decipher the point really. I thought Prof Goff was an incredibly engaging, funny, and wonderful lecturer.",
                "Unfortunately a great deal of the course felt like common sense and did not present much new information or unfamiliar concepts in the way that I had hoped it would after shopping it. Still, it's important material to know and Dr. Goff is a very engaging lecturer, so it may be worth taking the class just for that reason if you have the space in your schedule.",
                "A lot of the course lectures and the out-of-lecture coursework feel disjointed from one another",
                "This course was one of my favorites and I was content with the way the course occured.",
                "This course was very well organized for learning, each lecture had a clear topic and argument that we could follow throughout the class and readings were referenced in a way that made the lecture very engaging. I think that Professor Goff is a great lecturer and that this class was extremely well formatted for understanding the key ideas, one of which is that racism is ever changing in the way we define it and the way it manifests, so we need to have nuance in all of our discussions and consider as many scenarios as possible.",
                "The readings were engaging though sometimes unnecessarily long so that we couldn't fully discuss them in the 50 minute discussion sections. Sometimes the readings also felt disconnected from the lectures. I would have liked to see more cohesion. \r\nOther than feedback on the midterm and final papers, there was no other way to gauge my performance in the class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Goff is absolutely incredible. He is an amazing lecturer, mainly because of his humor and storytelling abilities. The TAs are also incredibly smart and dedicated. Furthermore, as someone who was sick often this semester and often had to miss sections\/assignments, Prof. Goff and my TA were extremely helpful and accommodating. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the only weakness I would say is the discussion questions. Because you have to do 2 for each reading with an average of 3 readings per week (6 Qs total), it's an assignment that often took me a ton of time given the depth of the readings and my urge to make the discussion questions thoughtful. However, I would've been more engaged with the assignment\/readings had the discussion questions not been due every Monday at 5pm. Because my section wasn't until later in the week and the readings were supposed to stretch across both classes, it felt counterintuitive to have the questions due all on Monday as opposed to before section. I am not sure what the best solution would be, as I understand this is a way to ensure all students read the material, but perhaps having only 1 question for each reading or even 2 things per reading where one can be a reflection\/interesting quote\/passage and the other can be a question.",
                "The topic is, of course, of the utmost relevance. It is, however, not particularly easy. The readings are also quite intense, but that is required to begin to grasp the subject. Nonetheless, the TFs and Prof. Goff did an incredible job in helping us along the way, with the lectures commenting on each week's readings. Both the TFs and Prof. Goff were also very responsive to questions by email and were truly willing to meet, which was extremely helpful.\r\nOne weakness is that the sections were very short, and we rarely had time enough to discuss all of the readings in much detail. Another small issue might be the slightly imprecise nature of the weekly \"critical reading question\" assignment: some general guidance around that would have been appreciated.",
                "The readings were well supplemented by the lecture content, but the reading content tended to be dense, making it harder to contribute accurately and effectively in section; however, it did make for a really engaging section environment as we were often faced with hard questions that forced us to really think.",
                "Pros: Section helped a lot with hammering out the ideas explained in lecture, prof. Goff is a beast who is entertaining and very informed making class very enjoyable and worthwhile. I really enjoyed engaging with other students because we really need to discuss these types of issues in order to really gain an understanding since we all struggle with the complexity. Emphasis on Goff being epic and keeping current events in the consciousness too. I liked the nature of the reading responses as critical questions.\r\n\r\nCons: Grading on the papers seems to be a toss-up due to the rigidity of the rubric (that the students do not get to reference). A good paper (if you got 4\/5 in every category of the rubric for the midterm you got a 80% which seemed quite steep). However I am very fine with how this class progressed and that would never make me regret the course",
                "Honestly, this class was amazing and it could be improved by having more support for the course.",
                "There were too many readings assigned that sometimes did not feel necessary--the lectures easily summarized them and much more clearly.",
                "Walking into class I knew the lecture would always be engaging. Discussion sections were also really useful to break down difficult readings.",
                "Strengths: Professor Goff was an excellent lecture, classes were super engaging (I always looked forward to going). The readings were difficult but worthwhile and interesting. My TF was great and was always willing to answer questions. Professor Goff was also excellent in office hours, he made time to meet with students and gave me super helpful and specific feedback when I went to meet with him.\r\nWeaknesses: First off, my section always let out at least 15 min late every single session. I would recommend that sections are an extra 20 or so minutes, so we could get through everything we wanted and still get let out on time.\r\nSecond, section wasn't super helpful. The readings were quite difficult and so sometimes I felt like I wasn't getting as much out of the readings as I could when we didn't talk about them in section. I personally think the one person presenting the readings at the beginning of each section was a waste of time. In my section we all just covered information that everyone had probably already gotten themselves. I would recommend more of a 3 key insights type of structure to keep it shorter to not waste so much time and also actually useful to the other students.",
                "Stengths:\r\n- environment to challenge your\/other's beliefs about race and racism\r\n- participation!!\r\n- Dr. Goff's superb lectures\r\n- some very interesting readings on the syllabus\r\n- sections were (mostly) awesome\r\n- making critical questions was super helpful for digesting the reading material\r\n- academic freedom with papers\r\n- recorded lectures\r\n- music at lecture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- in section, I experienced that non-POC students in the class were not as comfortable contributing (as well as some unwelcoming comments from other students in the class that would promote this)\r\n- would have found example papers from previous semesters to be helpful",
                "A weakness was that sometimes the lectures were just a recap and did not give much additional information to the readings which were extremely long. An amazing strength was the discussion sections in which I heard from my fellow peers. They were always insightful and brought tons is new knowledge and arguments to the table.",
                "The professor made the lecture very engaging and interesting. In my opinion, the course is very relevant and is a course that every student should take to gain insight on today's most pressing racial and ethical issues. Unlike other courses, however, this course is designed in a way that makes it hard to stay organized with the different topics; for example, a review of \"vocabulary\" would have been very helpful to ensure that all students have a similar understanding.",
                "I lvoed the structure of the class. I always knew what to expect when I went to both section and lecture. I thought that the syllabus was very easy to follow and I was truly set up for success.",
                "This class was incredibly well-organized and well-taught. Professor Goff's lectures were simply yet expertly crafted, and I greatly looked forward to coming to lecture and section each week. Professor Goff and the TFs took care to not only guide us through the readings and assignments, but also to emphasize their larger meaning within our development as writers, students, and thinkers. The TFs in particular went out of their way to help us succeed. The greatest strength of this course was that nothing in it was one-dimensional--every lecture, assignment, and reading had multifaceted implications which I now notice in every aspect of my life.",
                "The course was very engaging. The lectures were well presented. The material, while difficult, was made digestible. Lots of ground was covered - so much so that I sometimes with certain topics were paused at and observed more in-depth before continuing to the next one.",
                "The assignments for this class were terrible. They were to define racism for the midterm and \"diagnose something as racist\" in the final. They both gave the illusion of freedom to tackle the questions, but the long list of really specific questions in the midterm to answer in 5-7 pages made it difficult to complete the assignment and come up with a meaningful definition.\r\n\r\nThe final paper's wording of \"diagnosing\" something as racist speaks to broader problems with the class as well. Treating racism as something to diagnose implies that it is like an illness. That is, that it's a problem from individuals and not a structural problem. The approach of this class to try to quantify racism through psych studies seems to be more of an appeal to white academics who don't experience racism themselves than a constructive way to actually understand how racism functions.",
                "Strengths: The content was very interesting and relevant overall. \r\nWeaknesses: Dr. Goff goes really quickly during lectures and it's sometimes hard to follow the flow of what he's saying. The readings are also confusing a lot of the time and it would honestly be so helpful for Dr. Goff to go over them during lecture. There also isn't a lot of room to critique the studies and the content. The studies are Dr. Goff's own studies and since he doesn't have very many office hours availabilities, it's hard to talk to him about our questions."

                "Yes. This is a fantastic course. As an Asian-American, I feel like I learned a whole lot about racism, not only toward Asian-Americans, but also toward Black, Latinx, and Native people. This class has given me the historical and theoretical understanding and the vocabulary to diagnose racism in my own life. I'm really grateful to have this knowledge and to be able to apply it to my future work. \r\n\r\nI felt a little uncertain about taking this class at first -- this was my first class in the AFAM\/ER&M\/PSYC domain, but it was a great intro class tailored to anyone interested in the subject. I especially encourage other Asian-Americans to take this class -- there weren't too many other Asian-Americans enrolled in the class this semester, but it is so valuable to have been in this class to understand how racism operates intricately to affect life for Asian-Americans in this country.",
                "Absolutely. This is one of the best classes I've taken in my entire life. It's multidisciplinary, important, interesting, and structured in an excellent way. 10\/10",
                "YES YES YES! This was one of my favorite classes this semester. I especially liked the way Dr. Goff always related the course to its significance in the outside world. I was able to take my papers seriously as more than just grades. I'll also use the information and journals provided in the course in the future.",
                "Yes, strongly. This course was certainly my favorite class of my first semester at Yale and unfortunately may be the best class I take for a long time. With an engaging and entertaining lecturer, intellectually stimulating assignments, a manageable workload, fair grading, and an incredibly important topic, I honestly dont think theres a reason not to take it.",
                "This is a good intro course, but if youre an upperclassmen that has taken ER&M classes before, theres not much more said that hasnt been taught before",
                "Every student at Yale College should take this class regardless of their major.",
                "absolutely, i dont stop talking about it",
                "I believe this class should be a requirement to graduate. You will learn more from this class to help you navigate your way at Yale. There are just weekly readings that are discussed at section. And a midterm an Final paper. Each paper is personal to you. Thinking in this class is so odd but amazing. And Dr. Goff is someone who you will see and just admire.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I think everyone should take a class on racism",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to everyone! I think everyone should take this course or a course like this during their time at Yale. Professor Goff takes such care with the material and the way in which he structured the syllabus was so intentional; he took us through theories on racism and then into methods of diagnosing racism and then finally bringing it all together at the end by looking at two examples. This class definitely challenged my views on racism and our world. Please take this class if it's offered again.",
                "Not at all.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it condenses knowledge that I feel is very necessary to apply and understand in today's society, into a single semester. While the workload is intense, the yield of the class is rewarding and accessible, especially as someone who has had no prior in-depth exposure to these topics in past education.",
                "Yes! One of the best, if not the best, class I've taken at Yale. Professor Goff is the top of his field, and for good reason. He's absolutely outstanding.",
                "Please please please take this course, and I mean that with all of my being. It is incredibly insightful and there are LOTS of people at Yale that should take this class... Truly one of those classes that I think should be mandatory due it's relevance, usefulness, and excellence.",
                "Yes, by far the best course I have ever taken",
                "I think if you are never going to take a critical race theory class at Yale unless it is this one, then take this course. The lectures are entertaining and probably the most valuable part of the course, so go to them. However, I might not recommend this course to ER&M majors. I think I wanted more from this course, but I was a bit put off by the structure of the assignments and confused by the direction of the class (are we learning how to define racism or are we learning how to debate racists? etc)",
                "Yes, everyone should engage in the discussions pertinent to this class and engage with this material",
                "Yes, I think everyone should take this class before graduating. Maybe not as a first-year but definitely  at some point!",
                "Yes. I learned so much in this class  it focuses on the world outside of the classroom much more than most Yale classes.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student because I personally learned a lot about racism. This knowledge is applicable to several elements of my own life, particularly my interactions with other people. The workload in this course provoked me to challenge my implicit biases and provoked deep learning about what racism means to me.",
                "Absolutely, this should be a required course to graduate.",
                "yes! everyone should take this course",
                "YES. In a perfect world, AFAM 118 would be a graduation requirement. It is one of the single most important courses you can take at this point in time, in context of what is going on in the United States with regards to attacks on \"Critical Race Theory\" and education about racism in academia.",
                "Yes!!! Would definitely recommend to another student. It will make you think very deeply about racism and the scholarly research around it.",
                "Yes! It's definitely a great intro-level course. As a PSYC major, I wish there was more of a focus on research and research method but overall content was good.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students! Although it was challenging, what I learned from the class about racism and how it is shaped by our society is invaluable.",
                "This is a great class!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. the skills and knowledge learned in this class could be applicable to anyone no matter their ethnic or racial backfiring, and I truly think the content learned will help my future endeavors",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students because it was incredibly useful in understanding racism at different levels, especially in my own life.",
                "Yes! It's a great introductory course to really reveal the nuances and intricacies of racism.",
                "No, this class is clickbait. It is not nearly as interesting as the course title suggests, the weekly responses through critical questions become quite cumbersome, many people seemed to like the Professor but I feel like he was ironically putting on a performance of Blackness to get laughs out of the majority white student audience, the studies are all super flawed in how they generalize their conclusions, the assignments are incredibly vague and unhelpful, I could go on for hours",
                "Yes! The class pushed students to form their own ideas about racism and the effects of it. The class comes at an important time for students to be educated about the theory of what racism is.",
                "Yes definitely!! This course is awesome, lectures are really fascinating, and you learn a lot of really important stuff in this class.",
                "Absolutely. Do not graduate without taking it. This work stays with you forever.",
                "Yes definitely take it - it's a good fifth class that you can put a little less work into but still get a lot out of.",
                "Maybe. I enjoyed it at times but Im not sure it was super worth it",
                "Absolutely.  The subject material is critically important, and the course is incredibly well designed and taught.  This is one of my favorite courses I have taken in my life.",
                "Yes! I think this course is extremely important to take for *all* students, just for students to have a better understanding of how racism and other types of inequality function in society. The lectures in this course may also have been the best I've ever witnessed.",
                "No, unless you're auditing it. I think it's worthy material, but I think it's presented very, very, badly.",
                "Definitely",
                "I would recommend this class to everyone. Number one, everyone should take a class with Professor Goff. Number two, what I have learned in this class will stick with me for the rest of my life, and it always makes me stop and think in my actions and conversations with others.",
                "Definitely. I think this course should be required for every student. I have now applied some of the information and lessons from this course to all of my others. Highly recommend.",
                "Unfortunately a great deal of the course felt like common sense and did not present much new information or unfamiliar concepts in the way that I had hoped it would after shopping it. Still, it's important material to know and Dr. Goff is a very engaging lecturer, so it may be worth taking the class just for that reason if you have the space in your schedule.",
                "Only to those who are relatively unfamiliar with concepts of structural racism and race in America",
                "Every student at Yale should take this class.",
                "Yes! If not for the essay topics which I found to be very fun, the information taught was enlightning.",
                "Yes, it's a must take during your time at Yale!",
                "I would recommend this class to every student at Yale. I think that this should be something everyone is required to take in order to frame conversations regarding race and racism from an understanding of what the stakes are in those conversations. There are many ways in which race and racism impact our daily lives and understanding that dynamic is key to having productive and informative conversations about race in classes and between students outside of academia.",
                "Yes. Professor Goff made the lectures engaging enough and the material was relevant to current events. The interesting conversations took place outside of lecture and in discussion section (but that also depended on the people in the DS and the TF). The midterm and final paper were both papers that I had never thought to write before and for me, it was intellectually stimulating and fun.",
                "Absolutely, 100%. I would recommend any course taught by Prof. Goff, to be completely honest. However, I think this is an incredibly important class for every student to take at some point in their Yale career. You are taught about racism, how to define it, what the stakes are, and more in an incredibly digestible, practical way. The amount of subconscious and conscious learning that happened was astounding. You are truly made to feel as though you can explore racism, ask questions, and have different opinions, which was incredibly refreshing. You also learn about racism in different sectors\/areas of (specifically) American society, which makes you realize the importance of defining racism as it pertains to the real-life stakes\/consequences.",
                "I most definitely would! The lectures are very engaging, the material is challenging and the workload isn't disastrous (that isn't to say that this is an easy class). The class is very American-centric, which is perfectly fine (Prof. Goff is clear about this): more coverage would be way too much for a single semester.",
                "Yes, I think it should be a foundational course for all students; the coursework is more than necessary for all students to develop a critical understanding of racism, empathy, and innumerable more human ideals they need to succeed beyond Yale.",
                "Yes, prof. Goff is a beast. Section is especially essential for debate and gaining understanding. My TA did a great job facilitating that. You will be able to actually engage with racial issues on a deeper level which all should seek in today's day and age.",
                "Yes, I have recommended this course to another student. I encourage other students who want to embark on a journey to become a scholar to take this class. It was very insightful and it impacted my learning in a positive way.",
                "Yes, but only if you yourself have a genuine interest in the topic. Or else it may seem too general...",
                "Yes. I feel like its an integral course in becoming more aware of racial biases and arguments in the world. Also helps a lot in starting to think of solutions to racial issues",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! The stuff you learn in this class is applicable outside of the classroom too. While this class is very theoretical at the beginning, by the end it becomes much more practical. Especially if you have not had a lot of prior experience with the material, I would recommend it. The assignments are challenging, but very fair and useful. Goff is an excellent lecturer, this was my favorite class to attend. The lectures alone are enough reason to take this class.",
                "absolutely; there is something in this course that would help anybody be a better ally\/activist (including an emphasis on learning from groups of people experiencing racism, wise approaches to ideas like abolition, and mental training for critical thinking that allows people to actually find solutions to problems)",
                "Yes! It is really interesting and a basic how to class :)",
                "I 100% would recommend this course to students who care about racial and ethical issues. What you learn in the course (how to define racism and how to apply the definition) is extremely relevant to everyday experiences. I am more knowledgeable and confident in identifying something as racist and explaining why it is racist.",
                "I would recommend this course to students from any major. I think the topic itself is super important and engaging with this information is crucial.",
                "I could not recommend this course to another student enough. In addition to its essential subject matter, the critical skills this course imparts make its lessons all the more valuable for the way they fundamentally shape you as a student, critical thinker, and citizen. I looked forward to lectures with Professor Goff and discussion sections with Da'Von each week. This course taught me the most of any class I have taken at Yale in terms of both subject matter and how to engage with and question the domains of our world. You have to take this class before you graduate.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course as many of the lessons taught are extremely important in the world.",
                "There are so many weaknesses to this course because the way it approached defining racism was done so badly. You would think for a survey course about racism that we would at least read about the history of racism so that it becomes abundantly clear that race and racism are social constructs and are not innate or quantifiable to people. Instead, we spent much of the course reading psych studies of white academics trying to make \"formulas for racism\" than talking about how racism is created and constantly changing to systemically oppress and exploit people of color. Meanwhile the studies that we read for this class that are \"more credible\" in generalizing how racism works than a person's first-hand experience have less participants in them than the half empty lecture room each class session. We spent three weeks on understanding methodology in an intro level survey class about racism while we barely even spent 10 minutes on topics like anti-Black racism from nonwhite people, colorism, defining race as a social construct, or engaging with any history. \r\n\r\nWe spent more time sympathizing with the mental health of racists in this course than we do with talking about how the mental health of people of color is impacted by racism. We had a whole unit on \"White Injury\" where we read a couple of psych studies telling us how racists actually experience negative effects from being racist while we completely ignored the wellbeing of people of color actually experiencing racism.\r\n\r\nWhat is also frustrating about this course is how we addressed topics like intersectionality, but we didn't read a SINGLE WORD from Kimberl Crenshaw herself. Same thing goes for DuBois who we also read about but not from. The short piece we read by Stuart Hall was about the only piece that wasn't a psych study that was by a Black author. The readings in general were uninteresting because they were either psych studies with bad methodologies or some random person summarizing scholarship from other academics. I would have maybe been more invested if we actually read more scholarship from Black academics themselves and not some random person telling us about them. \r\n\r\nOverall, this class is the definition of clickbait. If you want to actually learn what racism is and how to tell if something is racist, take literally ANY good AFAM or ER&M class instead.",
