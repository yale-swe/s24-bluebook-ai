                "I learned how to read and analyze theory, and more importantly how to be critical of the world around me and speak truth to power.",
                "I learned a lot of new vocabulary and became better at reading hard texts. I also just learned a lot abt theory and news ways of thinking about capitalism and imperialism",
                "I learned so much. From Bandung to world-systems to queer of color critique, I engaged critically with topics of liberation, colonialism, imperialism, power, and social formation. This course pushed me to question, quite literally, everything.",
                "We learned so much! This class is incredible - please take it if you'd like to be exposed to liberatory theory around anti-colonialism, (neo)colonialism, imperialism, education & the state, migrant labor, racial & social formation, gender & queerness, and beyond. In lecture, we get to hear from Gary Okihiro himself, leading scholar of Third World studies and founder of social formation theory. In discussion sections, we get to analyze and critique the readings, and we get a skill which is often-undervalued at an institution like Yale: learning collectively, and learning from our peers as much as our professors.",
                "I learned how to locate my subject position in the social formation in which i live.",
                "I learned a number of foundational concepts from social formation theory to capitalism in addition to important and foundation histories.",
                "Read and learned about a lot of important theory that I've been able to apply to other history and ER&M coursework (particularly relating to colonialism, imperialism, world systems, social formation, intersectionality, etc.)",
                "I feel like I really got a better understanding of lots of leftist and post-modern philosophy during this course and I think I got a lot better at self-evaluation and critical analysis.",
                "Language and theoretical framework for understanding the historical and social formation of society and understandings of the self in relation to society",
                "I learned how all texts communicate with each other.",
                "This is the best class I have taken at Yale I learned SO much about third world studies, from critical race theory to subjectivity to feminist genealogy. I cant even describe how much I learned.",
                "I developed my reading and critical thinking skills greatly in this course. We were provided with so much interesting material each week and each week we had the task of putting what we learned together and finding the connections between them. Also in discussion section we were encouraged to participate by sharing our thoughts and analysis of the readings which improved my speaking and on-the-spot articulation skills.",
                "Third World Studies makes you develop a much broader sense of the world and a critical eye for the way we accept things in society. The class makes you analyze multiple authors throughout the semester and you gain knowledge on new terms that describe society at large.",
                "Great introduction to theory",
                "Critical thinking, discussion, writing, connecting larger social structures together",
                "critical analysis of third world studies, positionality, and generally both history and theory as directly related to ethnic studies, I grew a lot as a thinker a learner, an analyst and as someone who is able to draw connections and synthesize information",
                "A broad introduction to third world studies as a field, which looks at different forms of power and resistance globally throughout history. First part of the course focuses a lot on theories of colonialism and imperialism, second part is about subjectivity and social categorizations/formations ie race, gender, sexuality and intersectionalities.",
                "I learned a lot about anti-colonial theory and how to analyze more theoretical works. It also shifted my perspective about the world a lot.",
                "I learned about critical theory, the history of the third world, and the history of third world studies. This course also focused a lot on power, its position, and the way it is exerted. It also created the space for me to engage with relatively dense and complicated topics by way of analyzing the readings and working through the vocabulary in lecture and in section.",
                "Third World Studies is a profoundly transformative class. I now have a more thorough understanding of the naure of imperialism, colonialism, and capitalism as well as poststructuralism, anti-positivism and other related philosophical and social science theory.  The skills I have refined in this class are learning how to be a better reader, writer, and listener during lectures. I leave this course knowing how profoundly liberatory education can be and with a greater desire to deepen my knowledge in ethnic studies and all other social sciences, always conscious of ways we must remain critical of institutional educational systems.",
                "This class is a really thorough foundation in understanding what the Third World movement is. I gained both a foundation in understanding colonialism, imperialism, and capitalism, and how they have formed the modern world. It also gave us many theoretical frameworks and examples of what de colonial and liberators struggle looks like.",
                "I'm glad I got to engage with (often very dense) theory on anti-capitalism and anti-imperialism. This course was almost like a crash course in reading theory how to make sense of jargon, what the overall ideas are, etc.",
                "Understanding of third world studies and lots of foundational texts in ethnic studies",
                "The course exposes you to a lot of really foundational texts in the field of ethnic studies, decolonization, critical race theory.  I found it really helpful to have a chance to read and engage with the material",
                "I learned how to locate my subject position in the subject formation",
                "Extensive knowledge about the third world and about myself and my culture.",
                "This course helped me be able to critically examine my position in society and the institutions and social categories I belong to. This course also gave a great introduction into fields of study central to Third World Studies.",
                "Learned about what collective liberation could actually look like and theories like queer of color theory, and was able to apply it to my own life and subject position. Analyzed intersections of the subjectivities and social constructs of race, gender, class, disability, etc. within systems that can be used to oppress (ie. education)",
                "Whole new perspectives about the world, its systems, its institutions, and its history. New ways of thinking about oppressive systems and marginalized people. You will feel empowered after taking this class. It's absolutely wonderful."

            "comments": [
                "strengths- having discussion section, not a lot of course assignments (weekly disc posts + midterm + final paper)\r\nweaknesses- this class is super theory heavy and confusing. i also had a lot of trouble getting and ultimately was denied accommodations, so don't expect much if you need them. also, i feel like all the work is really done by the TFs and the professor doesnt even read our work",
                "All strengths!!! Prof Okihiro is an incredible prof, the TAs are wonderful, the readings are all so, so important (actually do them, you will learn so much!) and the assignments are not at all overwhelming. Lecture is interesting and it is such a privilege to learn from someone like Prof Okihiro.",
                "I felt that the lectures were not particularly well organized. They often felt sporadic and I wished we had spent more time grappling with the actual concepts rather than focusing on an overview of the thinkers and the history of the development of anti-colonial, decolonial, and postcolonial scholarship. The readings were often presented without significant connection to the topics covered in class; we did not go into detail about the validity of the arguments of the readings, and it was unclear what we were supposed to take from certain parts of the readings. I felt that there were certain questions raised by the material covered both in readings and in lecture that was not adequately grappled with during class, which was disappointing considering I feel that Professor Okihiro has a lot of knowledge on this subject and seemed to be willing to go more in-depth during his office hours. The lectures did not have any supplemental material, i.e. PowerPoint slides or printed handouts, which would have been helpful to keep the lectures on-topic and engaging.",
                "strength was definitely the TAs and sections bc some of the lectures and readings had me a bit overwhelmed and confused. Also loved the midterm and final because they were actually interesting prompts",
                "Strengths: Professor Okihiro's brilliance, classroom environment where all students wanted to learn and be in class, the class' dedication to questioning and praxis; Weaknesses: Professor Okihiro's assumption that we already knew of some of the content he was discussing, hard to follow lectures sometimes, intense and hard-to-comprehend readings",
                "So many strengths!!! Prof. Okihiro is an incredible lecturer; he expressed to us a commitment to non-linearity and anti-positivism in his pedagogy. What he says is not to be taken as absolute truth, and he jumps from one concept/person/event to the next in a way that may seem chaotic at first, but gradually comes together over the course of a lecture. He is inspired by Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed and always strives to respond to and learn from the student; he also encourages people to come to his office hours, even though it is a large class. The TAs were spectacular - Josh, Katy, and Aron - and I imagine that, from year to year, this course tends to attract TAs who are thoughtful, radical, and supportive of the students. The assignments consist of weekly discussion posts, an in-class midterm exam (which the TAs are very helpful in preparing for), and a final reflective paper that consists of locating yourself within the social formation. A lot of community was cultivated through this class, and I've met so many people who I love and learn from. It's hard for me to think of weaknesses, but if you are someone who prefers highly structured/chronological lectures, this may be an adjustment - it's still totally worth it though! The final paper also asks a lot from you (8-10 pages to locate yourself within the social formation), but if you are interested in this class, these are probably questions you have already been considering. You can only grow from this class!",
                "Strengths: the professor and teaching fellows are amazing. They are engaging and passionate about the topics they teach. \r\nWeakness: the readings are sometimes too long and specific and not covered in class.",
                "The course was great! Strengths were the range or readings and authors. I would say sometimes the readings were overwhelming but they were all really valuable. I",
                "Strengths: great syllabus, interesting professor, strong TAs\r\nWeaknesses: lecture could be rather unstructured and difficult to follow at times; lots of reading (more than usually assigned for a lecture course)",
                "More organized lecturesmaybe just having an outline available.",
                "I think it was strong in that it was pretty accessible if you had a basic level of understanding. It made a lot of really complicated theory more accessible to me which I thought was really cool. I didnt really have any issues with it in terms of weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material and engaging lecturer.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Big differences between sections in how the material is taught.",
                "This course had to many strengths. The style of the class where we moved through the semester by touching on the overall themes then narrowed it down to the individual was very interesting and unique. I really appreciated how the content was introduced thematically and not chronologically like it usually is in historical based classes.",
                "Strengths: Professor Okihiro is an amazing lecturer and is able to explain every concept and topic with great detail. The TFs for the class were also amazing and truly cared for our understanding of the class. Aside from that, the content of the course and structure of it makes it such an amazing class to take.\r\nWeaknesses: The only weakness I can say for the class is that I wish there were recordings or PowerPoints. Its sometimes difficult to write down notes about whats being lectured on and actively listening at the same time.",
                "I don't really see this class as having any real weaknesses, it was really really good. I was thankful for the space",
                "Strengths: I think there was a lot of value in that the structure of the course and way of thinking it demands is likely very different from any class you've ever taken. \r\nWeaknesses: I often felt that the readings were never really further discussed or clarified through lecture. I thought with a lot of the readings, there was much to discuss, but I would say a majority of them were never addressed beyond being assigned. I would have liked the lectures to acknowledge and involve the readings a bit more, even if not necessarily centered around them.",
                "I liked that the course forced us to examine ourselves and apply what we learned to the world we are actively living in. The lectures were very well done and discussion sections helped make sense of the readings. Sometimes the lectures could have connected more directly to the readings.",
                "The readings and topics were really dense and took quite a bit of time to work through. The lectures could get very complicated and Professor Okihiro threw a lot of names and vocabulary at us. I did learn A LOT over the course of the year and really enjoyed the way Professor Okihiro weaved more academic aspects with his personal experiences (though I know this may not be something enjoyed by everyone).",
                "The strenghts of this course are the depth and breadth of reading material, the masterful lecturing style of Professor Okihiro, the very helpful discussion section meetings, and the presentation and overall progression of the class. The only small weakness of the course was that, at times, the assigned readings felt like a bit too much from one class to another. Overall, I believe this was an excellent class that suffered from no real weakness.",
                "This class is incredibly empowering us and challenges students to think beyond hegemonic and imperial structures. The syllabus is really thorough and well thought-out to help students gain an understanding of existing structures but also resistance.",
                "Strengths: Professor Okihiro is clearly very passionate about Third World Studies (it's his intellectual baby!) and his enthusiasm and dedication to his students was one of the highlights of this class for me. We also had a great group of TAs. Weaknesses: The course felt a bit disorganized at times. I also felt that there were too many readings per week; perhaps in the future focusing on fewer readings that are actually addressed in class could be beneficial.",
                "One weakness of this course was the material for readings did not seem inline with class discussion",
                "Reaching students with backgrounds in the third world.",
                "I loved the materials and discussions prompted by this class. I feel so lucky that I was able to take a class with Professor Okihiro and learn from him. His care for his students and their learning is truly incredible. At times, the lecture was difficult to follow and the amount of readings assigned each week was very difficult to keep up with.",
                "Strengths: the TFs are amazing, the readings are very informative Weaknesses: sometimes the lectures were not organized well to address concepts from the readings",
                "Professor Okihiro was always very eager for us to get involved in his lectures and add in our own experiences and theories, and I appreciated the energy and warmth he brought to the classroom. He definitely created a very welcoming and respectful environment.",
                "Strengths: A wide breadth of readings, content, and perspectives about our world. Professor Okihiro is a wonderful lecturer and also offers guiding questions to help us with the readings\r\nWeaknesses: None"

                "no; there's a lot of hype built up around it but really its just more leftist academic shit that stays siloed within academia and has no actual praxis. ur better off taking literally any other er&m course unless ur a theoryhead and really like reading and learning about theory for some reason or if u want a gut",
                "YES!!!!! 100 times yes. This course should be required. I've already told all my friends to take it; if you're reading this, PLEASE take this course!!! It will totally change the way you view the world / will totally challenge every notion about what you thought could be taught at an institution like Yale.",
                "Not necessarily. For those with a background in the subject material, the course would be too basic and does not go into enough depth. For those without any background, the jargony, academic terms used without clear definitions and the listing out of philosophers who students may not be familiar with might make the course material confusing. The class ends up falling in-between, so it is both too difficult for beginners but too basic otherwise.",
                "yes",
                "Absolutely. It will make for a lovingly critical community of other students at Yale with whom you can question and organize together.",
                "Yes yes yes! Cannot recommend this class enough - the theory is life-changing, and since the content is so broad there will definitely be something you haven't encountered before, the discussions are collaborative and exciting, and the people & community are wonderful. The Third World is a project, not a place, and for a moment (and maybe for the rest of your life), you will get to be a part of that project.",
                "Yes. It allows one to question the structures of power that oppress certain groups of people and look for alternatives to liberate oneself.",
                "Yes yes yes! Professor Okihiro and the TFS really made me rethink various aspects of my everyday life",
                "Yes. I definitely would. Professor Okihiro is a great lecturer and the content is so important especially if you are a humanities major.",
                "I would recommend it depending on their learning style (if they really need structure then maybe not). It's a great theoretical course, though, which I wish I'd taken earlier during my time at Yale (it really introduces you to important and useful frameworks, which I've since applied to other classes).",
                "i would recommend this class if someone wanted to take a course on philosophy that focused on real world experiences with social relations like race, sexuality, gender, and class. I thought it was super engaging and I enjoyed it a lot and enjoyed how it focused on experiences that I could relate to but also was super complex and interesting.",
                "Yes. It's the only course that offers content of this nature.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students because you get to dive into a subject matter that is not taught elsewhere at Yale, and you get to learn it from interesting people.",
                "I would 100% take this class. Its amazing, and Prof Okihiro and the TFs are absolutely wonderful.",
                "Yes I would most definitely recommend this course to other students! I learned so much about theories, history, and myself! It was really great encapsulating class that was perfect for introducing me to the rigor and intellectual standard at Yale as a first year student.",
                "YES! I think that this is a course that everyone should take as it truly makes you rethink the way we have come to accept society and the concept of the third world. This is by far my favorite class at Yale.",
                "Yes!!! I feel like everyone should take this class",
                "I would definitely recommend, this course was amazing.",
                "100%. It should almost be required in my opinion.",
                "Maybe, it really depends on your interests. I found it valuable to get an in-depth look into an intellectual genealogy that would be considered by the mainstream as quite \"radical,\" even if I didn't quite have the same stance or buy into all the ideas, in my opinion it is worthwhile opening your mind to them. Things could get a little abstract and confusing, but overall it ended up not being extremely challenging.",
                "Yes I would highly recommend. It is the type of course that I think any student at Yale should take as it provides an opportunity to examine the world and can shape how you will approach yourself and your future. It also highlights perspectives that every student should see.",
                "Yes. It was such an incredible course and challenged my thinking in many ways. Its focus on understanding our personal subject-position was really helpful in terms of understanding how power works and the origins of capitalism, imperialism, and colonialism, as well as delving into the more nuanced aspects of these terms. It was a really good survey course that introduces students to ethnic studies, Marxist theory, queer theory, etc. and uses texts that will be read again and further analyzed in more focused seminars.",
                "I would completely recommend this coruse to anothet student. The actual material of the course was profoundly enlightening and eye-opening and the way the course was taught by Professor Okihiro made every class seem like a story was being woven together.",
                "Absolutely, for ER&M majors and non-ER&M majors alike. It is a very heavy course but also one of the most empowering courses Ive experienced in the department. It truly feels like we are getting tools for theorizing liberation.",
                "Yes! Professor Okihiro is a treasure. I'd recommend this to anyone who is slightly interested in engaging in anti-imperialist/racist/capitalist discourse. And the thinkers/theories you'll encounter in this course will stay with you for a long time.",
                "Yes. Professor Gary is one of the best professors Ive ever had",
                "Yes it helped me find out about myself and my culture and why the world is so messed up.",
                "Yes, absolutely! This course helped me critically examine the other classes I was taking at the same time and has changed the way I think about society.",
                "Absolutely! I think that people should take this course and learn about what liberation looks like and how it can happen starting in the classroom.",
                "Theory is hard to follow and break down sometimes, but Prof Okihiro was very helpful in applying it to the real world and our TA broke down the complicated language. There is much to be said about learning about collective liberation and the oppressive academic institution while sitting in a classroom at Yale, and I think it's a conversation that needs to be had",
                "YES 100% TAKE THIS CLASS. I think everyone should take it because it challenges you to think about the world in new ways and understand the power that each and every one of us has to make the world a better place. I think especially everyone in the ER&M major should take this class because the readings are so foundational to a lot of other classes and a lot of ideas and concepts in general. It is empowering."
