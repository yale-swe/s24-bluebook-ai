    "I feel like L1 & L2 do a great job introducing you to grammatical structures and to vocabulary, but you don't really begin to speak until L3. After this class, I actually feel like I have an ability to go out into the world and speak Spanish.",
    "I developed a more complex understanding of basic Spanish grammatical structures and vocabulary. I am better able to understand and analyze Spanish stories and narratives. I also advanced my oral and auditory skills tremendously and have become a more confident Spanish speaker and listener. I am better able to follow along and engage with Spanish videos and movies.",
    "The course did a good job of slowly introducing more difficult readings and film material.",
    "You develop your reading, writing, and speaking skills in Spanish very well. There is a lot of practice in all 3 through classwork, movies, and short stories. You will have your Spanish whipped into shape!",
    "expanded my spanish vocab and reviewed material from L2 spanish with more practice",
    "I developed my Spanish speaking skills and I was able to learn more about Spanish grammar.",
    "Better understanding of grammar, vocabulary & fluidity of speech",
    "Throughout the course we have greatly developed our writing skills by writing more complex compositions and having more practice. Additionally, there was a great emphasis on the usage of grammar and more detailed exploration of past tenses.",
    "L3 Spanish is a perfect follow up to the first two classes, as it perfectly solidifies all the grammar and vocab of the previous classes with a greater emphasis on synthesizing them into speech.",
    "I learned how more grammar topics to increase my ability to speak Spanish.",
    "I got a more advanced understanding of Spanish. My knowledge was expanded and skills sharpened in regard to Spanish grammar, speaking, writing, and listening.",
    "I gained knowledge on new vocabulary (e.g. personal relations, entertainment, daily life, health, and travel) and new grammatical structures (e.g. preterite vs. imperfect, commands, subjunctive, prepositions, and future tense). My Spanish speaking, writing, and listening skills significantly improved after conducting mini interviews, reading literature, and watching foreign language films within this course."

   "comments": [
    "The class is solid the whole way through. The semester is paced well and you feel like you really know the topics introduced. However, and this is a commentary on the Spanish program as a whole, percentages for exams must be changed. Fluency is not built in a day, and the idea that high stakes testing is necessary to learning a language is just wrong. It adds unnecessary stress and isn't truly a signifier of a student's ability. Most other language departments, like Hebrew and French, rather have small tests spaced out throughout the semester. This would be much better Spanish's current program.",
    "The strengths of this course was definitely the professors and the overall structure of class periods. The material was organized and presented in a manner that was interesting, easy to follow, and conducive to analysis. Further, we were allowed ample collaboration time during class to engage with our peers and to develop conversation skills. The weaknesses of this course was that there wasn't too much of a lecture component so most of the class was just spent in discussion, which was much more enjoyable and still productive, but there were certain topics that I wish would've been explained a little more comprehensively. This could be improved by making sure there is a set lecture time for each topic during the beginning of class complete with Powerpoints.",
    "Strengths: structure of class time was beneficial (when new material was introduced, it was fully explained and reviewed but with assumption that you had seen it before; therefore the grammar lessons balanced review and practice well), the conversational partner activities were the most engaging part of the class, the zoom session had a good mix of low intensity and high intensity engagement activities (for example: group discussion about a film versus doing quick grammar activities from the book) which made maintaining a focus and interest much easier throughout the two hours, the google docs were efficient in communicating the lesson plan and consolidating all resources\r\nWeaknesses: could have benefited from more discussion based partner activities; these were the most engaging parts of the class--on days when we did not do something resembling a speaking\/debate\/discussion (like something from the A section of the textbook) for some part of the class I was less engaged, the breakout room\/main session schedule change implemented by Dario in the latter half of the course improved the breakout room experience (good: changing partners often, returning to the main session to correct between activities, constant check-ins)\r\nImprovements: do more speaking activities during class time, continue to incorporate more cultural mini-lessons (song of the day, the significance of last names in Spanish, the norms of writing an email)",
    "strengths: was at a fast enough pace to keep me engaged when reviewing L2 material \r\nWeakness: not enough speaking in spanish due to Zoom format so speaking skills are weak",
    "Great professors",
    "Needs: more breakout rooms and problem solving\r\nStrength: Professors are extremely helpful",
    "The main strength is constant practice of writing skills. Additionally, extensive usage of new vocabulary and grammar in different types of exercises. The flaws are mostly associated with the way of the course was taught (through ZOOM), so sometimes it was really hard to engage in conversations and work more.",
    "The primary strength of this class was the absolutely phenomenal teachers, Daro and Terry were both wonderful, kind, engaging, helpful, and joys to work with. They were also different enough that it was a great balance between the two. The continual practice and daily class time is also a necessity of this class in my opinion.",
    "The class offers lots of practice writing, but it could be improved by giving more opportunities to speak in smaller groups.",
    "Two strengths of this course were (1) the inclusion of brief peer discussions, such as through breakout rooms, and (2) the inclusion of mini interviews with special guests. The peer discussions helped students stay engaged throughout what was, by nature, a long class session, and they additionally helped create a sense of community among the class. This community was especially appreciated given the isolation of remote learning. Moreover, the interviews with special guests introduced students to new aspects of Latin American culture and challenged the students to actively listen and communicate. \r\n\r\nHowever, weaknesses of this course included rapid pacing and a lack of in-class feedback. Given the accelerated nature of summer courses, the rapid pacing is not necessarily something that can be fixed, but it nevertheless caused me to rely on short-term memory rather than truly understanding the material. I recommend that more external listening activities (such as the mini interviews), become incorporated into the curriculum, as these activities challenge students to use their knowledge of material on the spot. I also believe that students grow accustomed to the way in which their professors speak over time, so being introduced to other voices, accents, and paces of speaking again challenges the students to rely on more than short-term memory. Furthermore, I wish I would have gotten more feedback in order to improve my learning. Though I received excellent feedback on my written assignments, I received much less feedback on my communication skills during class, and this class time is pertinent to the goodor badspeaking habits that I develop."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, although I would make sure they understand how intense the workload is.",
    "Yes. Despite the online format, this was unquestionably one of the best organized and best taught language classes I've ever taken. I initially was wary of the once a day for two hours five times a week schedule, but the time truly does not drag on and every second is utilized. During L1 and L2, I always felt like class was rushed and never left feeling like I got much out of being there. However, over the past five weeks, I have left nearly every class period feeling like I gained a deeper understanding of grammatical concepts and developed my conversation skills. The homework was never tedious and was designed in a manner that truly promoted learning. In addition to the standard Supersite homework, we read 5 short stories during the course that were both enjoyable and allowed deeper analysis of written Spanish. Overall, the structure of this class is amazing and I truly feel that I have learned a lot.",
    "For an online Spanish class with 2 hours of zoom five days a week, an excellent experience. I'm hesitant to say that the online was better than my L1 and L2 in-person experiences but the structure of the class was more engaging online--the professors did a mix of cold-calling to maintain engagement while also allowing for opportunities to choose to speak and elaborate, the professors were extremely well prepared for each day of class and the ease of the progression through a day's material demonstrated this",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student!",
    "yes, take this to hone in your spanish skills because the pace of L2 spanish is not enough to adequately learn the material",
    "Yes - for a mandatory language it was really good,  but my classmates were dope too so that helps",
    "Yes, if you have time to dedicate to this class. It requires a lot of work but it is very enjoyable.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course! It is mostly revising all the previous grammar and vocabulary topics but in more complex ways, definitely challenging writing tasks, but overall a great finisher for the previous two Spanish classes.",
    "Absolutely. It's a very fun class where you get to engage meaningfully with the teachers and fellow classmates to learn this incredibly important language. It is a time commitment that is very much worth it in my opinion.",
    "Yes, if they need to take it for a language requirement.",
    "Yes! If you want to get nearer to proficiency in Spanish, this course is a great help! It was however very rigorous, fast-paced, and work heavy so that is important to keep in mind.",
    "Yes! I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Though SPAN S130 was fast-paced, I believe that the professors did an excellent job at creating a sense of community among the students. This sense of community made the challenge of rapidly learning the material something that I looked forward to, rather than something that overwhelmed me."
