                "strenths: The daily homework assignments are really helpful for learning and they all seem to have an intended purpose which is nice; the way classes are structured with lots of talking is super helpful; all students are encouraged to participate; class was always super fun and our larger assignments were creative (like the cooking video, ebook, etc)\r\n\r\nweaknesses: I don't personally like the asynchronous days because I feel like I would learn more if we had a normal class. Also, the preparation for asynchronous work often takes much longer than a normal class would, so it makes the workload a bit harder; also the pacing of homework would sometime make it so that one week was super busy and then the next week was really light, so I think it might help if that was evened out a little bit; also the textbook has become a little bit old fashioned I think, my TF would always tell me that phrases I learned weren't actually used today in China",
                "The course is very well organized, more so I think than any other course I have taken here yet. The daily quizzes and workload are very helpful elements also and the course is designed so that students practice Chinese constantly. Its main strength I think is that because of these factors and the small class size every student's engagement with the course is very high, it is impossible to be otherwise. It also builds confidence in the language ability which is nice. I can think of no real ways in which it could be improved.",
                "Strengths: The vocabulary we learned from our textbook is very useful. The teachers and tutorials were very helpful in answering questions. \r\nWeaknesses: Super fast paced--I would barely start to get a grasp on one lesson before we were already moving on to another",
                "Chinese is a very well organized course, with lots of assignments. This can be a drawback if you're looking for a lighter workload, but is a huge plus in terms of forcing you to practice.",
                "lots of homework",
                "High workload but understandable because otherwise learning a language well is hard."

I had Liang Laoshi this semester and she made class periods go by so fast, we would basically just chat and joke for the entire time and then at the end of the semester I realized that it had helped my learning so much.",

                "Yes, the Chinese department at Yale is the best language department. Can learn Chinese really well, if willing to put effort and time into it."
