I also learned more about the different levels of formality used when speaking Korean. Additionally, we further explored Korean culture.",

                "Strengths: very welcoming, comfortable, and fun environment that is very conducive to learning. Great professor who is incredibly caring and good at guiding your learning.\r\nWeaknesses: this class has less structure, so if you do not keep up with reviewing class material on your own, you will be cramming for tests",
                "More speaking help would be nice",
                "The course is thought very well",
                "Could be improved by more TA sessions.",
                "strengths:\r\nHigh level of class engagement\/participation makes the learning process easier: theres less pressure if you happen to mess up, because everyone else is making mistakes too.\r\nAlso, the class is geared towards learning practical conversational skills which makes barrier to entry lower, and you can more readily use what youve learned \r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\nKorean is a hard language and though it is no fault of the professor\/textbook, it would be much more manageable if taught at a slightly slower pace.",
                "I think the kind nature of the Korean department is what encourages so many students to pursue their interests in Korean language studies. I think in language learning, encouragement is so vital, and L3 was an appropriately more difficult course but this was a smooth transition with the resources and openness of the department. I would say the vocabulary is a bit much, and the review sessions only happened one day before the testI think in the future, it would be best to space the vocabulary out in brief quizzes, and to have the opportunity to review for exams\/receive the exam material at least 3-4 days before the test.",
                "View grammar rules that I still get switched up every once and a while. However, became much better at speaking conversationally",
                "STRENGTHS: Professor Lim is such a great professor! He is very knowledgeable and motivates language learning by keeping class fun and interesting, giving fair assignments and tests, and being very approachable. He keeps students engaged during class and is very responsive to questions and emails. The class itself moves at a good pace and is very interesting. My Korean improved a lot by taking this course and continues to inspire my interest in the language and Korean culture! WEAKNESSES: None!",
                "Strengths: The class dynamic really makes or breaks the course. All of my fellow students were wonderful and being able to closely interact with my peers made practicing every day much more enjoyable. Also, there is a lot of individual attention and practice with each new concept once we learn it \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There isnt much effort made to reinforce past concepts in class, and is instead expected to be done solely outside of class. Some sort of incorporation of past lessons or daily small quizzes would help solidify things more",
                "The course atmosphere is very mellow and positive. I think this makes the course very engaging to students, but the overall level of difficulty is pretty low. That's not a bad thing, but I definitely feel like a more intense curriculum could cover a lot more ground."

The workload is not high yet this class is very conducive to learning. Additionally, Professor Lim is amazing! Definitely one of my favorite professors and classes at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. Taking Korean at Yale was one of the best decisions Ive made here. The department and professors truly care for each and every student and take the time and effort to help each of them succeed. I actually already do recommend Korean to my friends looking for a language",
                "Yes! It's a lot of fun, it builds well upon previous korean courses, and it expands a student's grammar and the spectrum of phrases they can use."
