Between learning about the feminist side of the witch movement, studying protest art, and diving into indigenous cultures, this course enabled me to both immerse myself in the Spanish language while gaining insight into so many cultural components I otherwise would not have known.",

However, I wish we talked more to get conversation flowing just about simple things, so conversation becomes more second hand.",
                "Giseli did an excellent job facilitating the conversation and giving us assignments to prepare us for the discussions in class. I also found the asynchronous days helpful for developing my writing skills.",
                "I thought that this course was super strong regarding its focus on class discussions in Spanish and in-depth writing assignments. I loved having the opportunity to also engage with Spanish media (movies, podcasts, and short films) which propelled my understanding of the language. In terms of weaknesses, there are none that stand out!",
                "I love learning about indigenous women but didnt love really only working with jamboards the whole time.",
                "Strengths were that it was a fun class to be in and the content was fairly different throughout the semester. Weaknesses were that many of our readings still seemed at a higher level than Spanish 140, if we could have gone through the readings again in class, that would have been helpful.",
                "Sometimes there was a lot of busy work where we would be doing work when we probably did not have to, but these cases were always engaging our writing skills and other Spanish skills.",
                "The biggest strength of this class is the small class size.",
                "I found the topics/ units of the class to be extremely engaging. I also was really grateful that the instructor emphasized group work and working with new people.",
                "The class did a good job at teaching us about the core topics. I also liked how we interacted with the movie we watched. It could be improved by having more of an emphasis on improving conversational skills. It would also help to have a little more clarity or advance notice on when assignments are due."
