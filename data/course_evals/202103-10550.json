The professors in the course made great presentations to help our note taking; however, this is always a skill that has been challenging for me and something that this course had helped me improve significantly.",
                "I gained a cursory understanding of biology and an understanding of how it influences our current world. Given the pandemic and the threats posed by climate change, this was very useful and topical!",
                "I feel like I got a great intro level knowledge for all of the topics taught during the course, from a scientific angle that I had not been able to learn about before, and from a more theoretical angle that Ill take with me for a long time.",

                "I developed a strong background of how the biology of our life processes interact with our environment. I wish there were more classes at Yale like this one because everyone should have to take this course, as it presents important information about how we interact with our surroundings. It was also really fascinating to take this course during the coronavirus pandemic.",

                "There were specific areas related to biology that I now know more about, mostly specific case studies.",
                "Learnt a lot of new biology",
                "I learned a lot more about how we view science than about the science itself, which was refreshing and eye opening. As someone planning to get a degree in the social sciences, rather than the hard sciences, it felt a lot more applicable to my understanding of society--our opinions and thoughts on disease, illness, climate change, and agriculture, and how these opinions compare to the real facts.",

            "comments": [
                "Strength: interesting lectures\r\nWeakness: discussion sections were so useless, it was just a ploy to get ppl to talk, imo",
                "Strengths: Professors Marlon, Carlson, and Gendron (wow: they all end in -on) make this course really interesting and engaging. I wasn't expecting to be interested in a course concerning biology, climate change, and public policy, but I found myself pleasantly surprised. Some of the lectures didn't grab me as much as others, but I really enjoyed learning about prion diseases, Mautam, malaria, Four Corners Disease, ocean acidification, epigenetics, and the nitrogen cycle (among other topics). And we got to take a tour of some of the Peabody Museum collection, which was awesome! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I mean, this is a lecture course, so I wasn't really able to interact with the professors all that much (they did hold office hours quite frequently, which I appreciated, but they often just conflicted with my schedule). And while discussion sections were kind of interesting, they felt pretty ancillary. A lot of the material we covered in them didn't relate too much to the course, but we did have some good conversations. Also, I felt like the three midterms pretty much just required rote memorization, which felt a bit tedious. I feel like I didn't have the chance to apply what I'd been learning until I started working on the final paper. But these are fairly minor issues. For a course designed to offer non-science majors the opportunity to fulfill a requirement, I quite enjoyed it.",
                "It's a great course! Wish the essay could be a tad easier -- fewer source requirements maybe.",
                "The strengths are the lectures and course material. Lectures were always really engaging partly due to the professors and partly due to the material itself. The only weakness is the climate change unit. While it was really interesting and digestible, much of the material was taught in broad strokes, making it a little difficult to study for the exam.",
                "I loved the sections that had a little to do with lectures but dove into more interesting topics. I feel like the course was kind of hard with 3 exams, a paper, and sections as the only grades. I'm not sure if it's curved or not but if not, 1 bad exam can be pretty hard to recover from.",
                "This course is very accessible to non-STEM majors and does well to the scientific concepts to relevant social issues",
                "This class is such a great chance to learn about the diseases and climate concerns that we hear about in the news. While these topics are understandably important, it was a bummer we didn't get to look at any other topics like those more to do with genetics which were pitched as part of the class but only barely made it in. \r\n\r\nThe assigned readings were also a bit frustrating. The syllabus said about 40 pages a week, but then in the first half of the semester about 100 pages were being assigned and they were all articles making the same argument. A lot of students just got frustrated for even trying to do the readings and just gave up for the rest of the semester. I think assigning fewer and more varied readings would be a great plus, because there were some really interesting ones mixed in there - but you had to read 80 pages of repetitive material to get there.",
                "Strengths: pretty low commitment class\r\n\r\nWeakness: midterms were memorization heavy, which given that a lot of material was covered for each midterm was at times daunting.",
                "This course is very well designed and organized. I have no complaints about lectures and assignments but section could have been more engaging",
                "The biggest strenght def were the professors. They were so engaging, funny, and approachable! Without these attributes, I wouldn't enjoy the topics a lot.",
                "The strengths of this class are most certainly the ability to connect what we were learning back to our everyday lives. Along with this, I thought the class section was the most intriguing element of the course, mine being the experience section, where I could actually go to different locations and see the science we were learning about. I think the class could be improved if the readings were used more in class or touched upon.",
                "Most of the lectures were engaging, some were not. The biggest weakness were the exams. They were highly specific to the content in the lectures and there was practically no help in terms of review sessions.",
                "Strengths would be that I loved the professors and how this course was taught. I liked having them switch and I found the course material interesting even though I dont have much of an interest in biology and science. \r\nWeakness would be the amount of memorizing you have to do for the exams",
                "Strengths- great teachers and interesting subject \r\nWeakness- more 1 on 1 with teachers",
                "To better understand the tests and how specific they get",
                "The strengths are the engaging professors and lectures. I didn't feel as though there were any glaring weaknesses.",
                "I wish the lecture notes posted were a little more detailed. I found that if you missed lecture, there really wasn't much you could do.",
                "Great teachers and lectures",
                "The professors were dynamic lecturers and always accessible. I do not see any weaknesses in this course  I believe it was designed and executed well.",
                "This course had a good structure\/order of professors. Some powerpoints were much more interesting than others.",
                "In general I think this is a very strong course. Because each unit is relatively short, you are never bored. Also, though the material varies a lot, the exams always follow the same format which is really nice. I think that the mandatory section could be more useful. We didn't really reinforce what was taught during lecture. It very much felt like the registrar said the course needed a section, so it had one, but there really was no need.",
                "S: lectures are quite good, studying is a straightforward process, and the experience science section was fun\r\n\r\nW: it's not super clear how you're supposed to take notes or process information until you start getting practice exam questions. I was a bit confused about the level of specific knowledge\/detail we would need until then.",
                "Strengths: the accessibility of the course! The lectures and topics move at a very fair pace and the professors were all incredible. Lectures were on the whole engaging and relevant to current events and the TAs were also supportive! \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the lectures felt a bit repetitive toward the middle and end of the course so sometimes transitions between and back to topics felt a bit disjointed.",
                "Professor John was very knowledgeable and engaging\r\nThe first two exams were straightforward and aligned with what had been taught",
                "Strengths could be better review sessions because the tests were extremely specific questions and even if you studied a lot you never know what specific details will be on the test",
                "In my opinion, there weren't many weaknesses in the course. I think the biggest strengths in the course were how great our instructors were in engaging our class and making this topic of research so interesting each day.",
                "I thought that the lectures were, by and large, fantastic! I think the climate change unit could have used a little more direction, however. I also think section could be amended to be a little more topically relevant to the course  it was frankly hard to engage when section differed from what we were learning so significantly.",
                "The lectures were great and I always enjoyed them. I did feel a little caught off guard by the exams, but I think in the end they were fair. And the pace of the class felt a little fast at times but Im happy about the range of things we were able to learn about.",
                "Strengths: Having 3 professors that specialize in 3 different areas\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the exams and the grading did not make sense at all",
                "Strengths: engaging lecture content, very relevant to our lives and society\r\nWeaknesses: improved structure for section, and more clarity in reviews on what will be on exam",
                "The professors were very engaging and I really liked my experience science section with Ronit.",
                "Strengths are having a TA and weekly discussions",
                "Strengths - good overview of several biological concepts, in an easily digestible format\r\nWeaknesses - heavy on rote memorization for assessments, also would have liked more of the actual bio rather than spending so much time on infectious diseases and climate change",
                "Strengths are that it brought topics covered up in a super relevant and engaging way. Lecture was very enjoyable and discussion section was helpful in teaching other implications of the stuff we learned.",
                "This course could be improved with more transparency between the lecturers and the students about exams",
                "I loved the rotation of professors and the structure of this course. I liked the way it was taught with historical examples to keep it engaging. I think the middle section on climate change should definitely be kept, but could use a little more specificity on how it is affecting the world.",
                "I wish it went over a few more topics, it just felt like we hit climate change a few too many times, and the diseases got a bit repetitive as well.",
                "This course does a fantastic job of explaining the different topics in lecture. Lecturers could do a better job having a uniform way to revise the material before each of the exams. Some lecturers provided helpful roadmaps of each of their lectures, while others did not.",
                "This course is very engaging without demanding a lot of you as a student. I have no complaints about the lecture, in fact I found them highly enjoyable, however, personally, the discussion sections seemed rather useless as there was no discussion and the information talked about, while making an attempt, rarely added upon our class material.",
                "More clarity is needed around what we are tested on. It was unclear from the lectures that we would only be tested on the biology, not the sociology. But then we were tested on the sociology, including historical information. Also, most of the lecture slides are just photos which makes obtaining information if one is sick incredibly hard. Recording the lectures would help those who cant make it to lecture one day.",
                "more discussion around preparing for the final paper assignment",
                "Strengths- great in class explanations, material was clear to understand \r\nWeaknesses- not really any, maybe could use section as more of an opportunity to talk about things we dont understand",
                "Strengths-I thought each of the professors was a great lecturer and that they were really an asset to the course. I learned a lot just by going to lecture and paying attention!\r\nWeaknesses-Section was such a miserable experience, which I suppose depends on who your TF is. There seemed to be no consistency across sections. My TF would stand at the head of the class and lecture us on really advanced and irrelevant biology topics for the whole time. So section felt like a huge waste of time. Definitely be mindful of which section you choose and dont be afraid to shop around in order to land on a TF that will really improve your experience with the course.",
                "Its a great class for non-science majors. I genuinely enjoyed it, and the professors are great and engaging. My section was also great because we discussed the real-world application of the subjects we learned in class, and the materials we read were often interesting. The exams are also manageable.",
                "Didnt like how lectures shifted due to different professors",
                "I would've benefited from a more comprehensive list of topics to be covered on each exam. Sometimes it felt unclear which part of the lectures we would be tested on (for example, when looking at climate change graphs).",
                "Lectures were for the most part interesting and I enjoyed that hearing from multiple different professors. Sections were super helpful and interesting.",
                "I wish I could take more classes taught by Professor Carlson, he is such an engaging teacher and made me never want to miss a single lecture. The section material was also very interesting each week and allowed me to engage with the course material in a smaller group which fostered my understanding. I would not change anything about this class!",
                "Strong lectures; not very much guidance on preparation for exams.",
                "I was engaged during this course. I loved my section class. Sarah was extremely helpful and engaging. I loved how the professors changed throughout the semester.",
                "The exams were purely memorization (some people might love it, some people might hate it). I feel like if the exams also had some more application based questions, it would help us think more critically about some of these topics.",
                "The lectures are clear and the exams are fair. I do not think their any things that need improvement.",
                "profs are all AMAZING!!!!! cool and hilarious and their lectures are super fun and engaging. super chill lecture vibes! you will need to study for the exams as they can be pretty detailed but theyre very managable if you pay attention and put in just a little time",
                "The strengths of this course are definitely the professors as they are great lecturers that keep topics clear and easy to learn.",
                "There are very few assignments so it's difficult to stay motivated to keep up with the classes between exams, I crammed for all of them since I did not need to know the material in between at all. At the same time, the lack of assignments made this class a lack of stress in my life for almost the entire semester.",
                "strengths is that its very interesting and you get a basic knowledge of a lot of different concepts. Weakness is that we didnt really know how to prepare for the tests with different lecturers.",
                "More definition on exam",
                "Strengths: I liked the three-professor model. It worked well to provide a diverse set of viewpoints and expertise. Class was well organized and you always left with a clear picture of what the teachers wanted you to learn. The information isn't too daunting and is very accessible for beginners. Guests are frequently brought into class, helping spice things up and adding some additional variety. The professors also clearly care about each of their students so much -- they play pump-up songs beforehand, hand out gifts, and get to know most students by name. It's a really lovely community by the end of the semester! Also, take the experience science section! It's way more fun, no more work, and you don't need to sit around talking about science -- you actually get to tour buildings at Yale that you've never seen before and do a science \"experiment\"! Super fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because of a snafu in scheduling the profs, the \"plants\" section came after \"climate change\". The course could have flowed a little better if it had gone the other way -- infectious disease, plants, then climate change. Just my two cents. Sometimes, lecture was kind of boring too. Some more dynamic engagement from the professors could have boosted the energy in the room. Finally, the TFs take off points for silly reasons on the test -- typically for omitting some random minor detail they wanted to see in your answer, even if you answered the question completely. Overall, though, the course was really well organized and enjoyable.",
                "the course having 3 different professors was a strength",
                "Strengths of this class are that I think there should be more classes offered by Yale College that are STEM classes specifically directed towards Humanities majors, so I'm grateful for that. Weaknesses are that the exams are pretty difficult to study for, and since they're all directly from the slides, the review sessions mostly include a speed-run of the previous presentations which is kind of difficult to consume so quickly.",
                "The professors are amazing. Extremely engaging presentations, easy-to-understand, and with slides being available on the Canvas site, it's simple to look back and review anything that didn't make sense. The sections also helped a lot in that regard. As for improvements, the tests were mostly based on memorizing and repeating facts, rather than applying learned information. If that could be adjusted, I think it might end up being even more engaging.",
                "Strengths -- some lecturers had good overviews and organization of their material. I also liked the review sessions as well as the experience science section. Lecture lacked engagement.",
                "The strengths are definitely the lecturers; they are so engaging and fun! I think the course could be improved by the sections being more relevant to the lecture material so that there is extra support for the content that will be covered on the exams.",
                "The class was very engaging and things were explained at a level that a non-science major could understand. However, the class' relationship to the tests was not as clear, and it was more of a guessing game as to what information was necessary to know for the exams.",
                "The strengths of this course are definitely the sections. I found my section to be highly productive and useful in retaining information for this class. The other strength is the fact that the faculty post the slides to the lectures on canvas, which is great for when I miss something during lecture. The area of improvement would be the fact that there isn't always clarity on what information we should study as we go along, and there aren't zoom lectures of the class posted on canvas. Not having zoom lectures posted makes things difficult when I've missed something the professor is explaining and isn't on the slides to write down later."

                "Yes! gut science credits woohoo",
                "Would recommend, if you, like me, are a non-science major trying to fulfill a science requirement! There's no homework really (aside from some short readings you have to do for your discussion section) and no math. So on principle, that means this class is kind of gut-adjacent, but the lack of weekly assignments means that doing well on the midterms kind of matters. Study for them! It helps a lot! It's really not difficult to do well if you i) go to class ii) take notes iii) read over your notes thoroughly for the tests iv) learn specifics and not the just the big-picture stuff and v) attend the review sessions (not least because the TFs put a lot of work into them).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any Yale student looking for an easy science credit.",
                "Yes! Especially to non-science majors. Its very digestible and fun.",
                "Yes. This class is so interesting and not a ton of work so it's good if you have a hard semester with other classes.",
                "Yes, it's a great science credit for students who aren't STEM majors",
                "Quality of course differed with professor changes, so it is difficult to give an overall assessment. I liked some more than others, which also reflected in our exam scores. Overall, yeah, I'd recommend the course. It's not a full gut class, but it's not that hard and stressful either.",
                "Yes, especially the experience science section. Was such a cool way to get to see more of Yale, especially parts that you would never get to see as a non STEM student",
                "A great Sc credit! If you pay attention in lecture and study an average amount, you will get an A. There's nothing designed to trick you, but don't necessarily expect to have an A handed to you without doing the bare minimum.",
                "If youre looking for an easy yet engaging science credit, I absolutely recommend taking this class.",
                "Absolutely. This class is basically a Yale rite of passage. Take it you wont regret it",
                "Yes, i would. Good science credit for those not that into science, will still be able to learn a ton without having to get drowned by super difficult concepts.",
                "Yes, this is a great class for humanities students to think about the connections between the humanities (especially politics and public policy) and biology. The class was very engaging and all of the lecturers seemed passionate about the subject material and kind to the students.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I really enjoyed the content, and I thought all of the staff running the class were excellent.",
                "This course is NOT a gut. Sure, there a light workload, but the exams are highly specific. If you are not a test person, do not take this class.",
                "Yes I would reccomend if you are non stem major and good at memorizing stuff for the exams",
                "Yes! Very interesting",
                "Yes, I think this class provides scientific outlet to students who do not always do well In the sciences.",
                "Yes it is good for students to who dont like science",
                "Very easy class, but the midterms are very memorization heavy, and they test on quite specific things from the lectures. The class isn't much work, but you definitely do need to put in time studying for the midterms if you're going to do well on them. \r\n\r\nBut the professors are all amazing, super kind, and helpful, as are the TFs.",
                "Not as much of a gut as people think",
                "If you are a non-stem student and need a science credit, then yes. If you have an interest in biology and want to explore it in depth, then probably take a harder class.",
                "Yes 100%",
                "I already have! This course is worthwhile to any student pursuing any subject. This class provides a fantastic opportunity to learn about science in a meaningful way.",
                "Yes! Good mix of science and social studies.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I took this course as a fifth class and as my science requirement, and for many weeks, it was my favorite course I was taking. I genuinely felt excited to attend lecture and what we were learning was directly applicable to real life, so it's sticking with me even though the course is over.",
                "Yes, though keep in mind how it works. Most weeks you basically show up to lecture and discussion and that's it, but each of the three exams requires at least a few hours of studying, and the final paper also takes a little bit. If that's how you like to work, go for it. It was interesting and fun!",
                "I would 100% recommend bio, the world, and us to a student interested in sociological and biological intersections and for taking a science credit that is accessible. I felt prepared by each lecture for the exams and the content was all relevant to current events which kept the class engaging.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes my favorite class at yale because it was fun and interesting and not insanely difficult.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I think biology is a really important subject to understand in our everyday life and I also just think the caliber of the course was so great. I really feel like I learned a ton.",
                "Yes! An excellent science credit for non-science majors.",
                "Yes definitely. Its a great option for non-science majors to learn about important biology topics that they can take with them going forward into other fields.",
                "I would! It is a good science credit for non-stem majors and you can really make the connection between biology, the world, and us.",
                "Absolutely! If you're looking to get a glimpse of biology without a technical background, this is a great introduction!",
                "Yes especially for non-science students.",
                "Yes I would because it is a good science course to take for people who are not wishing to take the science route",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend the course to others because it is a great science course for non science majors.",
                "Yes. This was one of my favorite classes. I leaned a ton but wasnt drowning in work.",
                "Yes but only if they have a fairly easy schedule. studying for the exams was always a challenge for me.",
                "Yes! I was on the fence about this as my science credit and am really glad I took it. The professors are super engaging and I was glad when I understood things like the significance of a new potential malaria vaccine in a more nuanced way.",
                "Yes, it's a good SC gut. I liked the topics too, and the exams seemed pretty low stakes. Take the experience science section if you can.",
                "Bio, the world and us is an absolute dime of a class. I think every Yale student should be forced to take this",
                "This question is great for non-STEM majors. I recommend it to anyone looking to fulfill a science requirement with a class that is actually interesting.",
                "Absolutely - if you need a science credit as a non-science major this is a fantastic introductory level biology that is engaging and applicable to the world around us (true to the course name).",
                "Yes - great science credit for any non STEM major. Feels like a conventional course that is not super high stress but you will still get something out of it.",
                "yes, its a great class for non  science majors to get their requirement and learn some new and interesting information",
                "Yes! I feel so much more informed on issues than before, and I feel a lot more grounded in my understanding of basic biology.",
                "Yes, if you have only high school bio experience youll definitely learn something, and approaching it with the societal problems lens will probably be novel to you as well.",
                "Yes. I genuinely think every non-science major should know the things we learn in the class, and its facilitated in a way thats manageable and really interesting.",
                "Yes because it offers an interesting perspective",
                "I would recommend this course to non-science majors. It gives a broad overview of important topics (without diving too deeply into the science of each) and its workload is manageable in conjunction with other hard courses (the workload for this class only really gets bad around the time of the 3 exams).",
                "I would recommend it if you need a science credit that is low work (you do need to study for exams though) but otherwise no.",
                "Yes, you must take this course! It is extremely informative and relevant to the society we are living in today, and the challenges that our future will face.",
                "Yes!",
                "If you need a science credit, go for it!",
                "Yes I would 100% recommend. It was very interesting, loved the professors, and the work load wasnt too heavy.",
                "I do! Its great for any non-STEM majors. But be warned: there may not be a lot of work, but when it comes to studying for the tests, you WILL have to set aside time to study.",
                "Yes, for those looking for a relatively low work load science credit.",
                "Yes definitely take the experience science section, was so much fun",
                "Yes, great science class for non stem majors.",
                "ABSOLUTELY!!!!! truly the perfect gut science credit. very chill and easy and actually fun!!! so many guts are so dry and boring but this one is actually good. lectures are fun and engaging and the profs are really really great and seem like theyre having fun teaching the course which is so important!! def take this class if you need a sc credit",
                "Absolutely! The content is incredibly interesting and vital for all people to know, especially if they are interested in every being in positions of power in society.",
                "Yes! \r\nfor a nice basic general science course and credit",
                "Yes, great gut, don't have to go to class. Just get study guide night before the test. Paper is confusing but easy once you figure it out",
                "Yes definitely! Especially with the experience section. This class isn't a complete \"gut\" (you should still study for the exams and work decently hard on your paper), but it's not too hard at all and a great 5th class or science credit. The professors are friendly, the criteria for getting an A are clear, and you never really have to over-extend yourself to satisfy the requirements of the course.",
                "I probably would, just because there are not enough classes that are science classes specifically for humanities students. But I would definitely give a couple of disclaimers about it, like mentioning the difficult exams that are hard to study for.",
                "Absolutely. While the workload isn't high, I feel like I learned a lot of valuable information. The course is more about the application of science and how it relates to society than about the science itself. If that sounds interesting to you, you should take this class! But if you're looking to get an in-depth description of specific biology topics, you might be better off taking something like the BIOL 101 sequence.",
                "It is a good science credit.",
                "Yes! This is a great science class for non-science majors.",
                "Yes, I recommend it if you are non-stem",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this class to a student with the understanding that it is not as much of a gut class as many claim it to be. The knowledge is important, and it was able to lessen my disdain for biology.",
                "yes. I found this course to be highly informative on science that every individual should know. this course, though we cover the basic levels of many topics, allows for a greater awareness of the world around you and also your own anatomy.",
                "A great course to take for a science credit that may not be as rigorous as other science courses. Good if you would like to learn about the societal impacts of science and technology development."
