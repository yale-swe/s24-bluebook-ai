                "Strengths: Composition lessons are pretty helpful, and were the part of the class that I got the most value out of.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Most of the actual lectures in this class are composed of guest lectures from different composers, and their music is usually pretty some pretty avant-garde classical music. If you're only taking the class to make a pop song, and you don't have much interest in classical music, you probably won't get that much out of the guest lectures. The class also doesn't teach basic skills with a DAW, so if you've never worked with a DAW before, I imagine it will be pretty overwhelming.\r\n\r\nHow could it be improved: I wish there was more room to listen to other students' progress on their composition projects in the middle of the semester to provide feedback or get inspiration. In the art department they regularly do \"crits\" where each person gets their art critiqued by the class - I think this would be really helpful to implement a similar system for this class. It could be as simple as everyone uploading their in-progress pieces to a canvas discussion thread and requiring everyone to comment on three pieces with feedback. I think I was a little disappointed that we only got to hear other people's pieces at the end of the semester, once everyone was pretty much done, and by that point there wasn't much room to give deeper feedback/constructive criticism since people pieces are already mostly finalized. I feel like having a crit system would be interesting because you get to see what other people are working on, and it would also open doors for potential collaboration or exchanging of ideas/tips between students.",
                "I love the seminars, student presentations, and lessons, but I would have appreciated more formal teaching to the entire class.",
                "I thought this course was well-structured, striking a good balance between group learning and individual study. The only thing that stuck out to me as a point of improvement was the content balance of the lectures; there seemed to be a disproportionate focus on music tech, even for the number of DAW composers in the class, and some songwriting-oriented lectures could have been very valuable for the high number of songwriters in the class. However, I will say that overall, the diversity of lecture material was quite refreshing, and very boundary-expanding.",
                "Strengths: Private lessons, guest composers, ability to work at your own pace and choose what projects you want to create. Weaknesses: Assignments could involve a lot of learning on your own or hoping you were already familiar with the topic"

                "Yes! If you are a composer and want regular lessons and the experience of refining one or more ideas over an entire semester, definitely recommend this class. Also, you will meet other musicians on campus with the possibility of collaboration, and hear wonderful artists talk about new music and electronic music.",
                "If you are considering this class because you want to learn how to produce pop music, but you don't have much of an interest in classical/instrumental music, I would not recommend this class. This class has the difficult task of trying to make a curriculum that will be helpful for everyone, despite the fact that students have vastly different goals for their composition projects - some want to compose string quartets, and others want to make hyperpop bangers. Since the composition process for different types of music looks so different - some students are working with notation software like sibelius, while other students are working in a DAW - they can't really teach you how to use your tools, and you kind of have to come in already knowing how to do stuff. Honestly I think there should be a separate class for music production since it's so different from working with notation software, but that's a different story. I would view this class more as an independent study with your composition lessons, and the actual class lectures are just supplemental.\r\n\r\nIf you're only interested in pop music, you will probably not get much out of the weekly lectures. I consider myself pretty open-minded musically, but to be honest, some of the music from the guest composers was pretty far-out-there and wack at times. If listening to a bunch of really really avant-garde classical music doesn't excite you, you will probably not enjoy the guest lectures much.",
                "Unequivocally.",
                "Definitely, if you're interested in composition and want to be held accountable."
