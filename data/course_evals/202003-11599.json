                "Strengths: the texts, the discussion (organization with good guiding questions + format over breakout rooms then back as one class), Professor Xiang who is the kindest and most engaged and so fire at leading discussion! Weaknesses: This course is scheduled in OCS as a MWF for 50 minutes, but we only took MW, which I appreciated on one hand because I had no Friday classes. However, I did feel like some of the texts could have used more time. In particular, we barely discussed Kincaid's Autobiography of My Mother. I think this is because of other scheduling differences, but apparently this course ran slower than it would have in a normal in-person year, and I don't see how the discussions could go as in depth as they needed to at a faster pace. I say this because even though I loved our discussions, I always felt like we ran out of time or just didn't have the time to go as in depth as we could\/should have. I either wish we had taken the Friday classes or the schedule would have been a little better to accommodate the texts, especially as the semester went on (so Kincaid and laterand also especially the Oceania texts). Related, I loved our initial ice breakers, but especially with people coming in late over Zoom, the ice breakers would often take up to or even over 10 minutes of our class time, which could be frustrating when then we didn't have ample time to discuss.",
                "Strengths: a clear understanding of the limitations of a \"World English Literature\" course that aptly named and discussed the tensions that existed; exposure to different pieces of literature; having speakers come in and discuss various works with us; extensive opportunity for feedback on essays",
                "Seminar format is very good. Reading list was a bit hit or miss but generally good. Some books felt a bit rushed. Could be improved with one or two fewer books to allow for deeper dives into other books",

                "I thought Professor Xiang did a wonderful job with the Zoom format. Her icebreakers and focus on collective participation helped build community and create a comfortable discussion environment.",
                "The breakout rooms were awesome. Prof. Xiang was my only professor who I think truly mastered the online situation. I got the sense that she was being inventive and not just doing the same thing but over Zoom. With our breakout discussions, normally she would give us context as a big class then send a file with questions into the chat, then divide us up. Then we would have 15-20 minutes to discuss and then come back and discuss as a class.",
                "I really appreciated Professor Xiang engaging us in thinking about what course participation might look like in a time like this. It created a welcoming environment that strived for high standards of education while still acknowledging that things were not quite the same. Use of synchronous and asynchronous pieces together (the seminars, individual study, and discussion boards) kept students engaged throughout the week, not just during those few zoom sessions. And the icebreakers! how could we not mention the icebreakers! were also a fun way to get to know each other, although sometimes they took a bit long for our 50 minutes sessions. I think the Worlding Project was an interesting project, and should be iterated upon if it is to be kept. It felt a little...detached from the rest of the course, and having a little more guidance on what the focus of the project was would be good.",
