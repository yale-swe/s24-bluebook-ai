   "comments": [
    "Got a nice introduction to a spectrum of Postcolonial writings",
    "I learned much about colonialism and about excellent works of literature produced outside of the United States",
    "I gained super valuable insight into a broad array of English literature from around the world. I was also exposed to amazing novels that I may not have read otherwise. I learned a ton from Prof M and also from the other students in the class.",
    "This course provided a great survey course of postcolonial and world literature. Most basically, the texts gave me a better understanding of colonized cultures and lifestyles, the writing styles of authors stuck between the pressures of imperial notions of linguistic superiority and desires to stay true to one's own culture or familial languages and practices. I enjoyed being able to look at literature and history together through archival materials. Class debate helped me to improve the way i structure thoughts and arguments verbally and individual meetings with Professor Mukhopadhyay helped me to refine my essay structures and ideas.",
    "Skills in analyzing a fantastic array of texts and insights into how they reflect the societies in which they were written",
    "This class has an expansive and impressive reading list that really broadened my understanding of the post colonial genre of literature as a whole.",
    "I think my critical analysis and writing skills improved drastically. I learned to challenge frameworks I have previously adopted and seen used in earlier English classes.",
    "I was able to read a selection of novels that I wouldn't have otherwise known about. I also learned a lot regarding the historical background of each book",
    "This course is really wonderful! We thought a lot about the project and implications of writing in English from\/about non-English-speaking communities and experiences. I also learned a lot about archival work, literary histories, and forms of literature. I would emphasize the latter learning: this class is not just a postcolonial literature class! We emphasize so much of the richness of experience beyond colonialism (none of the literature we read is limited to\/solely about suffering under colonial rule). And students become much, much stronger writers and researchers thought Prof. Mukhopadhyay's guidance!",
    "I learned a lot about critical reading & essay writing"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought this was a magnificent course, and I loved the various books we read for the class. I think the workload was a bit heavy asking students to read a 200-300 page book every week, and sometimes it felt like we didn't get enough time for certain books, but regardless they were all really enjoyable.",
    "I really enjoyed the works of literature we read, though sometimes it can be difficult to finish all of the reading for the week, especially if you are taking other English classes.",
    "I think that the works we read were really good and different enough to get a sense for the types of novels out there. Prof M is great at facilitating discussions and I really appreciate her thorough feedback on all papers.",
    "The readings were really great. I really appreciated not having to do tedious reading responses after every reading. It made the class way more engaging and less frustrating.",
    "The strengths of this course are the class size, the quality of people who take the class, the quality of instruction, and the range of texts. I think that a potential weakness is that there is not much direction given in terms of how to do each assignment - e.g. there is not too much explanation of how to best use archives or use archival material strategically in assignments. However, this also meant that there was a lot of creative choice in terms of the assignments and it helped me to become a more independent researcher and writer.",
    "Its genuinely fantastic",
    "It is my favorite core English class that I have taken so far, it is well rounded and the books are fun and easy to discuss. I think there could have been more instruction given for the use of secondary source material in writing, as it is supposed to be a foundational\/introductory course but maybe thats just me.",
    "I love the broad interpretation of World English Literature, but think an inherent challenge to such a course is that all texts must have been written in English, limiting our exploration.",
    "I wish there were more opportunities for writing assignments.",
    "The class discussion was fantastic, and it was always really high-energy - but I hated having assignments due on the last day of break"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. A really fantastic course that the professor taught wonderfully.",
    "If you are interested in colonialism and Empire, definitely.",
    "This is a great class if you're interested in reading non-translated novels that aren't often covered in traditional English classes. Class time is used to discuss the novels and I found that it was a great way to learn from the other students in addition to Prof M.",
    "Yes. The readings are great, and Professor Mukhopadhyay is very good at leading class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in postcolonial or world literature. The range of texts keep the class very engaging, the instructor is excellent and the workload is not overwhelming. The size of the class makes for great discussions and debates, and this class is great for improving your writing but also the way you express arguments in debate.",
    "Strongly recommend",
    "Absolutely, I think a non-English major would appreciate this course for the breadth of subject material that the reading list covers. If you want to have good intellectual discussion and want to read books that are truly well written and fun to read, take this class!",
    "Yes absolutely! Especially with Professor Mukhopadhyay - shes amazing.",
    "Yes  and, if possible, take it with Professor Mukhopadhyay. The syllabus of the course is also excellent. I'm leaving this course excited to read more \"world English literatures\" with the analytical tools gained in this course.",
    "Yes! This is one of the best options for fulfilling the introductory literature course requirement in the English major. The content is really fascinating, the instruction is unparalleled, and the essay assignments are purposeful. Students will leave this class better readers, world citizens, researchers, and writers. Definitely take this class!",
    "Yes, I found it vibrant and interesting",
    "Yes, I really loved the colonial\/post-colonial angle we took in exploring the works."
