   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths: a lot of resources\r\nweaknesses: lecture hall not big enough when all the students come",
    "Jonathan Parr is a great lecturer! Definitely made Gen Chem as fun as it reasonably could be.",
    "This course is well-taught, but I feel that the concepts in class have little to no correlation with those tested on the exam.",
    "Lecture slides are not very helpful apart from lecture itself and hard to study before tests. However there are a good amount of resources that students can reach out to for help.",
    "The course was very challenging. It could be improved if there were better engagement between the students and the material. The various resource presented (mioy.com, textbook, and lectures) does not make it clear the level of understanding necessary for students to succeed, some materials went in depth, while others were too vague. It would have been much more helpful if students can get all the necessary information from one source without it being overcomplicated.",
    "strengths: professor parr is very nice and tries to make to class fun by performing some experiments\r\n\r\nweakness: self-studying; professor parr doesnt really go over anything thats on the test during lecture with the exception of some practice problems. however, it is assumed that u SHOULD do the readings for the class and honestly for everything.\r\n\r\ntest material is reviewed during discussion section but honestly, it's too short to go over a chapter's worth of material which is what the TAs try to do.\r\n\r\nimprovement: BREAK THE GODDAMN class up into smaller sections ITSELF instead of one big lecture; students will be held accountable and can actually receive HELP during class instead of being lost if they don't understand one thing at the beginning of lecture",
    "At times, it was quite difficult to make connections between the lectures, readings, and Sapling questions. While Professor Parr's lectures were always interesting and helpful in understanding the material, I sometimes struggled with the material because of these gaps. The main strengths of this course were due to Professor Parr's lectures as they generally effective and helpful.",
    "I think a strength is the speed with which it is taught. The lectures are really easy to understand, and the powerpoints alone are helpful. A weakness is the difference between lecture material and test material. I felt like the tests were asking about different skills than the lectures provided.",
    "The lectures weren't great. Everything was talked about in a confusing way and nothing ever was explained in-depth, in my opinion.",
    "The Enrichment section was the most useful and helpful part of this course. This should 100% continue.",
    "Lectures are pretty much useless.",
    "The strength of this course is that the problem sets and section hours really aid the understanding of the material and what was taught in class. Professor Parr was always very engaged in the material, which made it even more fun to learn. I think the class could be improved if the lecture portion of the class had less practice problems and spent more time explaining concepts, while leaving the big practice problems for section time.",
    "Weakness: large lecture\r\nImprove: have smaller STEM classes",
    "Though the lectures were big, discussion sections were very helpful and there were numerous resources available to students. Enrichment section in particular was a great resource.",
    "sometimes i didn't really understand the material when it was taught until section with Mioy",
    "Not a very engaging lecture course, having more interactive portions and questions would likely keep students more engaged. Tests were very very challenging.",
    "Actually provide previous tests as review material in order to prepare students for what they are going to get whalloped with. Include TA sessions during shopping period so you won't get stuck with a less than desirable lecturer.",
    "The problem sets on sapling were helpful in understanding all of the concepts. There were also several opportunities for office hours and review sessions. However, the lectures could sometimes be too vague or hard to follow. The large number of students was challenging.",
    "A lot of info at once so hard to keep up",
    "Weaknesses- problem sets content are not fully reflective of what appears on exams",
    "The course was solid overall. If you took a legit AP Chemistry course in high school then most of the course will honestly be review. Online homework is a bit cumbersome, but the other side of it is that you essentially get unlimited attempts to arrive at the correct answer.\r\n\r\nThe demonstrations in class were cool but class overall was pretty boring if you already know basic chem.",
    "At times, I felt that the lectures didn't closely correspond to what we were reading in the textbook and what was being covered in section.",
    "I think this course is very interesting and the sapling homework and problem sets are very helpful to my learning in the course! However, I think some of the lecture material and explanations are over-complicated in a way that does not help students understand the material.",
    "This class was fairly standard although I wish there were more practice problems available to prepare for the final. Also I wish TF sections were a little more structured in teaching material as opposed to doing problems independently. This could have been helped with the posting of worksheet solutions the week of the section.",
    "The strength of the class was that it did a great job of breaking down the material. My only critique would be that it feels like we rushed through all the complicated things in class, and I think it would be better if those things (e.g quantum mechanics onward) were explained all the way through (like was usually done during office hours) even if it takes longer. But, I must say the material was still taught exceptionally well considering how complex the material is and how its being taught to a lecture class of students at a variety of levels.",
    "I think the lecture structure and Sapling work very well for the course although the sections didn't feel particularly effective, so that was a bit of a drawback.",
    "The lectures could be more focused to the textbook material to facilitate studying.",
    "The class moves at a good speed however some days it is hard to stay engaged.",
    "The content is useful, similar to the AP Chemistry material, and worth learning. Course-based peer tutors and optional but recommended discussion sections mean that you will receive consistent, meaningful support. Homework and reading questions are for a completion grade. Mioy and Jonathan were both great teachers and enjoyable people to listen to. I found that Sapling homework assignments were a great source of study questions, but the instructors also uploaded practice questions, concept lists, and practice exams. A dropped unit exam (out of 3) means that a bad day (honestly two bad days) won't ruin your chances at a good grade. My only complaint is that exam graders inconsistently follow students' partial errors, some being lenient, some offering no credit.",
    "The strengths would be that all of the professors and TFs are very open to help you. The weaknesses would be the overwhelming workload and vague information in the beginning of the semester of when the assignments were due. It was also very hard to hear the professor sometimes during the lectures even with the microphone on.",
    "The problem sets often were difficult to follow using sapling. Many strengths as Dr. Parr was a great professor however discussion section leader was very poor.",
    "Some strengths were the chemistry enrichment sections which were extremely helpful.",
    "Better access to online resources such as Mioys notes",
    "I dont like how everything is on Sapling, separate from canvas. I at least think assignments should be posted on canvas",
    "The course covers a fair breadth of topics over the course of the semester. The midterms accurately reflect the material learned and there are plenty of resources to study this midterms.\r\n\r\nOverall, I don't think the course is well taught. Dr. Parr, although a fairly engaging lecturer, did not do an amazing job explaining some of the most difficult concepts in the course such as MO theory and polymers. For an understanding of those topics, I had to go to Mioy's office hours, which are excellent. There are often many times during lecture, where even after having done the textbook readings, I felt completely lost. Dr. Parr is unable to take the pulse of the class and determine whether students have understood the concepts at hand.",
    "Boring",
    "Strengths include an organized layout: homework, reading questions, lectures, discussion section, and exams. Weaknesses include class three times a week.",
    "Strengths - weekly homeworks and daily reading questions kept me on top of my work and made sure I did not miss anything.",
    "I thought all the materials and learning tools were presented and organized very well so that if a student is motivated enough, they will do well. However, I didnt like the weekly discussions as I thought they were unhelpful and unnecessary.",
    "There was a lot of resources available to help students with the course but it could easily become overwhelming especially for students that have no background in chemistry. Also, discussion sections were not always helpful.",
    "The course was sometimes hard to follow, and important concepts were not explained clearly or glossed over. It was unclear which topics were important to understand and apply.",
    "I didn't think that the lectures supplemented my learning that well. Most of my studying and preparation for the exams came from Sapling and the chemistry textbook. I thought that the material covered in class was more complicated than needed for the midterms.",
    "Strengths are definitely the enrichment sections, the weaknesses are the way the lectures are structured. A suggestion would be to have a clear organization for the way lectures are structured (like a concluding slide with topics we went over, are expected to understand, etc.) so that understanding the slides before and after and during lecture come more naturally.",
    "This is a typical introductory stem course at Yale, where the readings, assessments, and lectures are all pretty balanced. What you put in is what you will get out of this course. I found no major strengths or weaknesses.",
    "Sometimes the questions in the homework tend to be a  lot  harder than ones that we go through in class",
    "While demonstrations served to liven up the lecture, there were only a few. More demonstrations would lead to a deeper comprehension of the material by combining the information learned in the lecture with something tangible. The lecture did offer a deeper explanation of key concepts with applications in other disciplines such as biology and environmental studies.",
    "I think that lecture is really enjoyable, and I like the balance between the typical lecture-style in reviewing concepts and problem-based learning in class.",
    "this was a good class. the lectures were a little disorganized and hard to follow, but I thought the saplings and the tests were good. The enrichment especially was super helpful when we learned about things that are hard to understand. I think the entire gen chem sequence could be improved if we had enrichment for 161 and 165, not just 161, because enrichment helped me make it through this class.",
    "The sections helped elaborate on the course material especially when it was not fully explained in lecture. Lecture sometimes went fast and it was hard to keep up with course material that wasn't on the midterm that immediately followed.",
    "- lectures often strayed off topic to focus on concepts that were not really relevant or would be tested in exams\r\n- lots of practice questions and materials were available to prepare for the exams \r\n- lots of resources available outside of class to help students learn",
    "I felt that my Discussion section was super unhelpful and I really struggled to understand what my TA was trying to teach us. I found that the problem sets were great because they allowed me to test my knowledge on everything that we had covered.",
    "Sometimes I felt like we didn't go over many examples in class, and that the class assumed that people had a very solid foundation in AP Chem.  I didn't, which was alright because I could go into office hours and just put in the extra time to learn it, but I did feel like the class favored those who maybe should have been in a higher course.  There were a lot of things that we didn't go over in class, and if you didn't learn it in high school, it was hard to approach problems that were much more difficult than ones on the worksheets.",
    "The course was interesting, but the lecture format made it difficult to engage with. It would be nice if it was a smaller class or if it was filmed.",
    "The demonstrations were helpful to understand the material.",
    "A strength is Jonathan Parr because he's actually a good lecturer and actually makes an effort to get t know his students, despite having so many of them. Another strength is action, because it makes it much easier to digest concepts. Even if you get stuck with a bad TF, section is a good place to make friends in such a big class and form study groups later on.",
    "I think the course was structured well, and I liked the way we learned.",
    "Lectures could have been more efficient in teaching the material, I felt that sometimes Parr would answer questions for a larger portion of the class time than he would teach the material. The TA's were fantastic, with Mioy being a huge help in providing succinct Powerpoint presentations on his website.",
    "I wish the discussion sections were more discussion based rather than a repeat of the class lecture.",
    "The main strength is that it is a straightforward course to do well in, given that the student puts in the time. The main weakness is that the material is primarily self-taught. Yes, you can go to the professor\/TA with questions. However, you do need to have a base understanding of the concept for a meeting like this (I assume, I never did this but this is my impression). This could lead to problems for someone who is rusty in chemistry. The course could also use some extra credit opportunities for those struggling with the material.",
    "The main strength in this course is the amount of resources that are provided to students to really understand the material. From the enrichment sections to discussion sections to office hours, I felt, especially during finals that I had a lot of options to achieve what I desired. The main weakness of this course lies in the fact that it's an introductory course, meaning that when confused during class, it was difficult to get the relief of understanding before the class ended.",
    "The course was extremely straightforward, but didn't really engage me some days",
    "Jonathan Parr is a great lecturer, but he goes over time a lot. I often couldn't stay late because I had to go to biology right after, and so I would miss the tail end of lecture sometimes.",
    "I thought the class was successful in creating smaller contexts to learn in outside of the large lectures (like section, peer tutors, etc) and sapling was really easy to use and very helpful in increasing my understanding.",
    "It could be difficult to study for the exams, since often what was on the exams did not reflect what was on the practice exams",
    "Strengths: Section and my TA, Mioy!! Even when lecture was confusing, Section was the best place for me to actually understand what was going on. I had a great experience with my TA and I learned a lot from him specifically.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Since its a lecture class with 250+ people, its hard to obviously tailor to specific needs. Also, a lot of stuff that was covered in lecture just wasn't important for the exams, and there were often topics on the exams (polymers, etc.) that weren't covered as deep as they should have been in lecture.",
    "As a first generation student, it was sometimes very frustrating to share this course with students who had substantially more experience in chemistry than myself. Though the class isn't largely curved, it creates an environment that can be very upsetting and toxic, as material is often much easier for students learning it the second time. After every test that I studied for days for, I'd hear a friend of mine who didn't study at all and who took organic chemistry in high school that it was a very easy exam, which added to the stress of the course. I know that the course is offered to all students who did not score a five on the AP exam, but perhaps lowering that threshold to a four would even the playing field in some aspects. Aside from that, Dr. Parr and Dr. Huynh were helpful and engaging lecturers. I often found that the majority of my learning came from outside of class in discussion section rather than in lecture, but that might be a result of me choosing not to do the readings.",
    "Course was well paced but a lot of topics were covered.",
    "I feel that the lecture was taught alright. However the stuff gone over in the lecture usually were irrelevant to what the course required is to actually know for the exam. The information was interesting but was very wide tracked form what we actually had to go over for the class. In addition, I feel that we would spend too much time on problems that we would never even need to know how to do at times which I thought was not that good of use of time. Although I did like the usage of presentation slides because it allowed us to have specific notes to take",
    "Lectures were for the most part useless.",
    "One of the strengths of this course is that it is very clear to the students as to what will appear on an examination and what types of questions will be asked. A weakness of this course is that some of the material covered in lecture does not appear on the examination, so the time spent in lecture can be more geared towards relevant material.",
    "The pacing of material was sometimes a little hard to follow. We would often spend a whole lecture explaining just one minor concept, or otherwise spend just one lecture trying to blow through multiple very important topics.",
    "The syllabus did not match the updated class.",
    "More in class practice",
    "-lots of outside-class support with great TAs in class discussion sections, enrichment session, peer tutoring, office hours, etc\r\n-the work balance was great - enough homework to help understand the material but not an overwhelming amount \r\n-no weaknesses",
    "Discussion section with Mioy was absolutely outstanding. Undoubtedly, everything I learned about chemistry this semester was thanks to his discussion sections and office hours; he is an incredible teacher. Lectures are extremely unhelpful.",
    "Since the lectures went so fast, it was hard to keep up with and absorb the material. I felt like a lot of the material ended up being self-taught. Also, we'd always be a few chapters ahead of the material our tests were on. For example we were on Chapter 5 in lecture when we had a test on chapters 1-3 so it was hard to review and keep up with the readings\/lectures.",
    "It seemed that this course suffered from beginning at a point which seemed far too easy, and then finishing with material that was far too difficult, making it a challenge to proportion time accordingly.",
    "The support system in chemistry is great. The peer tutors, office hours, ta's, enrichment sections etc. are all there to supplement lecture and help the student succeed. Which is great because you get multiple chances to understand topics and\/or refresh them. However, lecture in itself should be a major part of the material learned and it is not. Sometimes it feels as if going to lecture is a waste of time because it doesn't help with either the p-sets or the test material.",
    "I think that the professor is not very engaging and does not explain concepts very well. I learned more from the TAs and the other professor Mioy.",
    "The lecture was very unorganized and hard to follow. Mioys slides were the best of the course.",
    "strengths: sapling problem sets\/reading problems, discussion section\r\nweakness: practice exams were much easier than actual exam",
    "Strengths - the interactive learning with TA Mioy \r\nWeaknesses - long lectures, possibly could have been more broken up",
    "The strengths were that the Tfs and Mioy were all very helpful whenever we had questions. The weakness is that I never really gained to much from the lectures and found myself having to teach myself from the textbook.",
    "The course could have went into more depth like the test.",
    "Strengths of this course included well-taught lectures that went somewhat in-depth on the topics provided.",
    "Strengths: The problems sets really helped me cement my knowledge. \r\nWeakness:",
    "Great overview of all of the material. I loved the way the class was set up because it allowed for \"wiggle room\" regarding grades. We took three midterms, but only the two highest would be factored into our grade. I did find the daily graded questions a little tedious because if you forgot, nothing could be done. I got into the habit rather quickly, and I never forgot, but still, there is that added pressure of having to remember and check before each class. The p-sets were more than manageable and as long as sufficient time was left to do them, a 100 was ensured because of the online nature and limitless attempts. I did not like that grading was cryptic in the syllabus, so no one quite understood how the class would be graded in the end.",
    "I think making the syllabus clearer that the reading questions were mandatory because I thought they were optional until halfway through the semester. Also, making sure the TA's are on time because when I went to meet them, they were always late.",
    "The lectures were a helpful introduction to the material and the psets and especially discussion sections solidified the concepts. One weakness of the course was the presentation of quantum concepts. Without prior knowledge of the topic it was mostly pure memorization and more difficult to understand.",
    "One main weakness of the course was the formatting, as I felt some topics were not given enough time while others were covered for more time than necessary. I felt this could be mitigated by spending less time on the beginning topics and allocating that time to the later subjects. The main strength was the accessibility students have for getting help; there were plentiful office hours and the professor made himself readily available.",
    "- The grading system was really fair in my opinion \r\n-The weakness was that a better job could have been done to alert us about when the daily work on sapling was posted",
    "A lot of self learning",
    "Strengths: clear feedback, many resources, designed to help you succeed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lecture could be more engaging and introduce more practice problems.",
    "The course covers an immense amount of material, and moves fairly quickly. It also gains momentum really quickly, so its easy to get lost, especially if you don't attend section\/have a weaker TF. I would say more review sessions (Hannah's supplementary sections were extremely helpful) and perhaps more practice problems for the exams.",
    "Very good lecturing and extra help. easy to take a back seat and not engage.",
    "The lectures are irrelevant to the tests",
    "Lecture is boring and doesn't improve computation. Section is very valuable.",
    "Section was great",
    "Strengths are the lecturer and practice problem availability. Weaknesses are the pointless reading questions for every class.",
    "It provides a good foundational knowledge of chemistry",
    "I didn't find the lectures to be very helpful most of the time except for when Dr. Mioy lectured twice. I hope he'll be able to lecture more in gen chem 2 because his lectures were very straightforward and easy to understand the material and gave us problems to solve during lecture that were similar to what we would see on the exam. Otherwise, I found that looking over the slides outside of lecture, reading the book, and attending discussion section were more helpful to understand the material that going to lecture itself. I think if lecture was geared towards the most important material to be covered on the exams and included the types of problems that we expected to know how to solve on the exam, it would be more helpful to learn the material and feel prepared for the exams.",
    "This course was a great course that taught me a plethora of new lessons that are critical in gaining a better understanding of the world.",
    "The course was taught well but I think it couldve included a few more practice problems",
    "The strengths of this course are its office hours and discussion sections because help was easily found.",
    "The discussion sections were a great strength to this course, as were the review sessions held before exams. However, I found that I wasn't very engaged during the lectures, although that is understandable due to the large size of the class.",
    "This course was not well- structured.  I believe the lectures were out of sync with the readings, so we would be reading about topics that would not be presented in lectures, which made my learning patterns crumble. The essential information was not present on the slides used in the lecture. There were many concepts I had to teach myself simply because they were either not mentioned in the lectures or not taught to us at all. I really wish I could say this was an enjoyable class, but it was honestly very stressful and confusing. There were too many topics that we did not understand and were not presented to us clearly enough. I am afraid that I am not well-prepared for subsequent pre-med requirement courses.",
    "One of the strengths is that you learn a lot about the topics. A weakness is that at the end, the topics seem to fly by very quickly in class, so they took a lot of review and study outside of class to understand.",
    "Strengths - lectures were very helpful and the workload was quite manageable.",
    "The lecture wasnt engaging",
    "The level of engagement encouraged in lectures was a strength. A weakness was that practice problems done in lecture were not available online for later review after classes.",
    "Strengths: lectures are engaging with demonstrations that illustrate chemical phenomena.\r\nWeaknesses: Technical issues with Sapling made completing assignments difficult.",
    "The strength of the course was the engagement of the teaching fellows. The weakness of the course was that the instructor did not cover the material effectively. The exams tested on material that was not covered in the course.",
    "I found that the lectures were well organized to facilitate a comprehensive understanding. The demonstrations were very helpful. I think some of the in-class calculations could be made clearer.",
    "Sometimes, it is very hard to understand the content of the textbook. If any supporting notes could be posted about the hardest chapters of the textbook, that would be helpful.",
    "One of the strengths of the course was the use of Sapling for practice problems. One of the weaknesses of the course was",
    "Structure\/ reason for the order of the lectures seemed a bit lacking in the last two or three weeks. I wasn't sure how the things we were learning related back or would bridge into anything new, and so I was not very engaged. Section was very useful.",
    "One strength is that the textbook was well utilized and the online problem sets were very informative.",
    "Enrichment was very helpful. Going to both section and enrichment can make a lot of difference in your understanding of the material. Lecture is funny and engaging, but you don't always get everything right away, so it's very helpful going to section and enrichment if you need help to avoid falling behind. Extremely approachable instructors and TFs.",

    "if they need it as a prerequisite",
    "If you have to take Gen Chem then definitely try to take it with Parr!",
    "If you're looking at taking it, it's pretty easy, However, it can be very boring in lecture. But the fifty minute class time and Professor Parr's jokes and style of teaching make it very doable.",
    "No",
    "Yes! If you need it, its good.",
    "Unless it is necessary for pre-med or if they really enjoy chemistry I will not recommend it to another student.",
    "Only if it's a prerequisite.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that needed it as a prerequisite to the major or medical school. I wouldn't tell a student to take it if they didn't need it.",
    "If the other student was pre-med I'd recommend the course because it's mandatory.",
    "only take this course if you have to.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it helped me gain a stronger foundation in chemistry, while learning applications of chemistry as well. Professor Parr and Mioy Huynh are the greatest strengths of this course. They are both amazing at explaining material, and would do anything to make sure that their students understand the topics. I appreciated all the resources available in this class.",
    "It's a good introductory course.",
    "If you need to take gen chem for your major, its not too bad. Otherwise, another class might be more enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The material is fairly engaging and there are many resources to make sure you understand the core concepts.",
    "yes because its introductory level to a lot of things that will be more interesting later on",
    "I would recommend this course, so long as you are comfortable teaching yourself the concepts that your professor glosses over or doesn't teach at all but appear on the exams.",
    "If it is a requirement.",
    "NO. If you don't need this course for your desired path, do not! It'll try to fool you with the name \"General Chemistry\" but this class is not worth it. The TA will only answer yes or no questions and there is no accurate preparatory material for exams. Plus the final is a doozy.",
    "This is a relatively good course for a general requirement. It is not that challenging but incorporated some more interesting applications at the end.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes if it is needed as a requirement",
    "I'd recommend this to another student, sure. Basically anyone who takes this is either considering (1) the chemistry major, (2) going to medical school, or (3) both. For those students, it's not like you have much of a choice, but it's not a bad class.",
    "No. If they can, I would highly recommend trying to move up to a higher level chemistry class.",
    "I would recommend this to any student doing stem as an introductory level course.",
    "Yes I would because this is the best way to get to learn about chemistry. Even if you came in with some background, this class has something to offer everyone. And it was taught in such an interesting engaging way.",
    "Definitely.  If you've ever taken a chemistry class in your life, then this is an absolute gut (but only with Parr, the other Profs are supposedly much more difficult).",
    "Yes, because it fulfills requirements.",
    "If the student was not required to take the course, I would not recommend it. However, it is not a bad class for those who are required to take it.",
    "Definitely. There are many routes to success in this course. Course-based peer tutors and optional but recommended discussion sections mean that you will receive consistent, meaningful support. If you are very familiar with AP Chemistry material, you can succeed simply by reading the book and studying the homework questions on Sapling. Discussion sections are optional but recommended, and homework and reading questions are for a completion grade.",
    "No, don't take this course if you have a hard time managing your time and studying by yourself on your own time.",
    "Absolutely if interested in introductory science and with knowledge of chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student needing to learn the foundations of chemistry.",
    "Yes",
    "Overall, it's a fair course. If your major requires it, most definitely take it. It's not a very well taught course but there are plenty of resources available for you to succeed (go to Mioy is the best advice I could give). It's also not too much work and the psets are completion based.",
    "Bro I lost 3 points on a test because the grader didn't understand my work!!???? The work was clearly written, and it was all there. It's not my fault the grader doesn't understand chemistry enough to follow my train of thought. All the steps were there. This is unfair grading. Did I go back and ask for points back? No, that's a waste of my time. It should have been correct the first time. Next time, make sure the graders know chemistry cause that would help this class a lot....Some of the questions on the tests were unfair and didn't accurately depict what we had learned in the course. For the most part the tests were good but every once in a while, the test makers would throw in some stupid question to prevent every active hard working student from getting a 100%. Like why ask dumb questions about some random side fact in the text book that we covered for 1 question on a homework. Those should either be focused on more if they are going to be on the test or keep those away from the test and add more questions about concepts that we have been dealing with for a while. ...The final said it would be out of 150 but it was actually out of 160 so I don't know if they gave every student 10 bonus points or if they are just making the test a percentage but either way this was dumb because I was expecting the final to be out of 150 for predicting my grade purposes. Class itself was boring. We kind of just went through the text book. I could have just bought the text book and not come to class, but I guess what else is an intro to chem class going to be besides a textbook. ...I wasn't sure if sections were mandatory or not because they didn't have anything about attendance as a grade on the syllabus but at the same time the syllabus said the final would be out of 150 so I couldn't really trust the syllabus. Overall, not much you can do because you probably have to take this class for your major or as a prereq so no point in recommending it.",
    "Yes, the content is interesting and the course and professor are very straightforward and fair.",
    "For the most part, people take this class because it is required for their major. I think the class is straightforward and the material is taught in a clear manner so I don't see why I would not recommend this course to a student who needs to take this class.",
    "Yes, this class is a great class to fulfill the science requirement, and its not too much work.",
    "I would only recommend taking this course if a student has had prior knowledge in general chemistry.",
    "Not particularly except for the fact that it is an intro class to get to other classes.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, as the information should be interesting to everyone, and the workload is manageable, which allows for a good engagement overall. I thoroughly enjoyed the course.",
    "Yes, the professor is really good and engaging",
    "Yes, I thought the material was very interesting!",
    "It is a required course and the material can get dry at times but Dr. Parr and Mioy do their bests to liven up the discussion and provide the most engaging course possible.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially for premed students and anyone wishing to learn science at Yale. Gen Chem reviews a lot of different concepts that are applicable to practically any field of science and helps you understand how the world is built around us. I also recommend students to utilize Professor Parr's office hours, as he is really helpful one-on-one.",
    "I would if you have to take gen chem",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are willing to put in the work to learn general basic chemistry concepts. There will be a lot of reading and self-learning, however if you are comfortable with this, then the course should pose no problem to you.",
    "If you are a premed then I would say just get through it. But if you do not need to take this course then I would not recommend.",
    "Yes, if you need it for a requirement.",
    "I probably would since it is an introductory chemistry class.",
    "Yes, it is interesting.",
    "I would recommend it of you are pre-med or on the science track. Obviously don't take it just for fun. It isn't fun, but it isn't awful. If you're deciding between this course and 163, definitely take this one, it fulfills the same requirement, is much easier, and its important to have a good foundation in the topics covered in this course.",
    "Yes, it is a great lecture course to take that is not too difficult and is prime for learning.",
    "Yes- gives a clear and thorough look at the important aspects of chemistry that will be important moving forward (especially in STEM)",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the material, though self-taught at times, is much simpler than the manner in which it is presented in CHEM 163. The other course seems needlessly difficult, and I would strongly recommend this course over its counterpart. If your background in chemistry is strong, you will breeze through this course. However, this is an opportunity to strengthen your foundations for your future study of chemistry. If you are only taking this semester of chemistry, then this course would also be the better option.",
    "Yes the expectations of the class are clear and pretty easy to meet, and the course material itself is interesting",
    "Great professor, great section leaders.",
    "I actually really enjoyed this course, it wasn't too much work, the lectures were engaging, and the challenge of the psets and exams were reasonable.",
    "Yes, but unless you are actually interested in the subject, don't take it.",
    "Yes. It's a good course to take. It obviously takes care of the pre-med requirement. Between Chem 161 and 163, its better to take if you're not super passionate about Chemistry, want to finish the requirement, or have had no chemistry preparation in the past. You should do well in this course if you pay attention, go to section, and do the homework.",
    "I would recommend this class for a student who had no prior experience in chemistry other than a basic high school course.",
    "Yes because it goes over a lot of general chemistry topics.",
    "I would only if it was a requirement for your major, especially if you are STEM. If one would need it to get a calculations credit then they may not be interested in it.",
    "No. I also dont like chemistry. Besides that, I dont think this class was a great introductory course. I dont think it helped develop my interest for chemistry, if anything it deterred me from wanting to take more chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning chemistry at a basic level and attaining novel knowledge about chemical matters.",
    "No. This course does not help a student learn.",
    "Yes, it was clearly taught and supportive for students' learning",
    "Yes, it provides a very good foundation in chemistry.",
    "If you really like chemistry, then take it. otherwise it can be a little boring",
    "Not unless it's a requirement. So many other science courses that sounds so much more interesting.",
    "I would only recommend this course to people who need it for requirements.",
    "Yes.",
    "Only if you have to take it as a pre-requisite or if you are looking for an easy class",
    "It's required.",
    "If you have to",
    "Yes. For students wanting to pursue pre med this course would be very useful for honing in your chemistry skills",
    "Only if they absolutely love chemistry or if they need it for their major.",
    "Yes I thought it was interesting",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student, as it provides information useful for understanding the atomic structure of life, as well as why some processes in life occur.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course for STEM students.",
    "Definitely it provided a solid base of knowledge.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, if you need a foundation in chemistry because you either have never taken chemistry or have taken very little, this is quite appropriate.",
    "Its a great class to learn the basics of chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course if it is a prereq. I think this class was very hard, but it did help me realize how I learn and how to utilize that.",
    "Yes, this course was a good introduction to topics in chemistry that might be used in a lot of later courses.",
    "This course was a great introduction to Chemistry at Yale, and I look forward to continuing in the next semester.",
    "yes, if you want a general overview of chemistry",
    "Yes if you like chem",
    "Yes, if they are interested in Chemistry and its applications.",
    "If you have an interest in chemistry\/need to take an introductory sequence, yes. Professor Parr made it interesting enough, and the workload was very manageable.",
    "The course is a cornerstone course",
    "Not unless it is required. The subject matter is not incredibly complicated but there are few study resources which makes it difficult to be consistently successful or improve on exams.",
    "Yes, since it is not that hard with interesting topics",
    "If you have to take it take it. The lectures are boring but the pace is okay and the tests are fair to hard.",
    "Only if you really need to take it.",
    "I recommend this course only if it's required to fulfill pre-med requirements or prerequisities for a major.",
    "Yes, I will indeed recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes this course is a good introduction to basic chemistry and the discussion sections and peer tutors help a lot.",
    "Yes because if was well taught and interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning about the basis of science, especially for those who plan to pursue any medicinal studies or science-based careers. I think this class would be beneficial to anyone looking to be pushed in the realm of critical thinking or simply someone who wants a challenge.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student unless required by their major. I think there are many other, more interesting classes to be taken if someone is trying to fulfill a QR or Science credit.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student that is truly dedicated to staying on a pre-med track or any major that requires him to take this class. Do not take it if you're not serious about your major. You will regret it. This class is very very hard and only someone with a really good chemistry background will have a good time.",
    "I would recommend this course to those students interested in chemistry or who need this as a requirement.",
    "Absolutely. This is a great course (even if a requirement for many majors) for any student interested in science. It covers the basics of chemistry in an entertaining fashion and has a very manageable workload.",
    "Its a necessary introduction to chem so I would recommend it.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student because the teacher did a poor job of teaching the material. Additionally, the tests did not match the material presented in class.",
    "Yes, especially someone who has never taken Chemistry or has not studied the subject in English before. Chem 161 is very essential to understand subsequent Chem courses.",
    "Yes. I feel like I was very well supported in my learning even though I didn't know anything about chemistry and really struggled with certain topics (class moves kind of fast for someone who does have much prior knowledge of chemistry). Plenty of office hours with instructors and TFs. Mioy is amazing and so is Hannah, who leads enrichment.",
    "Go for it. It's an intro chem course that's not particularly difficult and the instruction is fantastic. If you're just looking for a Science credit or have a passing interest in Chemistry, I assure you that will regret nothing if you take this course. One thing though, don't buy the text book - you can easily find it, or one of the slightly older editions, online. Parr also uploads all his slides, so if your take notes you'll probably never even need to look at the textbook.",
    "Yes, it helped me have a better understanding of chemistry"
