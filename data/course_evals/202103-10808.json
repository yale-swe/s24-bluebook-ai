I had very little experience with memory studies before this class and I think the combination of place, race, and memory has changed the way that I interact with topics outside of this course.",
                "I learned about memory studies and how place and geography interact, inform, and intersect with school and education. I learned how to apply theories of place and history (including history as collective or traumatic memory) to education. The class also became versed in understanding how education and media shape relation to place and memory. The class included historical background on certain locations and education movements, frameworks to understand theories and critical theories, as well as ways to become stronger at writing about multiple intersecting threads.",
                "An interesting look at place, race, and memory in schools. I think a deeper understanding of the relationship between place and race was my biggest takeaway from the course, and really influenced how I see my own school experiences.",

                "I liked the structure of the course into case studies and how the writing assignments were designed to build on one another.",
                "errol's personality, patience, and care as an instructor made this course fantastic! area of improvement: closer focus \/ guided discussion on the readings (they were not always part of our discussions). errol prioritized small-group over seminar-wide discussions and those were best when we received questions in writing about what to talk about! overall, absolutely wonderful class with an even greater teacher",
                "This class was amazing! I really enjoyed the different activities and we did in class, and I think that Mr. Saunders really modeled the kinds of pedagogy and care that I would want all teachers to show their students.",
                "Even though we only examined 4 geographies, I sometimes felt that we didn't have enough time to fully understand that place before we moved onto the next. For example, I really enjoyed the section of the course that focused on Dine Nation, but because I had very little prior knowledge about Navajo Nation I felt like I was only able to make surface-level observations. I would have enjoyed a little more time spent on each geography even if that meant fewer geographies. Especially because this course criticizes how academic writing is wrongly valued above other ways of knowing, the readings were quite academic. I would have liked more opportunities to learn about place, race, and memory outside of books and academic articles. For instance, some of the reading could have been substituted for videos, stories, artwork, photos, music, etc. \r\n\r\nOften we were assigned a large amount of reading (such as a full book each week) and while they were interesting it was difficult to keep up with that much reading. Mr. Saunders usually cut down the reading by suggesting chapters to read if we were not able to do all of the reading, but that made class discussions awkward because it was unclear what reading expectations were. Sometimes I would do all of the reading and we discussed very little of it in class, and other times when I was able to do less of the reading I felt uncomfortable contributing to class discussions. Often large group discussions were very broad-level, and I would have liked to go into more depth on a smaller amount of reading. Mr. Saunders often apologized when he would talk for longer periods of time but I actually really enjoyed hearing his knowledge and insights! I think having small lecture overviews for each geography could have helped place our discussions into a clearer context. \r\n\r\nI think the best part of the course was the assignments, which gave students the opportunity to learn more about a school geography from their own lives. It did take a very long time to get feedback on assignments and even when we did get feedback it was not very detailed -- I don't think the feedback and evaluation fostered student growth and learning but I do think the assignments themselves were interesting and valuable.",
                "Strengths: the energy of Professor Saunders, the varied ways of interacting with the texts through discussion, visuals, small group talks, mini presentations, close reading. The texts themselves were also a strength of the course as there was a mix of locations, writing styles, and narratives as well as a lot of agency in choosing about which parts to read about for the Chicago guidebook. A strong strength throughout the course was the framework given to ensure that students all knew about the theories and movements encountered in class through discussion and presentation.\r\nWeaknesses: I think one area this course could improve is in feedback, at times it felt as if an assignment were coming up without feedback on earlier writings which sometimes produced hesitancy in the writing process.",
                "It was really great. Professor Saunders is an incredible instructor, and clearly put in an immense amount of work to ensure that the readings, class activities, and assignments were all designed to further our learning.",
                "The discussions and creative post it activities were amazing. The slow timing for feedback on our papers made it really hard to improve my writing.",
                "The first three weeks of this course each introduce the ideas of 'race', 'place' and 'memory'. By introducing and explaining these concepts with sociological and philosophical frameworks, the course sets a foundation for understandings of 'race' 'place' and 'memory' that is then expanded upon over the course of the semester. This common ground helps create class discussions that are focused and productive. The course focuses both on local examples of education, including an optional fieldtrip, but also draws heavily on the environments of Chicago and NYC. The weekly reading responses helped me remain engaged with the course. The course also draws heavily on the idea of 'close-looking', especially in looking at the built environment of architecture and seeing how the physical enacts the ideological.",
                "The course material was interesting and engaging, but the way we conducted class sometimes led to stagnant conversations. Our class was maybe just a little more reserved than what I was used to for seminars at Yale, but I was disappointed often by the discussions we had as a class. Also, we didn't get grades back until almost the end of the semester, which made improvement challenging."

Also, Errol is an amazing instructor and has a pedagogy that is caring, collective, fun and extremely thought-provoking.",
                "Yes! In the class, you're able to explore a really important topic in a lot of depth and put theory into practice in meaningful ways.",
                "yes!! the assignments allowed us to explore our schooling experiences analytically and to apply course concepts in unique ways. there was never an assignment we had to do where we didn't have authority over the topic\/geography and that mattered so much in elevating our learning experience!",
                "Yes! Do it to learn about New Haven, other school geographies, and maybe your home context. The projects you do in the class allow you to really dive deep into one place or look into lots of different ones.",
                "Overall it is an interesting course and I think I learned a lot! It did feel disorganized at times and I think the reading could be paired down. Mr. Saunders is a great and understanding instructor who cares a lot about his students!",
                "I would! The course content is really interesting and provides a new way of viewing education through an introduction to memory studies, collective memory, and theories on place in sociology. The reading load is a bit heavy at times, but manageable with a reading schedule and there are lighter weeks as well.",
                "Yes! I would recommend anything taught by Professor Saunders.",
                "Yes! The idea of memory in education is really interesting.",
                "Yes, this course is essential for any student interested not only in education but also architecture, philosophy, humanities, ER&M, etc. Both the content of this course as well as the way in which it is taught (expanded below) are unique compared to other Yale courses and improve student engagement and learning."
