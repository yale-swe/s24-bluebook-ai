   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course needs to be formatted better and taught without the assumption that students all know the same amount.",
    "Strengths: clear expectations, formulaic structure of psets and class time and tests, Professor Parr's accent\r\nWeaknesses: the material can be a little dull at times and honestly lectures can be a bit useless (like that one time we spent the whole class solving a problem and then got the wrong answer).",
    "I think strengths of this course include less chapters being covered so there was more time to focus on the material as compared to first semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of this course included limited practice tests, limited feedback on exams, and reading questions that didn't really help with my understanding of the material. Additionally, the lectures were no longer recorded so I could go back and view them again before the exams.",
    "I didn't really like how the professor wrote on paper that he then projected on the screen because once he was finished with a topic, it would disappear from the screen because he would be writing the next topic. With the blackboards, the writing stays up there a lot longer and is much easier to follow.",
    "Lectures were sometimes off topic and too focused on the application when the purpose of the course and exams were to fortify concepts and principles of chemistry. Issuing practice problems more akin to the exam would've been helpful in learning how to apply the equations and concepts covered in the course.",
    "- meets often, which facilitates learning. Discussion sections most helpful, head TA very good teacher.\r\n- instructor motivated, though some situations in which the explanation of contents\/the reason for some parts of the lecture were unclear.\r\n- Problem Sets partly odd, did not entirely relate to course material\r\n- In general, well-organized and taught course.",
    "The strength of this course was the amount of helpful chemistry material we got through. However, I wish we could have done more practice problems\/review during class.",
    "The lectures could be a lot to absorb at times. Maybe focusing on three or four key concepts, or difficult ones, and using the lecture to walk through those would be more helpful.",
    "Lecture was not engaging at times. Sometimes, they felt like they were not helpful because Professor Parr would go into detail that was too complex without explaining them fully. In lecture, I was mostly confused, but after reviewing my notes and reading the textbook, the exams came much easier.",
    "Well constructed to help the student get the best grade they can get. Lectures don't really cover enough of the actual material, so you have to rely on reading the book mainly.",
    "Lectures were not too relevant to the course. The textbook was way more helpful.",
    "This course has a lot of interesting material, but information got repeated a lot, especially at the beginning of the semester, and some things were taught too quickly, particularly some of the organic chemistry. There needs to be a mechanism by which students can inform the teacher that he is moving too quickly through something.",
    "The class is structured pretty well and the sections are very useful. Problem sets good for helping understanding and measuring knowledge. Lectures are often boring and don't relate to the reading or testing material very well; went over my head pretty often.",
    "The course felt disorganized and during the organic chemistry section the textbook reading, the practice problems, and the lecture material were completely different things.",
    "Terrible Lectures",
    "Weakness: It's a big lecture class, so there's little individualized attention. The lectures can be dull but they're generally helpful if you pay attention.\r\nStrengths: MIOY. His resources were a life saver. I loved all the practice problems and lecture slides he provided for us. They were so clear and concise.\r\nThe psets were helpful. \r\nThe sections were helpful.",
    "Strength: There are a variety of resources available to help you learn the material (TFs, textbook, Sapling, lecture slides, sections, etc).\r\nWeakness: Assignments and readings were extremely unorganized.  HW problems would be posted the day before they are due, and PSET due dates were inconsistent.  Additionally, towards the end of the course, we flew through so much material, causing everyone to be confused.",
    "I think the greatest weakness is that sometimes professor Parr would cover topics too quickly for the information to really soak in. The way you do well in the course is by reading the textbook.\r\nThe strength is the availability of office hours extra help.",
    "The lectures were very informative, but I do feel like we sped through the content a little too quickly.",
    "There was no structure to the classes\/lecture portion and I felt like it could have been geared more towards what we were actually learning",
    "TA's were great. Wish there were still bonuses on the exams. Also wish the orgo stuff was in the book.",
    "I did not like the teaching of this course the entire semester. I am sure that as an intro class it is meant to be difficult and impersonal connection to the lecturer but I found Dr. Parr to be unnecessarily condescending or sarcastic at times which was very off putting. I am sure that it can be justified being that a good quarter of the class stopped coming to class but that is not a valid reason to invoke such actions to the 3\/4 of the class or at least 50% of the class that was consistently there. Also the TAs this semester clearly couldn't care less if you were in jeopardy of doing poorly for an example. They themselves have often admitted to not knowing what was even going on in the class lectures. I found myself questioning how am I, a first year student with limited STEM experience, suppose to be able to fully comprehend materials that grad students and PhD students in chemistry didn't understand.",
    "I really thought this course was incredible. Lectures were extremely productive, and the practice problems were extremely helpful. I truly feel like I have a strong foundation in a subject I was uncertain about going into the year. I thought it was slightly unfair to take off for incorrect answer attempts in the daily problems. There were times when I was confused about a topic that we would be covering the next day, and it cost me points until I completely finished my progression to the correct answer. It would have also been nice to continue the livestream of the course.",
    "Overall taught very well, but I think it's very hard to explain in depth things in a course with 300 students. Much of instruction got lost in the weeds.",
    "The intro to orgo was super confusing and I think it made half the class get to the point of not caring. If it had been presented better it might have made us more excited to go on in chemistry, but instead it made us all super nervous. Otherwise the lectures were fine.",
    "The TFs and of course Dr. Huynh were amazing  they explained everything that Dr. Parr didnt really make sense of in class. Dr. Parr was good in the beginning until we got to electrochemistry, and from there he went through the lecture materials really quickly, talking the entire time rather than asking for class participation. There were definitely more PollEV questions in the beginning of the course, as well as opportunities for us to ask the TFs questions during lecture. By the end of the course, there werent enough practice problems in the powerpoint\/lecture notes for everyone to stay engaged and know when we didnt really understand a topic. More PollEV\/clicker questions would be very helpful. Also, the Sapling reading quizzes for orgo were unnecessarily brutal.",
    "Taught well, sometimes it moved a little too fast though",
    "Strengths- lectures are great, TFs care, professor cares, lots of care \r\nWeakness- parallel in lecture-textbook-exam",
    "The discussion sections were very helpful in terms of problem solving. Towards the end of the semester when we started organic chemistry, we sped up and covered a lot of new information in a short amount of time where I think everyone was confused on what was going on.",
    "Professor Hyunh was a shinning light in this course and last semester. It was sometimes stressful to be learning in such a large class environment, especially once we embarked in Organic Chemistry. However, even though I had never personally met Professor Hyunh, through his numerous study resources and office hours, I felt supported by an instructor. I think that having him as a resource in a position that is closer to students yet also very much involved in overseeing the course was extremely valuable.",
    "The strength of this course is how closely it follows the textbook and how many resources there are for help, from TA office hours, Parr's office hours, and peer tutoring. If all else fails, you can just read the textbook. The one weakness is the last unit, organic chemistry, which was not pulled from the textbook and seemed to be a random mishmash of topics. It was doable if you had the time to Google literally every topic, but there wasn't as much support for this unit as the others. Also, Mioy Huynh is THE BEST.",
    "Mioy was the strength, besides that the class was disorganized, lectures were disorganized, and there were no practice tests and homeworks were posted last minute without warning making it hard to keep track of.",
    "The lecture was hard to learn from at times. Occasionally, the book did not contain the material that we were learning as well.",
    "bring back the livestream",
    "Lecture was not very useful in learning the topics and there was a lot of importance placed on learning and understanding the material yourself without it having been taught in lecture very thoroughly.",
    "The lectures made me more confused about the topics than when I just read the textbook and did the homework on my own.  I felt that my TFs were better at explaining the material in a way I could understand than Professor Parr.",
    "The class is just too big to establish a good relationship with the professor or easily reach out to ask questions. I wish there were more than one person teaching gen chem to solve this problem.",
    "The pace of the course was reasonable, and the topics often interesting. I also thought that discussion this semester was very helpful. The course might be improved with more practice material available before exams, particularly the final.",
    "Once you really master the concepts and how to do the problems the course remains challenging but in a fun way.",
    "Strength: Mioy. Weakness: everything is taught assuming you already know so much about the material, so if you fall behind on the readings on night and the topic is something you feel you know almost nothing about, going to class is pointless because you'll probably just get more confused.",
    "Most of the material was not covered in depth in class.",
    "The lectures are not very conducive to learning the new material.",
    "Lectures were explained poorly and material was too simplistic and did not stimulate me to think beyond what the textbook literally presents. Tests also fail to properly test the course material but are instead basic algebra chem word problems. Perhaps homework can be thinking-based written problem sets as well as sapling.",
    "The lectures felt, especially near the end of the semester, disconnected from the textbook readings.",
    "I did not like lectures at all. I learned more by looking through Mioy's review notes and practice problems than I ever did going to Professor Parr's lectures. I didn't learn much in my section either. The single strength of this course was Mioy. He is very interested in student learning, and he put a lot of work into making sure that we understood the material.",
    "Going to lecture didn't really do anything for me, but because of that, I had to push myself to study harder to understand all the concepts. For some reason, it's like the lectures make it harder to learn the content because of everything that's thrown in. All that really needs to happen during lecture is the teaching of a concept and an example of the concept being put into place. The idea that so many different scenarios and practice problems were being done during lecture and I came out of it not knowing what even the original concept was was a very inefficient use of my time.",
    "The strengths of this course was that Mioy was a great resource in helping with questions, holding review sessions, and explaining subjects that were not clearly explained in class. The weakness of this course is that the professor mainly used examples from the book in class, and doesn't quite explain the concepts before delving into the examples.",
    "The course was not very interactive and most times lectures were boring and did not strictly follow the textbook as was expected.\r\nThere was also no review sessions for the final exam.",
    "The teaching was bad. I never learned anything in lecture. Lecture should be worked on.",
    "The lectures were not very helpful. They were very jumbled and the material needs to be covered in more detail rather than just trying to get through so much information in such a short amount of time.",
    "I thought the discussion sections were helpful and the course did a good job of covering a lot of material. Sometimes the lectures weren't very engaging, and the professor would just do one example problem for the entire period. I did not think the example problems we did, or the format we did them in, were helpful.",
    "The tests were good and the homeworks and psets were doable",
    "- really big lecture\r\n- I was really close with my TF who helped me a lot",
    "The course was effective in teaching the concepts of inorganic chemistry. I do think it could have been more engaging.",
    "This course is straightforward and tested fairly, and it is difficult to improve the rather dry material.",
    "Lectures could be better dedicated to material that will be covered on the midterms and final. Office hours and help that is available could be better announced to students. Weekly reading questions and sapling assignments should be posted every Friday evening, so that students can get a head start on assignments instead of wondering when they will be posted. Overall, the weekly reading quizzes and saplings were very beneficial in helping us learn the material and preparing for the exams. Also reading schedules really helped me stay on track and not fall behind with the material.",
    "lectures were very good and informative although discussion sections were heavily relied on as well. both were taught well. I really appreciate the three midterm system where one can be dropped, this definitely enhanced my learning.",
    "Strengths: mioy huynh thats it.  Weaknesses: extremely not engaging lectures.  Focusing on deriving equations instead of actual content.  The orgo content makes no sense for this course and is not in the book and glossed over in class.",
    "Strengths: Mioy Huynh is an excellent TA and lecturer, his explanations, reviews, and discussion sections were extremely beneficial to my development and performance in the course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Oftentimes, the professor would incorporate external ideas into his lectures. Although this can be interesting and engaging, the excessive focus on real world applications hindered learning of the core concepts that we would be tested on.",
    "The strength of this course was Mioy. Dr. Parr found interesting information to give us during lecture, but it didn't always seem relevant to what we were supposed to be learning out of the textbook. Mioy really helped us learn the material in a more understanding way.",
    "Lecture is not   very helpful  for learning  the material",
    "The class is pretty unengaging although that could be due to the massive class size. The second semester of general chemistry is much more poorly organized than the first.",
    "Strength: Great TAs who genuinely know how to teach and genuinely care about their students. (Arjun is the goat and Mioy and Max are legends)\r\n\r\nWeakness: Lectures were generally un-engaging and not very helpful. We we were rarely informed when new homework was posted so it was very common for people to miss the reading the questions because they'd be posted at the strangest times.",
    "Just challenging enough, not to the point where it felt impossible. Information is not that interesting. It would be best if the reading questions were all posted at the start of the week, since a lot of the times they would only be available after 6pm the day before they were due which was inconvenient if I had time to do it before then.",
    "The problem sets and homework assignments are appropriately challenging and relevant to the course.  This course has many weaknesses. First, it is unclear what is expected of the students to learn.  The lectures are useless, and though I attended all of them, I believe that one may have a better chance at succeeding if they were to spend that 50 minutes studying elsewhere.  Lastly, the textbook literally does not contain an entire unit what the students are expected to learn making it necessary for us to seek additional help or rely on the incoherent lectures.",
    "orgo unit was not taught as well as the others",
    "I found the tri-weekly reading questions very helpful for evaluating learning progress, since it was a regular way to check that I understood the content (and if not, I could seek office hours) without being too much of a homework load. The weekly problem sets were also good, but the issue with using Sapling is that sometimes the problem sets do cover things that are not related to what we are doing in class.",
    "have the final midterm retain info from textbook and not purely from the lecture. Makes it more difficult to study as the professor is not necessarily the best lecturer.",
    "I felt as though this class was not taught well at all. I left the lectures rather confused most of the time. I also believe that it was hard to get help from the professor himself.",
    "The course was well taught but I feel that the timing of the topics could be changed. We spent a lot of time on kinetics and not enough on acid-base so I feel that the next time this course is taught, the duration of time spent on certain topics should change.",
    "The lecture was usually not very helpful in terms of knowing what to prep for in the exam. The organic chemistry unit was more difficult than necessary to navigate because the textbook also didn't cover anything we needed to know.",
    "I think the course is pretty good.  Maybe it could be improved if section was mandatory.  Also if the  due dates for sapling were better outlined.",
    "Strength is that the pace of this class was perfectnot too fast and not too slow. A weakness is that the lectures did not really help with covering the content.",
    "One strength was that Mioy is an amazing teacher and go to his TF hours. Another strength was that every class the teacher would do an experiment, which was interesting to watch and learn about. A weakness was that the in class time was sort of vague and did not prepare you that well for the tests.",
    "Discussion section was helpful, but not lectures",
    "Felt like we skipped around alot; I guess thats the point of gen chem.",
    "The lecture is really ineffective at educating students since it is very easy to disengage with the class. Office hours slightly made up for it but not enough to improve overall learning.",
    "Lecture was not as informative as I would've expected. I gained my knowledge through the textbook and Mioy's review sessions\/ office hours.",
    "Parr just isn't a very good lecturer. It is hard to engage with his style of teaching, and the occasional questions asked with classroom polling weren't helpful. He seemed to emphasize a lot more tangential information while skipping the basic premise of what he was teaching, each unit.",
    "A great feature of this class is that your lowest exam score is dropped.",
    "It could use a lot more provided resources that could be used outside of class in order to grasp and practice new skills",
    "Lectures were not as helpful as discussion sections.  More practice on problems during lecture.",
    "The lectures were very clear and the TAs were super helpful. Also, the homework assignments helped make sure we understood the topics.",
    "Exams were fair. Lectures often unhelpful",
    "Discussion sections were really helpful in reviewing the material covered during the week, but I didn't feel like lectures were always very helpful. It would also be great if for the last unit, there was assigned reading the was more related to the material covered. Also, sometimes the Sapling mini PSETS wouldn't be available til quite close to class, so if they were available right when the class before ended, that would be helpful.",
    "Mioy is the best part! Amazing teacher",
    "The strengths of this course are the teaching fellows and the course content. I thought the content was engaging and when I struggled, the teaching fellows were very available to help me out. The main weaknesses of this course are the lectures. Often the lectures were not very engaging and left me more confused rather than clarifying topics.",
    "Strengths: \r\n- Gave a general overview of chemistry topics\r\n- Teaching fellows were readily available and addressed concerns well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Course material was taught almost directly from the textbook, topics had little to no connection with one another\r\n- Lectures were disorganized and had little engagement\r\n- Exams were badly written and not reflective of the practice problem sets\r\n- The third \"midterm\" was given mere weeks before the final, which makes no sense",
    "Mioy really helped clarifying the course material. Could be confusing and hard to follow in lecture.",
    "The workload is not a lot and the class is generally laidback but Parrs lectures are almost unnecessary.",
    "I think the class size is a limitation of how much can be accomplished during lecture",
    "Great content\r\nPoorly taught in lecture",
    "Lectures did not seem very relevant to information on the exam, so it did not seem worth it to attend lecture. However office hours are very helpful and the subject is interesting. The course is also a lot easier if you read the textbook before lecture!",
    "It is a lecture so barely anything is actually learned during that time. It goes too much in depth and doesnt reflect what is actually taught. The strengths are the discussion sections (if you get a good TF) and MIOY.",
    "The lecture was very hard to follow and dull at times. It would be better if it was clearly organized and broken up with practice problems and demonstrations like first semester. Parr was interesting to listen to and Mioy was very helpful. My teaching assistant, Arjun, was exceptionally helpful and availible to students.",
    "Super nice teacher. Moves really fast through the material.",
    "I think the lectures were somewhat boring and did not really contribute to learning. The book was good though.",
    "Strengths- Straightforward, Help was very accessible,  Professor was passionate about teaching, good demonstrations\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - disorganized at times",
    "Strengths: knowledgable teachers and pleasant classroom. Interesting content with a good textbook.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It took me a long time to figure out the correct way to simply answer the types of problems that would come up in certain units. Had I known sooner, I would have been better off, but it was difficult initially to learn.",
    "Well organized lectures and helpful online practice questions",
    "It could be structured like bio on regards with a chem enrichment section",
    "Felt like the tests were harder than the practice\/hw questions",
    "Strengths: Dr. Parr includes a lot of background information which makes chemistry interesting and puts it into perspective with the rest of education. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The homework was often posted very shortly before class. I would check for homework in advance, not see any, and later find out it was posted the afternoon before class.",
    "I like how discussion sections were a crash course for that week's lecture material, definitely helped me feel caught up. \r\nI hated that lectures were not recorded -- I don't know why they changed this.",
    "The majority of this class needed to be learned through the help of the textbook or TAs. I wish that lecture had done a better job at actualy walking through concepts rather than examples.",
    "The course is fairly easy, and the homework assignments only take an hour or two every week. The course would be more interesting if more examples\/applications of the concepts were given. During the organic chemistry unit Professor Parr provided more examples, and that unit was accordingly the most interesting. A strength of this course is the assistant professor, Mioy Huynh.",
    "The main weakness of this course is that the lectures are useless. Everything can be learned in the book, and the discussion sections are WAY more useful because you can do problems and receive real-time feedback. The whole flipped model this course uses (ie. read the material at home, do practice problems in class w\/some explanations) doesn't really work. In terms of strengths, the discussion sections are extremely useful, but again this is dependent upon the TA. There's also a lot of resources available outside of class (ie. practice questions, tutors, etc...), which is nice.",
    "Strengths: Really strong TF support (especially from Mioy Huynh!), straightforward lectures with examples that were very reflective of the skills evaluated on exams, clear and concise\r\nWeaknesses: Parr's handwriting was sometimes tough to read and this matters because although he does use slides, he often writes down extra (very helpful) notes that are projected onto the screen during his lectures and NOT saved onto those slides that he posts onto Canvas. This made the organic chem unit very tough because his slides often correspond with textbook material, and most of the organic chem unit was NOT from the textbook.",
    "Strengths: The class is very structured, homework and test questions were fair\r\nWeaknesses: practice problems for the test were not helpful, class is not very engaging",
    "A lot of content we needed to know was not in the textbook which was very disheartening. A lot of times, I felt as if missing lectures and teaching myself content was more productive. Also, discussion sections were pretty much the place where I learnt a lot.",
    "Better lectures that reflect textbook readings better.",
    "Structured poorly- not aligned with text book readings",
    "The lectures are taught really well and the lecture notes are made accessible so we can use them to study. Also, the course is well structured so you are tested on things gradually and get a lot of practice from the online Sapling problems. However, sometimes, the Sapling problems can be tedious or not pertain to what we are expected to know for the exams.",
    "Much of the content was left for the students to learn by themselves. The exams were straightforwards, but we had to teach the material to ourselves. The last section of the class - organic chem and transition metals - was absolutely horrible, because the professor barely taught any of the content, and the content wasn't in the book either. I asked the TA how to study when the material wasn't taught in class or in the textbook, and he told me I'd just have to Google information. Professors shouldn't leave the material up to Google - how much would we be expected to know?",
    "This course was an absolute mess. The professor never posted everything on time, and lectured about things completely unrelated to the subject being taught",
    "Strengths: Material can be interesting if you take the time, as a prerequisite some of the concepts have been helpful for me in other classes, such as environmental engineering.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were at times interesting but not particularly organized or helpful, the documents were posted but also not particularly useful. Section was  hit or miss and was often not very helpful, though moreso than lecture most times. The Sapling homeworks and problem sets were often annoying because there is no notification on Canvas for them and aren't announced explicitly so you need to constantly log on and check if there is a problem set, and there is also no partial credit for turning it in a day late, which is a change from last semester and caused many people to get zeros on problem sets that are worth a lot of points because they either didn't know it was due or hoped to finish the next day for partial credit. The in-class polling wasn't too helpful but talking through the problem was. There is also no really good mechanism of feedback aside from with the online homework because of how impersonal the large lecture is, the way the assignments are structured, how poorly section can be run, etc.",
    "The strength of the course is section. Section packs all of the formulas and information that you really need to know into a quick 50-minute session, once a week. It saved me. And the TAs are pretty knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The Sapling problem sets and practice problems are also a strength. They were probably the most helpful resource and learning tool for me. The lectures were pretty useless for me; they could be improved by focusing more on the formulas and number manipulation that we really need to know. The exams were graded leniently, and I liked the combination of multiple choice and free response. But I hated the bigness of the class--it was really easy to fall through the cracks and never be noticed, even if you did go to lecture. It would be great if this class could be broken up into smaller lecture groups.",
    "The organic chemistry was zoomed through and often not even gone over in lecture. Having the reading questions and problem sets on Sapling was incredibly useful for the feedback and review for exams.",
    "Discussion sections and review sessions were very helpful in reinforcing the material. However, lectures\/lecture slides could be more organized to facilitate learning.",
    "strengths: fair midterm exam policy, good textbook, demos in lecture, helpful discussion sections\/good TA's, good division of the information into units\/midterms\r\nweaknesses: lecture wasn't very helpful -- a lot of time often got spent on one problem or on a technical difficulty so I found it more helpful to read and take my own notes and go to section",
    "The course is very confusing. Many material was tested on in homework before it was learned.",
    "I liked not having quizzes during sections, because it made it easier to focus on trying to learn the material. I think the Sapling reading quizzes should be made so you can have unlimited attempts without losing points, since we haven't reviewed that material yet in class.",
    "Weaknesses are that some TAs are much better than others",
    "I think it is very difficult to understand everything from the textbook and the lectures alone. I think an improvement from general chemistry 161 was that the problem sets gave you unlimited tries, so you could truly see what was wrong with your answer and work through it. Another strength of this course, in my opinion, is the discussion sections. If not for meeting with my Teaching Fellow every week after each set of lectures, I would not have understood anything that is going on in class. It might be a reality of having a 300 person class, but I felt sometimes the lecture was teaching at a higher level than the textbook, so even if you read the textbook you would be lost. In addition, we went over a lot of things in class that weren't necessarily pertinent and were not needed for the exam. I also believe it is especially hard if you haven't been exposed to the material beforehand. In terms of how it could be improved, I believe making the lectures easier to follow by avoiding leaps in logic one wouldn't know without already knowing the subject and making the lectures more engaging would make it much better."

    "Nah fam",
    "Just take if you have to.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as I found it to be quite interesting. I would say though that the student should be prepared for a not completely well organized class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who was interested in a STEM major, but I would not recommend it to someone who was a humanities student and just wanted to take a chemistry class for fun.",
    "I'd recommend it only if its required for your major.",
    "Yes if you are interested in the subject because it gives a basic overview of the subject and has a medium workload.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any pre-medical student or chemistry major.",
    "I recommend this course to those who want to challenge themselves. It is not easy, but the content is interesting and is a basis for everything surrounding us.",
    "I would recommend it only if you HAD to take it. Definitely not a class that people would take for fun. That being said, it is extremely fair and rewards hard work. Dr. Parr and Mioy are a blast and hilarious in their own ways. Dr. Parr, especially, has a dry, English sarcasm that spices up each and every lecture. Even though the material was not fascinating in the slightest (and at times I could tell that the instructors felt that way too), they truly tried their hardest to entertain us and teach us at the same time. For a general chemistry course, it was pretty enjoyable.",
    "Well, chances are if you are reading this is that this course is required for you. It'll be fine.",
    "Absolutely not",
    "It's a prerequisite, so yes.",
    "Not unless you're premed or a chem major.",
    "I would recommend this course if the student likes chemistry or needs it as a pre-requisite; while it can be interesting at times, if the student doesn't have some enthusiasm for the material, they will find it hard to stay invested.",
    "Only if necessary for a major requirement. It'll teach you what you need to know but it requires some self-learning and isn't a very stimulating subject.",
    "Yes because it is an important prerequisite but not because it was a good course",
    "If it's a requirement, sure. Otherwise, no. Find more engaging science classes to take please.",
    "Most people need to take this for a requirement so I guess yes.",
    "No. Unless they're required to take it for a major or the pre-med track, I don't see why anyone would willingly take this class.",
    "I think the course was well taught, but I feel like if you don't have to take it for a requirement, don't take it.",
    "Only if they have to take it",
    "Yeah, it was a pretty good course. Make friends with the TA's (Mioy Huynh)",
    "make sure that it is required for you to take it, otherwise do yourself a favor and get a science credit elsewhere",
    "Absolutely! I entered this course nervous about studying chemistry and left it feeling confident about my foundation in the subject. Even better, I feel like I can apply the knowledge I learned to newer areas of chemistry.",
    "Only if they have to take it for requirements",
    "No, but you probably have to take it. It wasn't super engaging and it was difficult in a frustrating way. But it was fair, and that's all you can really ask for in a gen chem class.",
    "I mean, it's literally what it is - general chemistry. You can probably learn everything by the textbook and going to discussion section rather than going to lecture. It's not too stressful - there's a consistent workload of Sapling PSETs, readings, and a few Sapling questions due every morning before lecture. The hour tests are fair and straightforward and not tricky\/complex as in fall semester Gen Chem. It's not a bad course, just not extremely interesting. For pre-meds, it's what you gotta do. I've felt quite neutral about this class.",
    "yes if its a requirement",
    "Definitely, even if not premed, professor is engaging, actually cares about lecture",
    "Not really. It is a required class for many majors but it will not spark an interest in Chemistry, though Professor Parr tries his best.",
    "If you had to take the gen chem sequence, it's not bad. Wouldn't take it just for fun though",
    "I honestly liked this class a lot. It's very doable if you put in like, one hour per week outside of class (not counting the psets, which are graded on completion by the way). None of the topics are very hard, and the class is well-paced. Definitely take 161\/165 as opposed to 163\/167 because you will have a much better time.",
    "yep, if they like chem.",
    "I gained an incredible amount of chemistry knowledge over the course of the semester, but it was not an easy class, so I would recommend it only to people willing to work to learn.",
    "I would only recommend this if you need it. I would recommend this over 167 though.",
    "Yes, but only because it is a pre-req.",
    "I only took this class because it was a requirement for my major.  I would not have taken it or recommend taking it if it is not a requirement for something else.",
    "It was alright. The information learned is important",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it includes the basics of general chemistry foundational to many science courses in the future.",
    "Not unless needed as a prerequisite.",
    "If someone had an interest in chemistry or other sciences for which it would be helpful, I would recommend it.",
    "if required.",
    "Yes! I'm MCDB, and this was required for me, but if you're in any science-related field or want to understand how stuff works I would take!",
    "If you are pre-med or this is a requirement for your major then of course take the course, but if you are doing this just because I would urge you to find another science class.",
    "No, unless it is a requirement.",
    "No, don't take this unless you need to.",
    "No",
    "Probably not",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to another student unless it is a requirement. It was not particularly enjoyable, and it seemed to be more challenging than it really needed to be.",
    "Only if it is required",
    "I would not really recommend this course to another student unless they were taking it to satisfy a requirement. The subject material is interesting, but it is taught in a very dry manner without much engagement from the student or teacher.",
    "It depends, if the student really loves chemistry then yes.",
    "I would not.",
    "Not unless you have to take it. It is required for pre-med so take it as a freshman if you have any intention of doing premed. that being said the course is neither fun or super interesting. it is difficult to follow and you have to do a lot of learning on your own. the p sets and pre class questions can be tedious and not super helpful. The key is to getting a good TA. it will make all the difference in the world.",
    "No, not unless they need it. It's not interesting enough or good enough to justify taking it unless it's required for your major. The chemistry won't help you later in life unless you enter a field devoted to it.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "As a pre-req, yes",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who likes science.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if it's a requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it can help you gain a solid understanding of general chemistry whether you've never taken chemistry before, or you've taken a year of high school chemistry or if you took AP Chemistry and struggled. Also, reading quizzes, saplings and organized schedule on the syllabus helps students stay on track on the material unlike other courses that are less organized.",
    "yes only since I enjoyed the material. many others found this class very challenging since the lectures do not match what is being tested.",
    "Nope. Only if required. Poorly taught",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because a basic knowledge of chemistry is intrinsic to an education.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is a different atmosphere to the first semester of general chemistry. It's fewer people, so it feels a little more personal. Also, you get to further your knowledge of chemistry.",
    "Yes, if they need to take it.",
    "Honestly not really. If you have the chance to test into freshman Orgo do it.",
    "If they like chemistry I would recommend it but if not, it is not like someone who doesn't care about chemistry would enjoy this course.",
    "good course, parr goes a little fast but all and all he is a good lecturer",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I think that if there is interest in general chemistry, one should attempt self-teaching. Otherwise, this course will demand much time outside of class to understand even the simplest of concepts.",
    "Yes; if you need to take a second semester of chem but aren't that interested in inorganic chemistry (as was my case), I say do not hesitate to drop down from 167 to 165 (as I did), it will make your life much easier and you will still have an enjoyable time particularly if Professor Parr is teaching because he does put in the extra effort to make lecture interesting and shows us cool things that are related to but not limited to the core material of the class.",
    "Yes, but only because it's a prereq for so many majors.",
    "no, unless ur a STEM\/pre med major. There are other ways to get QR credits",
    "I would not really recommend this course to another student because I feel as though it is not worth the stress and bad grades.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Dr. Parr was a great teacher and I learned a lot. Dr. Mioy was also a really great teacher and he made the course so much better. He has this online website that was really helpful.",
    "Only for a prerequisite",
    "Yes, it really drives home the basics of chemistry.  Gives students a solid background to move forward with.",
    "I would recommend it to another student who wants a chemistry course that is manageable with other difficult classes or one that gives an introduction to organic chemistry.",
    "I would recommend if you like chemistry or are trying to fulfill premed requirements.",
    "Premed requirement.",
    "It'll help understand basic chemistry better, but it will be painful.",
    "It is a premed requirement so many people take it, but it is a pretty dull introductory class.",
    "Yes. It is a challenging but rewarding course.",
    "Ehhh. Im neutral. You will definitely learn a lot but you may not have the best experience int egards to feeling fulfilled and\/or actually enjoying the course",
    "Yes, if necessary. Better than many think it is.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. It was very interesting and a good introduction to inorganic and organic chemistry.",
    "For a general understanding of chemistry, yes.",
    "Yes its mandatory a lot of times but yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I think it covers very important basics in chemistry. Though I think the lectures could have been more helpful, the content was interesting and many resources were available to improve my scores.",
    "No, the organization of this course was pretty terrible. People take this course only because it is a requirement.",
    "No, not unless they had to.",
    "I would recommend it if its required or just for a science credit.",
    "It is general chemistry, take it if you have too. That being said it was not a bad class and I enjoyed the second semester than the first semester. Professor Parr was really cool and I thought his teaching style was conducive to learning.",
    "Yes. Content is important for science majors.",
    "Not really unless it's a requirement, lectures weren't great and there wasn't a ton of accessible support.",
    "If it is required.",
    "Yes, this is a relatively painless way to learn a lot about chemistry.",
    "I would only take this course if you are very interested in chemistry, or it's a required prerequisite like it is for most of the students there.",
    "No, dont take it unless you have to.",
    "Yes, as it is a prereq to organic chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this to people who require a good background of general chemistry. It gives a good base understanding of chemical concepts",
    "You gotta take it if you are pre med or chem, so go for it. If you are interested in chemistry, I'd still say it'd be good to take. It's just not the best course ever.",
    "Yes! Well taught and engaging",
    "Yes but be prepared to study and learn on your own with lots of help from TAs and tutors",
    "Yes to meet pre med requirements",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who needed it as a pre-requisite, but I would not recommend it to someone if they wanted to take it for fun.",
    "It wasn't the best class ever, but it wasn't the worst either -- very meh. You probably have to take it for some requirement so it doesn't really matter; most people don't take this class for fun. For what it is, it could have been much much worse, and I'm grateful for that.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who had little to no background in chemistry beyond the first semester 131 course.",
    "It's an intro course, so take it if you're interested in STEM. It does ultimately provide a decent foundation for chemistry, especially if your high school experience with the subject is limited (as mine was), and I would recommend it over 167 as it is less work and ultimately more directly related to chemistry foundations. I would not, however, recommend this course to a non-STEM student who is looking to take a science class. The material is not super interesting and it's not taught particularly well.",
    "Yes, especially if you need to take it. Parr's a decent lecturer and the TFs are nothing but helpful. The content is also generally interesting as is, and Parr does a great job of connecting it to real-world examples that make theory relevant to current issues (such as the chemistry of the Flint water crisis).",
    "If you have to take it, then you have to take it. Make sure to go to Mioy (one of the TAs) or a peer tutor\/TA for help--he is the only reason I genuinely grew to understand a lot of the more challenging topics. I think it is beneficial for most (if not all students) to receive some sort of outside help, and I think I overlooked that to start because I assumed the class would be really easy. It is not that easy, and a lot of the topics learned in this installment of Intro Chemistry are not ones learned that in depth in high school (unless you did AP Chem). You are not in the minority if you feel like you have to get help, and you won't regret getting help in the long run!",
    "I wouldn't recommend it unless you love chemistry or need it for a requirement, the class is a bit of a drag",
    "You're probably required to take this course so you should take it. It's not that bad.",
    "Neutral.",
    "Not if they dont have to take it. Unorganized and hard to follow.",
    "Yes, most people who take this class have to for premed or their major, but otherwise, it's just interesting and well taught.",
    "This class is yet another one that should really only be taken if necessary for pre-med or major requirements. It wasn't very interesting, and the professor constantly glazed over the material, so you had to teach yourself nearly everything.",
    "The course is fine, but lectures were a complete waste of time. I learned the material by doing the homework.",
    "Only really if it's a prerequisite. I think there are many other science courses someone could take if they were interested in learning about science or chemistry, but this is not really the best course for that purpose.",
    "No. The course is run annoyingly, and the topics were not at all interesting to me. There are too many people in this class. The class was not at all intellectually fulfilling for me. The exams are in giant auditoriums, and they suck. Parr is always very concerned about cheating. The lectures were boring, and people made section more stressful than in needed to be. Everybody complains about this class. Only take this if it's a requirement for you. If it is, don't worry: it's not a very hard class.",
    "Yes, as a background in chemistry it was very useful.",
    "I would recommend this course if needed to complete as a requirement, but otherwise it was not very interesting for someone looking for a science credit.",
    "This course goes into a lot of depth and requires a lot of work that I just don't think a lot of students would do unless it was required for their major\/pre-professional track.",
    "if you're not interested in stem, dont take this course.",
    "If you must take it, take it. If not, run.",
    "Yes, if you have to take it as a requirement. Dr. Parr is a pretty good instructor, and the tests were not unfairly challenging.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student if they were interested in the subject.",
    "It's an ok class. Much better than first semester chemistry",
    "I would only recommend this course if you need it for your major. It is not necessarily a fun chemistry class, but it does do a great job of covering all the basics you will need later in your STEM career."
