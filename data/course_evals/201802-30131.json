    "Much more ease using French in real, everyday settings. My accent improved a lot, mostly in the form of speaking more fluidly and with \"real French\" filler words and sounds, instead of \"um.\"",
    "In short, I became fluent in French.",
    "I greatly improved my French speaking skills and comprehension. I learned a lot more about French culture and history through the class trips and class readings.",
    "I gained confidence in my spoken and written French.",
    "An immersion into French culture and French language - a summer adventure!",
    "I advanced by leaps and bounds in my fluency speaking and conversating in French, being able to analyze literature and events while being immersed in Paris.",
    "I learned how to speak French in an everyday context",
    "Greatly improved my speaking and reading skills in French.",
    "I improved my speaking and listening skills, as well as became more comfortable reading literary texts in French and analyzing them.",
    "Throughout this course I not only gained the ability to hold fluent conversations in french but also comprehend everyday spoken french in a more realistic setting that the more formal conversations held in the classroom."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: the fact that it's in Paris, intensive grammar work to fine tune things, good and appropriately challenging reading list, really thorough and helpful feedback on writing assignments, Prof Sherak. Weaknesses: this program was WAY too insular for me--I wish I had done my research more before signing up. It felt stupid to take a language pledge to only speak French, but then be surrounded by only Americans. I had to make a super concerted effort to speak to actual French people. There was also a truly crushing amount of work at times, which I was surprised by. They kept telling us to go out and explore Paris, but I remember one night I had literally 8 hours of homework. But then the last week of class was super light? I think it could thus be improved by better pacing, and perhaps a less crushing workload each night. It felt like too much each night, so I could never really hone in on one specific thing and REALLY learn it.",
    "The best part of this course is the location, there is no better place to learn French than Paris. I liked that class was in the morning, freeing up the entire afternoon to explore the city. Like the course at Yale, it is a seminar-style setup that encourages you to participate and get to know your professor and peers.",
    "Strengths: lots of activities, engaging, interesting, prof was nice\r\nWeaknesses: lots of work, class time and location was inconvenient",
    "A lot of material in a very very short amount of time, but fantastic immersion experience",
    "The plus of this course is that you are immersed in a French speaking country and are given ample opportunities to speak in class and practice your skills. A weakness of the course is that there's a fine balance between having enough work to merit receiving a credit and being able to immerse yourself in the French culture. I found myself many nights having to stay up late doing homework assignments as opposed to being able to explore the city as much as I would have liked. Also because the language pledge wasn't as enforced I felt like I didn't grow as far as I could have if it were truly enforced somehow.",
    "Weaknesses: long classes three times a week, graded much too harshly, disheartening",
    "The course is almost perfect, maybe altering the reading list might help. Also, going somewhere else than Arles in the south of France.",
    "Great choices of texts, and loved how we discussed our experiences in Paris and how they tied in with what we were learning. Workload is very heavy though, which made it difficult to have time to explore all of Paris.",
    "I loved that this course gave students the ability to spend time in the classroom but also explore the city of France. One weakness was that I felt sometimes the workload took away from exploring the city because I would have to stay in and work."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would, but with some caveats. The main thing for me was how insular the program was. You will NOT meet French students through the program, unless you make that a goal on your own. Also, your experience really depends on your host family and the other kids in your class\/how much they want to all hang out as a group vs. do stuff on their own. If I could do it over again, I probably would have directly enrolled in a French university, but it took going to France to realize that I wanted something more immersive and challenging in that way.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this program to any Yale French student. The course is very fast paced, with a decent amount of homework every night, but it is worth it.",
    "I highly recommend if you want to finally master grammar and move on to French literature",
    "Yes, it was amazing",
    "YES YES YES!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, there comes a point in language-learning that immersion is truly what can set you on a path to truly learning a language outside of the textbook and grammar rules. It's a wonderful, definitely challenging but worth-it experience.",
    "No, you dont learn much more French and the grading is very stressful.",
    "Yes, especially with Mme. Sherak.",
    "Yes! Taking this course especially in the context of Paris is an amazing experience - you learn so much about French culture and society in class and out.",
    "Yes definitely. My french improved greatly and I met amazing other students."
