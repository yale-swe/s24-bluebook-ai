                "The course served perfectly to introduce me to Italian culture, history and literature. As a history major, I learned so much about Tuscany's rich art history and was able to draw parallels from the past to explain the current situation.",
                "A very general overview of the history, art, and literature of Italy (focusing on Tuscany) from the late middle-ages to the present. A gentle introduction to what I imagine would be L5-level writing and presenting in Italian.",

                "No weaknesses! Simona is incredible.",
                "Strength: Simona is an excellent prof, incredibly clear.  The language she uses with students is simple enough to be easily understood and yet challenging enough that you will learn more Italian by listening to her.  When the readings were difficult she did a great job helping us through it.  A lot of the city and museum visits were cool.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the museum visits ran a little long, especially difficult when a lot of the buildings were not air conditioned.  I think the course could have benefited from a little more discussion of the Italian language and how it is a product of Tuscany (which I really wanted to learn about as someone with an amateur passion for linguistics).  A lecture on that can be swapped in place of the second visit to Lo Spedale or the synagogue in Siena.",
                "There are a lot of class visits which I loved and think helped a lot.",
                "very engaging class",
                "The biggest strength is Simona and her in depth understanding of all the content. However there are a few important improvements that could be made. First, all of the guided tours are in Italian. I understand that this is necessary, but everyone I spoke to in the class was lost for many of the tours. Thus we stood there not understanding anything and wanting to know about the places we were at. It would be much better if Simona or someone with an understanding of learning the language would give us the tours, so they could teach us rather than talk at us. Would also be helpful to get info prior to the excursions so we can know the vocabulary. \r\nSecondly, I would love to see more diversity in what we learn. We learned a lot of history and literature, but not a lot of culture. I would like to see more information about music, more modern art, and theater.",
                "It was interesting because we went on many field trips and Simona was always great at explaining the content. It was an opportunity to learn about Italy interactively.",
                "Everything was great. However I didnt get as much out of the guided tours as I could because there would often be complex vocab that we had not learned before. Perhaps learning some of this vocab (e.g. things related to religious iconography, parts of a building) before the tours would be beneficial.",
                "Much of the course involved going on very engaging field trips around Siena and Italy broadly. I loved the weekly critical reflections as a way to keep up with the content we learned and give your opinion. Class discussions also flowed amazingly and supplemented our Italian learning as well as deep reflections on texts we read or places we visited. I would have liked to read more Dante and focus more on the humanist writers, however, with so much to learn elsewhere and outside of class in a beautiful country like Italy, it was a very fair sacrifice.",
                "Only weakness I would mention is that I don't think the readings were as well-utilized in class as they could have been. It often seemed like the readings were only there to check if we did the readings. Everything else was a strength.",
                "This course is great. Simona chooses readings and lessons wonderfully, and I feel like we were able to get a pretty good understanding of the most important literature and art from Italy, and the cultural forces behind its creation. Field trips helped deepen understanding and I enjoyed the selected films. The course being conducted in Italian helped with my Italian language skills, and I thought the assignments were fair and the workload was very manageable. Sometimes the tour guides during field trips were very hard to understand, whether that be because of the speed at which they spoke or the use of unknown vocab words. I think it could be helpful if students are given a list of words that might be helpful to know for the trip. The tours that Simona conducted were very understandable and I learned so much interesting history from her.",
                "I enjoyed the exploratory part of the course and visiting different monuments and towns. While understanding the tour guides was a little difficult in the beginning, I do believe that it helped us improve our abilities to listen and understand when locals would speak to us. The text that we read in class was difficult to understand, but I believe that the discussion that occurred in class helped break down and simplify the motives of the writers.",
                "The course immerses students in Tuscan culture and history. The course could be improved by providing occasional quizzes to help students retain information throughout the semester.",
                "I thought that the content was very interesting and the teacher was excellent but the long class period made it sometimes get difficult to stay engaged."

Students with other focuses may find this course difficult, similar to the difficulty they'd encounter with a humanities course at Yale. I personally loved this course; it truly sparked my interest in art history, archeology (strangely, this isn't a focus), and Italian literature such as Dante especially.",
                "Definitely.",
