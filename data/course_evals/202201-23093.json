                "Strengths: \r\n- Structure of seminar: Professor Coen did a great job of maintaining a balance between lecture and seminar. The readings she chose for each class were quite enjoyable\r\n- Field trip: Professor Coen organized many different opportunities to see Yale's many offerings and even go to the New York Botanical Garden. It was great to have seminars without always being in a classroom. \r\n- Scheduling of seminar: I enjoyed meeting only once\/week for an extended time. It allowed us to develop deeper discussions regarding topics that would have maybe been cut short in a 75 minute section. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Scheduling the seminar for 2-5pm on a Friday made it a little difficult to pay attention near the end sometimes just from exhaustion from a long week. I would have preferred the seminar in the morning, Monday - Thursday.",
                "Creating a guideline to better explain the trajectory of the course and the relevance of each unit to the broader timeline that we study.",
                "The strengths of this course were the discussion posts before each class. I found it interesting to read my classmates' thoughts about the assigned reading and their perspectives also helped me to understand the reading better. Because the class was three hours long on a Friday afternoon, I sometimes had difficulty being fully engaged when I was in class.",
                "Strengths: I really liked the field trips, they added a lot of value to the material we learned.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 3 hours is a very long time and my attention span was not able to focus the whole time. The discussion style of the course often got repetitive and long."

                "If a student has any interest in environmental studies, the HSHM major, or wants to develop writing skills in a more laid-back environment, then absolutely! Professor Coen is a blast to learn from, provides great advice about the HSHM major and other courses to take at Yale, and provides such intellectually-rich seminars each week!",
                "I probably wouldn't. Unfortunately, I found a lot of the course to be not that interesting. Many of our discussions felt like saying nothing about nothing. If youre coming in expecting a course that charts our understanding of climate change throughout history, that isnt what this course is.",
                "Yep. Im not an HSHM major, and so I learned a lot.",
                "I would recommend this course to a first-year who is looking for a writing credit and also has interest in epistemology.",
                "No, unless you are very interested in HSHM. I personally thought the course was more about climate change and the evolution of what we know about it. However, it turned out to be more like a course of meteorology in the past and colonization."
