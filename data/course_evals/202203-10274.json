The work isn't necessarily all that much more than you would do in a regular semester, but it is definitely more stressful thus making the work harder to do.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tran and Maryam. They gave wonderful advice in any roadblocks we hit, from developing a research question to the actual writing of the thesis, their feedback was wonderful and helpful.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think the course could be set up in a way that is more conducive to getting actual witting or research done. Some assignments felt not so helpful or applicable to the actual thesis writing. This might be a hot take, but I kind of wish there was more scattered deadlines for waiting through out the semester. I know they encouraged us keep writing but it might have been helpful to have more writing deadlines instead of Cor maybe in addition to) other assignments. Would have also loved t have more worktime during class since some sessions went a bit slow."
