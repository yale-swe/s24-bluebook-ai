                "Lots of biomaterials",
                "I learned about how the immune system responds to different medical implants depending on the material, surface texture, implant shape, etc. I also learned about the testing and approval process for approving medical implants for clinical use.",
                "How the foreign body response is a giant factor in developing anything implanted in the human body.",
                "This course was centered around the ways in which the body responds to biomaterials and devices. A major point of discussion was the foreign body response (FBR), its steps, the molecules involved, and how it compares to typical wound healing. We also learned about specific biomedical devices including glucose sensors and brain implants. Many of the concepts were introduced by looking at data and conclusions of published studies, which offered good practice in reading and analyzing scientific literature.",
                "I learned about the foreign body response and the nuances of how our body responds to implants and other materials. I learned about the current approaches to solve problems associated with this and many applications.",

                "I think that the course was well taught. I liked Professor Kyrakides' teaching style - he was very engaging and was able to explain difficult concepts and difficult scientific papers in a way that was easy to follow. I wish that the rubric for the writing assignments were clearer and more specific.",
                "strengths - theoretically low-stress writing assignments and open-note exams\r\nweaknesses - seemingly arbitrary point loss, no clarity in what we can improve on, extremely harsh grading seemingly only for the purpose of \"creating a grade distribution\"",
                "I enjoyed how many real scientific articles were used in the course. I wanted more feedback on my work, especially on writing assignments where points seemed to be taken off quite arbitrarily.",
                "Exams did not feel like they tested how much you learned rather than if you were able to write down a really specific detail from class or read a vague question the right way. Strengths were that it was very interesting course and cool topics.",
                "I think this course introduced many interesting concepts and I have learned a lot. \r\nThe course could be better organized to make it more structured.",
                "This course covers are wide variety of topics in numerous application areas ranging for tissue engineering to diabetes to deep brain stimulation.",
                "Strengths: Topics are very interesting, great integration the real world applications with the science \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are not recorded, rubric for the writing assignments are not clear, professor's wording is confusing to follow sometimes",
                "Strength: You get to learn a lot about biomaterials.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very poorly structured class. It was difficult to know what was going to be on the exams. In fact, it ended up being anything he might have said in class. This meant that keeping a detailed log of what he said in class was important in getting a good score in the class. This is also because 90% of the class grade was based on the exams.",
                "The tests were hard and unpredictable , lectures were really interesting tho",
                "Strength: The course content is interesting and teaches you a lot about the immune response to and testing\/approval process for medical implants. Prof. Kyriakides is very knowledgeable and enjoys interacting with and helping students. Weaknesses: The lecture slides don't make too much sense without attending lecture, which is good for motivating class attendance. However, the exam questions are based off of what Prof. Kyriakides verbally says in class, which makes it very difficult to do well on exams if you have to miss a lecture or accidentally lose attention in class.",
                "Loved the lectures including actual research and very well explained. Really enjoyed the information in the class. The test questions could be more clearer. Atleast one question on the final required too much time to find the answers, the question was too specific with no clear direction if these were details found in the lectures or the papers mentioned. If it was in the papers, then the answer was not clarity found, requiring too much time on one question for a 2 hour test.",
                "The course is fully lecture-based, which could be a strength or weakness depending on the learner. I personally really enjoy learning through lecture, and I found the lectures in this class to be better than most because they were primarily case studies that the professor would walk us through. If you have high interest in the course content, it isn't hard to stay engaged. Another strength is Professor Kyriakides' expertise; he knows the content like the back of his hand and can answer all sorts of questions. The open-note exam format was nice as it emphasized understanding the material (and showing up to lecture) rather than just memorization.",
                "The content was extremely interesting and it was taught in a very accessible way. I loved reading new papers and understanding the drawbacks of their approaches. The weakness was the lack of engagement of other students in the course.",
                "One major strength is the teaching style, no weaknesses",
                "weaknesses: no clear feedback, expectations not made clear, grades felt made up, passive aggressiveness from both TAs and professor, professor not open to answering questions,"

                "I would not recommend this course to another student. It is simply not worth the pain that comes from learning about biomaterials and how the body reacts to them. The unstructured nature of the course made it difficult to know what we were learning and how it all related to each other. Furthermore, the grading made it feel as if there was a heavier emphasis on copying every word that was said rather than understanding the material.",
                "Yes it was so cool",

                "Yes, the information was great and well communicated.  Appreciated no homework to allow us to focus on our research.",
                "Yes, I think the course content is super unique and cool to learn about if you have any interest in biomedical devices or pathology. This is also a low-stress course thanks to its low workload and no discussion section (you really only need to do a few assignments, attend class, and prep well for exams), so it's easier to enjoy and focus on understanding the material.",
                "Yes I definitely would. I loved the content and it really made me think about medical devices in a new light.",
                "Definitely, I recommend it to anyone in BME to fulfill their electives",
