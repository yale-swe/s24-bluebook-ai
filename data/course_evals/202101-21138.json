Readings were short stories by famous authors whom Professor Su knows personally, so I believe it's helpful to have read these works that are influential and widely read in China.",

                "No weaknesses! Strengths: the readings (theyre a mix of really important and interesting works in modern Chinese fiction), the professor (Su Wei is one of a kind), assignments (none take too long or are that difficult but all help you build Chinese language skills)",
                "Strengths include the curation of material that gradually becomes more difficult as the semester goes on.\r\nWeaknesses include clarity of assignment due dates.",
                "Strengths: Interesting and insightful readings. Su laoshi always had interesting background about the authors, Chinese society, proverbs, and personal anecdotes!\r\nWeaknesses: Class organization could have been better",
                "The materials covered in the course are very interesting. However it was sometimes a little bit lacking in organization (meaning sometimes it wasn't very clear exactly what the homework was).",
                "Strengths: Professor is really passionate and willing to share in depth the historical and philosophical background behind the stories, authors, time period, and Chinese culture. He even shares personal anecdotes and life advice. His feedback on essays and in-class explanations of how to write essays helped me improve a lot. Midterms tested on exactly what we learned, so students can learn a lot without being stressed and confused. I believe the value of this class exceeds plain language learning because of Professor Su. \r\nWeaknesses: The syllabus didn't match what we actually did in class at times. At the same time, the TA, who managed Canvas, followed the syllabus. As a result, it was at times confusing, for example: when to submit what assignment where.",
                "This class is somewhat between a seminar and lecture in format, which I found to be very effective. I really enjoyed listening to Prof. Su lecture about the stories we were studying as well as the cultural/historical/political backdrop of the authors' lives. \r\n\r\nSometimes the pacing of the assignments felt a little too fast, especially towards the end of the term. Reading in traditional characters for the first time was extremely time consuming, although I definitely found it a great skill to work on. I don't know if there is an alternative way to ease students into it, like perhaps a reference sheet for the extremely common characters; it wasn't too difficult, just required a lot of dictionary-checking."
