   "comments": [
    "Familiarity with biographical craft and archival research, as well as access to an incredible writer like Gaddis.",
    "I learned quite a bit about biography writing, the role of fiction in historical accounts, and assorted historical facts pertaining to the week's biography.",
    "Professor Gaddis makes you think.",
    "One of the best classes at Yale.",
    "Good practice in the archives.",
    "It really is a fantastic course with one of Yale's best professors. This will be one of the most demanding classes you take at Yale, if not the most demanding. It is also unconventional for a junior seminar don't consider it as such. People have described it as a \"book club\" with John Gaddis. It's more a book discussion led by John Gaddis. Expect the speaking in class to be divided equally between the students and him, if not slightly leaning toward him. This is an advantage in the class. John Gaddis' takes on the books are more interesting than most of our peers, understandably. But we don't get to think out loud like in other junior seminars, which is I guess a weakness. Most people can't read a book every single week, but most people do make a real effort which is enough for a discussion. People being frightfully unprepared wasn't a big problem for us, but it is almost impossible to do all the reading. \r\nThe biography at the end almost feels like a separate entity entirely from the class. To put it simply, it's nuts. It's a thesis that you'll procrastinate on and then lose 10 days of your life wasting away in a library from 9am to midnight to finish. In the end, hopefully, you've created something you're proud of.\r\nIt's a unique class.",
    "I truly knew nothing about writing biographies and had read very few going into this course. I leave feeling like a master of the subject!",
    "This was an excellent course  the very best Ive taken at Yale thus far. At the core, Art of the Biog taught us to question the stories we construct of others and ourselves, and to discern exacting methods and systems we might use to our advantage. Professor Gaddis discussions (and short lectures) were inspiring, provoking, heartbreaking, challenging. We dealt with concepts of biography, but went far beyond. Every class, I left with this question in my mind: What should we glean from the pages of others stories and our own? What do we take from tragedies (Life of Robert Peace), from political success (LBJ?!), from revolutionaries, and from reading in between the lines of their lives? Class was highly entertaining  Prof Gaddis is full of quips and fantastic stories. \r\n\r\nDiverse readings ranged from a creative biography of the death of Lincolns son, to the political machinations of LBJ, to the humdrum routines of an American midwife. As one might imagine, these equipped us to see nuanced complexity in different economic\/geopolitical situations and times and distill their period-specific role in driving a life. The biographies were so different, to the point that class often felt like a lively, strange history course. \r\n\r\nAs we moved into the research part, this questioning in turn served as a foundation to construct a personal vision of a subjects life. I learned to question the narratives we create  to pace around a subject to reveal the fundamental threads. It was one of the most challenging, intimate, and fulfilling endeavors Ive ever undertaken."

   "comments": [
    "Sometimes discussions were sort of disengaged, but Professor Gaddis always says something interesting to get us back on track.",
    "One of the best classes at Yale.",
    "Great final project. Decent throughout the semester.",
    "The class won't change lol. It is what it is, and it's a great class",
    "The syllabus is very strong. I am not sure the course has a major weakness.",
    "I think the course is really what you make it. The strengths are that Gaddis is an amazing facilitator of discussion, the books are incredibly interesting and readable, and that you are basically participating in a book club with smart students and an awesome professor. You also get the chance to write a long work about a subject of your choosing, and to get familiar with the archives. I would honestly take the course again if I could.",
    "Strengths - fantastic spectrum of readings, eye-opening and really ground you in a range of angles on the discipline. We hopped between social theory, ideas of governance, creative epistolary styles and back  loved the balance between readings, discussion, and creative work (autobiog\/project). \r\n\r\nThe interplay between theory < > creating\/writing was core to the class. Projects were inventive and painful (in a productive way). Creating is one of the BEST ways to learn. The project structure really emphasized that. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Not a ton. This was one of the most focused and complete classes that Ive taken. My main complaint surrounds archival resources. The team is great: George and Bill in particular were so responsive and incredibly knowledgeable! Yet the Beinecke fundamentally lacks historical archives of Asian \/ Southeast Asian figures (especially women). \r\n\r\nI recognize theres a language difference and perhaps a literacy difference, but perhaps more contemporary asian voices could be represented. (Asian-American authors or public figures?) Looking back in time, perhaps there are translations of asian archives. (For example, the Beinecke holds English translations of Native American sources.)  Asian stories are a huge part of world history, and it behooves the Yale collection to strengthen our understanding of such voices, from the mundane to the significant."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you WANT to write a biography. A lot of students took the course just to be in Gaddis's presence. Gaddis is of course very cool, but a lot of students failed to engage with the books since they didn't care about the essence of the course",
    "It is very work heavy (a large, sometimes horribly dense book a week, plus all the research for the project has to be done outside of class). But some of the books are really amazing, and biography is amazing, and Gaddis is amazing, and exploring people's archives and stories are amazing. It really is a bookclub with John Gaddis and an intense, intimidating research project at the end.",
    "only if you are willing to put in the work!!!!",
    "Yes, but know that it's not a how-to.",
    "One of the best classes at Yale.",
    "yes.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to a student of a certain sort. Self-selection into this course is pretty good. A surprisingly low number of students showed up on the first day. I think only 5 or 10 were turned away, which for a seminar by John Gaddis is astounding. If you are willing to put the time in, you will have an unforgettable experience",
    "Yes. It is a phenomenal course. The syllabus is fantastic, as is Professor Gaddis. All assignments are worthwhile, if not once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.",
    "100%. See above.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Itll be the best part of your week. It's like drinking from the fire hose in a good way. Youll push yourself and create an original project. Imagination is the beginning of nearly everything important, and creating a biography in a lively, focused way introduces all kinds of constraints.. Youll emerge more inventive than before, and a more interesting thinker. \r\n\r\nDo the readings!! You wont regret it."
