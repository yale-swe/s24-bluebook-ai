                "I gained a broad and deep knowledge of the events which occured in the Middle East during the time period covered, and how those events could be tied to the actions and choices of the people living in that period. I also learned to treat those people not as abstract concepts but as human beings, subject to the same fundamental constraints as people today, both through hearing them speak with their own words and through being constantly encouraged to connect the history we were learning about to the history we are currently living through.",
                "History of empires between Muhammad and Mongols  primary sources were especially interesting.",
                "I learned a lot about how Islam became a geographical power.",
                "I learned so so much about the medieval Middle East and Islam. We covered such a great breadth and depth of the different historical characters and processes at work. We learned how to apply conceptual models to actual historical events and to compare events across space and time. I had a cursory familiarity with the subject, but Professor Van Bladel truly made them so much more cohesive and interesting.",
                "This course provided me with a comprehensive overview of early Islamic civilization, focusing primarily on the Umayyads, Abbasids, Fatimids, Seljuks, some smaller dynasties such as the Buyids and Samanids, and the rise of Ismailism. We also discussed historiography and how such courses as this one came into existence. We covered a lot of material and went over everything in great depth while acknowledging broader trends of history.",
                "I've learned a huge amount of information on the period from the birth of Islam and the early Islamic conquests to the advent of the Mongols; concretely, we were taught to use a very useful framework to process this wealth of info that consisted in analyzing the sources of social power, such as ideology, economy, military, and politics. I've learned to look at history as a result of innumerable factors such as trade and economy, environmental factors, social relationships, and the narrator's interests.",
                "This course covered the Islamic Middle East from the 600s to 1258. I dont think it was listed as one, but it mostly felt like a history class and was taught like one."

            "comments": [
                "Professor van Bladel teaches history not as a list of occurences but instead as the story of people, who, just like us today, strive for security and meaning in their lives, and for justification for their vices and mistakes. By constantly connecting the events and phenomena we studied to modern-day examples, interesting anecdotes from realms as disparate as architecture and the history of post-war American academia, and above all the words and attitudes of those who lived through the events in question, Professor van Bladel made Islamic history pop off the projector screen and feel real and tangible in everyday experience. Only when this amazing push to relevancy was not in effect, such as during the essay assignments, was the class anything but tantalizing and exciting to attend, and these durations were short and low-stakes.",
                "I liked when we talked about broader themes and historiographic theories, though perhaps because the lecture size was so small one student question could easily derail the lecture trajectory for quite some time.",
                "Strenghts: Engaging professor, interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: Reading were too much, I sometimes  felt lost because of the structure, difficult to study for the exams since there was so much material to learn",
                "A major strength was the fact that Dr. van Bladel typically devoted a substantial portion of class time to answering student's questions. Lectures were always engaging and thorough. The readings, especially the primary sources, were all very interesting. Inevitably, some topics were discussed in more depth than others, but the topics of focus were set out at the start of the semester.",
                "Professor van Bladel is an outstanding lecturer; his classes were always extremely engaging and enjoyable, and the sections with Chris were always a good time, with very fun and enjoyable conversation. This class is a lot of work in terms of the readings, though, and it also has 2 papers, a midterm, and a final.",
                "I really liked the course overall. My only issue that I sometimes had was that I felt like I got lost in the timeline of the history we were learning, and I think a little more organization of the units\/structure of the course wouldve helped me keep track of things better."

                "Every student at Yale should take this course. Though the two weekends devoted to essay-writing were admittedly stressful, Professor van Bladel's magnetic lecturing style and ability to make history exciting and relevant to our modern experience makes every second spent in lecture an absolute joy, and the wide range of readings ensures that homework is never dull. No matter how many history classes a student has taken before, this one will give them a new, better perspective not only on the content it covers, and the region in which it took place, but also on the discipline of history itself. Those who are concerned about the workload should audit or Credit\/D; those who have another class at this timeslot should see if they can move it.",
                "Probably not as it currently stands. Prof van Bladel is an excellent scholar and a kind professor, but I felt like the class was not very well organized (mostly due to the amount of tangents we went on due to some student questions).",
                "Yes! Its a great course if youre trying to understand the geographical power dynamics in the Near East. An essential time period to know",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with a passing interest in Middle Eastern history. You cover so much and the events we cover are so interesting and significant and relatively unknown for many of us. Professor Van Bladel knows so much and because the lecture was small this year we were able to have such an extremely high level of participation and engagement to really power our learning. He answers our questions really well and also asks us to question our preconceptions. The papers and exams were very manageable, but the learning was still invaluable.",
                "I would highly recommend this course, even if you have no prior knowledge of Islamic history. Dr. van Bladel is an expert in the field and has a great sense of humor.",
                "Absolutely. Professor van Bladel is an outstanding lecturer; his classes were always extremely engaging and enjoyable. The sections with Chris were always a good time, with very fun and enjoyable conversation. You'll learn so much information and learn to see and read history more critically.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I learned a lot of history that I hadnt known before, and the required readings were always really interesting and enjoyable. I dont think Ive had a history class before where I enjoyed the readings so muchsome really great primary works."
