    "I learned hard audio editing skills, as well as how to better tell a story.",
    "This course taught me a great deal about different strategies to use when composing a journalistic piece. It also showed me how to produce a radio segment from start to finish using a recorder and editing software.",
    "I learned how to write, edit, and produce a radio story (using Audacity software). I learned more about what makes a story compelling, and what techniques make for the best radio stories. This course taught me how to achieve proximity to one's subject, and it made me more comfortable speaking into a microphone and expressing my voice.",
    "Really fun to learn how to put together audio pieces, work with recording equipment, and use audio software.",
    "Interviewing skills, storytelling skills, and analytical skills when it comes to listening to radio pieces (what makes it effective, what doesn't)\r\nTeamwork and group feedback skills\r\nHow to create an effective, short radio piece"

   "comments": [
    "I thought this course was fantastic!! I honestly don't wish anything was different.",
    "One strength was being able to workshop segments with other students.",
    "The strength of this course is that it forces you off into the real world of radio journalism; it's not theoretical. You have to go out and make a story. Over the course of the semester, you learn how to improve those stories and make them more complex and interesting. The workshop format is effective, and Professor Arnold is fun and engaging and encouraging. \r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course is that at times it seemed to privilege only a certain type of radio story; sometimes, when I was crafting my stories, it felt like I was just trying to do what would please Professor Arnold and his idea of what a story should be. Overall, there was less emphasis on the \"journalism\" part and much more on the \"radio\" part: what would sound good for radio, as opposed to what story is worth telling. I think the course would be improved if students were encouraged to try out different types of radio stories: instead of just \"event on campus,\" also do a feature or profile, or a serious piece, or a sports piece, etc. I don't think this is a reason not to take this course; it's just something to keep in mind that the universe of radio stories is wider than this class might suggest.",
    "Started off really strong, but I think the class, including Prof. Arnold, lost some enthusiasm about halfway through, then class became a little too slow\/unproductive.",
    "I thought that this was a very well-organized course and I learned all the skills I came in wanting to gain: interviewing, storytelling, and audio-editing. As discussed in class, this course could be improved by giving us more specific short-term radio assignments. For instance, instead of \"go cover an event\", it could be \"go profile a remarkable person\", \"tell a story about your childhood\/home\" (for breaks home), etc. This way we could gain a wider variety of storytelling skills and also help us learn how to better piece stories together."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. There are high expectations, but the work you produce is amazing and the feedback you get from Chris is invaluable.",
    "Yes, the course taught me a great deal about radio journalism and telling stories.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. It's an opportunity to do something that you normally can't do on campus. I learned a lot about how to tell a story with only audio, and I think that is a valuable skill beyond the domain of radio journalism. The class is relaxed and supportive. Making radio stories is not easy, so you will work for this class, but I found it to be challenging and rewarding.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone wanting to dip their feet into radio journalism, or journalism in general! Chris is a fantastic professor and we really do learn all the skills you need to go out and create a NPR-worthy piece (that you can totally pitch to NPR with Chris' help too!)"
