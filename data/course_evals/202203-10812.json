I learned how to manage myself in order to retain material effectively as well as how to manage my time.",

                "The strengths are that the content was well taught but it could be improved by reducing the amount of coursework. For example, during the week that we had a math midterm, we also had the discoveries and a problem set. My suggestion would be to make the problem set for that week optional.",
                "This course really just wasn't that engaging at all for students who already knew what they were doing, and I was pretty frustrated with the random assignments unrelated to math that we had to do on Canvas like Learning Strategy reflections.",
                "The class was the best it could be, Professor Diethorn is the best calculus lecturer that Ive ever seen. I am so grateful for her class!",
                "Strengths of this course include having many resources available online to access for studying and reviewing material. Weakness is that the pace of the class can be too slow or fast for some students, and it is evident in class where students fall. This makes it difficult to get through all of the material on the printed worksheets for each class because of questions.",
                "Strengths are that Rachel is an amazing teacher that is very encouraging. The problem sets are good , the material to prep for exams sufficient. However , the explorations are not very useful in my opinion.",
                "the class was very organized and rachel was an excellent professor",
                "The explorations are helpful however all of the explorations should be accessible at once and not only made accessible gradually.",
                "This course is very large and it is difficult to meaningfully engage with fellow students and professors.",
                "I really liked how there were worksheet templates that we all filled out together in class; those really helped me not only understand the concepts when they were taught but also be able to review concepts really effectively for exams.",
                "Strength - Lesson plans, the packets, abundance of office hours",
                "STRENGTHS: This was a good course overall. The explorations before classes grew on me - I didn't like them at first, but I appreciated when they were shorter - it felt like less of a chore, and still was able to set the logical foundation for the next class's topic. More instructors should take note of Professor Diethorn's guided notes - it's super convenient not to have to worry about copying down the problem, so you can just focus on trying to solve it and understand. WEAKNESSES: An answer key of the problem set after it is posted - with how to work through the problems - might be helpful for reviewing for exams. Going over more complicated problems and examples in class would be helpful, including challenging questions from the problem set after it is turned in.",
                "peer tutoring",
                "I appreciated my professor and the great energy she brought to class everyday. It really helped motivate me at 9AM. I also appreciate the packets that we filled out together during class. Rather than taking all of the notes myself, I feel like this method allowed me to truly know what is important and made sure I never got left behind.",
                "The strength of this course is its format. Being able to learn the content of the class, review it in the notes, and then apply it in the P-sets was very beneficial to my learning. Professor Diethorn was a key component of this and I really enjoyed learning from her. The only weakness may be the amount of assignments in Canvas, I found it difficult to follow what I needed to do and not.",
                "The strengths of this course were that it had a decent pace and workload that taught all of the necessary material without feeling rushed. I also think the peer tutors were really helpful with p-sets and concepts. This course could be improved by maybe having additional concept review sessions throughout the semester instead of right before the midterm.",
                "i felt it was a bit rushed while on some topics, overall it was a great class",
                "I have no suggestions for improvement within my own course, I would rather like to say that while I had a brilliant teacher I heard lots of complaints about the other teachers who were responsible for the same course. I would suggest looking at different teachers to teach calc 115 who communicate more in the style of Rachel Diethorn",
                "The weakness of this course may be the late peer tutoring hours and that the problem sets were at times coupled with midterms which was really challenging.",
                "not sure yet",
                "Strengths would be the practice tests given to us to study for the midterms. Weakness would be some of the assignments seemed to just be busy work.",
                "It was sometimes difficult to remember things from previous units because it wasnt always reviewed until right before the exam.",
                "I think there is disparity among sections. For example I had a really good section; my teacher gave us worksheets to follow along with the lesson and had accessible office hours. From, what I heard this wasnt true for some other ones."
