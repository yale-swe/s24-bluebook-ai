    "I learned how to do lab reports (you do a lot of them). I significantly improved my MS Excel skills. The lab also helps you understand topics from the lecture better.",

    "This class has a reputation for having a very high workload. While it was definitely still a lot of work, it never felt like an unfair or completely unreasonable amount. Dr. Cooper did a great job preserving the experiments while cutting down unnecessarily tedious and repetitive analysis and error propagation. That said, I still wrote 30-50 pages for every lab report, and the work was very time-consuming. I did learn a lot about the experimental techniques and how to do data analysis and error propagation, but I often found myself not focusing on the actual content of the analysis and the theory in favor of just working through the analysis and write-ups.",
    "This class is informative but very labor intensive, but by necessity. Possibly allowing lab reports to be turned in in sections could help remedy this.",
    "Okay so let me say FIRST that this has NOTHING to do with Anton and Dr. Cooper. They are the SOLE strengths of this course. I literally don't know what I would have done without them. If you are reading this, please do some background reading by referring to the Fall 2018 course reviews. This course is the hardest class at Yale no doubt (unless pchem 2 rips me a new one as bad as I expect it to), so everyone in CS 323 can back off. Dr. Cooper has worked really hard to make this not the case, and the changes made since last year are clearly visible. However, that does not change the fact that this course is literal hell (not his fault though!!!!!). I swore up and down that I would not let this class change me, as I watched it (and the people who designed it to be this way) destroy people that I care about. However I was not able to keep that promise to myself. I took a really light courseload and still was not able to keep up with my other classes. The only other \"homework\" I ever did was pchem psets. This class took over my life, and when shit in my personal life hit the fucking fan I couldn't even stop to breathe, I had to keep going or get caught up in the tsunami that is pchem lab, and doing that nearly destroyed me. This class should not exist in its current form. I submitted upwards of 150 pages for this course. I lost sleep over this course (another thing that I swore to myself wouldn't happen), I shed tears over this course, I watched my already fragile mental health continue to deteriorate over this course. And maybe one of the worst parts of it all is that others have been trained to fucking gaslight us about how bad this class is, all the while it is openly disclosed that pchem lab is the way it is to curtail the number of chem majors. I'm tired of watching this course hurt people.",
    "The class is fine and interesting but the lab reports take a lot of time.",
    "The course was, as Dr. Cooper mentioned, very very good at enforcing use of excel.  It also helped a lot in enforcing knowledge from PChem and generally understanding lab procedyres",
    "The strengths of this course were our TA, Anton (THANK YOU) and Dr. Cooper, who were both incredibly understanding and helpful. However, the course instructions were really confusing due to them being from the previous version of the course, and the workload was still incredibly high. The main weakness was that all of the instructions for the data analysis was incredibly confusing."
