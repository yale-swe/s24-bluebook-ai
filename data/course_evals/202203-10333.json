I also do not comprehend why students must purchase two-year subscriptions to applicationscontaining learning materials (Kontakte) that become useless after one year of use? It appears to me that the administration of the German Department treats students and course organization with their sleeves down and thinking only of their own interests, ignoring the interests of students, especially graduate students.",
