                "this class is really what you make of it -- you can produce small pieces and do them last minute or you can lean in and work really hard. Crits are more generative than critical. Course depends a lot on who's teaching; Oscar is great and emphasizes learning materials (fresco, egg tempera) and pairing with more theoretical readings. We didn't do much painting in class which means that the time per week for the class is kind of a lot because class itself is 4 hours per week, and then you add outside painting on that. First half of the class has painting prompts and the second is very open ended.",
                "Yes, it was a meditative class that took one out of the university mindset and got me thinking about broader concepts outside my own experience",

                "I would recommend the course to someone who wants to expand/keep up their painting practice at Yale if they are comfortable with a very open-ended format. You can pretty much do anything you want, which is exciting but intimidating also. It was very self-drivenbesides Oscar's tutorials on new techniques, most of the course was independent studio time."
