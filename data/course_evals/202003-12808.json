                "Strength: \r\nGetting to see all the high quality design art pieces that he picked out from historical designers were very helpful in developing creativity and critical eyes.\r\nHaving an opportunity to see other students' work was very helpful and inspiring. It was very interesting to see what people come up with from same topic and theme. \r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\nIt would have been more helpful if we were able to see art works of students from other section.",
                "This course was incredible. I enjoyed talking about work with my peers, while hearing Henk's feedback, as well. I think it was organized quite well, especially for an art class held over Zoom. However, I sometimes wish we gained more instruction and knowledge through lectures (even if they are on the shorter end) or demonstrations.",
                "Strengths: class size, regular verbal feedback, variety of projects, lots of interactions with peers and prof \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: registrar\/department charged students $150 supplies fee despite the semester being remote (no supplies\/resources were provided by the course despite this fee charge...quite unreasonable), workload was super off-balanced (super heavy during first month\/two), course materials are expensive, no formal assessment results all semester (closest thing was a two week late midterm check-in)",
                "The projects were very fun to do. The first set of formal exercises took more time than anticipated because they were hands on, but they were very rewarding in the end. Sadly, the limitations were that the course was virtual, and we were unable to interact with other students as much."

                "I felt that screen sharing the art work was successful, and using chat boxes to comment on each other's work was also successful. Professor scribbling on shared screen was also helpful to have us visually know where he wants us to revise. \r\nUsing google drive to submit our art works was also successful and efficient.",
                "I think going around the \"Zoom room\" for critiques was successful. However, of course, it becomes less engaging to just type feedback into the chat box, but I'm not sure if there's a way to get around that.",

The work load is very intense the first 1\/4 of the course, but the work load will become more doable towards the end of the course. Seeing other student's art work is very inspiring and challenges you to excel more.",

Whether it's promotional content, billboards, magazine covers, posters, etc., I've developed the skills and knowledge to look at things, and truly analyze whether or not its design was effective, and how it could be improved. In addition, you'll learn how to communicate through design, which is an important skill to have regardless of what career path you may choose to take.",
