                "This was a great writing seminar. I learned so much about human wildlife conflict and coexistence, but also developed my writing skills in a way I have never before. I feel that coming out of this course, I am a much stronger writer than when I started.",
                "This course taught me a variety of way of researching, thinking about and discussing human-wildlife conflict. On entering this course, I admit that I had a very limited view of what human-wildlife conflict was and how it could be managed - but after this class, I grew to appreciate the complex nuances of human-wildlife conflict and coexistence that intersected across fields of natural, social, and environmental sciences. This course was also very geared towards the writing process, which I appreciated so much. Very approachable for students seeking to dramatically improve their writing from a basic to excellent level.",
                "I learned how to better synthesize works of both natural and social sciences in my reviews. My writing improved a great deal through this course in general.",
                "I learned how to write longer papers in a concise manner and structure large amounts of information so that they would be easily digested by the reader. I also learned how to thoroughly research a very specific topic.",
                "A deeper and foundational understanding of Human-Wildlife Conflict and Coexistence. From drivers to mitigation strategies, this course push students to get creative and innovative.",

                "Not only did we talk about human-wildlife conflict for a diverse range of species and many different locations, we also explored how this topic is much more complex than it's usually presented in the media and in conservation strategies. Within this was a discussion of what coexistence with wildlife really means and how we can work towards this goal. As for writing, it really helped improve my writing, both scientific writing and academic writing in general."

                "The papers we read were relevant, current, and really interesting. Chloe did a great job selecting them! \r\n\r\nThe discussion format facilitates individual thought and student collaboration. One of the highlights of this class was listening to my peers. \r\n\r\nThe peer review sessions were very helpful due to the detailed peer-review sheets that Chloe made. \r\n\r\nOne way to improve the course would be to add some more variety in class (i.e. when we made conflict/coexistence diagrams).",
                "I absolutely loved this course. The format of discussion for the readings each day was super productive and really engaging. Everyone always had something to say and there was never a shortage of things to talk about. The workshopping we did for our papers was also extremely helpful and helped us learn more about writing from our peers which was really interesting.",
                "The course was excellent. Nothing could have been done to make it any better. Every course should follow this one as a guideline for how to facilitate thoughtful, meaningful, and well-informed student-centered discussions. I was blown out of the water by this course.",
                "The readings, discussions, and peer workshops in this course were really fantastic. The only weakness of this course was its bias towards human-mammal conflict, though this is generally a reflection of the existing body of literature rather than a failure of course design. Regardless, students had complete freedom to explore other taxonomic cases of human-wildlife conflict and co-existence.",
                "I loved this course! It was a great reading- and discussion-based seminar and all of my classmates treated each other with respect. We were allowed to be curious and goofy, which allowed for a really encouraging learning environment.",
                "Strengths: Chloe was extremely kind and welcoming, and the class atmosphere in general was also very kind and welcoming. The readings were manageable yet very informative and interesting, and therefore our class discussions were as well. It was also a great range of subjects and types of homework (i.e. scholarly articles, news articles, videos or movies, etc.). I very much appreciated how discussions were structured such that we usually began by simply going over the study/paper we had read to make sure we all understood, and then expanding that to a broader discussion about the concepts and our own opinions on the information presented. It was great to have a wide range of backgrounds and experiences in the class (for example, Environmental Studies majors were mixed in with Econ majors or History majors, etc.). The writing feedback was super helpful, and we had plenty of workshops and the like to make sure that each paper had as much support as possible.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of!"

The readings are interesting and informative, and you'll learn a lot more than you'd expect. The gradual increase of page numbers for the papers might seem intimidating, but you'll definitely have enough material at hand and not even notice. The writing workshops and focus on specific writing techniques in this class is excellent.",

As someone who feels very insecure in their writing skills, this course made writing way more approachable and fun for me. Our discussions were so engaging and fruitful every class which was very unique and something that I think a lot of other courses struggle with.",
                "Yes. The course is wonderful and among the best I've ever taken at Yale. I would recommend this course to a variety of students across different fields of study - such as environmental studies, ecology and evolutionary biology, political science, anthropology, etc. The course was also very approachable, and I left the course a better writer, thinker, and researcher.",
                "Absolutely. It was a fantastic introduction to the intricacies of human and wildlife relationships.",
