                "This course gave me an entirely new way of thinking about music. It's an analytical approach suited to both rhythm and pitch that points out patterns in existing music you might never see without it. Even though at times it can feel like a mental exercise without a purpose, the four papers we write over the course of the semester highlight how to apply what we've learned in a real context. It has allowed me to make sense of music by composers like Webern that initially sound extremely dissonant. Through the lens of cyclic and trichordal analysis taught in this class, each aspect of the piece emerged into clarity and gave me a much greater appreciation of music I once dismissed as just sounding bad.",
                "I gained some technical knowledge of mathematical music notation and concepts, but mostly I gained new perspectives on how to look at music and analyze the parts of it via chords, scales, or individual pitch relations.",
                "Learned about representing music with set theory, cyclical models of pitch and rhythm, tuning theory, scalar theory, and chordal/chord progression theory. This class will expose you to lots of complicated and beautiful geometric models - you might listen to music differently for the rest of your life, or you might throw up your hands and say you'll never understand it. Most of the students seemed to feel both of these ways at one point or another.",
                "I learned how to apply math to thinking about music and music theory. I learned a variety of models to represent rhythms, notes, pitches, chords, and note-spaces. I also learned about pitch theory, and found out a bit of historical context for mathematical musical thinking. I gained skills in collaborating on (ungraded) problem sets, and on analytical writing about music. The main insight of the course was thinking first abstractly about mathematical and musical ideas, then synthesizing them, and then applying them in analysis. It definitely changed how I listen to and play music for the better.",
                "HOLY MOLY I learned a lot in this course. I learned how to model pitches using all sorts of graphs, I learned about tuning theory, I learned about all the non-isomorphic rhythms made of eighth notes in a 4/4 measure!! I learned tools to make chordal analysis of pieces easier and I learned how to better recognize important details in musical analysis.",

                "I think probably the last unit was a bit far out there",
                "More time with 3D representation",
                "The course is really fun, first of all. The material is interesting on its own and you'll see aspects of it at work in the music around you even outside of class. It's a very interactive classroom environment and I felt like I actually got to know the other students. As a result, it's also paced perfectly for the students in the class, and the professor was able to adjust lesson plans according to how well we understood everything. I would expect that if another class had an easier or harder time learning then the course would move slower or faster to match the students. Perhaps one weakness is the limited number of opportunities to influence your grade - with only four papers and two exams, one bad grade holds a lot of weight. That being said, Professor Cohn is a pretty generous grader and is very understanding. Some participation credit might be appreciated, but I don't know whether that's possible while maintaining its status as a QR course.",
                "This course has a great discussion element and good presentations, and the first three essays (I was not a huge fan of the fourth) were very interesting prompts. I thought that it would be nice to include more real world musical examples in the problem sets and such as well, so that we could do more of this kind of analysis on our own without the pressure of an essay. The current topics of the problem sets were still very good, however.",
                "Prof. Cohn is a great professor and makes himself available to help students work through the material; he also gives helpful feedback on assignments. I can think of two things that could put you at a disadvantage for this course: not having easy access to a piano/keyboard, and not having a strong math background that sets you up well for set theory/complicated geometric spaces. I was lucky to have a keyboard, which really helped, but I don't have a strong math background and found a lot of these concepts hard to understand. Prof. Cohn regularly provided detailed notes to help us prepare for new topics; I think the notes were helpful, but it made a fool out of me much of the time because what I needed was to start from the basics. I would suggest defining a mathematical prerequisite for this course, or making a course that moves more slowly with new concepts.",
                "Strengths: the professor is amazing and understanding, the concepts in almost every class were mind-blowing to some extent, and I felt like I also learned a lot from the extremely talented fellow students in the class. There wasn't too much work, although I did spend a lot of out-of-class time just Googling and thinking about models and math/music concepts from class, and searching for more musical examples of each topic.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of too many...the course sped up a lot at the end and it seemed that we ran out of time to finish everything.",
                "I am really having a hard time thinking of weaknesses of the course. I guess I found the second essay, which was on a piece by Webern, very confusing, and had trouble finding cohesive connections to the material in class. But the pacing of the course was perfect, the PSETS were wonderful because they were very in depth and helpful but also not at all punitive if you struggled with them, and the exam was really fun.",
                "I think a lot of the material of this course is largely irrelevant to anyone's musical life unless you are specifically looking to go into mathematical music theory. The biggest strength of the class is also its biggest weakness: that it's a QR credit. The professor said that half of what he taught had to be math  which means that I feel like we glossed over/didn't cover a ton of the actual music-related stuff that would actually be interesting/relevant."

                "If you're interested in music and math, this course is for you. There isn't a ton of overt, raw math in it but the same type of logic that attracts you to math should also apply to the material here, with Mobius strips, cycles, Pascal's triangle, frequency ratios to represent intervals, and a satisfyingly mindbending 3-dimensional model at the end of the semester. Even if you don't like math that much, the applications of the concepts aren't too difficult and I found the course to be a pleasure almost all the time. It doesn't have the shortcomings that Yale math classes might tend to have, and the workload is flexible based on whether you do the optional weekly problem sets. They'll help you understand stuff but aren't necessary at all.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in music and math, this course is fantastic! It connects the two subjects very well and will teach you some fascinating new ways of thinking about music.",
                "Yes, if you look at the syllabus and feel prepared mathematically. If you're the type of musician who thinks tuning theory is interesting and understandable, go for it. Prof. Cohn is an expert on this content! A lot of it is his own research, or related to it. These are very exciting ways to approach music that you likely haven't been exposed to before. Throughout the course, we're always bringing in and analyzing music, but the week-to-week output of student work is definitely more math-oriented. If you take this course, be prepared to be called on when you weren't raising your hand!",
                "Absolutely. It showed an elegant (but imperfect, which we talked about in class) way of thinking about music. The lectures were engaging, in the way that a cool math class is engaging, but with musical interludes. Doing the problem sets with friends from class felt like playing through fun puzzles.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. This was my favorite course this semester and I got so much out of it being someone who's interested in both music and math. I think that people with a variety of backgrounds in music and/or math would love this course. I would be more likely to recommend it to someone with music theory experience because this course is pretty challenging. It becomes more work the less intuition you already have about mathematical models, music theory analysis, and musical scales / chords in the first place.",
                "No, unless you are a music major desperate for a QR. There are better QR classes and there are better theory classes to take."
