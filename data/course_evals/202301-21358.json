The grading was incredibly harsh for what would otherwise have been an introductory course to these topics, and the quizzes were worded strangely making it very difficult to gauge what the instructor and TFs wanted from us.",
                "I think that the grade that a student earns solely depends on which teaching fellow grades the assignments. I often compared my scoring to my classmate's and then the content we wrote about and while the content would be similar, our grades did not match at all. The grading was quite harsh and instruction was unclear, which often resulted in room for interpretation which I would be penalized for in my work. This class was very unorganized and I felt like I never truly understood what we were learning.",

                "the weakness of this class was the teaching style of the professor. I liked his stories but he did not teach math well.",

                "interesting material if you engage with it",

                "Could be more engaging in lectures, but had well structured assignments",
                "This course allowed me to learn a lot of new material and methods without being stressed. Not sure how he did it, but this had to be one of my favorite courses!",
                "The strengths of the course were that the assignments were clear. Professor Jaynes made the lecture notes available for students. I enjoyed working with my team on several of the projects, as it facilitated a collaborative working atmosphere.\r\nThe weaknesses of the course were that the lectures were sometimes a bit confusing. I can't pinpoint exactly why.",
                "Content and projects were really interesting but I feel like grading is very subjective and probably would not reflect your true learning in class because almost your entire grade is based on group projects. So it really depends on how smart and hardworking your group members are.",

I like the way the lecture notes are constructed too, it helped me learn the content once I got home and was able to look through what we went through in lecture.",
                "Strengths: Thorough explanation of various perspectives of current issues\r\nWeaknesses: Explanations sometimes a bit hard to understand",

                "Strengths was that the teacher made the lectures very interesting. He is an excellent orator. I also really liked how the course material related to real life problems and teaches us ways to quantify it and address it. The summary notes of the lectures were extremely helpful as well.",

                "I think this course could be improved by no group work as that was often the biggest burden and took time away from the actual content of the course. I think group essays themselves are extremely difficult. I ended up doing all the work for my group.",
                "Great lectures",
                "I think the lectures were engaging but I did not like the format of the group projects, because it was difficult to coordinate with other members of the group.",

                "I think a lot of people didn't take it seriously enough and also the group projects were difficult because the work load was incredibly unbalanced",
                "I think the strength are professors jaynes lectures. He is an interesting lecturer and keeps everyone engaged but I think the group assignments are difficult because the groups are assigned and they do not change for the whole semester so it is difficult to keep working with the same people especially if some do not pull their weight as much as others."

The content we learn in class is very relevant to the education inequality problem we face today, so one learns a lot of useful skills and knowledge.",
                "DONT LISTEN TO EVERYONE. Everyone says this class is a gut and while that may be true, if you get stuck in a bad group youll be the one having to worry about the homework assignments. This class is only a gut if you dont care about doing your share in the homework assignments.",
                "Yes",
                "If a student wanted to learn about education disparity on the basis of African Americans and latin x, then yes. However, the course summary was misleading in that I thought I was going to learn about education disparities across more minorities. For example, I would have loved to learn about education disparity for people with disabilities which almost no yale courses cover.",
