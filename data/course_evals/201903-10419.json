    "I learned how to think globally, paint better, and improved on finishing individual projects in short time spans.",
    "New style and approach to painting, learned a lot of the basics.",
    "This is a wonderful course, you will learn how to look at art critically and openly and how to think like a painter. Rob also provides incredibly helpful contextual anecdotes and references",
    "We learned oil and acrylic painting, beginning with abstract and geometric shapes, and ultimately transitioning to portraiture. This course was as much about learning how to see art as creating it.",
    "I learned art principles in an untraditional way. Our assignments were often simple like painting black lines but there are many key skills embedded within.",
    "I learned about composition and color mixing through the use of acrylic and oil paints."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: no prerequisite knowledge, not a lot of pressure to be \"talented\"\r\nWeaknesses: instructions for paintings were not clear during the first half of the semester, leading to confusion and doubt in students",
    "Instructions were sometimes unclear, seemed unorganized only a few times like when he would have us gather around his laptop or phone to look at certain painting, etc. Other than that he mostly let us paint the whole time which I thought was great.",
    "Rob is one of the most qualified and kind professors undergrads have access to",
    "I thought the course had a good balance of structure and freedom to experiment without penalty. The environment was very relaxed, and I felt I could focus on just improving my own work and appreciating the class for what it was rather than be stressed about the quality of my work.",
    "Strength: studio time\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
    "Most of the class is a work session where students get time to work on their paintings and the professor rotates around the room with comments specific to the student's painting, which is helpful to learn from. The beginning may feel a little slow, especially if you have experience with painting, but it helps lay the foundation of what you'll learn the rest of the semester. A weakness of the class is that it is very unstructured, with no syllabus and materials list at the beginning of the semester, so the plan for the coming classes is not made clear until one or two classes before or on the date of the class.",
    "I enjoyed the prompts that we tackled but do wish that the course had higher feedback from professors and peers and was a bit more fast-paced."

    "Yes, it is a great class and teaches you more about your physical space and paying attention to details.",
    "NO",
    "Yes it is a very good intro course for acrylic and oil paint and just a fun art class!",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in art or art history because it definitely changes your appreciation of painting. I would also recommend it if a student is looking to try an art class for fun but isnt necessarily interested in majoring in art.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in painting, whether you have experience or not. Much of the course is about your own personal growth as a painter, and the professor's comments are specific to you, which provides useful feedback."
