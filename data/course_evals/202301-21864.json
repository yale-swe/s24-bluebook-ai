                "The course expanded my scope of knowledge on immigration beyond the context of the United States and explored themes of multiculturalism and gendered migration which I found invaluable to my understanding of migration patterns.",
                "This was my first sociology class, so I used analytical techniques that I do not typically use. I also studied migration for the first time. It's a hot topic in my hometown that's filled with low-skilled and high-skilled migrants, and I was able to learn about and consider processes that happen in the Japanese and Korean migration markets to those in the American migration market. I've studied Japan and South Korea before, so I already knew about things like ethnic nationalism and a generalized unwillingness to let foreigners reside in the countries for an extended period of time. I would have never thought that Korea is increasingly becoming a multicultural society. That was very interesting to learn about.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths-readings were interesting\r\nWeaknesses-some readings were repetitive, and class discussion could be slow and dry.",
                "Strengths: manageable work, interesting and well organized \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: maybe a slightly more engaging project?",
                "I really enjoyed the format of class because we were able to discuss topics we read about in depth and had the opportunity to focus in on one week of readings and give a presentation at the beginning of class. All of the class presentations were extremely helpful in providing insight as to how my classmates viewed the topics we were learning about and it gave a lot of nuance to the discussions.",
                "The class is pretty solid. I cannot pick out a particular strength of the class. It's a good class. I appreciate the student presentations.\r\nI did like reading the instructor's own research. I frequently had questions on other readings that I would have liked to ask, but I took the opportunity to ask questions about Angela's research. I feel I learned the most from that, as I was able to ask questions directly to the author of a paper.\r\nThis is a nitpicky weakness, and dependent upon learning styles, but I think the class could be improved by changing up the class format once in a while. The class- not ever the readings- became monotonous. I think our classroom had media limitations, but bringing in more media would be nice. The teacher could even make us responsible for looking for Korean\/Japanese(\/Taiwanese\/Chinese) news about changes to migration laws and policies and briefly, informally report them at the beginning of class.",
                "The course is well-organized and the readings are interesting. Professor McClean is an effective leader during class discussions and is very knowledgeable on the topic. More variety could make the course more engaging; creative projects could be considered and alternative means of interaction should be considered instead of just discussion posts.",
                "Professor McClean is incredibly kind and understanding. She is very passionate about this topic, and it shows in the ways that she engages with students and the readings that she brings in. \r\n\r\nSometimes, the readings could be repetitive. The reading load was heavy every week, and also dense, which made engaging with all of it difficult at times. Student presentations were helpful for summarizing and generating discussion, but they also ran long due to the amount of material that needed to be covered. \r\n\r\nIt might be nice for there to be a mix of different types of articles and essays and media (art, films, videos, etc.) as materials for the class. I also wish that we could have had more readings that extended beyond East Asia, esp. beyond Korea and Japan."

The discussions were very valuable and I really enjoyed the formatting of the class.",
                "This is a very good, solid class. If someone is interested in learning about migration outside of the American or western context, this is the class for you. It's particularly pertinent as both Korea and Japan are experiencing population decline and constantly (considering) changing migration laws to compensate this fact.",
                "Definitely recommend! There are few classes about migration in East Asia and I've learned a lot!",
                "YES! This course was an extremely helpful introduction to the field of migration and is taught by a kind, knowledgeable professor who cares about her students."
