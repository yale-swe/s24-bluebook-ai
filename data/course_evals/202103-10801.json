                "This is an incredible course and Professor Goodrow is a fantastic professor. The syllabus is amazing -- a great blend of court cases and supplementary reading + documentaries. The people who decide to take this course often come in with specific areas of interest that relate to the First Amendment, and I learned a lot from them as well. Finally, the classroom environment is awesome. Professor Goodrow had a no laptops policy, and that made the discussions super engaging and meant that everyone prepared their notes in advance. She always responds to questions with great insight and commentary, and is able to steer the discussion in a way that feels incredibly fulfilling.",
                "A very nonchalant classroom environment where class seems more like a conversation than a course. Great material and professor that makes the course fun and steers class in the right directions when the class gets sidetracked.",
                "I really enjoyed the class, but I do think there could be some more attention spent on the text of the amendment itself, and when its various protections intersect (I.e. freedom of assembly vs speech)",
                "The discussions in this course are fascinating, and the instructor is a judge, so she (obviously) knows the law super well and does a great job of explaining it whenever it's confusing (which is often). I also really appreciated how well kg both directed discussion and encouraged us to engage with other students' points -- she really struck a good balance in a way that seminar instructors don't always do. The only weakness of the class is that discussion got a little off-track some weeks, and we sometimes didn't get to a decent chunk of the syllabus readings. It might've been nice for the pacing to be a little different in that regard (unless there were just fewer syllabus assignments/more recommended rather than required reading). But overall, a great course!",

                "Absolutely!! If you are at all interested in the law and/or questions of free speech, definitely take this class. It rocks. You will learn so much about how the law works, what the constitution covers and does not cover, how free speech exists in America, and more. I loved it!",
                "Yes it is a great course to explore the first amendment and discuss how the law impacts people in a tangible fashion.",
                "Yes I would. KG is an amazing professor!",
                "Yes I would. KG is the best and the readings and case selections were great. If you dont take her criminal case, take this one!",
                "Yes, if you're interested in learning about free speech through a variety of lenses. This class teaches can teach you a lot about First Amendment-related law if you come in with little knowledge (like I did), but it also reaches beyond that, and class discussions also touch upon ethical issues that affect individuals, private entities (like colleges & social media companies), and society as a whole. I thought a 6:30pm course might be burdensome to attend, but it actually ended up being a really fun two hours of discussion that I truly looked forward to every Wednesday evening.",
