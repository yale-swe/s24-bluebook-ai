It tickled the right parts of my brain to learn about microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments through foundational research in recent decades. Dean C also really emphasized the ways in which we could build on past knowledge of research laboratory techniques and the specific protocols in ways that supplemented my hands-on experience in my senior thesis lab.",

She also shares some of the most interesting anecdotes related to the research study at hand.\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, can't think of anything. Of my MCDB courses I've taken thus far as a senior, MCDB 355 was one of my favorites.",
                "Strengths: Dean C!!! Low course load that really helps you take time to focus on the papers each week without stressing out about assignments. Getting to choose when to do your 5 reading responses gave a lot of flexibility throughout the semester. Class was always so engaging and welcoming. I never felt pressured or nervous to speak. The papers, although sometimes dense, were really interesting!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none"

                "Yes. Great course for upper-level MCDB students.",
                "Yes, Dean C is great and the course is fine. However, if you are interested in the cytoskeleton and actually do the readings, just keep in mind that at times no one reads the paper and they just get away with it. Therefore, it might be better to learn how to \"bs\" your way through figure presentations rather than actually reading anything, as students would literally take notes and read the paper while other students would present.",

                "yes, Dean C is amazing and this is a great senior seminar! The workload is pretty light as well",
                "Yes!! I took it as a major requirement for MCDB, but I know that this was the right choice. The care and thought that Dean C puts into her classes really does show. Take this as a senior if you're having any doubts about which senior seminar is the right one for you! I never knew I could learn so much about the cytoskeleton and specific lab techniques that I've never done before in lab, and find it all so interesting.",
                "Yes! Definitely take it! Dean C is an amazing professor, and the class itself was incredible. I truly enjoyed taking it and looked forward to going each week. The papers were really interesting and help you get used to reading scientific literature."
