                "The strength of this course was that it taught from the ground up, and the professor and TF were truly excellent educators. I really liked the course design, I dont think there was a weakness in it.",
                "Strengths: The course has a mix of challenging and straightforward assignments, which helps understand how to work with the FPGA and sets an excellent background for the project. All the assignments are assigned and completed by the mid-semester of the term, giving a fair amount of time to work on a course project.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Hands-on practice with commercial cloud FPGAs such as AWS was missing. An assignment around that could be given as an extra credit assignment, and it would be a nice challenge.",
                "Very interesting final project as an open ended research problem. We got to read up on a security-related issue, investigate potential approaches to compromise the FPGA, and try out the techniques in the lab. This was a great highlight and let us practice various EE knowledge together (e.g. use signal analysis to make sense of the raw data collected). Professor Jakub's slides are also very well organised and great to read.",
                "It was a good class on cloud FPGAs but since I didn't have a huge background of FPGAs beforehand it took a bit to get familiar with the basic concepts and language. That's less of an issue with this class though, more of an Yale EE major side effect.",
                "The strengths of this course is the availability and support offered by Professor Szefer. One weakness of the course is the lack of information provided on hardware description language. The course can be improved by more time spent on how to implement hardware description language for module design.",
                "We worked on an assigned project throughout the semester. The project was interesting but not completely related to the material taught in class",
                "Awesome class.",
                "The course was great.\r\nI see no improvements other than more practicals.",
                "The FPGA learning framework designed for this course is excellent! There are also quite a lot resources provided for students for preparing their projects.\r\n\r\nOne thing could be improved is that there can be more assignments on the FPGA security part. The assignments for the second part of the class is a little weak compared to the first part which is very well designed."

                "Yes, for aspiring hardware design engineers this course is highly recommended. The course consists of cutting-edge assignments and projects which will make you ready to work on real-world applications. The course facilitates very well (by providing enough background in the introductory lectures) even the students who do not have a prior hardware development background can learn about cloud FPGA development.",
                "Yes, great way to gain Verilog programming skills which are important for electrical engineering. The pace of the class is also very reasonable, and the final project is doable with enough planning earlier during the semester. Be careful of real-world bugs when working with the FPGAs however, as there will very likely be some unexpected issue that complicates data collection. Still, one of the more exciting EE courses in my opinion.",
                "If they were interested in the material I would recommend it.",

                "Yes! Working on a novel project and presenting your findings was a very fulfilling part of this class. Professor Szefer is also awesome!",
