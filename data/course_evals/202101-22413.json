If you scroll through some of the \"Tonnetz\" diagrams in the Wikipedia page for Neo-Riemannian theory, you'll get a rough idea of some of the material. One very important thing to know if you're thinking of taking this class is that you're not going to find any of the material anywhere else. The only material you're going to have are whatever notes you take in class, plus what Dr. Cohn calls the textbook  which are basically lecture notes plus a bunch of additional detail. You'll be heavily leaning on the notes you take. If you take good notes everything will be much, much easier than if you don't (that's true in general but especially for this class).",

                "I found that the first 6 weeks of this course were quite boring. I did not like the way that it was being taught and found I was not being given proper motivation/justification for what we were doing. However, after this, the course became excellent! it was intellectually challenging and I enjoyed how it was taught.",
                "The weekly psets were exceptionally difficult, and took a ridiculous amount of time to complete (~8 hours per pset).",
                "Strengths: Prof. Cohn is amazing. He is very knowledgable and a great positive influence. It was a lecture, but it felt like a seminar in terms of the engagement. The readings were very well-written.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:",
                "The strength of the course is that the premise is to use mathematical objects to model musical ideas. In practice, this is efficient and pragmatic. At times, however, the reliance on pictures and/or \"black box\" techniques to convey concrete mathematical ideas was less effective. The course, in theory, could be presented from the perspective of a trained mathematician, who is fully interested in the rigor and maturity associated with high-level mathematical topics; but this would on the other hand alienate people not interested in the formalities of pure math.",
                "I think this class would've really benefitted from having sections. It felt like I had to teach myself most of the material through the psets instead of in lecture. Professor Cohn is incredibly knowledgable about this topic, though, and I enjoyed learning from someone so passionate.",
                "Strengths: Prof Cohn is great. He's really passionate about the material and just gets excited teaching it, which makes class nice. The problem sets really helped me get a handle on the material and made me internalize the concepts, which was a huge help for making the class make sense. \r\nWeaknesses: I feel like I didn't learn that much about music in this class. While Cohn made a good effort to motivate all the things we learned, I think we focused on very niche and contrived examples. But the math was cool!",
                "Strengths: Ability to ask questions during lecture and office hours.\r\nWeaknesses: Weekly problem sets were overwhelming, as was the final exam. Questions that are open ended felt impossible to master without more direction and guidance.",
                "The problem sets were wonderfully thought provoking and I looked forward to them each week. The course was well-structured, giving time for a music theory refresh in the first month before naturally moving from topic to topic. However, there were times in the course where certain topics seemed overly abstract and unmotivated, so I think it is important to refer back to musical applications as often as possible.",
                "This course started off strong for me because it was very exciting to be able to put a mathematical structure to the music. As a cellist I had often thought about the mathematical structures of music while I was playing, and it was quite satisfying to begin a more formal investigation of things that I feel like most musicians have contemplated. I was always eager to see what was coming next, because I thought I would use these mathematical ideas to have an aha moment where I could better understand a musical idea. However, I feel like at times we became quite disconnected from music. We spent a lot of effort to put musical ideas into mathematical definitions, but I don't think they deepened my understanding of subject. For example, we were making graphs of diatonic 2 note space and made the observation that it was a torus. I was left with the feeling: \"great, but so what?\" Because we spent so much time moving musical ideas over to a mathematical domain, what I really wanted to see was the use of developments in the mathematical domain to aid our understanding of music. Is there some theorem from topology that helps us to understand some feature of music? What new is in this course that I wouldn't be able to understand through a more traditional music theory class?\r\n\r\nAll in all, math of music was still one of my favorite classes of the semester. There were ideas that were new and surprising to me, and the class is exceptionally well taught. I just would have liked to see some more rationale/application to music/payoff from our mathematical investigations.",
                "A strength of the course was that it was well paced - not too fast or too slow.  A weakness was that the textbook was being written by Prof. Cohn as the class went on, so there was really only one explanation/POV for each topic for the students.",
                "The material is interesting and the assessment is fairly reasonable.  The textbook and TA were both extremely helpful.",
                "One strength is that there was a progression of information being taught, so one concept more or less led to the next concept. The information; however, is not particularly applicable either for musicians or mathematicians because of how obscure they are. While it is interesting to know something most people in this world do not know, it is very unlikely that the information will come up in the future unless you study it in particular. The problem sets were also quite difficult and sometimes very time-consuming because there is essentially only one place to get information (the provided textbook) and sometimes do not have straight forward answers.",
                "In general the course was interesting, but there definitely needs to be some polishing. Some times topics felt unmotivated and couldve been explained better.",
                "Strengths: well-taught, lectures and reading go very hand-in-hand, and professor was very engaged with the students\r\nWeaknesses: problem sets could have better feedback, problem set solutions would have also been very helpful",
                "Really good course and very clear lectures.",
                "The material is fascinating, and lectures are given in such a way as to facilitate comprehension, especially when the material is more challenging. The problem sets were very well-constructed to practice and asses what we had learned that week. The textbook (written by the professor) was good, but sometimes there was some lack of clarity about notation norms and things like that (which I'm sure will get worked out in future iterations of this course).",
                "The information taught was very interesting. Sometimes, I think explanations were too simplified and expected outside knowledge or a certain way of thinking.",
                "Grading was a bit unclear and ambiguous. Setting up the course so that there would have been a greater distribution of assignments and points within assignments would have made the course grade less sensitive to minor errors. Overall, though, I enjoyed Prof. Cohn and his enthusiasm about the subject matter. Hallie was a very helpful and kind TF as well.",
                "some problem set questions were essentially impossible to get right because there was no right answer. the professor would ask us to speculate about something and if you don't speculate the way he wants you to (which is impossible to predict) then there was no way to get it and the feedback on these types of questions was never helpful",
                "The main strength of the course is that Dr. Cohn clearly cares very much about the class, and is very enthusiastic and available to help students. The weaknesses of the course mostly stem from the intense workload and opaque grading. We would have a week to complete each homework (sometimes less) and I would end up spending probably between twenty and thirty hours on each one. Questions similar to \"speculate how X could be interpreted in the context of Y\" were relatively common on the homeworks, and on open-ended questions like these the grading was particularly opaque. It was not uncommon to see just a PDF annotation with a score and no elaboration for grading. Additionally, the graders' interpretations of definitions provided in the textbook were often inconsistent, both between graders and for the same grader on different homeworks.",
                "The course material is interesting at times, and every unit builds on the previous units. In that sense, I think that the curriculum is well-designed. However, the course material didn't offer nearly as many real-world applications as I would have hoped. While I feel like I learned some cool things, I'm not sure how much I've benefitted from learning these things. Some of the technical aspects of the course had minor issues, such as the relatively frequent typos/mistakes on the PSET's, which hinder learning and easily frustrates students when they are a bit too regular.",
                "This course is an incredibly captivating recasting of musical truths taken for granted by musicians as echoes of the properties of the small numbers upon which different cultures build their musical and rhythmic systems. It allows musicians and friends of music to see musical theory from a completely new perspective and provides satisfying answers to many questions traditional music theory teaching leaves unanswered. The mathematical methods introduced are very accessible and require no technical knowledge above algebra, yet are likely to be new and exciting even for students with advanced backgrounds in mathematics. My one remark would be that the course introduces many novel ways of analyzing music, but discusses few actual examples of applying these analytical tools to real music. It would have been fascinating to see more examples of the ideas we learnt about at play in compositions from different times/genres/cultures.",
                "It was a fun course that introduced some topics of interest to both math and music people. It was extremely slow-paced for me but I was probably very over-qualified, which I knew going into it, so this isn't necessarily something that should change."

I often struggled to feel like I understood what I was doing in this class.",

                "I want to preface this recommendation by giving some background about myself: I play an instrument, don't have music theory background, and despite my love of music, I am more of an enthusiast than a serious musician/composer. I also enjoy math a lot.\r\n\r\nI gained a lot of curiosities from taking this course. It was certainly neat to see the generality of some ideas in music and how we could use math to understanding some underlying structures of music that are conserved between different cultures of music. However I worry that in the future if somebody asks me to apply my knowledge, the conversation will go somewhat along the lines of: \r\n\r\n\"What do you notice about this music?\"\r\n\"You can trace the chord progression out on a tonnetz!\"\r\n\"So what?\"\r\n\"I don't know\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps this feeling stems from my lack of music theory knowledge and music in general. If you have time and are curious about music, I would still recommend this class. Just make sure you are asking the right questions so it remains interesting to you.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in music or math (ideally both!).",
                "This is a pretty good fifth or sixth credit, especially if you have a decent background in mathematics (and to a lesser extent music).",
                "No",
                "I would recommend this to someone that is particularly interested in the mathematics of music and not the two subjects by themselves. Although I love music and math, the combination of the two did not feel very meaningful. The problem sets were also quite difficult so you do have to put a good amount of effort in. If you think it would be cool to know about an extremely obscure topic and also want the distributional credits, I would recommend this class.",
                "Ehhh. Im a CS major interested in music. At times I was frustrated at how handwavy the course felt. It wasnt a lot of work, and the grading was pretty fair, so if you want a chill credit, go for it.",
                "It's a pretty interesting class that really gives you a new perspective in many musical concepts! However, prior knowledge of basic music theory, e.g. reading treble and bass clef key signatures, and chords, is EXTREMELY recommended.",
                "Absolutely. I really enjoyed the material and found the workload manageable. Perhaps would have been more difficult for a grade (I took it Credit/D/fail) but I had a very good experience.",
                "It depends on what they are looking for. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants an interesting, off-the-beaten-path investigation into the intersection of math and music, but I would not recommend it to those who want to stay more focused on core subjects and applicable learning.",
                "It depends. I would recommend the class to math-inclined students, but not music-inclined ones. When I talked to my music friends, they were often much more confused about topics than my math friends, who had an easier time grasping topics.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student, assuming the changes to grading I mentioned were made. Otherwise, I would recommend another music theory class. (This is nothing against Prof. Cohn or the course content, but the high sensitivity of the course grade to small errors made it unnecessarily stressful).",
                "A hesitant yes. The material is interesting but it is difficult to wrap your head around. THIS IS NOT A QR GUT! I could see it as a humanities gut but definitely not QR.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you have a decent grasp on music notation and basic theory (able to immediately know the notes in all the major and minor scales, able to quickly determine the interval between two notes, etc.), and if you want to spend a lot of time doing set and graph theory calculations on music-theoretical concepts. Taking the course will give you a new perspective on music theory, and a lot of the concepts you touch are really interesting, but you should be prepared for a very heavy workload. Additionally, (and this may change with Zoom vs in-person classes) the classes are fairly intense (cold-calling is quite common), and the grading was also rather opaque.",
                "Unlikely. This class may work ok for students that are looking for a 5th class that is relatively light in workload, interested in and have backgrounds in both math and music, and are simply looking for a class that might have interesting bits of information every once in a while. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this class, as I didn't feel very engaged (may be due to the online format) during the semester, and there are probably better options out there.",
                "I would greatly recommend this course to anyone who enjoys music, especially to musicians who might find music theory boring, and most of all to composers who seek the formula for a captivating piece.",
                "Yes, I took this course as a \"gut\" for me since I have a strong background in both math and music, and for that purpose it was great. It took up very little time in my schedule but was still interesting. It might be challenging for people with very poor math backgrounds."
