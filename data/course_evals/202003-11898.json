            "comments": [
                "Prof. Vaccaro's lectures are very organized and easy to follow.",
                "Strengths: Prof Vaccaro is a good lecturer and makes pchem as interesting as it gets I guess. The weekly problem sets, though a little long, were reasonable. The first midterm was too long so he corrected that for the second midterm and final by making them shorter, which was appreciated. \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are quite fast\/dense and it would be helpful if Prof Vaccaro would pause for questions. Also it would be nice if we could drop one pset since there was one every week. Meeting during reading period was not fun.",
                "Strengths: 1) You will learn a lot in this class. I have a deep conceptual and mathematical understanding of the material. 2) There is support in this class - use the instructor office hours, TAs for pset help, peer tutor reviews before the exams. The textbook is also great. 3) The documentation for this class is BEAUTIFUL. Professor Vaccaro's slides are colorful and clear and contain all the information you need. I appreciate how he would walk through every single step on the slides. The additional documents he posts to Canvas are also useful. And the pset answer keys are really clear! Clearly a lot of thought has gone into this class. 4) The extra credit on the later psets was great practice for the exams, and I really appreciated it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) The psets are long and tedious. Sometimes the psets will have parts a-k, and sometimes you'll be repeating a calculation you already did two or three times. While I understand the value in repetition, this adds up and doesn't contribute to your conceptual understanding of the material. The psets are so long that there isn't enough time in section to address everybody's confusion. Also some of that confusion is because 2) material covered in Friday lecture will be needed for the pset due Friday at 5pm. Maybe pushing that deadline to Saturday would be nice. 3) I wish we had exam answer keys - there wasn't enough time in section to go over the entire exam. 4) There is value in having to go through the equation sheet and understand all the equations for yourself. But there is nothing like having 10 min left in an exam and being unable to find the formula for the Joule-Thomson coefficient. Even slight grouping of topics or headings would save a lot of stress on the exam. 5) Lecture is dense. This is ok. It is less ok during reading week. It is very difficult to try to internalize old material while also learning a lot of new material - I ended up having to watch the reading week lectures 3 times each to get a grasp on the material, which not only impacted my ability to study for my pchem final but also for my other finals. The class is quite slow in the beginning  (first two weeks or so) - what if that part was faster to avoid this reading week lecture?",
                "Strengths are that you get a very vigorous overview of thermodynamics.",
                "Strenghts:\r\n-super well organized\r\n-very well-thought out and planned lectures\r\n-fair homeworks and tests",
                "A huge strength is that the entire course is mostly structured around the textbook. This makes it easy to refer to the text if you ever need anything and have your problem solved. We were also given plenty of resources to contextualize topics we were learning about, which were uploaded to Canvas.",
                "I think it's a pretty standard course for physical chemistry and drills down on the concepts it covers. The material was effectively presented and paced.",
                "The course was very organized but I felt like the professor was rushing through all the material",
                "The course material is presented very clearly during lecture, but a large amount of information is given in a short period of time. A slower pace would greatly improve this course. The PSETs are difficult and time consuming, but they are a decent indicator as to what the exams will be like.",
                "Strengths of this course is wonderful TA's and an available professor. Weaknesses include too much information and not enough explanation and tying ideas to the big picture. Exams are unnecessarily difficult and soul crushing. Additionally, the problem sets were unnecessarily long and arduous, often covering material we had not learned in class yet.",
                "All of the instructors and teaching fellows were excellent, the content was compelling and often put into a real-world context, and the grading weights were definitely fair. However, a couple of aspects of this course really didn't work for me and I'm sure many other students as well. For one, the first exam was borderline unfair with the amount of time we were given. Prof. Vaccaro definitely realized this and amended it with the following two tests, but I would've appreciated if that didn't happen in the first place. Also, the strategy of having homework based on the next week's content did not work for me, as I often just robotically walked through the PSets without actually understanding why I did what I did. I would've definitely also liked to be given any sort of practice material before the first exam, which was again amended for the second exam and the final via the extra credit problems. Lastly, I think the instructors did a good job preventing the environment of the class from getting too toxic or competitive, but they definitely need to not hire peer tutors that will send the exam distributions from the previous year in an attempt to \"scare\" us into studying.",
                "I thought this course was just bad all around.",
                "I enjoyed the material of Chem332a! Professor Vaccaro writes excellent problem sets and demonstrates his care for the material. He is willing to meet with any students and discuss chemistry. Additionally, his Powerpoints were excellent. They were clear and engaging. That being said, I have one criticism of this course: NO LECTURES DURING READING WEEK. The fact we had two lectures (Monday and Wednesday) before our final on Friday was ridiculous. I do not understand why that was necessary.",
                "This course has so much help, just go to discussion sections and office hours and everyone is willing to help you understand the topics. Highly recommended that you create your own study group, so that you can guide and help each other work through the dense problem sets.",
                "I don't particularly like the textbook (Atkins) and think the course would benefit from a different book like Simon & McQuarrie. I think the course would benefit from a different structure - maybe spending the first couple of classes on mathematics to familiarize students with the kind of partial derivative\/path variable\/etc. thinking that PChem requires. There was a big disparity between the difficulty of the Psets  (which were time consuming but very easy) and the difficulty of the exams. Finally, I wish the course content was better motivated -- I don't really understand the significance or utility of some of the material we learned.",
                "The tests were fair, but there was not a lot of practice for them. It was one of those classes where the teacher gives normal homework and the exam is nothing like it. Also you NEED a good foundation in math",
                "Strengths: Nothing out of the ordinary compared to an average class.\r\nWeaknesses: Its status as a requirement for the chemistry  major.",
                "This course brings up some very interesting concepts but unfortunately most of the lectures are dry mathematical derivations that lack proper context and explanation as to what is actually happening. You feel somewhat confident that you understand the material but then you get absolutely destroyed by the exams and realize how much you don't understand. Everything in the class asks for something different. Lectures speak mainly in math and don't give good definitions and explanations for what is really happening (the big picture). Psets are lots of computations and draw directly on formulas. Exams are require that you understand what is really going on along each step of certain processes\/theories. There is no cohesion between the three. As a result, I am walking away from this class without not knowing anything concrete, which is really unfortunate. I would recommend that in lectures, the professor should focus much less on tedious derivations (including those as supplements for people interested) and rather emphasize definitions (what does enthalpy actually mean compared to internal energy, what does the Born Solvation model measure) and the big picture things (talking about how heat, work, internal energy, and enthalpy change in certain situations).",
                "it's a very well organized class that is packed with information.",
                "The psets are way too difficult, some of the questions are impossible to answer without the TA's help, especially if you're not extremely comfortable with math.",
                "Tough material but great professor. Everything was done well.",
                "I think that this course did a good job at teaching thermodynamics. I thought that the course was a little to fast at some points, and the exams were more challenging than the homework problem sets, but overall it was a good course.",
                "Professor Vaccaro did a wonderful job providing lecture slides for every class, helpful supplementary documents for some topics, and detailed Pset solutions. He always stayed after class to answer student questions and was willing to meet outside of his scheduled office hours if there was a conflict. The TAs and peer tutors were fantastic as well! I felt that this course was very organized and there were many opportunities all throughout the week (and some of the weekend) to get help. I didn't engage much with other students in the course this semester, but this is not the fault of the course itself and more so the nature of online learning in a lecture-style course. Perhaps there could be some breakout sessions in class in which students would work on an easy example problem, but honestly I think the lectures were efficient and helpful as they were, and students could always ask a question during class if confusion came up. Another way this course could be improved is with some sample conceptual questions before exams as a sort of baseline knowledge check. As Professor Vaccaro and the TAs\/peer tutors suggested many times, the homework problems were helpful to review, as they often resembled the longer-response questions on the exam. However, sometimes I was hoping to do a brief check of my intuition\/basic ideas that might help especially with the true-false questions on the exam.",
                "Very interesting content. It was hard for me to stay engaged during lecture, unfortunately. Lectures felt very dry and methodical, and it would have been really helpful if time was taken to step back a bit and discuss the overall picture of the processes we had learned.",
                "Professor Vaccaro is clear and speaks live as if it's a recorded and edited video. He explains the background or derivation behind every concept and challenges his students but does what he can to encourage success. Great professor and course.",
                "The strength was the depth in which he covered the topics",
                "Exams weren't overly difficult, I wish the grading was more transparent though.",
                "The course was very organized and expectations for tests and problem sets were made very clear. Sometimes, problem sets were challenging, but we could go to office hours to get help on them.",
                "Lectures were not very engaging, and although our professor was pretty approachable and willing to answer questions, I didnt really know what I didnt know following lecture which made the class pretty difficult",
                "Overall, this class was one of the most organized courses I've ever taken. Professor Vaccaro's lectures and presentations are extremely thorough and detailed. He posts all the presentations and the corresponding in-class notes from each lecture. There are also supplementary handouts for certain topics. The midterms and weekly psets are tough, but there is ample support available for students via the teaching fellows, peer tutors, and Vaccaro's office hours."

I think that would be similar if in-person, though; it's just the nature of very condensed 50 minute lectures. Live section was absolutely helpful for the psets. Instructor office hours were very helpful for conceptual understanding. Overall, the class transitioned well to Zoom. I appreciated the windows of time given for the exams, but I will note that this is my only class that did not have open-note exams.",
                "It was good!",
                "Recorded lectures and large time windows for exams were a huge plus, especially since I was in an inconvenient time zone.",
                "I thought the virtual lectures mimicked in person lectures.",
                "Virtual sections were helpful. Online exams were stressful with the time limit and uploading responses.",
                "Everything COVID-related was excellent, Prof. Vaccaro was by far and away my best prepared professor for remote teaching.",
                "I thought that the office hours, discussion sections, and live lectures (which were recorded) worked very well.",
                "This class could be taken asynchronouly, which is great but definitely worth it to be in class to ask any questions on the topics being discussed.",
                "The professor would see whether people came to live lectures even though they were recorded, which was annoying",
                "This class showed little to no regard for how COVID impacts students beyond recording lectures. There was never a comment about student well-being, even after the tumultuous period after the election. After the first and second midterms, the professor stated that he would have hoped the average would be a letter grade higher, which placed blame on students for not studying hard enough. Then he gave students \"optional\" extra credit assignments, which were effectively required since the class is based on a curve; this gave students additional work beyond the tedious psets, listening to the lectures, and spending lots of time outside of class trying to actually understand the material. The lectures remained resolutely focused on equations which was incredibly hard to understand due to the lecturing style and the virtual nature. Again, lectures should focus less on derivations and more on concepts. The pset questions should have largely been in the extra credit question style (which is most like the exams) and additional problems should not have been assigned out of respect to students and the exhausting situation of COVID. What did succeed was the professor sticking to the 50 minute lectures.",
                "Having lectures be recorded and the class notes posted\/the class slides posted was an immense help and greatly facilitated my learning in this course. It was very useful to be able to look back on them.",
                "I think that more interaction in zoom lectures could have helped piqued interest in the course, as the lectures would often become boring.",
                "I think the discussion sections and peer tutoring sessions were very helpful to keep us engaged this semester. Perhaps the lecture could involve a few interactive moments, like presenting a quick question to the class for a student to answer, but I actually enjoyed the efficient, though still thorough, teaching of Professor Vaccaro.",
                "Side by side Ipad and slides format was really great! Lectures unfortunately still felt somewhat clinical and hard to interact with.",
                "Saving the virtual lectures to the media library such that they could be rewatched helped a great deal.",
                "None",
                "I liked the dual ipad + slides lecture method. Writing out the material with the iPad was helpful as students could follow along while taking notes. There was also plenty of office hours for students to attend if we had questions.",
                "Online lectures were not very engaging, but having peer tutors who were willing to go through the material was very helpful, and they handled the online platform pretty well",
                "Having the lectures recorded and available on Panopto was very helpful."

                "I mean I wouldn't take this for fun but if you're a chemistry major you probably have to, and it's not a terrible class. Personally I don't find pchem that interesting but the class was fine. Weekly problem sets take like 3-4 hours and this semester there were 2 midterms and a final that were I guess reasonable difficulty.",
                "Overall, this course is very well-organized, and you will learn a lot. Be prepared to put in time (especially for some of the more tedious psets AND during reading week lectures), but your time should pay off. Rewatch lecture slowly and rewrite in your own words. Read the textbook. Spend time to understand the psets (section will help). Do the extra credit. Break down the equation sheet. Go to peer tutor reviews.",
                "If you are taking it, you probably have to.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend it to another student. I think the ratio of stress it causes to the benefit \/ material learned and internalized is far too great.",
                "yeah, but you have to be willing to put in the time so that you don't fall behind. it moves quickly",
                "Sure! It's not as bad as everyone says. It's a great way to dive into thermodynamics. The problem sets are a little long sometimes, but it's not super out there stuff. Plus Professor Vaccaro is super organized",
                "If you're looking at the course, chances are it's a requirement so you've got no choice. It's not as bad as the reviews suggest as long as you stay on top of the work and make sure you understand the fundamental principles behind what you learn (always seek to explain why a phenomenon occurs). The exams were very similar in difficulty and content to the problem sets, so you are always well equipped to perform well.",
                "Yes. This class is well taught and a necessary foundation for higher level chemistry.",
                "If you like chemistry, then yes",
                "No, I would not recommend this course to another student, but, unfortunately, the likelihood someone is interested in the class is because it is required.",
                "If you're an MB&B major, take the other version of PChem, because you won't find many useful applications of the content for you in this class. Otherwise, you probably have to take this class, so definitely go ahead and do it.",
                "Absolutely not, unless you have to take it for a major requirement.",
                "I would recommend this course to any students interested in thermodynamics. Professor Vaccaro is a good lecturer who is organized and knowledgable. Additionally, you learn important mathematical principles which will be useful in future courses. This PSETs are fun, and you learn how to tackle complicated problems.",
                "The class is really good at reviewing and going through the textbook in detail. It follows the textbook really well and if you understand it, the course is a breeze until you study for exams.",
                "I thought this was a pretty painful course when I was taking it. Having finished, I think I can be a bit more objective and say that I am happy that I took this class, as I now have a solid foundation in thermodynamics that will be useful in other courses. If that sounds appealing to you I would certainly recommend this course.",
                "only if you need it for major",
                "If you're taking this, likely you're a chem major, and are required to. Otherwise, you probably just don't want to. It's a whole lot of math with none of the real-world implication that makes chemistry interesting.",
                "Certainly not unless you must take this course. I am walking away feeling like I didn't actually learn much of anything, which is sad since a lot of the material is very interesting.",
                "it's needed for your major most likely and definitely not a class to be taken lightly",
                "Not unless you need it for your major or are very good at math. It is far too much work even though it is interesting.",
                "As a requirement, but its a tough course.",
                "I would recommend this course only to chemistry students. I see no reason to take this course otherwise.",
                "One of the worst courses Ive taken at Yale. Pointlessly made difficult, especially for FGLI students. Professor has previously this is done to decrease number of chem majors and was banned from teaching pchem lab. Do not take it",
                "Yes! I was very nervous about taking this course at the beginning of the semester because I had heard numerous rumors of confusing, never-ending material and crazy exams. But I have to say this was honestly one of my favorite courses I've taken so far! There were definitely times that I felt a little confused and needed to go back and read the textbook\/Professor Vaccaro's documents a few times, but I think you will always run into challenges along the way in any course. Professor Vaccaro, Lidor, Ray, and the peer tutors were so kind and willing to make sure we understood the material, so I always felt safe that I would get something eventually even if I didn't see it on my own right away. I felt that the exams were actually very reasonable, and I think part of the reason why I didn't do so well on the first exam is actually because I was so nervous by what I heard before and then was confused why things weren't as complicated as I was expecting. All this is to say, Vaccaro and the TAs want you to succeed and there aren't any tricks! I know it probably depends on the student and their natural interests, but I truly enjoyed this material, as it was SOMEWHAT more mathematical than previous chemistry courses, and incorporated basic mechanics sometimes to give some descriptions of the physical world. I know some students that aren't as excited about math might be really worried by the previous reviews, and I was too because I haven't taken a math class in a couple years now, but the integrals\/derivatives that we used on homework\/exams were very basic (no crazy substitutions). So, sometimes the stuff looks scary because of the many terms in some equations (P, T, V, S, U, H, etc.), but Professor Vaccaro provides the relations between variables on the formula sheets for the exams and reviews the basic properties of partial derivatives both in lecture and on one of his course documents. I think this can be a great class for anyone, so I hope you don't psych yourself out too much beforehand (like I did) and just ask\/listen to questions!! You can definitely do well if you push through the longer problems, don't be afraid to talk to others, believe in yourself, and try to have fun with it!",
                "The subject material was super interesting, but incredibly difficult. I would recommend this course only if you are very interested in the topic (or it is required for your major).",
                "Yes. If you're a chemistry major you have to take it, but if you just want a better understanding of concepts as fundamental and important as thermodynamics...take it.",
                "Yes! Vaccaro was great online. TAs are amazing.",
                "Yes, I feel that I got a lot out of this course. The material is very dense and we covered so many topics. Sometimes, it can seem overwhelming, but overall the course is well organized, which helps with understanding the material.",
                "Not unless its a requirement for your major",
                "Yes, but you usually only need to take this course for your major."
