The organization of the course was very good. I felt like the topics flowed nicely into each other. Peer tutor session were also very helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The explorations felt more like busy work at times than anything else.",

                "Strengths: I think the major strength of this course is that it allows you to seriously develop some of your math skills, and it introduces you to complex topics that you may not have come across in high school. This should be a good course if you did well in AP Calc AB\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: MAJOR inconsistencies among the different sections in this course. I was lucky to be in a good section, but that was only after switching from a professor who seemed largely unprepared for this type of learning. Additionally, I was displeased to see the amount of students who had placed in higher level courses who were allowed to drop into this one. For them, it was essentially a review, whereas with other students, it was hard to stay afloat, which made the grading non representative of the whole.",
                "Recorded lectures and more thoughtful instrutcion",
                "Perhaps the only thing that could be improved would be adding a break during class as it sometimes takes a toll on students to sit on the Zoom nonstop for an hour fifteen minutes, and is not ideal to be continuous with no breaks in between for students to get up, stretch, etc..",
                "Strengths: A lot of time between homework assignments which allows you enough time to learn the material and get help if you need it; a lot of opportunity for review before exams\r\nWeakness: Instruction during class unclear at some times; little to no student collaboration during class",
                "Professor Vandenboom did a fantastic job teaching this course to us all and there were ample resources available to succeed.",
                "I liked the peer tutoring which definitely helped me a ton to learn calculus II. I think that office hours are also a great strenght as they allow for a more one-on-one lecture. I think that a weakness from the class is that their is low engagement but that is more attributed to the zoom format.",
                "One of the weaknesses was that the types of problems we went over in class were often at a lower level of difficulty than what we were expected to do on the problem sets or on the exams. It would've been helpful if we had gone over a wider variety of problems. One of the strengths was that class was very engaging because the professor did polls throughout, so that we could solve problems on our own before he walked us through the answer.",
                "The lectures were absolutely perfect. Dr. VandenBoom was especially great with engaging the class in his lectures, especially using the poll feature where he would write down a question on his tablet and we would solve it and enter our answer in a poll. It was a great way to judge how well you had understood the material thus far in the lecture. I don't think I would change anything about his lectures because they were great! One weakness of the course would probably be the exploration modules. Although they were a really good idea, sometimes the concepts would not be clearly explained and I wouldn't really learn much from them. They personally were not that helpful all the time as an introduction to the next lectures. However, I think that the explorations could be improved by implementing more short videos in between each question to introduce the concepts in a better way.",

                "Great explanations",

                "I know instruction varied a lot by section and teacher. There is a weekly pset to cover material worked in class. Only some of the sections had interactive portions of the lecture where teachers checked students' understanding. Thankfully, there is a class-wide review before each test that students from all sections can join. The practice exams and solution guides were posted to canvas which helped studying at student's convenience."
