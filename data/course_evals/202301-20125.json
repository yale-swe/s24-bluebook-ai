                "French was one of my favorite classes! It's so consistent and well-organized, and I do think there's a lot of faculty support for students who need it. A lot of work on grammar though, and sometimes I wish we had more preparation time for quizzes -- a lot of quiz formats were different than the Course Packet so I often felt surprised on the day of the quiz even though I studied a lot for it",
                "The strength of this course was definitely professor Bedoui. She was so patient and kind while also setting high expectations for us. She was a fantastic instructor, and I grew as a student significantly with her guidance. It could be improved by making sure that the quizzes and exams were more similar. They often tested on the same skills but in very different ways which could be confusing.",
                "The course is very organized and the grammar worksheets and review sheets are very helpful for studying. I really liked being split up into groups and having more casual group discussions in French about the stories we were reading or about what we were doing for the weekend. The group discussions helped me feel more comfortable speaking French and I wish we did more group discussions.",
                "strengths: intense grammar practice, interesting readings \r\nweakness: not much talking / speaking, difficult grading",
                "Strengths are class discussion, and I would prefer more in-class practice",
                "All of the assignments are well-catered to the course. I think there is too much homework for a class that meets every day. I feel that we should have no more than an hour of work per night because that equates to 5 hours per week of homework just in one class, which is fairly normal for other Yale courses. More than that and I often found it extremely difficult to complete, and students often did not do the homework.",

                "Quite frankly, I would not unless incredibly passionate about learning french. If you are looking for a course to purely fulfill the language requirement, look elsewhere. French as a whole will drain a lot of time, just by what it expects you to complete each and every night.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially someone who just finished French 130 because it helps you get a firmer grasp on French grammar and you learn more about the francophone world through the different texts that we read in the class. I would also definitely recommend that anyone who chooses to take this class should get a head start on the final project during Spring break at least, so you'll be less stressed out towards the end of the semester.",
                "yes, if you need it. It's better than L3 and your grammar will improve.",
                "If the student thinks that they are interested in French culture, yes",
                "I would recommend this course, but only if you have a fairly light schedule otherwise.",
