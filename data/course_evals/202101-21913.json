                "The topics covered in this course were interesting, but it was a bit disorganized. It could be improved if it had more structure. The bar for mathematical knowledge coming in was too low, so too much time was spent on catching up on various techniques and not enough time on really digging in.",

                "Strengths: coding learning, interesting material\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the professor wasn't really communicative with his TAs about things, there were quite a few mistakes on the homework and the professor wasn't very good at admin stuff for the class. Additionally, while Slack was used relatively affectively, if an announcement was made that was highly important for the whole class, it should be announced using canvas. The professor also did not respond readily to emails and was a little confusing in how he taught the material."

It won't necessarily blow your mind on its own; you have to come in with some interest or you'll likely get bored. I think you could either skate by in this class and get nothing out of it, or put some thought into the things we discuss and have a good experience.",

Also its not too hard of a class just a little confusing. The professor and TAs are really nice but again, the Professor can explain things pretty confusingly."
