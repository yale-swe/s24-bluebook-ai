(homogeneous, isotropic, elastic) material and apply it to word problems; use of Navier-Stokes equation to characterize different kinds of fluid flows (Poiseuille, Couette, and plug flow); laminar and turbulent flows; viscoelastic models (Maxwell, Voigt and three-element); derivation of stress-strain relationships for freely jointed chains; basic principles governing thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Also learned that hydrophobic interactions are really important and ought to be your favorite intermolecular force!) Pro tip: he does a lot of complicated (and maybe unnecessary) derivations of these equations, so try not to get too bogged down in the math and just remember the bigger picture: for any kind of material (elastic solid, fluid, viscoelastic) you're always trying to find a relationship between stress and strain. That's literally it. Remember that and things will make sense for you.",

            "comments": [
                "difficult, but professor is very good",
                "There wasnt much posted material (lecture notes) on canvas to help supplement student learning.",
                "Strengths: Taught very well, lectures were always engaging and most of the material was interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No resources outside of attending lecture. No notes are available and no textbook to look back on. The supplemental readings are not very helpful.",
                "Strengths are definitely Dr. Murrell's passion for the course! He is so honest and genuinely wants students to do well. Another huge strength are the TFs -- they are always willing to answer questions and provide very useful insight. I think that at times, the lectures were a bit fast-paced. It is understandable to not want to draw out every mathematical step but it would be helpful to post notes related to the math so that we can review on our own. There were oftentimes when final answers did not correspond to the math steps necessary to get to the answer. I also think it is a bit difficult having the course be graded on just 3 exams. If one has a singular bad day on exam day, it may not accurately reflect their abilities. Therefore, a strength was the extra credit offered but the extra credit assignments were probably not always necessary.",
                "This course covered a wide range of useful material applicable to biology. The main weakness was that there wasn't a lot of practice material offered, as the professor never released practice problems outside of the homeworks. We had 4 homeworks before the first exam, 2 before the second, and only 1 before the third. Additionally, many of the practice problems were unrelated to what we were learning in class, so they were not helpful in preparing for the exams.",
                "I enjoyed the lectures! It would be helpful to have access to the professor's slides when it comes to quantitative parts (like formula derivation, etc.) It would also be helpful to have more practice problems for the quantitative aspects.",
                "This is an unpopular view but Professor Murrell has really improved his teaching method over the six or so years since he started teaching this course. He explains the fundamentals very clearly and emphasizes mastery of basic concepts (ex. Hooke's Law as a mathematical statement of the relationship between stress and strain, meaning of homogeneous/isotropic/elastic assumptions about a material) as a way of gaining understanding of the more challenging applications (ex. he explains how deriving the force-strain relationship for a freely-jointed chain takes you all the way back to Hooke's Law for an elastic solid.) He outlines very clearly what kinds of word problems will be asked on exams, most of which he solves step by step in class. Not sure if he will continue this in a future iteration of this course but for us at least there were opportunities for extra credit to boost everyone's scores. As long as you pay attention, ask questions in class and keep up with the optional homeworks, you will do very well. I do think, however, that having only three exams count for the semester grade places a lot of pressure on students to do well on each of them--I don't think I've ever studied so intensely for a single exam in my time at Yale as I have in 353--so I hope that the problem sets/class quizzes will count for at least part of the grade next year. This class is also quite inaccessible in terms of resources (notes and slides are not posted on Canvas, and lectures are not recorded) so you really, really need to attend every single lecture if you want to do well. All you need to know for the course comes straight out of Murrell's handwritten notes, so take notes copiously and diligently, and don't be afraid to ask for clarification if you don't understand something. Best of luck.",
                "I thought the structure of the class was a great strength of the course, there were a lot of concepts that were covered in-depth. I also enjoyed how the exams and homeworks were given, I think it helped really reinforce the concepts.",
                "I would like to receive more organized equation derivations or explanations of the steps leading to it. While some of the derivation steps that were skipped over could be solved, others were of unclear origin/assumptions.",
                "The only three assignments in the class are the three midterms which are not curved even though the averages are in the C to B range. Homework is given, simply not graded, which is something that should change. The opportunity to do extra credit or revise tests could improve student engagement and learning opportunities.",
                "A strength of this course was that the set of concepts which were explored were pretty interesting. Though the different topics felt pretty disjointed at the beginning of the course, by the end of the course it was clear how the topics came together and were connected to each other. \r\nThe major weakness of this course was that there were limited opportunities to get feedback on one's understanding of the lecture content before the exams. There were ungraded Psets, but they were created separately by the TAs, their answer keys were fairly minimal, and they sometimes did not end up reflecting what was emphasized on the exams. Additionally, the exams had quite a bit of time pressure, to the extent that for the short answer questions, it felt more effective to just memorize derivations rather than understand the process, so that you would be able to complete the questions quickly to be able to get to all of the questions in the time allotted."
