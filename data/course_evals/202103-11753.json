                "This was the most fun course I had this semester because it allowed for creative freedom in our conversation and expression of our shared love for music, and I believe that is a strength of this course. I believe this is how the course should always be, so I do not have many improvements.",
                "Strengths: I loved everything! The workload was not overwhelming at all; because we werent assigned a ton of reading every night, I spent much more time grappling with each musical/literary piece every night. Micah facilitated discussions that were very often engaging and fruitful, and given the easygoing classroom dynamic, I felt very comfortable speaking up, even though I tend to usually listen to my classmates opinions. Everyones ideas were valued, even if we sometimes disagreed, and classes were fun and dynamic, with opportunities to watch plays and movies (I loved Into the Woods!) and musical recommendations given at the beginning of each class. This was the highlight of my semester! The only weakness was that I wouldnt have minded reading a few more short stories, just because the readings we were given were already so engaging that I sometimes wanted even more to discuss in class.",
                "Overall it was a great course but I would have hoped that we could listen to music a little more rather than read mostly.",
                "This course had a very strong instructor, course plan, and theme that it revolves around. Discussions were always interesting and the assignments followed the plan of the course very well. Overall, the class was fantastic. The only weakness I could potentially see is in the fact that a few of the readings could have been better chosen to suit the course. A couple, including a novel read at the end, were less interesting for the main theme than the shorter readings that demonstrated the description and utilization of music within.",
                "The material is interesting and not overly wordy for the most part. A couple of the readings could be substituted with more engaging material. The course flows well in terms of assignments and readings.",
                "Diverse assignment structure, good introduction to English at Yale.",
                "Micah was a wonderful teacher. She was very considerate and facilitated a great classroom environment. This was my favorite course this semester for sure. She also gave helpful writing feedback -- it was especially nice to be able to submit a first draft before you received a final grade, and then a revised draft after she met with you and gave feedback. \r\n\r\nThe readings and assignments were interesting too -- music and literature is a fun topic and we got to watch a movie and play during the course too!"
