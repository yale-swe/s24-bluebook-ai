                "I went from knowing nothing about music theory to feeling like analyzing and composing music is within reach. Now I feel like I know enough to take my learning into my own hands. I now use the counterpoint and harmony ideas to understand good vs bad voice leading, chord progressions, etc.",
                "In this course I learned the fundamentals of composing and analyzing music from 1500-1800. This class starts with writing counterpoint above and below a cantus firmus, and we learn more skills weekly. After learning how to write multiple lines of counterpoint with suspensions and four-note figures we transitioned to the harmony section, where we discussed sequences and cadences in depth. The final weeks of the class covered various forms, ranging from basic period and sentence structures to forms of larger works like ritornellos. The class is structured so that material from earlier sections is utilized in later parts. For example, being able to generate a contrapuntal reduction of a larger piece can help with analysis of chords and harmony.",

                "The biggest strength is that the class really forces you to learn the concepts but not in too stressful of a way.",
                "It was interesting, but some of the presentations didn't explain the concepts directly, and instead kind of circled around what they were talking about. My best example of this happening was with tendency chords like the Neopolitan 6th, which I understood more from 10 seconds on google than 20 minutes of class.",
                "Strengths- I feel like I learned a ton. The weekly homework sets were challenging in an engaging way and helped my learning a lot. In class examples were very helpful. \r\nWeaknesses- some of the info sheets werent super clear but some of them were very helpful so it equaled out.",
                "Strengths: I liked the homework structure of this class. We received weekly problem sets that covered material from that week's class. Each problem set was not too long, and by completing them I was able to keep up with the new class material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was often the case that material covered in class on Wednesday (we had a M/W schedule) was on the homework due by class time on Monday. Therefore it was difficult to start homework assignments early or ask questions about them in office hours or in class. Later into the semester Aditya added office hours between the Wednesday class and the following Monday, which solved this issue. For future classes it would be nice to have at least one office hour before homeworks are due.",
                "This course is very well structured. Each assignment in the unit builds on the previous assignment. Sometimes however, some assignments seem more difficult than others, although this may be due to the nature of the different species of counterpoint.",
                "Strengths: Aditya assigned a lot less HW than the usual professor. Weaknesses: It was hard."

                "Yes, but only if they have pretty extensive musical background. I know music very well and can compose well, and I enjoyed the content very much and improved my composing. I feel like someone who isn't as skilled/experienced musically will get less out of this course than me.",
                "Yes. You learn a ton about music theory and its very interesting. It is a lot of work but its very fulfilling.",
                "Yes, I recommend this class to majors and non-majors interested in music theory. As a player of classical and baroque music it was valuable to learn the purposes of melodic choices and form so I could incorporate this knowledge into my performances. Also, as someone who enjoys composing as a hobby I found it fascinating how these composers thought about their works and what rules they had to abide by.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course as it builds a great foundation for music theory and can benefit any musician.",
