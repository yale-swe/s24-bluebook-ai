    "I think that this class helped me to think in a way that I wasn't used to from high school.",
    "I had already taken calculus in high school, but this class was much more focused on the philosophy of math and logic than just rote memorization, so I liked understanding why I was doing things!",
    "Different ways of thinking about math. I gained a better fundamental understanding of math and working through problems.",
    "I learned a lot about the whys of calculus rather than the hows",
    "I learned how to take basic derivatives and how to apply them, as well as their basis in limits. Integrals were also taught briefly but not in much detail.",
    "I learned basic calculus and I learned it well. I learned math problem solving skills.",
    "Having taken Calc AB senior year, i feel like everything covered was basically the exact same thing, with just a few more concepts. Other than that, if you did well in Calc AB, this course is a similar challenge level.",
    "I learned a lot of new mathematical skills.",
    "I got a fantastic foundation in Calculus surrounding the work of 1 variable.",

   "comments": [
    "The course is supposed to be for students taking calculus for the first time but it moves faster than one can understand, and it assumes that the students know more than we actually do because some of us have never taken calculus.",
    "Was not a very engaging course, and problem sets were unnecessarily hard (harder than the exams, even).",
    "The strength of this course was the passion all instructors had for what they were teaching. The weakness was that I don't think the lectures were structured in a way that drew connections between different units of the subject.",
    "tests are not frequent enough",
    "I think that the exams were very difficult considering the material taught during lecture.",
    "For me, I felt like the newer concepts were glossed over while things I had already learned were taught over and over again, but that's coming from someone who already took the class. Lectures are really strong, but I think the in class worksheets would benefit from more time in class.",
    "I gained better problem solving skills.",
    "I feel like the problem sets should be easier and should reflect more of how the tests will be",
    "The course is rooted in conceptually understanding calculus while the exams are about application. The course does not necessarily teach how to apply concepts and the problem sets are difficult to understand without assistance from peer tutors.",
    "Great intro course for math. I think its fun very well. The psets prepare you well for the exams.",
    "I thought the problem sets were manageable. If you went to office hours, they took a max of 4 hours a week, which is not bad.",
    "One weakness of this course were the webassign problems. I found them very stressful due to the fact that the assignments were graded despite the fact that we were still learning the concept. Since there are already graded problem sets for the course, I think these problems would be more beneficial if they were less harshly graded so that students can focus more on learning the concepts rather than getting the correct answer to gain credit. The biggest problem with the program was that it didn't provide feedback as to how to solve the problem, so if the student is unable to solve the problem, not only will they lose credit, they won't know how to solve similar problems in the future and they will not learn anything from the problems.",
    "I think there could be a greater focus on helping students solve difficult problem set questions in class.",
    "The Webassigns were quite difficult at times and covered material\/ examples not covered in class. Perhaps students can learn more from the WebAssigns if students could access videos and other worked examples to supplement the questions. Or at least give the step by step process and answer to each question."

   "comments": [
    "I recommended if your major requires it or if you have taken calculus before. If it is not a requirement or if it is your first time taking calculus it will make your life miserable like it did to me.",
    "For those interested in math it's not a bad course. But unless you truly want to take it or need to take it, I wouldn't take it for fun.",
    "Take it if you need to. Calculus is a good foundation for many other subjects.",
    "no, only if you need to take it",
    "Unless you like math I would not recommend this class. I know that it is a pre req for many majors but it is often taught as if you have already learned calculus. In addition people who are well overqualified for the course attempt to take this for an easy A. This harms the rest of the students as this class was challenging.",
    "I had a good enough time! I am a humanities major and still enjoyed this as a class.",
    "Yes. It builds a solid foundation in math and helps with critical thinking.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you have to take it.",
    "If you are just starting calculus or took IB Math SL or AP Calc AB, this class is good for expanding upon and fortifying basic calculus skills.",
    "Yes! It was consistent, fun, and fair.",
    "If you need it for a certain major, of course take it. Other than that, it is a pretty typical math course.",
    "If Math is something you would like to pursue, absolutely. Otherwise, Id only recommend it to those with major requirements or if you really have a passion for math.",
    "Yes"
