                "I learned a ton about the Indian subcontinent and its history, both political and religious. I learned about best practices for going about a research paper at Yale College. And I learned about the nature of religious studies, how the discipline is incredibly meta and self-questioning, and how almost no historical narrative is as simple as it seems at first.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of communal violence in India and the historical controversies at the heart of contemporary Hindu-Muslim antipathy.",
                "I learned about the history of religion in South Asia (particularly India) and how many contemporary ideas of Hinduism and Islam are relatively recent constructs. We also discussed contemporary issues like an immigration bill that excluded muslims and the role of Hinduism in modern politics."

                "Professor Gandhi is great, really knowledgeable and great at facilitating a discussion.",
                "This class's greatest strengths arose in the classroom environment, where in-depth and appropriate lectures were mixed with intense and enlightening discussions. Professor Gandhi is a great discussion leader, knowing when to apply a light touch and let the conversation flow and when to step in and direct things in the right direction, and a great lecturer with tremendous subject area knowledge who was totally unfazed by any question no matter how specific or obscure. Outside of Professor Gandhi's direction, in small group discussions or in the readings, the class could be a bit plodding and aimless, though this was greatly improved when the syllabus was rewritten to decrease reading loads. The research project guidelines could also feel somewhat unclear, especially for the midterm assignment.",
                "I thought the course readings were fascinating, week in and week out, and I loved the subject of our study. The one thing I might have done would have been incorporate more different styles of discussion within our class week-to-week, as I loved it when we would break into groups or attack the material in a different way.",
                "There was too much of an emphasis on pre-modern history. I wish we had talked more about current events",
                "The content was very interesting, especially for someone interested in political violence. The format of the course---a short student presentation on a contemporary issue followed by class discussion, did help to make the themes of the course feel relevant and urgent. However, the emphasis on (often abstruse) secondary scholarship detracted from the readings. I wish there had been more readings of primary texts.",
                "The readings were fascinating and Professor Gandhi's slideshows were always engaging and well-curated. Writing paragraphs as reading responses was a bit stressful and I really liked that we switched to using Perusall annotations. The Perusall assignments worked well because, without any pressure, it incentivized me to think critically and gave me a chance to see other people's questions. I also really liked that the midterm paper was a stepping stone for the final paper. That forced me to start researching early in the semester and gave me time to refine my topic.\r\n\r\nThe syllabus was exciting because approached religion from many different angles. I especially enjoyed the articles about poets because they showed how artists often don't fit into neat religious or cultural boundaries. I also liked the current events presentations because everyone chose different topics and it made the course content feel relevant. Overall, I felt like I left with a better conceptual framework to unpack words like \"syncretism.\"\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is that it jumped into the history and sociology of religion in South Asia without giving students much background on how Hinduism and Islam are actually practiced.\r\n\r\nI'm Hindu and the stories of deities like Krishna, religious \"superstitions,\" and festivals play a fairly active role in my life. Sometimes the tone of conversations made it seem as if Hinduism was an abstract set of concepts that people believe far away and I felt like it would somehow be improper to say that those concepts are part of me too. I also noticed that a lot of students didn't have any context for how different Hindus interact with priests or holy texts, for example, and accidentally project Abrahamic notions onto Hinduism.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge gap was clear to me because I don't know much about Islam and sometimes didn't understand even basic references (e.g. the difference between Shias and Sunnis). I felt awkward talking about the hijab, for example, because I don't know how it originated or what it's role is within Islam. \r\nI wish I learned more about the Quran and Islamic belief in general and heard more about how my Muslim peers conceptualized their own religion. \r\n\r\nI feel like I got a lot from this course but, if it focused on contemporary religious beliefs alongside historical trends, it might be more digestible."

                "I would definitely reccomend this class to anyone interested in any part of Indian history over the last millenium. I enrolled in this class with an interest mostly in medieval and Renaissance-era history, and I was certainly satisfied on that front, but the parts I enjoyed most ended up being discussions of the present day, and how the issues we discussed in class were affecting real people's lives as we spoke. Professor Gandhi is a great discussion leader, and despite the large class size it still really felt like a seminar where everyone got the chance to speak their piece on issues political, personal, and historical. This is probably the only time I've ever seen people consistently address other people's arguments in a seminar at Yale, and it's a real revelation, it's great! However, the readings could be a little dry, and the writing load is kind of high, especially given the amount of scaffolding in class (very little,) so I would advise a Credit\/D for anyone who isn't using it for a requirement.",
                "I would certainly recommend it to another student. Professor Gandhi is brilliant and kind, and learning with her was a pleasure, and the course is well-designed for those who have a lot or a little experience studying South Asian history.",
                "It depends on what you are looking for. You will learn very little about Hinduism and Islam as systems of religious belief or as humanistic traditions. The emphasis of the course is on Hindu-Muslim identity politics. I was initially frustrated because I was expecting more of the former, but I was entirely okay with learning about the latter. If you want an introduction to South Asian religion, however, this is not the course for you.",
                "Yes. Hindutva and the relationship between Hindus and Muslims in India is always in the news but this class provides historical context that most people don't have. Professor Gandhi is an expert in this field and it's satisfying to learn from someone who is so widely read. It's worth noting that the although the course is about South Asia generally, it definitely focuses on India most of all.\r\n\r\nOne of the highlights of the course is that it's a multi-media experience. Going to the Yale Art Gallery and watching documentary clips, in addition to reading and writing, made this class memorable."
