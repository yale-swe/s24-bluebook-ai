I am a computer science major, and this class was completely unrelated to my field of study, but it was a class I am incredibly glad to have taken. I will add, though, that you should only take this class if you are passionate about the material and about reading/writing prose and poetry for an entire semester. The small size and the structure of this seminar make it to where the class is only really enjoyable if everyone taking it is highly interested in the material and in improving their writing craft. I was lucky in my year that the other students in the class were all absolutely brilliant and passionate, but I can imagine that this seminar would be a bit unbearable if the others in the course do not share the same enthusiasm for the material. Please do not take this course if you are only interested in optimizing your GPA or course workload  take it because you want to immerse yourself in a selection of beautiful poems and works of prose. Take it because you want to write as beautifully as the writers you grow up admiring. Take it because you want to experience what is a quintessential Yale course: a small class, led by a phenomenally kind and caring professor (Professor Barkin), surrounded by passionate students who are there to learn, explore, and broaden their horizons alongside you. I took this seminar in my last semester at Yale, and I was all the richer for it. I thought about this class as one of the formative parts of my Yale experience as I walked across the commencement stage while holding my diploma."
