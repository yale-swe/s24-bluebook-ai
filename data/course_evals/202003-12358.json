Professor Klein is super attentive to every response paper and really helps you engage with the material by responding to what you have written. He also lets you be very creative with the reading responses which allows you to articulate what you took from the readings in a way that is most interesting and fun for you. The final is also super flexible which allows you to write about something you are passionate about."

The syllabus was very thoughtfully organized, and all the readings made sense in creating a larger picture of the seminar. The seminars were interesting ways to discuss the topics at hand and Professor Klein always had interesting insights to make. Weaknesses included the Professor's online handwriting being hard to read for feedback.",
