I learned about crucial themes relevant to the region and time period, as well as key events, leaders, and groups. I came out with a better understanding of how to understand the region's contemporary history as well as how to use that to contextualize the region's current affairs.",

                "This class was a great way to learn about different Latin American countries during the cold war era and learn how they all share a common history of revolution and struggle. Moreover, I think this history is incredibly important to understand current situations of migration and political moments in Latin America.",

                "Strengths: The readings were awesomely enriching and, unfamiliar as the topic was to me, I simply learned so much. Prof. Grandin is a treasure. Weakness: As much as I enjoyed listening to Grandin speak, because he tended to talk for 80% of our weekly time together (not including the student presentations), this was a seminar in name only. I wanted to contribute more but found it was hard to participate since there was little space and structure to do so.",
                "This course was incredible and I especially loved its structure with student presentations in different weeks.",
                "Strengthsgreat professor, great topics, and great readings; also great people in the class! \r\nweaknessesthe reading was very heavy and difficult to complete in its entirety, there were classes that were much less discussion based and more lecture-based (could be a strength if you like that).",
                "The course is excellent. Greg is a wonderful professor, and the student presentations are very engaging. The greatest strength is the readings themselves.",
                "Strengths: Professor Grandin is a great professor! Kind, genuinely cares about his students, and is clearly knowledgable in the subject. Great class, would recommend! \r\nWeaknesses: At times lacked a bit of structure",
                "The class was great, I think the readings were very engaging.",
                "Professor Grandin was the best part of this course. He was smart, knowledgeable, approachable, and helpful. The way he organized the course, with different students summarizing the readings each week, didn't always encourage careful reading of the assigned materials. And, to be honest, I really appreciated that. It was an incredibly difficult semester for so many other reasons, and I was glad I could learn this material in a more relaxed environment."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course even if you do not have an established interest in Latin America. The material was fascinating and vital, and Prof. Grandin is full of knowledge. Some of the books we read were unforgettably enriching. However, be warned: Grandin tends to speak at great length, such that many weeks there was no group discussion at all, only student presentations followed by an insightful but protracted monologue. He explained late in the term this had to do with his not being adjusted to the Yale seminar period. In other words, this is not a seminar with much student participation. Nevertheless, the course is one of the most engaging and instructive I've taken.",
                "Yes 100%. The topics we covered are integral to understanding Latin America. There are few courses, if any, in which I have learned as much that is applicable to current topics.",
                "Yes. Other students should definitely take this course.",
                "Definitely! I think this course is great if you want a survey of the region's revolutionary history, which not a lot of American high schools offer. I also think this class is great for those with some knowledge of the region or a particular country within it that want more depth on these topics.",
                "Take this course if you want to be aware of the world you live in, especially in the intricacies of the US and Latin America relations (and how the US cant keep its hands to itself and by doing so screws a lot of people over leading to thousands of deaths and still ever present instability in these nations).",
                "Yes, absolutely. It is essential for any U.S. resident (especially those eligible to vote) to know the character of U.S. interventionism and dispel the myths of \"democratization\" or \"counter-terrorism.\" For non-U.S. residents, learning about U.S. hegemony may be redundant, but it may still be valuable if you don't have knowledge of Latin America in particular.",
                "I would definitely recommend if you are interested in Latin American history and want to learn more. Covers a lot of countries, but is not overwhelming. Great course with a great professor!",
                "Yes, if you are interested in Latin America, you must learn this history. This is one of the few classes at Yale that actually touches upon countries in Central America. If you are interested in learning about different revolutionary movements beyond Mexico and Brazil, I would take this class.",
                "Yes, I would. Grandin is incredibly flexible about the work, and that was definitely a plus for me. The one drawback is that you have to keep yourself accountable to do all of the readings to get the most out of the class. If I had had an easier semester, I would certainly have done a better job doing so."
