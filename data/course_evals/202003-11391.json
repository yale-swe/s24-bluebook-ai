Also, using case studies to identify problems within them and building an argument as to how that problem comes about.",

One weakeness was that some topics were covered more by the readings than others, resulting in the inability to cover many of the remaining topics on food politics.",

                "This course was very helpful in improving both my writing and my way of thinking. However, it felt at times that we had too many readings and were unable to discuss them in-depth (or sometimes at all) in class. Also, many of the authors read in this class have similar perspectives and it would be nice if more authors with opposing perspectives were included. The writers' workshops were also not the most helpful and were overly detailed. They could have been more effective if feedback could have been given in-person or via zoom and the document was not as long.",
                "I think the course was very well organized and laid out. I enjoyed the seminar and group discussions. I think there could have been slightly more focus on writing technique and less on the specific topic.",
                "The class did teach me quite a bit about essay-writing through a trial and error process, although I sometimes felt like it was a bit difficult to fully understand the feedback given to me and how I could apply it on my next essay. Class discussions and readings were engaging, and the professor is nice and compromising. The essay prompts could be a little vague at times, sometimes leaving you a bit lost on where to start."

One the other hand, if you do absolutely hate writing and want nothing to do with it, then maybe not. The class is very much focused on how to improve your essay-writing skills, and as such, much of the class builds up to your papers. I don't enjoy writing at all, but the class was still enjoyable, although I feel like it did start to lose steam towards the end of the semester (~third paper)"
