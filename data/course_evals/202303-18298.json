                "It opened me into a world of film I have never seen, and it also brought awareness to so many issues! It's definitely the class for people who are very big on social justice and injustice and who are interested in seeing film in spanish.",
                "I learned about the New Latin American Cinema that discusses social/political/economic issues around Latin America. I also learned how to discuss film in Spanish.",

It would be nice if there was less work assigned because I think it's really meaningful stuff to learn.",
                "I think the syllabus is this course's biggest strength. The predominant lecture style is the course's biggest weakness. Transforming the class to more of a discussion-oriented format would greatly enhance the overall learning experience.",
                "Strengths was that the content was just so amazing and eye opening. The films we watched touched on many different themes relating to different aspects of identities. I will say that I wish we would have spent more time in class learning about technical aspects of film. It also definitely would have been more interesting with my students and tables set up seminar-style.",
                "The strengths of the course are the pace and the films we watch. It was fun and not overwhelming to watch one movie per class, and it allowed me to really enjoy each film and excited to discuss it in class.",
                "Movie selections and topics were amazing.\r\nWeakness: there was a slow roll in terms of workloads so many people would not do the screenings and some discussions would only be a few class members that were actively engaged."

                "Yes! I would recommend this course to another student. I thoroughly enjoyed the course's content and feel my Spanish writing skills have improved a lot.",
                "If you're interested in film about societal issues from a different perspective, yes!",
                "Yes, Prof. Tortora knows so much about Latin American history and film. This is a great class for everyone who wants to better understand American imperialism and the role of the West/United States in intentionally destabilizing Latin America. Film is an amazing medium to learn about and discuss a variety of social issues in Latin America, which are covered in the class. The class also does a great job of showing the diversity country by country in Latin America.",
                "I would recommend especially if you enjoy film and/or social justice issues and/or histories in latin america. The film selections are amazing and so powerful. The instructor is extremely understanding, and will work with you to get better.",
                "Honestly, I would not recommend this class and instructor to anyone. Her organization is dismal: the canvas Files section is a huge mess of files, links, documents, and videos. She grades everything at the end of the semester, which is not conducive to student improvement. Plus, her grading is arbitrary and hard to understand. She does not teach us about film analysis yet expects us to go in-depth regarding scene analysis in papers. Her \"teaching\" consists of convoluted yet oversimplified histories of Latin American countries. She seems to be more preoccupied with preparing for the LIFFY festival than teaching the class. Unfortunately, Professor Tortora and this class were major disappointments for me this semester."
