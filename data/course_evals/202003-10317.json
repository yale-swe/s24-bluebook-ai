                "The best thing I learned from this course was how to structure my own stories and how to parse other stories' structures. Before entering this class, I knew a little bit about the three-act structure, but beyond that, I didn't know much. Camille helped us dissect existing films and screenplays so that we could then use these structural tools and apply them to our own screenplays. I absolutely see myself using this information in the future.",

We watched several filmsboth during and outside of classto learn storytelling techniques in the visual medium and how to apply them to our own screenplays.",
                "Ostensibly I learned a lot about screenplay writing, but I really felt like I took away a better understanding of storytelling and narrative in general. We read books like The Actor and the Target, which helped with dialogue writing, and parsed screenplays by breaking them down into story beats, which helped me see the underlying construction of most of the stories I encounter.",

We learned the basic structure of screenplays and \"beat sheets\" and parsed films to find the plot points. Analyzing films gave us the conceptual knowledge necessary to begin writing our own screenplay. When writing, I learned how be concise with my language and to think outside the box.",

                "Camille is, of course, the greatest strength of this course. She is a fantastic professor. She is always available to help students and she is eager to provide feedback that will improve your story and your writing. She treats each student's story seriously and provides many opportunities for one-on-one discussions during office hours. She also gave me the tools to recognize when I needed to change certain aspects of my story. Although my screenplay is still very much a work-in-progress, I plan on using her guidance for a long time!\r\n\r\nI also enjoyed exchanging writing and feedback with my peers.",

                "Strengths: Basically everythingthe professor, the syllabus, the peers, etc. Professor Thomasson truly cares about each and every student, and you get a lot of one-on-one attention to ameliorate your story. She translated the seminar into the virtual format really well. Every assignment was clearly laid out on Canvas, so there was little to no confusion about deadlines. The peers were also amazing; the seminar was made of students from all different undergraduate majors, and everyone had such an incredible story to tell. I personally found the peer-review screenplay sessions super productive and very helpful for brainstorming plot points\/details.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps one or two more of the peer-review screenplay sessions wouldve been the cherry on top.",
                "I loved this course with my whole heart and its strengths were many. The lectures were creative, informative, and encouraged participation, the group work assignments were challenging but unique enough that they didn't feel difficult, and I loved how all the homework assignments fed into the eventual project of writing the first fifteen pages of an original screenplay. I'm having a hard time pointing out areas for improvement. Personally I enjoyed that sometimes the beginning of class consisted of cryptic poetry and clips from which we had to surmise the topic of the class -- it kept me on my toes -- but that might not appeal to everyone.",

The films we watch, parse, and analyze are fascinating and there is nothing more satisfying than creating part of a screenplay that YOU wrote. My classmates were also so supportive of everybody in the class. Everybody wanted everybody to succeed and create the story of their dreams. No weaknesses.",
                "There are so many strengths! The feedback delivered to us was consistently crafted with so much care and thought. The structure of the class made each meeting absolutely compelling. You will leave each class session feeling more confident and assured as a writer and thinker. I honestly cannot think of a single weakness."

Since it was a seminar, I really appreciated Professor Thomassons efforts to get everyone to talk and contribute to class discussions by having cameras and audio turned on. Having each weeks assignments clearly listed in Canvas Modules was very helpful and reduced a lot of unnecessary anxiety about deadlines. There were a couple of Zoom-related snags, but most issues were resolved pretty quickly.",

All the professors at Yale are amazing in their own way, but Professor Thomasson truly has a gift for teaching. Every week, she prepares a well-thought-out presentation and shows us the perfect collection of films that demonstrates some element of screenwriting. At one-on-one office hours, she really gets to know you and helps you examine the story youre trying to tell from the macro to the micro. She has a brilliant intuition for finding the ingredients of a compelling story, so even if you go into this course with a barebone premise, shell help you crystalize it into a coherent plot.\r\n\r\nIf youve ever had the briefest inkling of a story you think might look good on the silver screen, please do yourself a favor and apply to this seminar.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. When I started I had never written a screenplay before, and I was the writing equivalent of a shower singer -- I wrote short stories in my free time but never showed them to anyone else. This class made me feel confident enough to pursue screenplay writing in further classes, and I enjoyed the course itself immensely. Professor Thomasson is wildly charismatic -- her expectations are high in the best of ways, and she is so very kind. All of our reading material felt necessary and held my attention consistently. Even on Zoom, Professor Thomasson helped us connect with each other and engage with the material every week. One of my favorite courses at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Thomasson is the best teacher I've had at Yale; she has a deep understanding of story telling and craft, gives excellent feedback, and has been an invaluable guide. Everyone with any interest in writing should take this course.",
