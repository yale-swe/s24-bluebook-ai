            "comments": [
                "I think the biggest strength of this course was the instructor. Professor Shoemaker was extremely understanding, helpful, and accessible. I also think the structure of the class allowed for development of skills without too much stress; reading assignments dwindled down when major papers were due and for each paper we were allowed at least one draft that we then discussed with the professor. I think this structure was really helpful and was definitely conducive to not only the development of my skills but also to the writing process in general. I think potential improvements would maybe be including more reading assignments. I appreciated that the reading load was fairly low, particularly towards the latter half of the class, but some readings were cut that I think would have been interesting to discuss.",
                "Strengths: the material and selected readings are very strong. There is a huge variety of topics and mediums covered which is very refreshing. The papers were all very interesting and there was plenty of time to develop a strong piece of writing.\r\n\r\nWeakness: very few. Because the class is so small, your classmates can really determine your experience, so I'd shop the class to make sure you like the people. In my case, I did.",
                "There were times where class felt unnecessary, where we didnt have much to discuss.",
                "I think the course content is super, super engaging. I felt in the beginning of the year, some of the assignments were a little rushed. I also wish readings were cut down a little bit because I would often spend a lot of time digesting and analyzing but we would sometimes barely spent time on discussion.",
                "Discussions were very fun and useful in better understanding the readings and movies we watched for class. However, I felt that the peer reviews and some of the class discussions could have been more productive."

                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think of the writing seminars offered this one definitely has a really interesting topic/focus and the way that Professor Shoemaker organizes the course makes it very easy to learn a lot from it. If you're looking to develop your writing skills and/or have an introduction to how to write well in college I think this course would definitely benefit you a lot. This course is also really great if you want to examine questions about time, especially since the research assignment allows for a lot of freedom that can really be molded to your specific interests.",
                "Definitely. Great topic, great teacher, great class.",
                "Yes I would",
                "Yes, I definitely would recommend this course. It's not a typical English class, we watch and analyze some really cool movies, and get to explore a particular field of time that we find intriguing.",
                "I would highly recommend this course if you are curious about the concept of time and are interested in improving your writing in a less intimidating academic environment."
