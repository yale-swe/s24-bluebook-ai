I spent a lot of time thinking about the ethics of oral history and how they can empower for marginalized communities.",
                "I learned how to conduct an oral history interview and how to properly care for peoples stories.",
                "I learned how to conduct oral history interviews. As a class, we spent time going over the guidelines by the OHA and discussed numerous papers on oral history methodology. The skills we gained as an interviewer in this class will be helpful beyond the classroom.",
                "This course was really incredible. Learning how to conduct Oral history interviews was intimidating, but I really treasured the experience.",
                "This course taught me the foundational methods, theories and history behind oral history as a discipline. I learned how to conduct an oral history project from start to finish, from finding an interviewee and formulating questions, to processing the interview and adding it to an archive. We also learned a lot about the ethics of oral history and how to understand our positionality as interviewers and researchers.",
                "I learned the entire process of conducting oral histories, meaning we learned the processes of identifying narrators, reaching out to them, preparing the proper permission forms, conducting the necessary research in preparation for the interview, preparing questions, conducting the necessary follow ups, and finding an archive on which to presence the oral history. We read many works that talked about the process of conducting oral histories, works that used oral histories in a historical, literary, or creative fashion, and we watched /listened to oral histories themselves in inpreparation. We even had time to practice conducting oral histories in class with our peers prior to conducting our own with our narrator."

Course policies are fair and assignments are super engaging!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- No major ones, but I would've liked if the reading schedule felt more cohesive & if class discussion could have felt more structured.",
                "Strengths: Frankie was a really knowledgeable and emphatic professor! She is sensitive to everyones needs and is honestly the best professor you could ask for. The class content was amazing and well-structured. Readings were relevant and interesting, and the workload wasnt too heavy.\r\nWeaknesses: Deadlines were constantly being changed throughout the semester, but in a good way (to make more time for us). Im sure it will be adjusted in future iterations!",
                "Strengths: \r\nAmazing professor\r\nDoable amount of reading\r\nNot too many assignments\r\nFlexibility in individual oral history interview\r\nI was able to make lots of new friends in this class",
                "I loved this course, but it would have been good to have more practice before we sat the actual interview.",
                "Strengths: Frankie is the biggest strength of this class; her care, passion, adaptability, and patience were a highlight of the course and the semester. She encouraged us to engage deeply with our readings, interviewees, and classmates. The readings were engaging, and the syllabus was well constructed. Weaknesses: The group project at the end of the course felt overwhelming at points because of its somewhat tight timeline, but it turned out alright in the end. Thinking about the project more throughout the semester might have been helpful.",
                "The class was very learning-centered rather than focused on grades and assessments, which made for a welcoming and engaging learning environment. I was always excited to come to class because the readings were so manageable and interesting. Frankie Barrett was such a strength because she herself has taken an oral history class and understands the student experience really well. I think the class could be improved by having us reach out to potential narrators even earlier in the semester, and also having the option of picking from a prepared list of potential interviewers who had indicated their interest in the project.",
                "I really enjoyed how open and collaborative the professor was about making decisions about everything from the syllabus, the class assignments, to the masking policy. Really demonstrated a student centered educational approach.",
                "Strengths: Frankie, for sure. Frankie made sure t o listento our interests, needs, and questions, and addressed all of them in class. Frankie made sure to guide us through every step of the process of preparing for, conducting, and preserving and presenting an oral history ethically and responsibly. She made space for all us to share our thoughts and questions. She also developed the classroom as a truly collaborative space. We all got to know each other and our interests, and that fostered an environment in which we were able to give each other true honest constructive feedback. Together me brainstormed questions, gave each other feedback on the oral histories we conducted, and collaborated in presenting our oral histories Ina creative project. I think Frankie did an amazing job at fostering a truly collaborative learning environment where we challenged each other and supported each other. She guided us through every step of the way. Way and provided constant feedback."

                "YES! If you are even slightly interested in oral history, you should definitely take this course. Frankie is an amazing teacher and she will guide you through every question and every struggle. The readings she assigns for class are also highly relevant to the entire field of history as well, and this course will open your eyes to unexplored research methods.",
                "Yes! Frankie is lovely, and it is a great opportunity to learn how to conduct oral history interviews. My main recommendation is that you should ideally have the person you want to interview lined up ASAP, like, start reaching out in the first week of class.",
                "Yes! Oral history is such an amazing method, and I am so grateful that I got to learn about it with Frankie!",
                "Absolutely. Take it for your American Studies or History major, but I would also recommend this to any student for a humanities credit or even just a fun extra class. I think the content and skills would be interesting to anyone interested in New Haven, politics, history, social issues, or genealogy. The grading was really fair and course expectations were manageable. I felt that every assignment we did had a purpose and was actively contributing to my understanding of oral history as a process. Our classroom environment was great and engaging. Definitely a highlight of my week.",
                "Yes",

Any historian should be know how to ethically and responsibly listento, prepare for, and share a narrator's story, this work is important. Logistically speaking as well, this course taught me alot while keeping the workload very manageable."
