                "This course was incredibly meaningful to me, both on a personal level and an intellectual level. At first, I was suspicious of an \"African-American Perspectives\" course taught by a non-Black professor to a class of majority non-Black students. However, over the course of the semester, I understood the value of studying Black scholars and the Black political experience as relevant to ALL of American history and political philosophy -- rather than just Black history. As an EPE student, I learned so much (!!) in this class. I became a better writer, a better philosophical thinker and a more critical student. As a Black woman, I had the opportunity to reflect on Black Americans' position in the American political economy throughout history. If you're an EPE student, or any student, please take this course!!",
                "Great knowledge into the intellectual tradition of African-American thinkers, especially in relation to important ideas like the Constitution and capitalism.",
                "Gained a broad understanding of African American history and contemporary applications of African American thought, got exposed to both liberal and conservative perspectives and learned about the role of the Black church",
                "Its a survey course of famous African American thinkers. A lot of intellectual diversity. Also there are two debates that are pretty fun.",
                "I learned about different aspects of African American thought in America relating to black progress from Frederick Douglass on. This includes conceptions of the Founding, the role of women, capitalism, classical education vs. industrial education as modes of black progress (aka the WEB Dubois vs. Booker T. Washington debate), modern debates about disparity (ie. Thomas Sowell vs. coauthors of the 1619 Project), economics/capitalism and discrimination, education, class, and more.",
                "I learned about African-American thinkers in a way that I hadn't before: focusing on issues facing black Americans in their struggle for political inclusion in a country that has denied them existence for so long. I learned to see black America in its diversity of thought and perspectives. I learned American history and its significance to black Americans through the eyes of people who lived it. It was such a refreshing new perspective.",

                "Strengths: The discussion was always thorough, engaging and substantive. I genuinely learned so much from my peers throughout the semester. The readings were also phenomenal. The Black thinkers spanned the entire political spectrum, which was unusual yet fascinating to see.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't love the format of the midterm paper -- two 5-page essays on two distinct prompts -- but I definitely see why we needed two essays in order to cover everything discussed.",
                "Really enjoyed the readings and the discussions. I wished we had focused less on quote id and more on engagement with the readings (analysis on their argumentation/persuasiveness, etc.). More time spent, not just talking about what the thinkers said, but rather if their arguments were persuasive.",
                "Strengths: very broad intellectual introduction to AfAm thought",
                "The quizzes are really stress free and a nice grade bump. Professor Collins is a good seminar leader. The midterm paper and test are very fair, and the test isnt too bad so not a stressor. I do feel that the class does structure the readings to be set up to be compared to each other in a very debate-y way.",
                "The readings were exceptional, we always read multiple sides of any debate, we did multiple mock debates in class and therefore really got to flesh out the issues, students were engaged in class discussion, and Professor Collins is easily my favorite professor here at Yale. He listens to his students closely and teaches them to strengthen their arguments and consider counterpoints. He himself knows the content really well and offered us additional readings (if we chose to) out of pure interest and curiosity in the subject.",
                "Good readings and discussions.",
                "I liked the historical breadth of the course. I feel like I've gained a strong foundation in the various topics and African American political philosophy in general. However, there are moments the syllabus dwelt too long on one topic without getting any deeper into it. I wish we learned more about the role of criminal justice.",
                "Strengths: great class discussions. Very interesting readings that are tailored to what we are learning. Excellent feedback from Professor Collins on papers. Lots of support during office hours.  \r\nWeaknesses: I don't think I learn that much from the in-class debates. The in-class exam is a rude awakening for an EP&E major who usually just writes papers and does not take tests."

                "Yes- especially if you are EPE, this is an amazing core course.",
                "Yes, I would if you are interested in a course that offers big-picture takes on AfAm history and politics, both on the liberal and the conservative side of things.",
                "Sure, youve already read everything in Classics, Aristotle didnt change. I would definitely suggest adding Du Bois and Frederick Douglass to your academic journey.",
                "Take this course if you can!!!! It was a pleasure to debate in class and engage with such diverse AA thought. The thinkers we read were all exceptional, and often made me rethink my views. Professor Collins himself is also just awesome to get to know. He's willing to help his students with whatever they need, not to mention his being really sharp. Class discussions (and formal mock debates, which he organized) were always insightful and fun.",
                "yes definitely, although their GPA might take a hit.",
                "Professor Collins facilitated wonderful class discussions and clearly cares very much about the academic material as well as his students. I learned a lot from his meticulous feedback on essays and he is a very approachable professor. However, there were definitely conversations that went on too long without getting anywhere more critical, and sometimes large chunks of class felt like surface-level reading comprehension checks. So take this class if you are looking for something foundational and predictable with some notable gems but I wouldn't expect something mind-blowing every week.",
                "Yes. It's a course to explore Africa-American perspectives, instead of just brushing over them as most other classes do.",
                "Absolutely! Everyone should take this course. One of my favorites I have taken at Yale."
