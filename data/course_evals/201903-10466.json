   "comments": [
    "Vast introduction to biomedical engineering fields.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of many biomedical engineering concepts and gained a lot of knowledge about entrepreneurship in the field.",
    "I learned about the various tracks and careers that make up Biomedical Engineering. It was a very informative seminar. The writing assignments weren't too much work, and they really got you thinking about all things BME.",
    "I learned so much about the various fields of biomedical engineering, particularly the commercial aspects of how to start a company and getting FDA clearance.",
    "Knowledge: Some BME application fields, names of BME faculty, and possible post-graduation options for majoring in BME.\r\n\r\nSkills: How to write in CSE format.\r\n\r\nInsights: On career options for BME majors.",
    "I learned about a variety of different career paths that one can pursue with a biomedical engineering degree. I was really impressed by the number of industry people who came to speak and surprised by how interesting I found their work to be considering that I had came into the class thinking the only two career paths were med school or pure research. Besides the speakers, the three essay assignments were extremely valuable. The first one being a \"why bme\" essay allowed me to reflect on why I was there sitting in that class at Yale to begin with  a good jumping off point for summer program personal statements. Also, the other papers directed me to delve into bme research areas and become even more enamored by the topic.",
    "I learned what BME actually was and what it could lead to",
    "I gained insight on a variety of different paths for a biomedical engineering major and I loved that aspect of the class. I think it was extremely valuable especially for sophomores who are not entirely sure what they want to do. Seeing the options really gave me a clearer understanding of the multitude of opportunities out there.",
    "I learned about the various fields and careers of biomedical engineering through speakers who come and talk about their experiences. Many Yale professors and alums introduce their research\/business.",
    "I gained a lot more knowledge about the various fields of biomedical engineering.",
    "I gained a great background about the biomedical engineering field. It helped me to shape my ideas of what careers can come from the major and get excited for the next few years and job opportunities after graduation.",
    "This class provided an overview of the various fields of BME. It was so enriching and interesting because we were able to hear from people in VC, research, biotech and even current students.",
    "I learned about the applications of BME and opportunities to explore career paths within BME",
    "I gained insight into the various avenues of biomedical engineering.",
    "I gained insights into the possible jobs and career paths of BME majors.",
    "The BENG 280 seminar was great at providing an overview of the different tracks of the biomedical engineering major, as well as a wide range of career paths the major could lead to. The guest lecturers and panels were well planned, engaging and very informative, especially the summer internship panel. The assignments were great opportunities to further learn about specific topics in biomedical engineering and for exploring and reflecting on interests.",
    "overview of the field of biomedical engineering at Yale. learned about industry relating to biomedical engineering a lot, including venture capital. I was connected with some interesting and helpful people. learned about global health and biomedical engineering."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - guest lectures were so interesting, writing assignments were interesting and fair\r\nAreas to improve - more continuity between lectures, more peer-to-peer interaction",
    "Strengths: learn about the major before you have to commit to it; gain exposure to department faculty and their research projects; meet industry workers and learn about their day to day jobs\r\nWeakness: not a lot of interaction with our peers, the people we may spend the next few years with in the major; some sort of group rotation each week could help us meet everyone in the class",
    "The course offers a relatively broad picture of BME industry, but we did not get as many looks into academic research or other paths such as medical school. However, Prof. Miller-Jensen was very keen to get our feedback at the end of the year and is intending on accommodating many of our suggestions.",
    "Strengths: The workload is very low so it is very manageable, and you get to meet\/see all the fellow BME majors in your grade. We all could learn from each other and form a supportive community.",
    "Since the class was only sophomores interested in BME, I was hoping to get to know my classmates more and build greater comradery. Group projects or group presentations could have helped. I did enjoy the wealth of resources that Professor Jensen demonstrated with the speakers, but then again, us as peers are a good resource to take advantage of as well.",
    "I thought Prof Miller-Jensen did a great job of bringing in a diverse range of speakers",
    "Strengths -- the variety of speakers and lecturers made this class worthwhile and Professor Miller-Jensen was extremely organized and I thank her for everything she did. \r\nWeaknesses -- Just the fact that we did not get to interact with the other students in the class itself was sort of unfortunate.",
    "I loved the learning environment of this class. We learned something new each class without having to be stressed out about grades. Everyone simply wanted to learn. It was fun hearing from alums and their paths following the BME major as a Yale Undergrad. The class could use a bit more student interaction\/engagement. Despite only having like 35 students in the class, I did not know (and still do not know) over half of the class. It would be nice to get to know other BME majors at Yale.",
    "Strengths: Covered a lot of areas of biomedical engineering, a lot of content in a short amount of time, workload was PERFECT for a half credit class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough opportunities to discuss all the content we were exposed to with our peers, also feedback on essays was not always clear",
    "Learning about different pathways that biomedical engineering could take me was very helpful.",
    "The course does great to expose you to many different variations of the BME field. I think a few more optional guest lectures would be nice.",
    "This class was amazing! No weaknesses (its a half credit though.)",
    "Strength: Connected you to people and faculty \r\nWeakness: In the future, would love to see more focus on computer science intersection",
    "Strength is definitely how the course has a low workload, yet you get valuable insights from all the speakers that come in. Weakness is that there isn't much discussion in this course and maybe being able to talk with more junior and senior BME majors and making the seminar more discussion based would be an improvement. The seminar is already good as it is though so keeping it in the same format would be fine.",
    "The course was very well organized and the guest lecturers were very engaging and informative. The course did a great job of covering a wide range fo career paths and topics, allowing for good exploration and development of interests. The course could be improved by perhaps providing the opportunities to grab lunch, or coffee with some of the guest speakers and having 1, or 2 more summer internships\/opportunities at Yale panels.",
    "good array of speakers from many different places. could be improved by exposing students to bioengineering research that happens elsewhere besides Yale and not industry."
