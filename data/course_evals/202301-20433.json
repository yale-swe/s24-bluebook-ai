                "Not a lot of historical review in this course, but you learn post-Soviet history from the material we engage with in class.",
                "I have learned so so much in this course, knowledge and skills as well as great insights into Russian realities. I have learned about Russian history and I am now able to position contemporary Russia into its history of empires, Soviet Union and then chaos that followed the collapse of the Union and the rise of Putinism. I have learned how to do a close reading successfully as well as to analyse films carefully.",
                "This course opened my eyes to many avant-garde films, literature, and other works of art produced in the post-Soviet space. Both the class discussions and the papers were highly engaging. My writing abilities improved significantly, and my understanding of Eastern Europe became much more detailed.",
                "I enjoyed learning about current Russian protest movements and watching and reading a lot of interesting works of fiction as well! The writing component also helped me build confidence and skill as a writer.",

                "I learned about the post-Soviet chaos that led into Putin's Russia today through an array of novels, films, and other source materials as well. I also learned how to analyze literature and film and write effective essays."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: amazing Professor and TF (some of the best Ive ever had at Yale), incredibly interesting subject matter, great class discussions, detailed and personal writing feedback \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes I just wish we had more time to discuss everything! In class we would get into some really interesting discussions but unfortunately have to cut them short bc of time. I generally hate 2-hour class blocks, but maybe this could be one that benefits from that structure",
                "Strengths: Marijeta is amazing, she is one of my three favourite professors at Yale and this is one of my 3 favourite courses after two years at Yale. Marijeta is super interesting and unapologetic in her opinions but also very balanced in expressing them. She is very eloquent and a careful reader and writer. She created mini writing workshops in class where we criticised \"bad\" writing pieces and commented on what worked and what didn't, which helped us become more aware as writers. Also, she always met with us after each paper to make sure we understood the feedback well which made it a lot easier to learn and incorporate her constructive feedback. She is a very demanding critic when it comes to writing and analysis which I really appreciated. Most writing credits don't actually make you a better writer but this class certainly does if you are willing to put in the work. She also met with me like 3 or 4 times before the final paper to help me brainstorm and was literally always enthusiastic to chat and share her knowledge and opinions. \r\nAnother strength is John, the TA. he is the best TA I've ever had. He has very interesting opinions and is unapologetic in expressing them, but also he, like Marijeta, always lets you be free to express your own opinions even if they differ from theirs. We mostly talked about pretty delicate topics so I appreciated feeling free to say what I thought, especially considering that I definitely didn't have their knowledge and so my opinions were a work-in-progress, which they definitely welcomed. John was incredibly available to chat on Slack about papers and always answered super quickly which really helped me with my papers, and I have never seen a TA put that much effort into helping students. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the course was a bit disorganised, which I definitely felt at the beginning and other times when the prompts weren't published on canvas and we had to ask for them multiple times or they hadn't downloaded the movies for a while so we had to watch them more last minute. I think that can easily be improved",
                "The course was perfect in terms of class discussion management, topics, organization, and assignments. I wouldn't change anything.",
                "This course had a a great selection of works and a rather balanced workload.",
                "Strengths: Engaging and approachable professor, interesting material, well-structured classes\r\nWeaknesses: Discussions were sometimes hard to follow and I felt like the same people always spoke",
                "The course looks at a larger variety of films and novels, some comedic and others gruesome, that kept me engaged with the course material. I loved Marijeta's style of teaching and how she interacted with students. The one critique I would give is that I would have liked to focus a bit more on the historical context for the actual fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of Putin because it would have helped level the playing field on knowledge between students in the class; we did focus on the history aspect a bit, but I would have liked to go more in-depth.",
                "This course has a good mix of literature and film, and is conscious of how students' workloads fluctuate throughout the semester (less workload during midterm season, etc.) It also covered fascinating works and inspired engaging discussions in class that encouraged us to look at the source material through a critical lens: who funded it? what does it represent beyond the obvious message? how does it mix genres? However, the course felt somewhat disorganized. We used a mix of Canvas and Slack, so it was at times difficult to keep track of the files we needed for the course. At times, Marijeta was also quite slow responding to emails, which was difficult when I was reaching out for support as I brainstormed an essay but only received a response after it was almost complete. I also had a hard time understanding exactly what the expectations were for some of the essays. Some of the feedback I received felt overly critical, and even when I improved it in the following essay it did not seem to be reflected in my grade. It was discouraging to see that an essay the professor said I did better on was graded lower than the prior one. Hence, the benchmarks I was trying to reach felt unclear, and it was stressful to work on my final project not knowing what the expectations were and not feeling like I could get all the support I needed.",
                "Overall the course offers a wide survey of post-Soviet Russian culture, but is somewhat thin on post-Soviet Russian history. While the protest culture portion of the course title was covered relatively thoroughly, the Putin's Russia part was not touched at all. The works of literature and film covered in the course need more contextualization. At times it was unclear why a certain work would be classified as \"protest culture\" and what social and political developments in Russia these works were influenced by or responding to."

                "Professor Bozovic is wonderful, and I deeply, deeply recommend anybody interested in Eastern Europe, REES, or Slavic Studies take a course with her if given the opportunity.",
                "1000% yes. Marijeta is hands down one of the best professors at Yale, any class with her will undoubtedly be amazing. The detail of writing feedback is so insanely helpful, the course material is really interesting, and class discussions are always so engaging. The workload is extremely manageable too!!!",
                "Absolutely! Marijeta is incredible and so well spoken.",
                "YES! I had no background before starting, only a strong interest for the subject and it truly was one of my favourite courses at Yale ever. It's definitely not a gut, so you have to be willing to put in the work. Readings are very long sometimes and movies too + you have to write a reading response for every class. Papers took me a lot of energy to write but I really got a lot from the course and the professors so I cannot help but recommend it fully.",
                "If you're interested in Russia/Ukraine and other Eastern European cultural spaces, definitely! It is easier to notice certain intricacies if you speak Russian or are familiar with the realities of the region, but it shouldn't deter you from exploring.",
                "Yes! It is incredibly engaging and a great way to improve your writing while studying an interesting subject!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in Russia media and film and wants to improve their writing.",
                "Yes, if you have an interest in the material. It is super interesting, and I feel that the class made me a better writer. Do note that the films and literature can be disturbing at times.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in Soviet history and protest culture, and if you have the time to watch up to 2 films a week, I would highly recommend this course. Marijeta makes the writing assignments approachable and schedules one-on-one meetings with every student to make sure they have a solid thesis to build on.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who want to learn more about genres in Russian film and literature they may not otherwise interact with. The materials used for this course are fascinating to look at, even if you have not had much experience studying Russia in the past. The mix of films and literature is also interesting, especially given the many comparisons made across genres throughout the semester.",
                "Yes absolutely: a very interesting seminar with a passionate professor leading the course."
