                "I gained a fantastic breadth of knowledge about the world of french poetry in and around Algeria. I learned to write comprehensive essays of varying length and explications in the french language.",
                "I learned how to better analyze and write about poetry, as well as to engage more with the socio-political environments that surround the poetry of the time.",
                "I learned a great deal about how to analyze and appreciate poetry in French. Class discussions and the opportunity to give a presentation to the class also helped me improve my oral expression.",
                "I learned about many North African poets who wrote in French, and the themes that are common common across most of their workssuch as the internal conflict that arises from being educated and writing poetry in French, and the idea that poetry can act as a vessel for political awareness and change. We also honed our poetry close reading skills.",
                "I developed skills in how to approach and analyze poetry, through looking at etymology of specific words, sonority, rhyme scheme, etc. This class also exposed me culture and literature of the Maghreb, which I had never studied before. I also developed insights in how to connect different pieces of poetry and how to use biographical and historical contexts to inform my reading of poetry."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The timing of the class: one long discussion class a week, is literally perfect. The workload, at least one rather long book of poetry that you only have to read as much as you can get through, is literally perfect and flexible. The discussions are interesting and well lead, and the in-class poetry analyses are fantastic. The explications were fun to write and pretty intuitive, and Prof. Connolly gave good critique while also being considerate of my rocky french ability. The final essay was a complete marathon but so rewarding when I turned it in. No Prerequisites required, basically a perfect class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The one class sometimes feels long because... it is long. Sometimes discussion can take a bit to ramp up, but it's good once it gets going.",
                "The section was always very well lead and the readings were very well organized and in tune with the discussions.",
                "Strengths: The course is very well organized and comprehensive: students learn not only about the works but also about their historical and literary contexts. I definitely improved my writing and reading abilities in this course. Prof. Connolly is a great professor and class was always interesting and informative. Weaknesses: none",
                "Everything about this course is great. Prof. Connolly is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about poetry of the Maghreb; he guides class discussions so that each student has a chance to participate, while still making his own (extremely insightful) contributions. I love the way the class is structured, as each week we cover a new poet and read one of their anthologies as well as some secondary literature on them. I cannot really think of any way to improve this course, other than the fact that we often run out of time at the end of each class so we had to rush a bit.",
                "I truly believe this course had no weaknesses. It was very well organized and Prof. Connolly was great at communicating his expectations to us. The class size was small so everyone always had a chance to speak, and Prof. Connolly ensured that there was a welcoming environment, even for those like myself who had no experience with French poetry or the Maghreb. A great breadth of poets were covered, but I still felt that we were able to talk about each poet with decent depth during weekly seminars. Prof. Connolly himself is also such a kind and passionate professor, which made my experience very enjoyable."

                "Yes Yes Yes. If you can read\/write in french you should take this course. Incredibly cool subject matter and a great classroom environment.",
                "Yes! Professor Connolly is so passionate and loves what he teaches and the subject matter is very interesting and niche. If you love poetry or want to learn more this is a great class to do so.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning more about the literature and history of parts of the Francophonie other than France. Moreover, this course is perfect for advanced French speakers who would like the opportunity to perfect their writing and speaking abilities.",
                "Absolutely. This is one of the few courses within the French department with a focus on post colonial \/ diaspora literature.",
                "Absolutely, as long as you are very comfortable speaking and writing academically in French. This course will give you a completely new perspective on Francophone poetrythis was the first course I've ever taken on North African literature, and it made me realize just how limited (i.e. Eurocentric) my knowledge of French texts had been until this point. The readings are manageable (and you don't have to read everything word for word), the assignments are meant to let you explore authors that interested you, and Prof. Connolly is very understanding about deadlines. I also really enjoyed going to Prof. Connolly's office hours.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any French student who is interested in poetry or the Maghreb. This course exposed me to an entirely new way of reading and writing French, and the poetry itself is so profound and beautiful. The environment is so supportive, and Prof. Connolly has so much wisdom to share."
