    "Intro language skills, such as vocab, sentence structures, etc.",
    "I learned basic Italian language skills. I also learned a little bit about Italian culture.",
    "Present tense, past tense, imperfect tense, and other grammatical concepts. Vocabulary about greetings, food, clothing, school, family, and other concepts. Some culture.",
    "I learned the basics of Italian. Lots of vocab. Present tense, imperfetto, passato prossimo, trapasso possimo. Other general grammatical things like adverbs, adjects, nouns, direct\/indirect objects, etc. But we also discussed a lot about Italian culture (FOOOOD!!!) and did our oral presentations on Italian art\/historical figures\/films\/and of course food.",
    "we learned a lot of italian grammar in a very short time, even in an online setting",
    "I learned elementary Italian.",
    "Basic understanding of italian grammar concepts, culture and language.",
    "I can now have a basic conversation in Italian. I can talk about my likes dislikes, experiences, hobbies and so much more.",
    "I came into the class not knowing more than 5 words of Italian and by the end of the course, I knew hundreds and hundreds of words. I could speak in multiple tenses, write papers, and really use what I was learning. I learned basic Italian and I feel very confident in my skills so far. I learned about Italian culture, watched films, and food.",
    "Knowledge and command of elementary Italian. Ability to speak, comprehend, read, and write in elementary Italian."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths-professors\/textbooks\r\nWeakness-fast pace, but theres nothing they can do about this",
    "Strengths: great professors, accessible textbook, fun class activities\r\nWeaknesses: fast timeframe for learning material and not enough time to cover more culture",
    "- strengths: the class is everyday which keeps you accountable. The teachers were AMAZING! Anna is so kind and comical. Megan is super chill. This class could have been a real drag, but they made it so much better. \r\n\r\n- weaknesses: going to class everyday for 2 hours wasn't too bad, but the quantity of material we covered in 5 weeks was pretty crazy. The pace is super fast. We learned a lot, but I don't know how much was cemented in me. Since this summer was online, it was really hard to keep up with the pace without the immersive aspect of living with a host family. However, this could be a good thing if you really vibe with the language like that.",
    "the reverse-classroom style was really productive - we studied the grammar before class, then reviewed in class. I think we should have had more guidance for practice exercises to do on our own, and sometimes class time felt a bit misused - more practice\/review exercises and correcting together in class would've been helpful, and given us the opportunity to ask specific questions centered in examples",
    "The professors were great and very kind, knowledgable, motivating, and encouraging! They were understanding of the fact that we were doing Zoom classes and were happy to accommodate us as we worked out how to use Canvas\/Zoom\/remote classes in general. They switched up the different types of activities we did in class which was nice for a change of pace--sometimes we did textbook activities, sometimes we did more inventive and fun activities, etc. They used breakout rooms effectively for us to practice conversation. They stayed after class a little bit each day to let us wrap up any last questions we had. \r\n\r\nThe course is obviously very fast-paced and it is hard to wrap your head around all the concepts we learn so quickly, but that's an inherent part of such an intensive course",
    "The class was great but there was a lot to cover in very little amount of time.",
    "Strengths: This was by far the most engaging and interactive class I have ever taken over Zoom, this was due to the fact that participation was key to learning so I had to stay focused and engaged, we used breakout rooms which was a great way to practice and get to know other students, all aspects of Zoom were utilized to make this course feel very personal all while being on a computer, the professors were AMAZING, they were funny, nice, and welcoming, they made the class a comfortable space and I was never afraid to say an answer or share my opinion, they never made me doubt myself or feel bad for getting a question wrong but rather used it as a way to learn for the entire class to learn and that made a huge difference!! I felt comfortable and happy to participate even if I didn't know the right answer for everything, they always answered questions, and kept us focused with a clear agenda and goal for the class that day, we even had inside jokes, it was so much fun but at the same time challenging, I was constantly learning and putting in work to stay on top of things and I felt really accomplished by how much I learned\r\n\r\nEssentially, the class was a beyond excellent learning environment and I am so pleasantly surprised it was as interactive as it was despite being online, I really loved this class!! I learned so much but also had a great time! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the main weaknesses come from the fact that the class is still online and only five weeks long, so within the five weeks there was a lot of material to cover and it was very important to study and stay on top of things or you could easily fall behind, you had to be dedicated to this course since it requires a lot of hard work, there are a good amount of assignments, tests, and presentations because the class is five weeks the workload and material is intense but the professors really did a great job to make it as smooth as possible, also the final exam being 3 hours was exhausting considering the day before was an in-class presentation, so I think the timing of exams and spacing out of workload could improve, also the presentations took me a surprisingly long amount of time, because the class is online and in a limited time frame I do think there was less time for conversations and work on pronunciation, essentially the weakness was the workload and timing of assignments and less room for conversation and pronunciation practice, however those weaknesses arise from the nature of the fast and online course",
    "The course was excellent, I cannot think of any weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! The professors really want you to learn, and they dont care about grades too much!!",
    "Yes! The teachers are amazing and let you explore the language in a way that is very conducive to learning.",
    "Yes! Anna and Megan are wonderful, and I learned so much in such a short period of time.",
    "I would recommend this summer intensive version of the course if you already know another Romance language or have self studied a little bit before. Its nice to have a base knowledge so you can be ahead of the game. Despite the hard work, it was a pretty pleasant experience. The teachers were really encouraging.",
    "i would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn italian, and who's willing to put in a bit of extra work to be prepared\/comfortable with the material",
    "Yes absolutely, especially with Anna Marra or Megan Crognale! The course itself is well organized and structured, and both of them are great professors who care about their students and will make class fun.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The Professors made it the best they could considering the limited time frame and amount of material that had to be covered. You have to be dedicated and willing to put in the hard work but you will feel very accomplished and proud of yourself. The class was also fun and incredibly engaging! However, if a student has the ability to take courses at its full length and in person, I do think the class would be better (for obvious reasons since there is not a limited time frame) but this class was amazing!! I highly recommend it!!",
    "Yes! It's an excellent L1 course; the language is not too difficult to learn as long as you keep up with the (admittedly very fast) pace of the course. And Anna and Megan are great professors; they do everything they can to help you succeed -- take the class with them if you can!",
    "Yes. I enjoyed this course and learned a lot, yet it was never extremely overwhelming."
