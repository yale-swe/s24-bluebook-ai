                "This was my first academic experience with government legislation. The class greatly expanded my idea of sovereignty and how legislation connects to policy. There was a focus on the growth of tribal powers over time, as well as the current and ongoing issues between tribes and the federal government. There was also a (much appreciated) focus on the difference between undergraduate study and law school study over legislation. The class revealed to me how many ways law and policy can be analyzed and interpreted. It also gave me enough practice with law to feel comfortable taking another class on government with less initial hand-holding."

                "I loved this class!",
                "Strengths - It seems many more Indian law cases enter the legal radar as the US reckons with legal and racial history. Therefore, the instructor has the ability to incorporate different legal cases and legislative procedures into course materials. \r\n\r\nWeakness - The instructors does not understand how to fully operate all the necessary technologies to ensure a good virtual classroom.",
                "This class teaches so much about a specific part of Native American history that is fascinating and seldom taught in any other class",
                "Weakness of the class: the instructor grades too harshly off the bat without adequately preparing students with information about his standards. The course's reading load is also poorly distributed--there's a lot more reading in the beginning and very little in the end. Strengths: the course material is fascinating, the assignments are well-designed and interesting to complete, and the instructor is really invested in student learning.",
                "I really learned a lot in this class, and I think everyone should learn more about American Indian history. The assignments were not too demanding, and Professor Blackhawk was very accommodating. I do think it might have been better off as a longer seminar once a week than meeting for a shorter time twice a week, because it sometimes felt like we didn't get to have a full conversation about the readings, but other than that, I can't think of any weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: Engaging readings. Grading that dramatically improves writing style. Engaging discussions in class. Incredible guest speakers. Class does not feel hard to keep up with. Good for people with an interest in Indian Law and structure of American government. Relevant to modern issues.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some readings came directly from law journals, so their length and verbage were hard to engage with. Some readings were too long, so seminar discussions rarely incorporated close analysis of texts. Class discussions often deviated from plans on syllabus, so it was hard to remain motivated to do all of the readings. Grammar and sentence structure are really addressed in the class, so it feels like it impacts one's essay grade to an extent larger than feels necessary."

This was a morning class, so it was the only class I was somewhat happy went virtual since I could just slide out of bed. Professor prefers to grade by hand, so receiving feedback on papers was limited."

                "Yes, I think it's important to learn about American Indian history because this is often left out of American history education. I also think this is a great opportunity for people interested in law because it exposes you to reading cases and law review articles, and Professor Blackhawk brings in guests who talk about law school and careers in federal Indian law. And Professor Blackhawk is great!",
                "I would recommend this course if you are motivated to take the course. It is good for students wanting to attend law school, but there is some downtime for students who do not."
