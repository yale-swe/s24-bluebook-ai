                "very useful criticism on essay drafts that helped me improve my writing. my writing is much better for it. however, the readings weren't often well connected to our writing, and the professor tried to stay out of discussions too much.",
                "In the first half of the course, it was frustrating that we would not usually close read entire pieces. Instead, we would hyper fixate on the first paragraphs of a piece. After acknowledging this in a mid-semester review, the course shifted to read pieces holistically. A strength of this course was the open discussion and copious contribution from students, though our professor directed conversation and challenged indefensible comments.",
                "Very well organized and streamlined in terms of assignments and feedback! I wish we read from a more diverse range of authors.",
                "The course readings are varied and engaging and class discussions about the readings helped to distill strategies for showing ideas to the reader. Class free writes and workshops of essays by classmates were very helpful. Individual feedback on a rough draft and final draft of all essays from the professor were very helpful for identifying specific weaknesses and seeing growth in your writing. One weakness is that it can be difficult to get up to speed at the start if it is your first college writing course depending on your writing background.",

                "My section of English 120 improved communication skills for both the most experienced high school journalists and the (relative) newcomer to the English language. It was great to share comments and writing to our class, and it was great to be exposed to the ideas found in the works selected by our professor and written by peers.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. As a STEM major, I did not anticipate enjoying the class as much as I did. The workload is manageable yet my writing improved significantly. The class materials and topics are engaging and relevant.",
                "Definitely; the course teaches you how to become a strong writer, which is an essential skill to have regardless of your career path."
