   "comments": [
    "I learned a great deal about the traditional music of Japan, China, Indonesia, South India, and parts of Central Asia.",
    "I delved into an area of learning that I'd never previously studied in an academic context, and gained significant knowledge of a handful of musical traditions from across Asia and their histories, legacies, and impacts. I learned about how to better approach such studies of music and culture, and gained insight into what the mind of an ethnomusicologist is like.",
    "I gained a vast amount of knowledge about traditional music in Asia, from the way they are performed to the contextual meaning of specific practices. It was quite interesting and helpful to learn about the ties between music, society, religion, and culture, which was the focus of this course. In terms of skills i gained from this course, the professor incorporated physical participation in learning instruments, dancing, and other aspects of the musical practices which allowed me to learn firsthand from an expert in the field of traditional music how to engage with the music. As for insights, I was able to make connections between this class and my Chinese Traditions class where I learned more in depth about religions and ideologies that were floating around Asia at the time. It was thoroughly interesting to see these connections and it made the course so much more concrete and real for me.",
    "I developed factual knowledge and insights into different instruments and musical practices performed throughout the Asian continent.",
    "Music practices and cultures throughout Asia",
    "This course opened my mind about how expansive music can be! We take so much for granted when we hear the word music, like the idea that it has be in rhythm or to be measured or to be melodic. I really view music as a totally different concept.\r\n\r\nI also learned overviews of many different music traditions and feel much more knowledgable in that regard."

   "comments": [
    "Although they were a little annoying, the unit packets were actually very helpful for solidifying the material.  However, the textbook readings were quite dry.  I feel like had we covered the basics in lecture (which we often did), reading time could have been better spent on more interesting specifics of each tradition.  For instance, I loved the reading on Acehnese dance.",
    "Excellent course, with fascinating readings, media, and concert opportunities.",
    "A strength of this course is most definitely the physical engagement we were allowed to do as part of the course. It was so much fun and I thoroughly enjoyed these activities. I also appreciated the professor's attempt to cover as much area as we could and still go into depth in those areas. There is so much to cover when one says \"Music Cultures of Asia\", but I am quite satisfied with the material I learned this past semester. One weakness would be that the lack of assignments that force students to fully comprehend the readings. Because the other activities were so much fun, there were times that the focus on the information we were supposed to be learning from the readings was forgotten. Perhaps more assignments to have us reflect on the readings would allow us to retain more information from the readings.",
    "The strengths of this course were the more interactive sections such as the soundwalk, using gamelan instruments, listening to music sections, and learning from our guest speakers. All of these elements helped me learn more about musical cultures and solidify the concepts that we learned in class. One weakness that I could see is that the discussions did not seem incredibly well-structured to promote the best learning.",
    "Pretty interesting and relaxing",
    "Maho is an excellent teacher! The readings she gave us were very strong and so were class discussions and presentations giving us the bare bones about each topic. What made the class incredible were the interactive moments when Maho either brought one of her friends (or her spouse) as a guest speaker or herself involved us in practicing Solkattu, mrdangam, gamelan, Aceh dance, Bharatnatyam, mudra, wayang kulit, erhu orchestral playing, and more.\r\n\r\nThe unit packets though tedious while doing them provided a really helpful concrete show of what we learned throughout the semester and was really helpful for the paper at the end."

   "comments": [
    "It would not be my first recommendation, but I would still recommend it to anyone interested in Asian ethnomusicology.",
    "Absolutely! The course was chockfull of interesting content and sensory experiences, and emphasized an environment where individual areas of interests and passions could be addressed through presentations and the final paper. The layout of the course was well structured, where the unit packets\/essays were immensely useful for synthesizing material learned in that unit and letting the student engage in their own analysis of both ideas and firsthand experiences. Ishiguro is a wonderful instructor;  extremely knowledgeable,  kind, and invested in the students and the arts.",
    "Yes, it was so much fun and engaging in every way. I really enjoyed the activities the professor brought into the classroom, as well as those that were outside of the classroom, and I truly believe that one would not be able to know about these traditional musical practices in Asia as well as they could if they had taken this course. There are so many opportunities to engage with traditional music of Asia right here in the US, and it was this class that allowed me to discover those opportunities and engage in them.",
    "Yes, I came to this class with almost no musical knowledge, and I came out of it with more perspective about the study of music.",
    "Really chill and interesting class. Maho is a great instructor.",
    "Yes, I would!!! This course opened my mind about how expansive music can be! We take so much for granted when we hear the word music, like the idea that it has be in rhythm or to be measured or to be melodic. Or even the idea that music is an idea that is separate from sound can not exist in some countries!!! I really view music as a totally different concept.\r\n\r\nMaho is an excellent teacher!
