                "Strengths: the textbook is super clear and helpful, the tests are not too challenging, the weekly paragraphs really help build writing ability, and the class is relatively low stress\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there could be more spontaneous speaking in Italian during class",
                "A major strength of this course is the emphasis on learning Italian culture. it makes the class so much more interesting and so much more full to be constantly talking about food, traditions, cultural sites, etc. There is also a language exchange program where we were paired with a student in Italy and that was really fun and allowed additional opportunities to practice. You also get really good and helpful feedback in written assignments and on tests. Professors in the Italian department are so kind and so helpful. A weakness is that they don't really emphasize pronunciation, which can be difficult.",
                "Strengths: meeting and covering new material everyday ensured I was engaged and learning the language, variety of assignments and activities, chances to practice speaking and interact with other students and Deborah\r\nWeaknesses: more opportunities for optional practice and review would have been useful at times",
                "The different ways in which we practice our Italian (writing, reading, speaking, and listening) were varied and as a result we got more practice and a better understanding of the language as a whole which is a strength of the course. It was fast paced but our professor ensured we understood the basics before we moved on to more complex topics that required the knowledge taught before. The course is almost entirely strengths and I can't really think of any weaknesses except that the class tended to run over time and it being a course you take everyday you would imagine the time would be enough.",
                "The strength is that all the grammar and vocab concepts are fit into units that make sense and teach also about the culture of Italy. The weakness was in the monotony of the workbook pages, but they were helpful so it wasn't too bad.",
                "Besides COVID restraints, I thought the course was conducted very well. Access to additional resources and practice opportunities was good."

Deborah made the class highly engaging (which was key over Zoom), gave great feedback, and was often clear about the expectations for assignments and the class as a whole.  At the end of this course, I felt like I had made significant progress in learning the language, and I look forward to continuing the language.",
