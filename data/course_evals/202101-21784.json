                "the material is very interesting (though I think less of an emphasis on Stanislavsky would be nice), the workload of the class was pretty irregular (the first couple weeks were very busy then towards the end it alternated by each day of class)",
                "The organization in this class was loose. It was a covid semester and they tried to have half the class on zoom and the other in person which may have jostled the syllabus because it was adjusted weekly.",
                "Generally, I like the outline of the course, starting with monologues, working through scenes, and finishing with the more flexible final.  I have two main pieces of feedback: First, I feel like it would have been helpful to have \"final presentations,\" or at very least hard off-book deadlines for the monologues and scenes.  Having those deadlines would, I think, have helped me motivated myself to work on my own.  Second, while I appreciated the discussion in the first week about the limits of Stanislavsky, we then really only focused on his system (and derivatives of it) for the rest of the semester.  I feel like it would have been helpful to have even just a few weeks where we discussed techniques that are not founded in his work, because it's harder to grapple with the limitations of his style when we can't easily conceive of anything else.",
                "The only real improvement I might make to this course is a bit more discussion of and practice with implementing some of the practices we read about in Stanislavski and Hagen's texts, since we did read about some of them without ever talking about them. Still, I really enjoyed the practice-based structure of this course, and I wouldn't change much about it.",
                "Strengths: this courses attempts to meet in-person as much as possible!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it could have been organized better to communicate with students how they were doing in this class other than the two meeting with an instructor. The only grades we received before the final grade (which I still have not seen as I have to submit this evaluation in order to see it) was the grade on one of the papers, which was only worth 5% of our grade. I think it would have really helped me feel more confident in the class if I knew more clearly where I stood and had more timely feedback on papers.",
                "I really enjoyed this class throughout the semester. I was very grateful for the amount of time and effort with Professor Stokes and Professor Brooks put into ensuring that the course was informative and rewarding regardless of whether students were on Zoom, in the studio, outside, or split between different locations. The only way in which I think this course could have been improved is that I think it would have been helpful to get written feedback on the second paper we wrote for the class before we were asked to write the third, if this would be at all possible in future iterations of the class (however I understand that this was a very hectic semester for all professors)."

                "I think that both professors succeeded remarkably on making a class which is usually highly contingent on in-person contact work very well while incorporating aspects of virtual learning, as well as social distancing and masking regulations. The online seminars earlier in the semester were very useful for grounding us in the core concepts of the course, and later hybrid classes allowed for effective application of these concepts within a continually COVID-safe setting."

This course will give you a great foundation from which to approach all future performing, and the connections you get to build with the instructors and your classmates are wonderful.",
                "It depends. Its required for the TAPS major, but if youre just someone casually interested in theater, I think there are more interesting courses in the department to take that would feel a little less old dead white man-centric.",

I felt that I received a great deal of individual feedback and attention throughout the vast majority of the course, and both professors were incredibly supportive and insightful on helping me improve my performance skills."
