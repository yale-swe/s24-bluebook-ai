    "General skills and knowledge regarding basic level of lab work in organic chemistry.",

I also learned the importance of understanding the hazards associated with various chemicals and experiments. Additionally, I improved in many important skills such as close analysis and quantitative reasoning.",

    "I learned a lot about the techniques used in an organic chemistry lab which helped me better understand some of the concepts that I was learning in the lecture course.",
    "I learned different laboratory techniques such as filtration, recrystallization, thin-layer chromatography and many more!",
    "How to purify, separate, use vacuum filtration. Many techniques that were not previously learned.",
    "I learned how to synthesize compounds and analyze their purity."

   "comments": [
    "Dr. D is an incredible professor and was extremely kind and helpful during lab.",
    "The teacher and TA were both very good. I liked how we went into lab twice a week and how all the labs were designed for maximum time and chemical efficiency. I believe that the first PLA was graded very harshly--the students were not given a description of all criteria that was necessary (ie a bunch of points were taken off all of our PLAs that were for things we were not aware we needed). In addition, the general vibe in the lab was great. There was seriousness with the chemicals, but it was much more relaxed with percent yield and stuff than general chemistry. More specifically, I was not stressed out in this lab like I was in gen chem. In addition, considering the amount of time and effort put into this class, I believe it should be weighted as more than just .5 of a credit (should be 1 credit).",
    "I think this class is great. Dr. DiMeglio instructs the course very well, explains things clearly, and is always willing to help.",
    "I think that this course was coordinated well with the lecture course which made it easier to understand the labs.",
    "I enjoyed how the course really built off of itself! The first labs focused on skill-building and then the later labs synthesized all of those skills. It was really neat being able to see how the foundational practices came together in the synthesis labs. The only weakness was the final- I really messed it up and it brought my grade down quite a bit. I would have appreciated a bit more guidance on how in-depth the questions would be. I went through the practice exam questions and felt confident, but the actual exam questions really got me.",
    "The course is very good at following what is being learned in the lecture portion of organic chemistry so it helps solidify what is being learned.",
    "I think the lab is structured well and I would not change it."
