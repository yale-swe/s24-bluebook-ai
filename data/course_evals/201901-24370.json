    "I researched under Professor Baskin-Sommers. I learned research presentation methods, the design of the lab's studies, and the process of participant recruitment",

    "Research techniques",
    "I gained an even greater knowledge of canine cognition this year working in a different study, while also improving my skills working in a lab.",

   "comments": [
    "I liked that I was exposed to the research side of psychology outside of the classroom, as well as being actively involved in a lab (including lab meetings, running participants, etc.)",
    "Researching from credit was a great practice of collaboration, but I also wish I had an individual project to accompany lab work so that I felt more invested in the course",
    "Being a part of this lab was a great experience. It could be improved with more chances for members of the lab to connect (and to connect with Dr. Santos).",
    "I thought the lab provided a lot of opportunities to get involves and learn a lot. I don't have any complaints!",
    "The strengths is the chance to learn hands on research techniques",
    "The lab is a great environment to learn in and I enjoy working there every semester. The managers are open to any questions and understand your experience level.",
    "strengths: working with dogs, engaging lab meetings\r\n\r\nweaknesses: none"

    "Great opportunity to develop practical skills in the lab!",
    "Definitely take this class! Especially if psychology is your major. Great way to get credits while also gaining research exposure. Choose your lab wisely though, because it definitely depend on what lab you end up in.",
    "Yes! A very realistic, hands-on approach towards learning what it's like to be a researcher",
    "Absolutely! Mod lab is such a fun and safe environment for personal growth. Arielle Baskin-Sommers is amazing and it's fun to know that you are contributing to her important work.",
    "Yes. I would recommend it to a student who wants to get involved in research, but doesn't have the time to commit to one credit worth of research.",
    "I would definitely recommend for other students to get involved in this lab! It was so much fun, and a great experience!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The half-credit means that it's not too much time spent in the lab, but you still get the hands-on experience of seeing the things you learn about in class being played out in actual research. It was very cool to be involved in planning and carrying out different projects, and you get a lot of insight into the behind-the-scenes research process.",
    "Yes!!",
    "I would recommend this lab to another student. The colleagues you work with are all very kind. The graduate students and Laurie are all willing to help you with any work you are interested in and willing to help you move further in the field.",
    "yes if you're interested in cog sci or psych and want to understand how research works"
