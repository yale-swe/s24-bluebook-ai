During Daisuke's lectures I learned all the Python code basics and integration and derivative techniques, as well as working with arrays and lists. Also, learning Monte Carlo simulations and particularly working on the simulation of diffusion was really fun and rewarding.\r\n\r\nAritra's part of the class was initially more difficult but I ended up enjoying it a lot. I really liked learning about regression techniques, k-means clusters, decision trees, etc. Lastly, the last segment of the class on Convolutional Neural Networks was really fascinating and given that during my graduate studies I will implement some machine learning methods, I am very happy that I got to learn about these topics and executing code succesfully.",

I got more intuition into things like efficiency and flow of code, and learned some foundational skills like function writing, the difference between for loops and while loops, and basic integration techniques. In the machine learning portion of the class I learned about different types of machine learning models and their applications, including linear and logistic regressions, k nearest neighbors, and neural networks.",

            "comments": [
                "This course has too many strengths to list. It was really nice working during class time in teams because people who are less experienced with code learn a lot from their peers. \r\n\r\nI believe it is not needed but I will mention it anyways: Daisuke and Aritra are amazing teachers. Also, the TAs Isaque and Naomi were always available to lend a helping hand",
                "Strengths -- robust support from all of the instructors and TFs; leminar format was good for being able to explore these topics in a space that wasn't too big\r\nWeaknesses -- the psets got pretty long, especially in the second half of the semester, and I often felt like we hadn't had enough time to dive deep into the code during class",
                "This course does an excellent job of starting from zero assumed knowledge of Python and teaching students, by the end, how to work with convolutional neural networks and other advanced programming structures. The course is well organized to ensure the workload and difficulty remain consistent; there was one week which was extraordinarily difficult as it was one of the first weeks of the machine learning topic and the material had grown in difficulty rather quickly, but this was quickly mitigated as the instructors toned down the workload of the remaining assignments to bring it in line with the rest of the course. If this is kept in mind for next year and the difficulty of that week is also toned down, then the workload of this course will be even better balanced!",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The layout of class time with half lecture and half group work on homework assignments was conducive to learning and productivity. It's helpful to have built-in time to work with your group, especially time comes right after class to immediately apply concepts.\r\n- Clear concept-based lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Big mix of students with varied skills in coding; makes it difficult to collaborate with others in your group with more/less expertise.\r\n- The ML lectures did not connect well to the ML assignments.\r\n- TF support was not very helpful.",
                "The first half of the class was strong, although the lectures could be a bit boring, the workload was challenging (for me, a semi novice coder) but still manageable by attending office hours with the TAs. The second half of the class changed gears quite a bit. The lectures were very engaging, but the workload went through the roof. For one thing, the problem sets first became much harder (overwhelmingly so), and then they addressed that by giving us pre-written code and asking that we simply fill in certain parts, which didn't help me learn how the code worked very well. That was unfortunate because I needed to understand that for our final projects. They also held off assigning the final projects until almost the end of class, and provided the rubrics even later, while still requiring us to submit problem sets. This took the class from challenging but manageable to extremely stressful. I also would have preferred having my own final project to work on and present, rather than doing it as a group. My group suddenly had to schedule in extra time to meet and work on the project in the last week and a half of classes and Reading Period, which ended up putting us behind because no one had extra free time and some of us had multiple finals and exams in the timeframe we were supposed to be writing up the project. Our group was assigned a TA to mentor us on the project, but they did not reach out very much and we really struggled.",
                "strengths: the TAs were amazing and very helpful \r\n\r\nweaknesses: the 3 hour classes were very long at times",
                "The class is a great intro for a lot of computing concepts. However, by the end of it it does become less de novo writing and more editing existing code. Personally this is a negative but some students did enjoy this a lot.",
                "Good course content and felt like I learned many applicable skills, and Professor Nagai is great. I only wish it was split into two days a week instead of being one long lab session. PSets increase significantly in difficulty in the second half of the course, but still very manageable.",
                "Amazing teaching staff, intriguing lectures. Professors and TAs were wonderful. Weakness is that the course gets very time-consuming in the last third. I wish it would have been a little bit less hectic at the very end.",
                "This course was an amazing introduction to Python as someone who has only dabbled in it before, and I feel like it will be very helpful for my future research. There was a drastic jump in the difficulty of the psets in the second half, but many people had discussions with the TFs and the issue was addressed by the end of the semester. The final project was a great way to practice the skills we had learn in a less structured manner.",
                "Strength: robust course content, instructors and TAs are nice people\r\nWeakness: a lot of work (this course should be 1.5 credit); no pset drop; entire course depends on your arbitrary lab group so if you can, take it with your friend",
                "Too rushed. The profs were excited to cover every topic, but there were just too many to cover so it felt like a survey class without depth. Overall very good introduction. Sometimes the workload was too much and too complicated to meet the weekly deadline but profs very understanding and considerate",
                "Two big weaknesses: \r\n1) The timing of deadlines. Having psets  and the final project due at 5pm every Thursday felt very awkward for me. I would very much have preferred a midnight deadline (or at least a grace period) like some other classes have to offer. The class isn't very generous about giving extensions for pset due dates.\r\n2) Inflexibility of attendance. I had an unexpected emergency and I lost points off of participation for that. I understand it's important that we prioritize the class in our schedules, but I think the participation grading system should be a bit more lenient, at least for notif in advance absences.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Literally everything else. Lecture notes and homeworks are fairly easy to follow. TAs do their best to be available to give help when people need it. PSets are great learning resource for python. The final project is also incredibly rewarding. Nagai really went all out making the class fun and down-to-earth.\r\n\r\nImprovements: Fixing the two weaknesses. That's all!",
                "Big jump between first and second half.",
                "Strengths - In the second half of the course, you learn about the introduction of machine learning, which is an important skills\r\n\r\nCons - if you know even very basic programming, the whole first half of the course is extremely boring. Additionally, the problem sets in the machine learning problems sets are just filling in one specific line of code so you don't fully learn how every part works or what different parameters mean.",
                "Huge imbalance of backgrounds in the course (only pre-req really is that you are a junior or senior) which made me feel lost / confused for most of the semester",

                "Yes! A great alternative to the extremely theory-based machine learning courses in the S&DS department. Good for people who want to gain some experience in machine learning without the added stress",
                "Absolutely! If one wants a lower-stress introduction to scientific computing and machine learning that will still be useful for their other coursework, this is a good course to take -- I see it as the perfect course for students of physics and other non-CS fields who'd like to learn Python and advanced programming concepts without the excessive (and, I would argue, unnecessary) stress and workload of an advanced CS class.",
                "This class is a good course for students with some exposure to coding who are looking for more information about machine learning, especially students looking for a science credit. Any physics concepts that are implemented in code are sufficiently explained in class; even students with no physics experience can take this class.",
                "I would recommend this course under a couple conditions. If you are a student majoring in a science field where Python is the industry standard language (bonus points if you've seen it before!) and you aren't at a super advanced level. There were definitely students in the class for whom the first half of the class was \"too easy\" because they had already mastered Python, and they were only there for the machine learning part. I think that negatively impacted the instructors' ideas on how to design the second half of the class, because they saw people flying through the first psets. However, if you have never seen Python before, and have no real stake in wanting to learn it (i.e. you won't be using it in research or at an internship), this is also not a good class for you because you will struggle with the first half and probably not find the second half engaging enough to put in the time to work through it (this was a few people I worked with). \r\n\r\nThe TA's and instructors were all very helpful in the office hours and the \"lab\" portion of the class, and I really appreciated having slides and sample code to work off of when doing the problem sets. If the final projects had been assigned (with rubrics!) before Spring Break, I would have given this a stronger recommendation, because outside of that the class would have been challenging but manageable.",
                "Yes 100% Professor Nagai is amazing and the teaching team is really committed towards teaching you why we use Python and how we can make it do more complex work. Aritra is also an incredible lecturer and his knowledge about how we use computers and how that changes is an endless fountain of wisdom.",
                "Yes, especially if you're looking to fulfill the machine learning requirement for the S&DS certificate.",
                "Yes I would!! Amazing course and learned a lot.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone, especially physics majors (but I don't think you need to be one to enjoy the course). It was well-taught, well-structured, and very engaging.",
                "If you are looking for S&DS certificate credit, this is prob the easiest approved course out of other selection. However, that doesnt mean this course is easy  this course is pretty demanding for a once a week meeting class (I think this should be 1.5 credit), not to mention the weekly p set with no pset drop. The TAs were super helpful/nice, but the OHs could get crowded. We asked if one p set could be dropped to which the instructor said no  but I think that should be implemented in the future. The seminar thing was weird, and I thought it was pretty inconsiderate for them to to schedule that at the end of the semester when everyone is so busy. The entire course is split in two sections  computation and machine learning  but I found these two portions pretty disconnected. Two sections also had different workload which made the time management difficult at times.",
                "Yes it gives the basics of machine learning and programming. Kind of hard at first because I didnt know programming but its immersive learning",
                "Yes, absolutely. I would argue that it's the best class in all of Yale to take to learn coding (in python), especially for those who have no experience. Prof. Nagai does a really good job making learning how to code accessible for non-CS majors, so it's very background friendly!",
                "This isn't a great course, but it's not a terrible course. For most of it, I found it pretty boring. I think the only thing I learned was the basics of a few machine learning algorithms. The grading is pretty lenient though.",
                "Yes, ultimately learned a lot about ML. The first half of the course I felt more meh about.",
                "It depends. The content towards the end with machine learning, neural networks, etc. was interesting, and working on the final project was cool, but classes were very long (1-4PM on Fridays), which it made it hard to sit through. Lectures are also quite dry, and psets can sometimes feel redundantly long. However, TFs for the class were amazing and the professors seemed very open to feedback."
