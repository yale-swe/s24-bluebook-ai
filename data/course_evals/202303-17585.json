                "I learned a great deal about historical events and themes surrounding empires and how they've changed since the 1800s.",
                "Knowledge about different empires and forms of imperialism, especially tied to the empires from the last two centuries\r\nSkills regarding information synthesis and discussion; also writing",
                "General histories of some of the world's major empires (British, Russian, Qing, Japanese), colonialism, and anti-imperial resistance.",
                "The course gave me broad strokes about different empires and their practices compared with each other. However, the strokes are too broad. The course felt as if it brushed off too much, too fast. I came out with some very broad superficial insights, like \"the Ottomans were attempting to modernize more than the Japanese.\" But I didn't gain any deep understanding of why certain empires did certain things.\r\n\r\nThe main problem of the course is that it has too many topics. I would cut out all contemporary questions. This is a history course, not a global affairs seminar. Study only the British, Chinese, and Ottoman empires. I would also structure the class around topical questions (military force, economic structures, political legitimization, etc.) instead of around empires to promote comparison. I would also triple the amount of reading (I'm sorry, 150 pages on the entire Ottoman empire is a joke) and instead cut out three out of four essays. Essays are bad for learning new comparative material. Essays force specialization because a student needs to know quite a lot to write insightful 10/30 pages on any given topic.\r\n\r\nClass discussions were underwhelming. Almost no one did the readings and just spoke to speak. There should be fewer students (below 15), more selection, and no underclassmen. Professor Westad should also be more active in moderating discussions in an old-school way. I would be happy if the professor had pushed back against students when they voiced flawed arguments and cold-called people to summarize readings in order to force students to read.",

He's also very good at putting students in conversation with himself and each other, so I always felt confident to talk when I could.\r\n\r\nI think there could have been more of an emphasis on frameworks for how we analyze history, which especially would have helped us as we wrote our papers.",

                "Strengths: great cohort of students led by a passionate, kind, welcoming professor. Professor Westad is such a broad and deep thinker in these subjects, and he led discussions on such a diversity of topics with so much skill and nuance. He seemed genuinely interested in students' takes and engagement in the class. Weaknesses: would like more feedback on all the submitted assignments, more opportunities to speak with the professor outside of class for insights or guidance on research projects.",

Not by any means a necessary course for non-global or non-history majors but a great one to understand the history of our world better. A genuinely interesting class in my opinion",
