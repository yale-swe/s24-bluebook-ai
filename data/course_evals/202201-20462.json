                "Professor Boorman is a treasure trove of wisdom -- both of knowledge and lived experience, and he conveys it as he speaks. It's easy to get lost in his monologues, which is why his classnotes are life-savers. Ensuring that the classnotes are supplied for each class is the only way I can conceive to improve this course. There are no surprises on the midterm and final. The readings are rich and varied -- even picking-and-choosing what readings you're interested in over the course of a semester will leave you feeling beyond sated.",
                "This class is probably the most enlightening of all the classes I have taken at Yale. It has changed the way I think and will affect how I view all classes going forward. With that being said, you really need to focus to get this information out of the class. Zoom did not help but things weren't always presented in the clearest way. A big weakness is that the entire grade is the final exam which can be stressful."

                "If you see yourself in a position drafting and implementing public policy from scratch, if you're interested in the word of policy engineering hidden behind the veil of partisan politics, then I'd recommend this course. During the first two weeks, you will think many, many, MANY times about dropping this course, because you feel Professor Boorman drones on. If you're interested in the subject matter, DONT drop it! Start asking questions on how your policy interests relate to the syllabus, and you will unlock a playground of knowledge and guidance.",
                "I would recommend this class to a very specific type of student. If you are interested in the logistics and details of policy and its implementation and are able to focus well, I would recommend this class. If you are taking it because the workload rating is low, I wouldn't because it is only low because the only grade is the final exam, which is stressful in its own way. This class changed the way I view the world, but I don't think it is for everyone. I would recommend shopping it at least to see if the style is for you."
