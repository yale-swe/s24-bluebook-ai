                "The class was intense and fast-paced, so I learned a lot. I would have preferred if we spent more time on speaking in class and had fewer tests, as we generally had 2-3 tests or quizzes every week.",
                "This was a great introduction to Japanese. The class style -- learning most of the grammar outside of class and then reviewing the more difficult material and practicing conversation in class -- was effective for covering a lot of content without getting left behind. The homework occasionally felt a little bit like busywork, but it was often helpful for pinpointing misunderstandings of grammar and practicing vocabulary. It was enjoyable to be in class, and I felt motivated to study the material in order to perform well in class discussions.",
                "The course is well taught and very organized. Another strength is that students will definitely receive quick, constructive feedback. Though it's not a weakness, students should be prepared to complete homework every weekday.",
                "This class teaches a lot of Japanese. Although the workload is high, it was understandable in order to drill the language to stick in our minds."

                "The class was very small, so we were able to meet in person. This was very helpful.",
                "The synchronous classes every day really works well. The engagement level was very high, and my listening and speaking really improved. Heard that other sections had one asynchronous class every week--pretty glad that my session didn't have this.",
                "Starting about a month into the semester, Stever-sensei moved class in-person for the four people who could attend. The other three students joined the class over Zoom. I thought this was effective when I was in-person, but for days when I joined the in-person class over Zoom, I found it difficult to follow the conversation happening in the class.",
                "I think in a language course like JAPN 110 specifically, virtual learning lacked a lot of elements that in-person learning provided. In addition, having some students learning in the classroom and others over Zoom led to some confusion due to lack of coordination.",

The class was also really well-organized and it was easy to plan ahead.",
