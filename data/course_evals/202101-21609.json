Homework was graded for completion and included feedback about the correct answer so you weren't afraid to make mistakes and could learn from them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The workload was way too much for a class that doesn't satisfy any distributional requirements. The expectations required a whole bunch outside studying, which was simply not worth it.",

We learned the basics of musical notes, progressions, and harmonies then were expected to know them by ear the following week. I think there could have been a lot more attention paid to practicing listening to music than there was in class.",

Without that background, I'm not sure I would have been able to get through the class. It doesn't seem like this class is geared towards people who are casually interested in music\/who don't have some sort of experience interacting deeply with music.
