However, all of this learning was done during reading period. This is because HIST 311 was taught in an extremely chaotic manner, in which the professors threw information at us in a disorganized fashion during rushed lectures.

            "comments": [
                "This course has so much potential because it covers such an interesting period and civilization. That said, there was what seemed to be a complete lack of organization and a disconnect between the professors and students. For example, the professors refused to post lecture slides prior to the lectures out of fear that it would incentivize students to skip lecture. This made no sense to me, and I found it to be quite the opposite. I would rather skip the live lecture and watch the recording with the slides in front of me than watch the live lecture with no slides. It made lectures incredibly difficult to follow. Additionally, there was no clear purpose to each lecture, as they all went off on tangents about specific artifacts.",
                "The class was fairly straightforward in terms of what it required of students. Although lectures at times felt haphazard, with the information in lecture not always aligning with what the professors wanted us to internalize about a given topic.",
                "Weakness, some of the lectures seem to cover events randomly. As a student who has never taken an Egyptian history class before I found I learnt a lot more from the textbook than the lectures as the information in lectures was not always chronological. It took me a while to wrap my head around the chronology of the events we covered. I think the course also tries to cover way too much history within such a short class. We covered nearly 3,500 years worth of history within the class, and were expected to know the information and historical context of most of the kings, monuments, and events from this timeline which was very difficult to remember for the final exam.",
                "The content of the class itself is really interesting, and the lectures were quite pleasant (despite the fact that they completely lacked organization). I looked forward to going to class each week, and I could feel the passion of the professors and appreciated their dedication to teaching us. The papers we wrote also felt feasible and were not graded too harshly. That being said, the class would have maintained this pleasant nature had it not been for the final exam. This consisted of several essay questions, and although the exam on the day-of was not terrible, the preparation for it was a huge undertaking given the chaotic manner in which the class had been taught throughout the semester. In order to improve this aspect of the class, I would say that the professors should consider making the exam open note, as I do not think my memorization of the topics aided in my understanding of ancient Egyptian history. It would also be more fair, in my opinion, to give us less potential essay questions on the study guide. While this guide was super helpful and definitely necessary, preparing for all fourteen essay questions (when only about 5 were on the exam) seemed like a waste of time after the exam was done. Going back to the lectures and class content, I think the class could be improved by moving chronologically through the course or thematically. The professors attempted to do both  first giving us a whirlwind tour through all 4,000 of Egyptian history followed by scattered thematic lectures.",
                "A strength of this course is the integration of lots of different types of sources, like literature and art along with material history. However, it was really difficult to tell which details were important and make sense of the sheer breadth of the history we cover.",
                "Strengths: v gutty\/low maintenance  only a couple of short papers and a final exam that we had all the questions for beforehand. Some of the info was interesting. The profs are nice. Section was helpful\r\nWeaknesses: tries to do too much at once. You cannot fit 4000 years of history into one semester. I constantly felt like we were learning irrelevant details instead of overarching themes. No one went to the lecture because it was kind of useless but it was better than the textbook, an archaeological text that was incredibly dense and spent way too much time explaining the measurements of various tombs. A bit disorganized and it felt like we were never given a foundational explanation of ancient Egyptian ideology before descending into the minutiae of the various states.",
                "Lectures were engaging and the course gave a good overview to ancient Egyptian history. However, I felt like too much history was covered during the semester, forcing us to just skim over a lot of what could have been really interesting information. The readings also tended to be a bit dense, but they always felt useful (especially when we went over certain primary sources in section.)",
                "Strengths: Low workload\r\nWeaknesses: Not engaging",
                "The course did a good job of dividing lectures between broad overviews of ancient Egyptian history and more specific, thematic focuses. This allowed for the course to cover ancient Egyptian history in a semester without only covering over three millennia of political history. \r\n\r\nAt times I felt the course was focusing too heavily on archaeology rather than history, but overall this did not detract too much from the course as the two subjects are closely linked when studying ancient Egypt.",
                "Cannot think of either; had no incentive to show up to class. I went the first lecture and got bored. Should've dropped when I had the chance.",
                "The final exam was a weakness in my opinion. I feel as though I wouldve learnt much more towards the end if I was able to write a cumulative final paper with proper sources and outside information, rather than just cramming for a final exam that expected us to know a large range of topics. Besides the final exam, I absolutely loved the class. The lectures were a strength, Prof. Manning and Moeller were very passionate and enthusiastic about what they taught and it made learning very fun. I hope they restructure the final to be a longer essay and not a timed exam - I think students would get a lot more out of it.",
                "The biggest strength of the course were the two professors, who were both very kind and inviting. The biggest weakness is that the information was taught a little too fast, and it was really difficult to absorb the content going at that pace.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-pretty interesting content\r\n-great guest lecturer on religion \r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-poor TF\r\n-sometimes slow lectures\r\n-didn't know what to take notes on (hard to differentiate what was information I should know from information that was for fun)",
                "I felt that this course was not very well structured and I felt that it was difficult to pinpoint what exactly we were learning as the information we got was quite scattered. It was difficult to follow lecture as we were covering so much ground but not in a well defined way. Because of this we would spend time in sections going over any confusions. This aspect of section was helpful, but it took away from what we were actually meant to be discussing during section. This meant that some things on the syllabus (like the key objects) often went undiscussed. Additionally, we would sometimes have extra reading or work sprung on us fairly last minute (less than 2 days in advance) when there was no mention of it in the syllabus.",
                "Strengths: the professors were engaging and clearly excited about the material. It was fun to have guest lecturers too. It also worked great having two professors, and I enjoyed the casual conversation style they had.\r\nWeaknesses: the course was a bit weirdly organized and it could be confusing between lectures, knowing how it was all tied together. We were also expected to know a lot of strange details.",
                "The biggest strength of the course was the two professors. Professor Mueller and Professor Manning were both super knowledgeable about the topics discussed in class and very receptive to student feedback. They also complimented each other nicely with one of them being more focused on Egypt and the other being a great historian generally. The biggest weakness of the course was that sometimes lectures could be difficult to follow. There was so much information, and I felt that sometimes lectures moved to fast between topics to where I was not able to take everything in.",
                "Professors were amazing and the material was extremely interesting.",
                "The course material was interesting and lectures were generally informative. One weakness would be that assignments and our grade wasn't directly related to class lectures and we sometimes had to rush through class lectures.",
                "The professors put in a lot of effort to make sure we were learning and engaging with the course -- I really appreciated that.",
                "The strength was that we were able to learn a wide variety of stuff, and the professors are very engaged with the course materials and always come to lecture very excited to speak and teach. They bring a lot of enthusiasm to the course, and often make it feel like telling stories rather than listing of facts. \r\nThe weakness was a bit of disorganization and confusion. Throughout the course, it was tough to follow how we were progressing through topics, and what we were supposed to be gaining from lectures. There were lots of readings and lecture covered a huge amount of info, so it was tough to pull out main concepts.",
                "We talked about certain topics in more depth during discussion section. It would have been helpful to have to a review of material from class through psets",
                "This course had some really excellent moments. In particular, the guest lectures were engaging, and some of the discussions of artifacts were as well. However, it felt like most of the time we were fed facts without much connection or analysis. I walked away from this course knowing little more about Egypt than I did before it began, and the syllabus didn't really live up to its promises. Lectures seemed really disjoint, and there was little focus on constructing a historical narrative. Moreover, the assignments felt completely unrelated to the work we did in class, and I felt like I learned more writing the papers than I did from any of the class readings.",
                "for whatever reason the professors taught the entire history of egypt in the first six weeks and then spent the last six weeks covering individual topics related to egypt. while it was nice to learn about those random topics, the first six weeks felt very rushed to cover the entire history of egypt."

                "Yes, but my answer is highly caveated. This was without question the most frustrating course I have ever been enrolled in. Not because of a challenging workload or difficult assignments, but because of the lack of organization and direction. I was so excited going into the course, as I had never taken a non-western-centric history course. I found the material to be incredibly interesting, but the lack of clear structure ultimately made the class so much more difficult than it had to be. There was what seemed to be a complete disconnect between the professors and students. For example, the professors refused to post lecture slides prior to the lectures out of fear that it would incentivize students to skip lectures. This made no sense to me, and I found it to be quite the opposite. I would rather skip the live lecture and watch the recording with the slides in front of me, than watch the live lecture with no slides. When I raised this point to my TA, they explained that the TAs had tried to make this case to the professors, who were absolutely opposed to the idea. That lack of flexibility made lectures incredibly difficult to follow. Additionally, there was no clear purpose to each lecture, as they all went off on tangents about specific artifacts rather than establishing clear points about historical events\/trends. Given the virtual learning environment, I would have thought that professors would do everything in their power to make the lectures as accessible as possible. I was wrong. My TA, Jen, proved to be incredibly helpful to that end; I think she understood the issues that students were raising, and it was clear that she did her absolute best to help give us a sense of direction and orientation. This class has so much potential, and I would hate to see it continue on this trend. It's cool to look at and learn about all the different artifacts, but at the end of the day, I just didn't find it to be a great learning environment. I have learned more about general ancient Egyptian history in the 2 days that I have studied for finals than I did throughout the entire semester.",
                "If you have a genuine interest in Ancient Egypt, this is a great survey-style course to get acquainted with it.",
                "Unless you already know a decent amount about the topics or are committed to doing all the assigned reading you will find the course difficult. Lectures were a bit random, and topics were not always chronologically covered. For the final exam we had to know the information and historical context of most of the kings, monuments, and events from 3,500 years worth of history.",
                "All in all, I would recommend this class to another student. I truly believe that some of the issues I had with the course stemmed from the fact that it was an online semester and the professors' first time teaching virtually. The class will feel really relaxed for most of the semester, but take good notes and actually do the readings because you need to be prepared for the final. Just know that it's coming. But the course itself was super interesting, and I don't regret taking it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course if you are at all interested in the course material. However, if you aren't just take another history class lmao.",
                "Only if you want a gut",
                "Yes! Great course. The instructors were very nice and accommodating, would recommend.",
                "If you're interested in ancient Egypt as well as archeology, and understand that you won't be going too in depth into the material, then yes. You do learn a lot about ancient Egypt during this course.",
                "No",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in ancient Egypt or ancient civilizations in general. The focus is very different from more modern history courses, and after taking this course I feel that I have a good understanding of ancient Egyptian civilization in the aggregate.",
                "No don't do it",
                "Sure, if you have an interest in ancient history. If you are considering this course to fulfill the PI requirement or as a relaxed fifth class, this is not it.",
                "Maybe. It depends on whether they would be interested in the subject matter. Most of my friends would not be learning about ancient Egypt, though I actually enjoyed the content more than I thought I would.",
                "I think the premise of this course is very exciting and there is a lot to learn from it, but because of how it was taught, I would not recommend this course to someone else.",
                "Only if theyre actually interested in Ancient Egypt. It was very specific and it would be hard to follow if you arent interested. If thats what you want it gives a good overview.",
                "If you are interested in Egyptian history, definitely! If you are just looking for an easier course, probably not. There is a lot of content and the class moved quickly, so I think a genuine interest in the material is a necessity.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes. Its an a amazing course with two amazing professors and dedicated TAs.",
                "If you are already interested in Egypt then yes. If you are on the fence then probably not.",
                "The course is a great class if you are interested in archaeology and learning more about Ancient Egypt. It is a little specific, so i would recommend it more to people who are planning on taking more classes about ancient Egypt. It was kind of a brief survey of 3000 years of history.",
                "Yes! This course was a great overview of Egypt's 4000-year history. If you want to go more in-depth with a particular time period or subject, both professors teach those courses too.",
                "Yes. The professors are great",
                "If you're really excited about Egyptian history, maybe. But it's a full course workload for a pretty small payoff. And I think you'd be better served taking something more focused if you really want to hone any kind of historical skill. A good fifth class perhaps, if you like to stay busy.",
                "a nice introduction to egypt, but i would not be too desperate to take it.",
                "If one wishes to learn more about Ancient Egypt in a way that covers the breadth of Ancient Egyptian history, but also touches on various themes of that history, this is the course to take."
