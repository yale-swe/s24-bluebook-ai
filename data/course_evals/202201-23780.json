                "I learned a lot about political theory, specifically different ways in which the state can be legitimized. Different thought processes have been used throughout history, it was pretty cool.",
                "I learned about the fundamental ideas that underlay political theory, and help contextualize the relationship between the individual and the state. Some of the material was the predictable entry-level kind of stuff you would find anywhere, but some of it was more unconventional and expanded my thinking, and some of it was simply odd and unnecessary.",
                "I thought my ability to take big chunks of readings and find the key points and arguments of each work increased as the semester progressed.",

                "I learned how to question political theory in a way I hadnt before. I learned there is no single way to define a successful government. I learned that each form of government legitimacy we learned can be understood through a variety of lenses. I learned how to put various political theories into conversation.",
                "I learned a lot about many contemporary and older political thinkers and their theories. We also learned about the critiques of many of these theories.",

I learned where conservatism came from, some the major discussions in political theory, and some of the ideas of authors I had meant to getting around to read (including Locke, Rousseau, Rawls, Nozick, Marx, and Burke; to.be sure, these were not the only authors read during the course)."

                "I really liked the format of lecture, I think section could have been a little more talkative for everyone, but a lot of the readings were difficult enough to where people did not know what to say",
                "Strengths - low workload, if that's your thing. Some of the readings are genuinely very interesting and will challenge your ideas of politics and society. \r\nWeaknesses - the professor is all over the place, the course follows no coherent path, and it isn't really clear how we end up learning the things that we do. \r\nThis course needs a clear narrative and a syllabus that builds each unit on the previous one, not an eclectic collection of books and theories from various time periods and standings.",
                "The regular section complements the lectures very well.",
                "The lectures were not great, and often felt unnecessary after having done the readings.",

                "Professor Steinmetz was very engaged and passionate about the topic. The weakness is that some of the material is boring, but it isn't the professor's fault.",
                "A lot of reading that doesnt get done",
                "While I loved the material, I think the readings were often a little two dense. I wish we read shorter sections more in depth. I feel like I could have gotten more out of the readings that way. Other than that, the class was strong.",
                "I like the lecture style this course was taught in, and the fact that we were able to debate interesting moral and philosophical questions during class.",
                "I would love sections to have been longer. The presentations were a nice touch, but once you add presentations, it is usually only after 25 or 30 minutes that we actually start to discuss the material. In a 50-minute section, that might mean only 20 minutes of discussion, where one might be expecting 50 minutes, which was often a big disappointment."

                "Yes. Very interesting course and I liked noticing that my knowledge of the topics increased as we got to more contemporary works, and I could more clearly see how each broad subject was connected to each other.",

                "Absolutely",
                "Yes! I surprisingly loved this course. The organization of the class was clear, straight forward, and comprehensive. The philosophers cover a wide range of topics and ideologies, and you will leave knowing a lot about the ideas of the last several hundred years.",

                "It's a decent introduction to political philosophy. Definitely interesting concepts and not much work (if you're in the non-writing section, the only assignments were the midterm and final, and the reading was manageable). I wasn't very engaged with this class and felt that not many people were doing the readings, paying attention in lecture, etc which made the class less rewarding. I think it could be a solid course if you put more into it than I did.",
                "Yes. It was very interesting and a great intro to polysci.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are intersted in political theory and different modes of organizing society.",
                "I really wanted to take Moral Foundations of Politics for this EP&E requirement, but this was the course available that satisfied this requirement this semester. I would still be tempted to take MoFoPo over this course, as nothing from the course seemed to be particular special."
