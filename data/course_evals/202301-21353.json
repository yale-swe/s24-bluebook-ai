                "This course takes microeconomics and delves into the mathematics behind it, covering consumer behavior, producer behavior, and some additional topics. The bulk of this class focuses on optimal decision-making, centering around consumers trying to maximize their utilities to firms in different types of markets maximizing their profits.",
                "You get what you expect from an intermediate micro course - nothing special but i really enjoyed it and thought the material was covered well.",
                "I developed knowledge about how consumers and firms maximize their utilities, Nash Equilibrium, externalities, monopolies, oligopolies, and how policies can work to encourage cooperation and mitigate externalities.",

                "Knowledge of dealing with microeconomic concepts from an increasingly mathematical standpoint  using calculus, Lagrangians, graphs etc. to address concepts we had briefly touched upon in ECON 115. Skills-wise, I learnt to bring different ideas together to answer complicated multi-step questions  being able to make predictions about market movements or consumer choices from writing down equations and utilizing multiple concepts was really satisfying. I will be taking ECON 122 later on, and am excited about a similar progression in terms of complexity with ECON 116 to ECON 122 as the microeconomics progression.",
                "It's like AP Microeconomics but you go in WAY more depth and you actually work out the math behind the concepts. Topics include lots of Cobb-Douglas, some game theory, risk aversion and insurance, market corrections, market clearing, demand functions, Edgeworth boxes, the Slutsky equation, perfect competition and monopoly and oligopoly, consumer and producer surplus, equilibrium, externalities, correcting externalities with taxes and quotas, maximizing utility by checking first- and second-order conditions, indifference curves. You use some multivariable calculus but you def don't need to have taken multi, it's only the very basics and if you have a strong foundation in single variable calculus you'll get the hang of it very quickly.",

                "Good lecture style, sections often very helpful.",
                "Prof. Frick and the class being recorded are the main strengths. Sitting in lecture can be dull but if you concentrate on what Frick says and her slides, they are actually very clear/ thorough (hence, why being able to watch the recordings are crucial). Also, her exams are very fair and not trying to trick students. The TFs were terrible but that's the case with most ECON courses.",
                "Not much feedback on psets but well organized material",
                "solid",
                "Strengths: interesting content, taught clear and concise\r\nWeaknesses: low engagement",
                "This class had so many resources. There were probably at least a dozen office hours per week and over 40 hours of office hours during reading week (and this is off-cycle!). The lecture slides were incredibly organized and easy to follow during and outside of class. ECON 121 is also by far one of the most well-organized and well-structured courses Ive taken as it starts by focusing on consumers; then focusing on producers; and then additional topics, and does so in a way where the knowledge points become naturally cumulative; everything builds upon each other very nicely, which also makes learning new ideas less complicated. The only weakness is that for people who grasp onto the content easily, this may end up feeling like a course that teaches you a few optimization techniques and then applying them in different flavors, in turn feeling like the content has little variety.",
                "The course was taught at a good pace but it is very dependent (meaning that you will get out of the course what you put into it).",
                "Strengths: lectures were concise and easy to comprehend, information was taught in a perfect order, and this course was brilliantly planned by Professor Frick.",
                "Professor Frick is phenomenal. Taking core ECON classes with any prof. at Yale is usually the same experience; you dont gain or lose much depending on the prof. That is not true here. You gain a lot by having Prof. Frick, even though the content is standard (given its a core class).",
                "Strengths: useful content\r\nWeaknesses: low student engagement, especially throughout the semester.",
                "n/a",
                "Very well structured and organized. No real qualms.",
                "The professor certainly help, Frick knows how to teach. The lectures are also not overwhelming, it is new information, you must learn it how anybody learsn anything, but in each lecture there is leeway for it to be covered in the next one, she does not burden you with unnecessary math. There are plenty office hours, the psets are 2 week deadlines. And each problem tells you where you can find the topic (lecture). The math also isn't pointless, you truly learn about optimal decisions and the comparative statics. And exams are  - ill say peaceful - there are not unnecessary curve balls or surprise topics, it is what you learn and the process is familiar from the psets. Course is designed well, and the math is taught to anyone who hates math.",
                "Mira is incredible at teaching, and is absolutely a strength of the course. The slides psets and exams are all also very well made.",
                "Professor Frick is an incredible teacher. She teaches so clearly, and engages with students wonderfully. I wish I hadn't skipped so many in-person lectures, but the ones that I did attend in person were great.",
                "Strengths: I think this course is very variable in terms of benefits, many of which depends on the professor teaching (I took this course briefly last semester until the midterm, and believe the professor is really important in the experience  see below). Given that, a course-wide strength is the non-weekly problem sets, instead giving longer tests every few weeks to bring together different concepts. I also benefited greatly from the TA sessions right after the lesson on Wednesday to recap the concepts covered during that week  the TA slides were very efficiently organized.",
                "This is a hard class. The lectures are boilerplate, the slides are dense, and the math is applied in funky ways. Once you understand the structure, it is a matter of applying concepts to problems in a repetitive way.",
                "STRENGTHS: amazing professor, good workload, everything is great, TFs are super helpful and know their stuff, lots of support in discussion sections and also you can ask questions anonymously through Ed Discussion and the professor and TFs are very responsive and give detailed answers // WEAKNESSES: none, take this course with Prof Mira Frick and you will be set",
                "Strengths: Professor Frick and our TA Helena. Mira is the sweetest professor ever, and Helena was super helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: the rest of the course. Econ 121 was easily the most boring course I've taken. To be clear, this is not the fault of the teaching staff--the material is just so boring!",
                "I really liked how Prof Frick taught the course!",
                "I think that the accessibility to office hours and help is very high, but I dislike the grading policy with homework and in particular exams. There is no room for discussion on the grading of the exam, which I believe prevents students from being able to discuss and fully understand why certain points are docked.",
                "I wish these classes would write out problems on the board during lectures instead of relying solely on slides. It is much easier to take notes and retain something when the professor has to slow down enough to walk through it themselves, and it is helpful to see the math done rather than omitted for speed.",
                "Weakness: if you are not good at math, this is going to take a lot of effort. Nonetheless, this was a wonderful course.",
                "The professor was great, lectures were well organized, but the sections weren't very engaging.",
                "This course was extremely well-structured! Unlike other economics classes, I didn't have a hard time following along the course and the progression (and connection) of ideas.",
                "It was extremely hard to follow lectures. The material was dry and read directly from the slides. The only strength is that it covers a lot of material.",
                "The strength of this course is that it provides you with the tools and knowledge needed to use mathematical concepts to analyze modern economic concepts.",
                "The course should not be recorded or at least the recording should be sent with the permission of the instructor. It was very easy to skip class and watch the recording later, which did not really fulfill my academic experience with this class.",
                "Strengths: course is very well organized, slides are SUPER clear and well done and they definitely facilitate learning. peer tutors were good. \r\nWeaknesses: psets were sometimes sooooo long and had boring algebra calculations that made them 28 pages long without reason. Professor is clear but basically reads the slides and is quite boring. nothing exciting about her or the class. I ended up watching the lectures at home on 2 times speed\r\nTA's are awkward but peer tutors are great",
                "The organization of the material and sections was strong. Lectures greatly followed slides.",
                "The strength is that it's required. The weakness is everything beyond.",
                "This course could be improved with more examples in lecture and better practice problems that are applicable to the professors teaching style.",
                "Very well organized and exams were fair. Also interesting content.",
                "Mira Frick was great, I would not change the course.",
                "I think the course was strong! My only feedback would be that I would've appreciated more questions (in homeworks, etc.) that helped link up the math to the intuition behind it.",
                "Strengths: Well-organized, problem sets and discussion section materials reinforce class concepts, many office hours and support \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures feature a lot of proofs and math and go too quickly to understand the logic behind the math, and too slowly if you choose to learn the math later and focus on the overall concepts in the moment.",
                "Weaknesses: Can be overly involved in the math and not spend enough time on actual material. This class turned too much into a calculus class at times, and instead spend roe time diving into the interesting topics that arise later in the course, such as game theory or uncertainty.",
                "This course was extremely strong in explaining the concepts thoroughly and had very few weaknesses.",
                "The course was really well formatted. The lecture slides, discussion section problems & explanations, and previous homework explanations all being posted on Canvas was super helpful if we ever wanted to look back on previous material while completing the homework or studying for exams. Additionally, there was an abundance of office hours.",
                "Incredibly organized and well taught",
                "the course is very well structured",
                "slides were way to dense and concepts were gone over way too quickly",
                "Lectures were informative",
                "It was extremely well organized, with all lecture notes and recordings posted promptly, final exam contents very well-defined, and homework assignments very standardized and on a consistent schedule. The only weakness that I can think of is that the contents of this course are extremely similar to the contents of introductory microeconomics courses (ECON 115 and ECON 110), with just a little more mathematical rigor. I took ECON 110 last year, so I found some of the content to be a little bit repetitive, and would probably just have taken ECON 120 without ECON 110 if I could go back.",

That said, I would highly recommend taking it with Professor Frick; it will make this major requirement not feel nearly as dry.",

                "Meh. Boring but needed for econ major. You will take more intersting classes. Lots of math in the first half of this course; be familiar with derivatives and partial derivatives. I honesly would've struggled more in this class if I had not taken multivariable calc beforehand. It's not a prereq though and possible to do this class without it.",

                "Yes of course. You do have to know intro micro and maybe a little bit about derivatives. But, if you are an econ major, maybe epe, or if you have taken intro micro, this course is not going to be a stress. You may find somethings harder, but other times simple, and then you might be amazed at a thing or two. If you are poli sci, I except you to take this because I don't trust people who don't know anything about optimization.",
                "Absolutely yes. Especially if Mira is the teacher. This class is important for several majors, but I genuinely think the material is interesting. This class opens the door for so many awesome classes to. I will warn you, psets are long. Some are a little hard. But you have two weeks: don't procrastinate. Unlike previous  years exams ( they were available so we could practice for the final), the exams in this course were very fair.",
                "Yes. Go to section, go to office hours, and study.",
                "I am biased as an economics major, but yes to anyone who had taken an intro economics course and was interested in exploring the mathematical aspects of the economics they had learnt. I do believe coming out the course and looking back on everything taught, it is very satisfying  I do hope that following-courses utilize these concepts however, as I do think some ideas are very easily forgotten if not needed. But otherwise, I would recommend one try the intro courses and one elective (such as ECON 159) first before taking ECON 121.",
                "If you have to take it, take it. Don't take it for fun.",
                "YES TAKE IT WITH PROF MIRA FRICK. She made econ super clear to me. I was nervous entering this course because I heard from upperclassmen that it's one of the toughest econ courses, but I was able to slowly kinda figure it out. Workload is reasonable, pset questions are helpful if a bit tedious at times but it's definitely manageable, and the exam questions are very straightforward and you know what to expect. I'm glad I took this course, especially with Prof Frick.",
                "No. Dont do it.",
                "I'd only take this class if: you're an Econ major OR you love applied math. I am not an economics or Econ-adjacent major and I greatly prefer proof-based maths to the application of derivatives, so I did not enjoy this course. There is very little economic content: it's mostly just doing a bunch of optimization problems with Lagrangians. If that's your thing, take this class; otherwise, think carefully before enrolling.",
                "No, I did not learn anything that is applicable outside of the course. Take Econ 159 instead.",
                "Of course! Micro can be tough but Prof Frick is a fantastic professor.",
                "Yes, because I think understanding the math behind concepts learned in Intro Microeconomics is necessary.",
                "I would only recommend this course if it is required for your major.",
                "If they need the class, yes, but otherwise, no.",
                "I would recommend this class if you have to take it for a major requirementespecially if Mira is teaching. I would say consider taking this class if you're interested in microeconomics (and a deeper level of math than what is taught at the introductory level).",
                "Only if its a major requirement.",
                "Only if it is a requirement or if you are interested in theoretical economics.",
                "Only if it is a requirement or if they are very good at mathematics.",
                "yeah if you gotta take it for your major or are interested in microeconomics",
                "I would recommend this course, especially if you are a part of the major.",
                "If you have to, take it.",
                "Yes, if you need to take the course. It is not the most interesting because it is trying to get through so much material. Lectures mostly consist of the professor reading off the slide presentations, so engagement is not high. The professor is comprehensive with review sessions and materials before the exams however and the material that appeared on the exams was very similar to the study material. It is a lot of material split between only two exams so be prepared for more extensive studying and preparation than in previous economics courses.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students interested in taking micro to the next level. I think that it definitely lacks math though compared to the 125.",
                "Yes, if they enjoy math and economics.",
                "I would recommend it if it's required for you (either as a major or pre-req for other classes). Otherwise, it is not much more useful than what you would gain from intro micro.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students as it is very well taught and the concepts have a real-world impact.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The class was organized to facilitate student learning, all of the resources we needed were provided, and I learned so much!",
                "Not unless you have to take.",
                "Yes very important just for economic well readness",
                "probably a prerequisite",
                "Yes if they are interested in the material",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone trying to gain a fundamental knowledge for microeconomic theory. In general, I would suggest skipping past introductory microeconomics if you are comfortable with mathematical rigor, as this course covers pretty much the same ideas."
