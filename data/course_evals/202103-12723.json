                "I came into the course with no knowledge of Southeast Asia. Over the semester, I learned about the region's geography, history, and culture and how it has grappled with the challenges of modernity. It is worth noting that the course acknowledges the arbitrary nature of area studies and focuses as much on the differences within Southeast Asia as it does on the similarities. We conceptualize Southeast Asia as a sort of \"negative space\" where people and nations are included simply because they don't fit into another category. Outside of Southeast Asia, the course taught me to see the world through an anthropological lens. For example, I've caught myself paying closer attention to the unwritten rules of the Yale dining hall.",
                "I came into the course knowing very little about Southeast Asia, so I learned about its geography and politics, as well as how space shapes social dynamics and spiritual beliefs and traditional norms exist within modernity. It's a great was to learn abut SE Asia without being bounded by borders or a historical snapshot. You cover a lot of ground.",
                "Students learn cultural anthropological methods and frameworks in the context of Southeast Asian studies. Areas of focus include geography, history, and politics.",
                "We engaged with fascinating texts that pushed me to think more deeply about SE Asia; I got a great introduction to some of the foundational literature in SE Asian studies, which was helpful, given that there are so few SE Asian studies classes here.",
                "A more in-depth knowledge of Southeast Asia both in the landscape and the cultures of the people that live there",
                "I learned not only about modern events and trends and concepts in Southeast Asia, but also regarding how to analyze these texts in terms of its evidence, structure, approach, etc.",
                "Gained a broad understanding of SE Asia and the issues it has historically and is presently facing. Learned to write a lengthy research paper and incorporate anthropological perspectives.",
                "This course is a extremely useful survey course on Southeast Asia as well as a good introduction into the field of anthropology. It has been one of my favorite classes that has changed how I think in general: from how I view culture, what I consider as evidence in a claim, to what makes life meaningful and the processes of death.",
                "I learned about different cultural phenomenons in Southeast Asia.",

            "comments": [
                "Rather than divide the material into nations, the course divides the material into themes which appear across nations. For example, we spent a week talking about the role of gender, and that week included readings about Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, etc. This format was conducive to comparing different parts of Southeast Asia and not allowing national borders to become ontological ones. The \"ripped from the headlines\" assignment in which we wrote about current news articles was really cool and helped me develop my final paper topic. My only complaint with the course is that towards the beginning, it felt more like a lecture than a leminar. I would appreciate more discussion among students towards.",
                "Strengths: 1) Diverse course material that is usually very interesting, 2) Professor Harms is an engaging and approachable teacherit's great to hear him talk about his own experiences (he's an expert on Vietnam), 3) the class (at least this semester) had lots of students with ties to different places in SEA, so you learned a lot from them, too, and 4) while the final paper is long, you get a lot of time to write it and help in and out of class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) It's a bit more of a leminar than seminar, especially in the first half. 2) There are a fair amount of assignments on top of the readingsnot very hard, but relatively time-consuming. 3) 9am in Watson was tough for me",
                "Strengths: Professor Harms is a caring, knowledgeable, invested professor who has enormous expertise in southeast Asian studies and clearly cares deeply about the topics we discuss. The syllabus has a range of topics and the assignments are open ended to allow for creativity from students.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes our class discussions got a little side tracked and students who wrote detailed responses to the days readings werent able to talk about their work.",
                "Lots of reading, the beginning is more of a 'leminar.'",
                "As a Southeast Asian, this class was too early in the morning to be quite honest; I think even starting the class 15 minutes later would have helped. Additionally, I wish we had more time for class discussion because it often felt rushed at the end. Other than these two small comments, this class was fantastic! Professor Harms is the best.",
                "Strengths: I liked how the syllabus was the structured by concept instead of by nations. I also enjoyed the days that focused on small group discussions! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the first few weeks were too lecture-style and barely allowed for discussions",
                "Strengths: Professor Harms, Vanessa, the final project. Weaknesses: some readings were unnecessarily long, not interesting (at least to me), and not discussed in class. I also think it is important to understand that this course is very much a survey of various topics and that content largely does not build on itself.",
                "The strengths of the course are: amazing professor, interesting and diverse readings (probably the best part of the course), students with expertise in a variety of backgrounds, open\r\nThe weaknesses of the course are: a very lecture-oriented hybrid class which is good for the first few weeks but makes discussion difficult (the class often felt disjointed like people trying to get out various points rather than discussion).",
                "I like that the discussion revolved around the different readings. However, at times, the readings could be tedious.",
                "Strengths: Incredible leadership from Professor Harms and Vanessa (engagement, challenging of perspectives, encouraging students to collaborate and embrace their studies as anthropologists), the collaboration between students (built-in and outside of class, collaboration was strongly encouraged and formed a tighter and more comfortable classroom space), the diverse selection of weekly readings, frank discussions on the role of academia and anthropology in the real world"

                "I would recommend this course to another student, even if they have no knowledge of Southeast Asia or no experience with anthropology. However, you should be aware that the course requires a significant time investment and a willingness to engage with the material. Some of the readings are dense, but as you work through the semester you get used to them.",
                "Yes, especially if you want a nuanced introduction to Southeast Asian geography, social relations, politics, economy, and more. Professor Harms is very engaging, the readings are mostly interesting, and the class usually brings a lot to the discussions. It's more of a leminar the first half of the semester, though.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in learning about Southeast Asia today and/or exploring methods used in anthropology.",
                "I honestly would not recommend this class. Professor Harms is a great professor but your experience in this class REALLY depends on the TF. The TF this year and Professor Harms were almost never on the same page about what they liked and didn't like about a student's writing / work, which made grading really difficult to understand because the TF could grade you poorly even if Professor Harms liked your work. I know a couple of students who took this class last year and had a VERY different experience than I did.",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in learning more about the field of SE Asian studies. It is a great place to start!",

                "Yes",

                "I would recommend the course if another student was interested in SE Asia.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course. If you put the time in,  it will be extremely rewarding.",
                "I think I would if you wanted to learn more about Southeast Asia. It's one of the only courses at Yale about the region.",
                "With much enthusiasm! Professor Harms is incredible at bringing out the best in students in all sorts of academic viewpoints and is quite engaging (and so personable). The subject matter is broad, too, so students are able to get a sampling for Southeast Asian studies while customizing their time in class to focus on personal interests."
