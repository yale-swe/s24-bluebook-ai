                "I learned more about history and how to read latin at a fast-pace.",
                "I learned how to translate faster and see the importance of Latin diction. My reading comprehension also improved as we would translate on the spot. Also, the philosophy we learned was very interesting, and I believe I will remember it for the rest of my life.",
                "I learned about the oft-neglected Greco-Roman literary genre of consolation literature. I also greatly improved my ability to prepare and sight-read large amounts of difficult Latin text. I feel comfortable at an L5 level with the language after taking this course and adjusting to a college-level Latin literature workload.",
                "I feel that my Latin skills improved considerably to a point where I am confident enough to take other L5 Latin courses. I also became very familiar with the texts we read and gained insight into the themes and styles of consolation literature.",
                "This course involved the application of high-level Latin syntax, grammar, and vocabulary to two difficult works of prose. My ability to parse and translate Latin text definitely improved over the course of the semester, and I feel much more confident now in my reading skills.",
                "Gained greater proficiency in Latin and a stronger hold on translation skills. Also read a very interesting philosophical text in Boethius' consolation."

                "I improved my Latin a lot by taking this course. I got feedback through regular quizzes and exams.",
                "Strengths: Some lovely texts to read, of course. Highly structured, so after a couple of weeks you know exactly what to expect.\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "Very much enjoyed seminar style setting, class engagement was very fun, I liked how the professor went over material in class with us and was always able to answer questions about the latin or the meaning of the text.",
                "I found both Boethius and Seneca to be fascinating reads. It was also really good during Boethius to get to read the full thing in English so that we get the full experience. I found the pacing to be very fast, but it was also proportionate. Dr. Stoner did push us past our comfort zone to succeed, but never pushed us so hard as to make us fail. I think that takes a lot teaching skill and finesse.",
                "This course was great as we would go over the translations in class and talk about what they meant outside of just Latin. It could be improved by scaling back on the workload because this class had far and away the most work of any class that I took this semester.",
                "I think that the course is graded way too harshlyyou can lose a significant amount of points by translating almost everything right but in being confused about one word can make it seem grade-wise that you did not grasp the passage.\r\nFor quizzes and the exams, I don't like how there isn't a \"correct\" translation we can use to study, instead we use our own, which can have flaws, so no matter how much time you study, you can still not know even if what you are studying is correct.",
                "Seneca was a tad boring, but Boethius was very interesting. The course was very interesting, but the workload every night was quite high. However, I took away so much from the class, not just Latin skills but also points of consolation that apply to my own life.",
                "This course is branded as a course on consolation literature as a genre, but that theme seems rather forced to me. We read both Seneca's Ad Helviam and Boethius's De Consolatione Philosophiae, but I think the course would feel more focused if we only read Boethius. Prof. Stoner's passion for Boethius was palpable, so I think this course could be made stronger by embracing that and focusing solely on Boethius. Seneca was a nice introduction to the genre, but I felt like Boethius was the true core of the course.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Stoner is great at teaching the course as the bridge course intended to bring students Latin skills to college level. She also explained to us our expectations very clearly, especially with quizzes and exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class sessions largely consisted of translating the passage assigned for homework. I wish that we spent more time doing close readings, tracing larger developments, and learning about the context. The large size of the class (since it was designated as the bridge course this year) may have restricted the seminar.",
                "Class discussions, lessons, and translation sessions were helpful, and the overall pacing of the class was good. I feel that the only weakness was the style of assessments - we were almost exclusively tested on our ability to translate and parse grammatical constructions. This was helpful to brush up on our language skills at the beginning, but it would have been to do more writing and analysis as the course went on.",
                "I think the content was very interesting and it was taught and discussed very well. I do think however that the volume of translation was perhaps slightly too much at times, with the workload for quizzes ending up being quite high because of the amount of Latin translated."

                "Yes",
                "If you have very strong Latin grammar knowledge and vocabulary, then it makes a lot of sense to take this course. I took this freshman year and my most recent Latin class was Latin 4 my junior year of high school. My experience was reading some Cicero, Ovid, and a shallow but wide variety of stoic philosophy in latin. With that knowledge, the only thing holding me back was my vocabulary, but that was addressable with enough practice.\r\nThere's no getting around the fact that this class was by far the highest workload of any of my classes, and you are translating 50-70 lines per class. \r\nIt was fun getting to read these texts and learn about consolation philosophy in Latin.\r\nSo, I would recommend if you are prepared and able to dedicate the time. It's a really interesting topic and is nice to have an L5 credit from a single course.\r\nI would not recommend if you are inexperienced in Latin or take a long time to translate, as this will take all of your time if that is the case, unless all your other courses are guts.",

                "No, although the material is interesting the grading isn't conducive to learningyou are so focused on how harshly it's graded it's harder to appreciate the texts",
                "Yes, this class greatly improved my translation abilities, and also the texts themselves are quite interesting.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this coursebut really any \"bridge\" Latin courseto incoming first-years interested in completing their language requirement or continuing to study Classics at a college level. Prof. Stoner did a good job of ensuring our transition to college-level Latin was smooth, and she provided us with extra-credit opportunities and dropped our lowest quiz grade in order to ensure that we were not overly stressed about grades.",
                "If reading Seneca and Boethius, whose texts are both somewhat of a mix of autobiography and philosophy, intrigues you, I would highly recommend the course, though if literature like Vergil is your thing, they will feel very different. If it is offered as the bridge course again, it is a fantastic course to improve your Latin skills.",
                "I would recommend this course to students with strong high school preparation in Latin (AP-level) who are interested in pursuing classics or philosophy.",
