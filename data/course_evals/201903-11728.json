    "This was a great overview of the religious rhetoric in American military history.",
    "This class is a great survey of the religious influence on American diplomatic and military history, which I did not know existed. After taking this class, I learned the fascinating and manifold ways that religion manifests itself in American foreign policy. An enlightening course.",
    "I learned a ton about religious and political life over all of American history. The course taught how religion and politics intersect in a non-biased fashion.",
    "I gained an understanding of the underappreciated role religion plays in American identity and how war is a key feature of American life.",
    "I learned how to think critically and in a more interdisciplinary way, and to examine history without biases of a 21st century perspective.",
    "A completely new ideological framework for examining American history, as well as a far deeper logistical understanding of American wars since the Puritan era. Learned how to understand American origins in terms of religious influences in places I never would have expected.",
    "We learned about many of the major wars in American history and their ties to religion, mainly Christianity. We considered the ideas of civil religion and American exceptionalism as well throughout the course.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about a field of history which previously I had overlooked. Growing up, I was taught that religion as a political motivator took a backseat to economics and foreign policy. This class showed me in great depth how vital a role religion had played -- and continues to play -- in American politics and war.",
    "This course was excellent for drawing connections between secular and political American culture and religious institutions.",
    "This course opened my eyes to the myriad connections between war and religion, especially in the context of America being heralded as a \"New Israel.\"",
    "I gained a lot more breadth of knowledge about this continuous role of Christian religion in American history.",
    "See syllabus, but the discussions on the relationships between religion, war, and the meaning of America were fantastic. Several of the readings were fantastic as well, and the rest were relevant and helpful. Professor Stout runs a really great class on a fascinating topic. The syllabus is organized based on conflict, and we read a good number of both primary and secondary sources."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The readings are interesting and class discussions are run smoothly.\r\n\r\nI do feel like this class could use a bit of a narrower focus.  I don't feel that I left with a clear idea of what American civil religion actually was and sometimes the readings felt a bit scattered.",
    "Strengths: Professor Stout is insightful, kind, warm, welcoming, generous; material is fascinating; Prof Stout facilitates excellent discussion.\r\n\r\nProbably the only weakness was that each week a student did a report summarizing the readings, and these often droned on for a long time. I felt like these were unnecessary given we did the readings (or were supposed to!) so this felt redundant. Especially given that the readings for this course are not overwhelming for a junior history seminar, I got the sense way more people than usual read them. I wish the presentations had been more argumentative in style and meant to provoke discussion.",
    "The strengths lie in the syllabus and the class discussion. Professor Stout is excellent and encouraging healthy debate and students felt that it was easy to engage with all the material. Seminar discussions were the best I experienced at Yale. The final paper is opinion\/article based, not research, which makes for a much more enjoyable project.",
    "Seminar discussions were excellent, however, sometimes we ran out of time and the topic from one day bled into the next.",
    "This is my favorite course I have taken a Yale. The material and theme of the course is unique, compelling, and challenging, and requires its students to embrace multiple perspectives at once.",
    "I absolutely loved the seminar format of this course. The weekly readings were fascinating and gave us ample discussion material. The course did an incredible job of covering a giant breadth of material while still delving deeply into each topic. The only slight weakness of the course was the fact that the format and expectations for the first two essays were not clearly outlinedI wouldve appreciated a bit more guidance.",
    "I really liked the format of the class in that we basically did a survey of all the major American wars, while connecting these wars to specific themes, so it gave a nice broad overview that also made me make connections and think critically. I think the assignments were also manageable, though I wish we had clearer instructions for the two shorter papers, and the final paper felt a bit long. Professor Stout was always super helpful when I asked for more guidance though. The biggest weakness I would point out is that a lot of times we ran out of time and had to continue our discussion into the next class, which ended up setting off the schedule by a week. The topics we discussed were all worthy of long discussion, so maybe focusing on fewer wars might be helpful so more time can be allocated to each one. This could be tough because I don't know which wars could be cut out, but another suggestion might be to cut out class discussion leaders, because the discussion leader basically just summarized the readings, and this normally took up a lot of time.",
    "Prof Stout created an ideal climate for a seminar, that balanced casual conversation with challenging, rigorous academic debate. The professor also smoothly balanced student-led teaching, quasi-lectures and whole class conversations.",
    "The course is logically organized and the selected readings are enlightening.",
    "I can't think of any weaknesses. Professor Stout is incredible; he's understanding, passionate about the subject, and genuinely excited to hear what students have to say.",
    "The strength was definitely classroom discussions. Professor Stout did a great job of facilitating those. I think a weakness was possibly not engaging with one another's online postings as much as I would have, if they were brought up intentionally in the classroom.",
    "I thought the varied PDF readings were really good - reading an entire book or the long chapters from Preston were helpful to be sure, but Bellah, Hatch, Ebel, Hauerwas, etc. were the really detailed interesting readings most relevant to the war we were discussing that day and on different perspectives and arguments about the relationship between religion, war, and America. I learned the most from those readings, and wish there had been more."

   "comments": [
    "It's a lot of reading. 150 pages on a light week. You don't necessarily have to do all of it, but you can feel lost if you don't. \r\nProfessor Stout is wonderful.\r\nI think the readings could be scattered sometimes, and I'm not sure that they really lend themselves to a cohesive, coherent class. I think that with more focus, this class could really shine.",
    "Absolutely!!! Take this course! Professor Stout is a Yale gem - a font of knowledge, such a charming personality, and receptive to all ideas. The subject is very niche - the religious influence on American foreign policy - yet also broad, covering major American wars from King Philip's War to the War on Terror. Thus the course provides an ideal balance between general and specific; while many Yale courses tend to learn way too specific, Professor Stout's class has the advantages of both types of learning. This is a superb course.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Professor Stout is one of the best in the world, and I had a really good time doing the readings and even writing the papers!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in American history or politics.",
    "Yes! I loved this class and Professor Stout is a kind and generous teacher.",
    "Absolutely!! Professor Stout is incredibly knowledgeable and generous in discussion, the material is fascinating, and whether you know everything or nothing about American history, you will come away from the class with a new understanding. Studying the interactions between religious and wartime ideology in the history of America is a vital framework for understanding current events.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who already has background knowledge in American history and would like to apply it. It did feel at times that prior knowledge was expected since we were considering these events through a religious lens, so it might be challenging for someone who is new to history. However, if someone is interested in the topic and willing to put in the work for long reading assignments and a long final paper, the course can be super rewarding and lead them to think about American history in a new light!",
    "Absolutely. Prof Stout is an excellent teacher, and his curriculum is well thought out and incredibly informative. I highly recommend this course.",
    "Absolutely.  Anyone studying American history, political science, or religion will specifically benefit from this class, but anyone with an interest will find it fulfilling.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you care about American history, particularly its religious dimension, this course is for you.",
    "Yes",
    "I absolutely would recommend to another student. The vision of America and these relationships are strongly supported by a large body of readings and discussion, but not often talked about. This class is a brilliant blend of GLBL & PLSC with RLST & HIST. The class discussions were strong as well, and Professor Stout gives wide latitude on papers with detailed feedback on the paper and interesting notes on your discussion\/arguments themselves."
