                "Strengths of this course were relating the topics to real world examples and current events, as well as the quizzes to let us try and retain the knowledge.",
                "\"TikTok for Cats\" and \"Crazy Donut\" are just two reaosns why Aleh is the goat. Well, really, Hawkins and Tsyvinski are the goats. Both are great at teaching concepts clearly and have an uncanny humor. Makes for fun lectures.",
                "Just let Hawkins teach it",
                "This course had many strengths. Lectures were generally interesting and enjoyable. The weekly sections were especially helpful, as the chance to work through problems was always great, and Hawkins is incredible at teaching. I don't have any specific feedback in terms of how it could be improved, except that it might be nice to provide more quantitative proofs and explanations for the things we learned; as someone who learns better when theories are backed by numerical explanations, I felt that it might have been helpful if a bit more (maybe optional) math could have been used.",
                "This course was well-organized, and I believe the problem sets and exams were really fair to what we learned in class. I don't have any weaknesses to list about it.",
                "The largest strength of this course is its organization and sheer amount of resources dedicated towards the class. This, when utilized properly, helps with all facets of the course, from difficult problem set questions to test review to clarifying new concepts.",
                "The professors did an excellent job with the lectures. Information was easily conveyed in the virtual format, and Professor Hawkins was an excellent \"moderator\" who helped things go smooth and answer questions. \r\n\r\nThe sections felt like a little bit of a waste of time, not much value add. I think the content of the section could be improved.",
                "Strengths: extremely organized and well maintained canvas site; Kortum's lecture slides were difficult to follow and there was little cohesion between the different professor's lectures",
                "Overall the class was very organized and fair",
                "Weaknesses: professor Kortum. Before fall 2020 only Aleh taught the class and everyone loved it, but the duet of Aleh and professor Kortum definitely did not work out this semester. Professor Kortum was just reading the slides and did not really explain the material properly. So I ended up understanding topics taught by Kortum way worse than the ones taught by Aleh. It was also hard to switch between professors, as their teaching techniques are different. The biggest issue was that the material taught in lecture was very surface, while exams and psets asked for way deeper knowledge. The grading of psets was vert weird too for the same reason. Giving one explanation for the question was not enough and I ended up losing so many points for not giving 3-4 different perspectives. Strength: I guess this class gives a good end to the econ intro sequence.",
                "Great lecturers and the course is very well-run. It could be improved by offering a bit more help on problem sets (they were pretty hard and no instructor gave straightforward help).",
                "One strength of this course is that there are plenty of opportunities to ask questions about the material throughout the semester, and especially in the weeks leading up to an exam (there are plenty of review sessions). I think the course was also very well organized in terms of how lectures were grouped together in themes and the order in which these themes were presented (themes included but were not limited to GDP, trade, money, financial institutions, and financial crises). I also appreciate that weekly quizzes allow for unlimited attempts so you are able to get some practice before having to submit the p-set for the week.\r\n\r\nAreas for improvement are defining terms more clearly during the lecture, taking more time to explain the more complex equations and what each term of the equation means, and generally making lecture slides easier to understand\/more useful for review.",
                "The problem sets were not really reflective of what you would see on the midterms or finals, but they were still engaging.",
                "It was very well organised and help was always available.",
                "Strengths: TA office hours were incredibly helpful and constructive. All of the TAs are helpful and great at explaining concepts in a more direct setting beyond lecture. \r\nWeaknesses: some of the lectures were disorganized in that it was challenging to holistically grasp concepts.",
                "The strength I appreciated most was how much help was available to us at all times. The profs, Dr. Hawkins, TAs, and peer tutors were always willing to help and explain concepts. I was so thankful for how many review sessions and office hours were offered throughout the semester. That was amazing, and I really appreciated it. Looking to the future, I think a potential weakness is that it might be nice to see more example problems in the lecture (but the profs and Dr. Hawkins did an excellent job incorporating this feedback and responding to it the second half of the semester).",
                "Pretty easy and straightforward class. Good professors",

                "Strengths are that the discussion sections and peer tutors were very helpful with going further in depth with examples. A weakness was that sometimes the material would be covered very quickly and it was tough to instantly get all the concepts.",

                "strengths are that it covers all of the basics of macroeconomics. weaknesses are that it goes so fast and through so much material you don't have time to truly grasp any concept",
                "The teachers are very good. One suggestion for the weekly quizzes: if they could be posted on gradescope instead, so that if someone gets only one or two questions wrong they don't have to redo the whole quiz but can instead redo only those two questions. Also, it would be great to include more material about other countries other than the US.",
                "This course moves very quickly, and, due to the limitations of Zoom, does not offer many opportunities to access help outside of class.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is its instructors: Dr. Hawkins, Dr. Tsyvinski, and Dr. Kortum. Dr. Tsyvinksi and Dr. Kortum are incredible teachers; they know what they're talking about and do their best to make the material as engaging and useful as possible. Dr. Hawkins is the professor behind the scenes making sure everything runs smoothly, and he does that exceptionally well. Dr. Hawkins tries the best he can to make sure that the course is well-organized and that no student gets left behind. All three of them are extremely knowledgeable about macroeconomics and pick what they believe are going to be both fascinating and practical topics to learn. I can't really think of any weaknesses of this course; I loved it very much!",
                "Strengths: good textbook, good practice questions\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the lectures can be made more productive and the problem sets were sometimes a little vague in terms of their instruction",
                "The professors are amazing and Dr. Hawkins was always on top of everything logistical and all the professors were really great at answering questions. However, I wish we could have studied inequality more",
                "The information is taught in an accessible, but not overbearing way. Overall, I cannot think of a way to improve it."

The professors were very engaging and enthusiastic about the course, which made it easier to learn. Dr. Hawkins was very supportive and understanding of each student's needs and I really appreciated his willingness to help and advise me when I needed it. This is all especially relevant as each student is dealing with his or her own situation at home\/on campus, and I think that the practices employed by the course directors were excellent. The peer tutor office hours were also very helpful in the hours before the problem set deadlines.",
                "The online quizzes definitely helped my learning, and it was nice that the professors allocated some time for a break in between lecture.",
                "Weekly psets were pretty obnoxious.\r\n\r\nHawkins definitely had to see a weekly chiropractor the way he carried this course on his back. I know he already probably spends four hours a day cleaning up the pedagogical messes that the profs leave for him, but the profs should also have to filter the slides through Hawkins to make them coherent before using them.",
                "Virtual tools were used well.",
                "I think the discussion sections, although virtual, were engaging and greatly helpful, mostly due to a small size and use of breakout rooms. The lectures, on the other hand, were typically rushed, as the course had a lot of content to cover in the allotted time. While there were some opportunities for questions, I do not think there was enough engagement, partially due to remote learning, so many questions went unasked, and, therefore, unanswered.",
                "I felt the exam method was well done and conducive to learning while still being examined",
                "I think the combination of low-stake quizes and graded prolbem sets worked out well. And it was good that there was an option to rewatch lectures later on.",

                "I really appreciated filming the lectures. I loved watching the lectures live, but sometimes things came up and I had to watch the recording instead. I thought that was thoughtful and considerate of the instructors. I also was thankful that the professors adopted an open-note exam policy for the semester. I think continuing the in-lecture breaks that we started in the second half of the semester would be awesome. It helped me focus more.",
                "Recorded lectures were nice if you missed the live one.",

                "strengths: professors were very receptive to feedback and changed exam times\/meeting lengths to accommodate students\r\n\r\nweaknesses: didnt have to have as many psets considering the times and a few of the quizzes felt more like busy work than learning material",

However, this class could benefit from an increased frequency of office hours before assignments are due as well as better feedback on past assignments after they have been graded.",

Having two engaging professors switch out every few lectures (Prof. Tsyvinski and Prof. Kortum) kept the course fresh and exciting despite it being on Zoom. Piazza was a really great way for me to ask any questions I had about the material; huge thank you to Prof. Hawkins for responding so quickly and thoroughly to every Piazza post! Assignments on Canvas and p-sets on Gradescope were well adapted to remote settings, and exams were especially well-adapted because they were open-book on Canvas but still challenging enough to warrant an average that wasn't exceedingly high or low. Office and peer tutoring hours were well organized and accessible to many time zones. One thing I believe could be improved is working through examples in lecture, especially writing math out on the screen. The course made up for it with examples in section, but I think there were definitely certain scenarios during lecture that could've warranted a pause to work through an example on the screen.",

Even if you took some iteration of macroeconomics in high school, this class provides a number tools essential to the analysis of large-scale trends and real-world events which you can benefit from in a tangible way. Its also very enjoyable, and the problem sets, while not unchallenging, are both manageable and helpful for practicing the material.",
                "Yes, if they want to learn about macroeconomics!",
                "Yes, if they haven't taken AP macro; no if they have. The most salient additions to this class apart from AP Macro are the Solow Model and Financial markets--albeit these are two great topics. Having said that, I think AP macro sufficiently covers these topics as well as more, so you'd be wasting your time by taking this class. If you haven't taken AP macro though, this class is an awesome introduction to macro. The models are covered quite well and the concepts learned are essential building blocks for future courses.",
                "Yes, this class was pretty great (significantly better than the intro micro lecture course). Topics covered were interesting and both Kortum and Tsyvinski often linked the material studied to recent economic trends and things in the news, etc. In terms of intellectual challenge, this course was really very doable overall. There was extremely little math, even compared to intro micro. Also, Hawkins is really incredible as a course director -- he teaches so well, his sense of humor is great, etc. Definitely take the course with Tsyvinski and Hawkins if you can.",
                "Yes. I took it for the economics major, but I would also recommend it to students who are not economics majors. It teaches you a lot about the real world and practical economics knowledge.",

The course is incredibly well-organized, which, if the student is willing to put in the effort, allows for greater success. There are plenty of practice tests and other resources, making preparation for the exams straightforward. In addition, there are various helpful resources provided that make the class an enjoyable and fruitful experience, such as TFs, Peer Tutors, Office Hours, and Discussion Section.",

                "I would recommend this course because it is important to understand the causes of economic growth, policies that help with growth, the history behind the current global economic order, and economics' application to issues like COVID and climate change. Hearing concepts for the first time can definitely be confusing, but practice via quizzes and discussion sections definitely helped.",

This course is a holy grail for political science students to get a bit of a background understanding for economics and some of the most important aspects of it which affect political discourse (such as labor and trade).

The professors are engaging, really care about their students, and adapt the material to the current economy and government policies (like the coronavirus and the CARES act or climate change), as well as to topics students seem most interested in. I think macroeconomics is an extremely interesting topic, and anyone even remotely interested in government policies and money should definitely try it out!",

                "If you are curious about macro-economics (or if you have to take this course as a pre-requisite), you are in good hands! The course is well organized and there are almost too many resources available to help you master the material. The professors also do a good job of relating course content to its real-world applications, which makes the lectures very interesting."
