                "Combining S140 with S148 while in Spain is simply too much, especially because S148 takes up way more time. Between classes every day of the week and the additional afternoon excursions, there was not really any time to enjoy the city for ourselves. In addition, there wasn't a lot of time to interact with our host families because, at least for me, there was always more homework. It was very difficult to keep up with all the different conjugations and grammar rules and irregular tenses, etc., while also having such a packed schedule. I understand the need for exams, but having exams for S140 plus essays for S148 plus homework nightly plus daily projects became incredibly overwhelming and retaining any of this information individually was quite a struggle.",
                "It is tough because of the time scale, but it was good. I would just add more guided practice and practice sheets with answers so that there is more material to understand the course concepts.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- It was nice having two different professors\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- At times, not being able to ask questions and receive clarifications in English, especially in grammar lessons, made me more confused and did not allow me to learn the language to the level I wanted to. I understand the need for full immersion in Spanish but sometimes lessons (particularly grammar) need to be explained in English for us to fully understand them.\r\n- lots of random activities that took up a lot of time but had no relevance to grammar lessons or future projects/exams that we had (robots, microrrelatos, economa y trabajo  el papel de mujer). I'd rather we had that time to study for exams, work on graded projects, talk about/practice grammar, etc.\r\n- There was a slight discrepancy in consistency and continuity between the two professors' teaching\r\n- Sometimes some activities take longer than expected, but instead of shifting the requirements and expectations, we are still expected to complete everything that was originally planned, and that takes away from the quality of our work and learning. More flexibility and prioritization is needed. When plans change, the important (graded) work and lessons should be prioritized. If we have an in-class project one day and we are expected to start and finish it that day, it does not make sense to have an unrelated (or even related) activity beforehand. We should spend the time doing the project first, and then if there is time after projects are over, we should return to the activities. Furthermore, if the first activity of the day takes longer than expected, the following activities should be modified to firstly include the most important elements, and if time allows, then the original expectations can be added.",
                "Strengths: Definitely will learn Spanish if you force yourself to get involved and speak after class.\r\nWeakness: Difficult to immerse yourself in the Spanish environment because you have so many assignments, projects, Supersite tasks, and tests to study for. Therefore, you do not have a lot of free time after class to truly explore the country and the culture.",
                "Strengths: I gained the ability to have more complex conversations in Spanish. Weaknesses: The workload for this course was unnecessarily high with the amount of outside homework and in-class projects. The 2 exams are also weighted so heavily that if you do not do well on one, your grade can drop significantly. The professors taught and organized class time in a terrible manner that was not conducive to learning or inclusive of student struggles.",
                "I thought the course was effective, and I enjoyed the the VHL supersite and assignments. However, I thought the tests were often difficult to prepare for, and that the practice materials could be misleading or incorrect. I think a better system for exam preparation would have improved the class. I also did not like that the exams were at the end of class."

                "No, I would not. This course was exhausting, and really took a toll on my health. Arguably the course become harder once we got to Spain, which was incredibly unfortunate considering that the first couple of weeks every student is just trying to find their way around and adapt to a different country. Furthermore, one month in a foreign country is not enough to really immerse oneself. In a vain effort to make up for the lack of time, we were often pushed as students to only communicate in Spanish both inside and out of the classroom. However, when every day a new concept is being taught (and the concepts often don't overlap with English grammar rules), constantly instructing in Spanish leads to a lot of confusion. Even if I was confused, and tried to convey that to the teacher, they would respond in their fluent Spanish very quickly then move on. This led to me needing quite a bit of help outside the classroom, which was unfortunate considering the tutors provided through Yale are 6 hours behind in time zone.",
                "If it is required I recommend it to get better at spanish, but be cautious with which professor you take it with.",
                "Yes, because of the rest of the study abroad experience.",
                "Yes, if they are looking to fulfill their language requirement, but no, if they are taking it for fun/for the study abroad experience. The course was very intensive, but in some ways, the organizational structure did not help facilitate learning and took away from the experience. The main instruction was not from our instructors in person but from the videos we watched for homework.",
                "I would not recommend this course because there are a lot of outside of Yale programs that teach Spanish but also gives you free time to explore the country which is something I felt I did not have time to do in this course. I also think the speed at which the class is taught makes it difficult to learn the language fluently. Furthermore, there are not many excursions sponsored by the program so you have to find a lot of activities to do in the country alone. It is also very annoying to live in the host families because you can really get an uncomfortable living situation who hardly feeds you or feeds you terrible meals. Also, some people are placed far away from the university so I had to travel upwards of 45 minutes to and from class each day which added a lot of time to my day and away from studying.",
                "NO, I would NOT recommend this course to any other student because the material is taught too fast for you to practice the concepts and remember them for longer than the month you're in class.",
                "I would, especially because of the experience of taking the classes at Deusto."
