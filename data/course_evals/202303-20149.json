                "An introductory to intermediate understanding of the French language and culture. I am able to write and speak French much more clearly than when I first joined the class, learning much of the linguistic rules associated with the language.",
                "I gained a solid foundation in spoken and written French, and I can now read many French children's books and participate in a basic conversation in French.",
                "I learned so much french I almost cannot believe it. I also learned how to study a language effectively.",
                "French grammar- verb tenses (present, imparfait, passe compose), vocab about describing people\/places",
                "A comprehensive introduction to the French language through speaking, writing, and listening practice.",
                "Practical vocabulary and grammar skills in French, including different tenses and various practical situations; better understanding of Francophone culture.",

            "comments": [
                "The course was well-structured and easy to follow. The course homework assignments could be overwhelming at times, but they were effective in helping us learn the language.",
                "Strengths: FREN 110's greatest strength is its emphasis on spoken French; the immersive nature of a classroom conducted in French, as well as exercises that focus on speaking and listening to French, helped me adjust to the pace of authentic, real-time French conversation. I also enjoy the \"Dfi francophone\" textbook, which continues the immersive theme by emulating French articles and infographics and using French in grammar and phonetics tutorials. I think learning French more similarly to how a French person might learn it, as FREN 110 provides, is immensely valuable.\r\nWeaknesses: This course doesn't really touch on present tense conjugations, which can be a roadblock when attempting to say or write new material.",
                "The strengths are that you learn so much so quickly, however the workload is off the charts. This class consumed almost all my time, the amount of work I have for 2 or 3 classes. The work is all engaging and fun however one must be prepared to be fully invested in this class. Blinklearning is AWESOME and makes learning so fun and much easier. The oral section of tests however I do not feel like gives an accurate assessment of how much french I know.",
                "strengths: Professor Ngame was an incredible teacher and created a classroom space that felt open to trying and fun, workload felt rigorous but manageable. I enjoyed the skits, was a great way to engage with the material, but I wish we had a bit more time to prepare\r\n\r\nweaknesses: I didnt love the Blink platform for completing assignments. There was no consolidated way to see whether your assignments had been graded or exactly what was due when because the syllabus was not updated sometimes",
                "One of the strengths was how the material was presented. The new curriculum is fairly efficient, and I don't have many complaints regarding its layout.",
                "The course encouraged active participation and speaking practice earlier in the semester, but the latter half felt like studying grammar was prioritized to the detriment of speaking practice.",
                "Unclear and unstructured homework assignments and not enough practice resources before exams."

                "Yes, I would recommend the course to another student, particularly with Professor Ngame. French is a relatively easy language to learn because of the logical rules associated with verb conjugations, English-like sentence structures, etc.",
                "Yes; I think Yale is a great place to start learning French! The workload is not light, though, and there certainly is a learning curve in terms of finding the best way to review the content.",
                "Yes!!! If you want to learn French this is the class to do it. Be prepared to work hard but it is so rewarding.",
                "Yes, take it with Ngame! I honestly think language learning is difficult for me but because he was so encouraging (office hours were always so helpful!) I was able to make it through and not lose my passion for learning the language in the process",
                "I would, especially if it's taught by Professor Ngame. However, be prepared to attend office hours and frequently review your notes.",
                "Yes -- I felt like we moved very quickly to learn advanced French skills in one semester but the professor was supportive and was adept at facilitating my quick learning of French.",
                "Yes, the day-to-day instruction I found was very helpful for learning lots of French in a short time span."
