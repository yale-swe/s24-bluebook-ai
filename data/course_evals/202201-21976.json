                "I wasn't a fan of this course at all. It was very one sided. The whole time the course was criticizing travel and NEVER once looked into the benefits of it. Not a useful course...",

                "The strengths of this class are the absolutely phenomenal professor (TZB is the best!!), extremely interesting readings, collaborative seminar environment, and exciting writing assignments.

                "I highly recommend this course, the course content is very engaging, even for people interested in STEM. The class offers unique looks at tourism and introduced me to some forms of tourism that I did not even realize existed. It really makes you think critically about your own motivations for travel, your own experiences traveling, and any potential travel plans you wanted to take in the future.",
                "I have mixed feelings about this course. I had high expectations going in because of the past reviews I read, but I definitely left with a less positive experience. I think the themes and topics we talk about are incredibly important, eye-opening, world-changing, etc. and I learned and unlearned a lot. That being said, I think it went way too far in the \"you're a horrible person if you travel\" direction. Not a single reading or class discussion throughout the entire semester addressed any positive impact traveling can have, and it was actually quite the contrary. People were laughing about volunteer and humanitarianism work, and although there are many flaws with that, I would have appreciated any sort of acknowledgement that there are still good people who do good work in the world. The class environment became one where you really couldn't say anything that went against the \"travel is bad\" narrative, and it honestly made me uncomfortable at times. From day one, tourists are literally called \"ugly human beings\" and the takeaway from the class is that travel is unethical and disgusting. I wish we had talked about the alternative: is it really better for everyone to stay exactly where they grew up? Also, I found the essays extremely challenging and the reading workload was quite high, so my overall experience with the class was not a pleasant one.",
                "Yes. Some of the topics that we covered were a little uncomfortable but really necessary to understand many of the issues that we went over in the class.",

                "No. If you want to sit in a classroom complaining the whole time then sure.",
                "I would recommend this course, especially to anyone who doesn't have a background in the subject area and wants to dip their toes in the water.",
                "TAKE THIS COURSE!! The best professor and incredible course material. The syllabus, class discussions, and writing assignments will reshape your worldview. You will look forward to this class every week!! TZB also prioritizes the mental health of students and is the most caring and understanding professor you will ever meet.",
                "Definitely yes, as long as they are willing to engage in the discussion, listen to others and do their assignments every week. Prof TZB was the best professor Ive ever encountered at Yale and I can never thank her enough for what she did for us.",
