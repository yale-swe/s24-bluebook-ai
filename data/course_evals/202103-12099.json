I had some familiarity with AfterEffects already, and I was able to develop those software skills a bit through each assignment. Through my individual meetings with Chris, I also developed my ability to explain my intent with a project via visual and verbal materials.",

                "I really enjoyed the structure of the class -- having time to create\/discuss drafts followed by refinements towards final projects. I also found the student presentations on motion videos valuable. \r\n\r\nIn terms of class discussion, I thought it was helpful when we were specifically asked to talk about each other's videos because it forced us to analyze each video deeply. Along with this disciplined approach to discussion, I wonder if there's a way to create more natural and engaged class conversations...I think that it could be fruitful to have students discuss their personal passions, why they were drawn to each other's videos, or discussion about how videos are relevant,...etc. I think that if the discussions mixed the current structured approach with more open-form conversation whose topics are moreso led by the students, the already interesting critiques could be even more engaging.",
                "This course is very good at diving right in to creating motion work. It forced me to quickly develop my software skills and my ability to think about time-based work. It was also very good at providing references and examples. Having little exposure to motion, this was very helpful. I also appreciated how bigger assignments were introduced earlier, so we could start thinking about them. I would have liked to see instruction offered in AfterEffects; there was virtually none, yet it was the primary tool we were using. Becoming more skilled at the software itself is something I thought I would be better at coming out of this course. The early assignment in which we animated abstract shapes to music clips was really effective for me, I think because it was such a tightly constrained brief. I wonder if there are more exercises like that, that could be sprinkled in to teach specific skills.",

                "Absolutely! Exploring motion opened up an entire new world of storytelling for me. I loved how each project looked at time-based storytelling from a completely different perspective that forced us to direct narratives in new and interesting ways. I'm also grateful that the class pushed me to improve both my technical and storytelling skills.",
                "Yes. Chris has tons of experience as a teacher and motion designer. This course is particularly good for a student who has little to no experience in motion. It will jumpstart your thinking and get you to learn the basics of the software through completing the assignments.",
                "Yes. This was a great learning experience"
