Professor Rogers also presents very intriguing and essential questions and perspectives to the discussion, which I really liked.",
                "The reading was fun, but discussions could be a bit slow at times",
                "Having the course on Zoom was a bit difficult, but otherwise the course was amazing! Ben and Professor Rogers are both brilliant, incredibly helpful in office hours, and keep seminar conversation going quite naturally. I enjoyed having the lectures to supplement the readings.",
                "The course was wonderful. The professor was very engaging and excited for the course. The students were also very engaged and our discussions were always fascinating.",

                "yes! john rogers is amazing and ben (the TA) was fantastic as well. super easy renaissance credit for the English major",
                "Absolutely. I signed up for this class entirely out of necessity, but I could not be happier with the way things turned out. Prof. Rogers is very kind and helpful. His talks are easily digestible and incredibly fascinating. He also does a great job of leveling with students who are unfamiliar with classic literature. Take this class: if nothing else just to have some fun conversations with Rogers and explore some literature that is very weird, but also beautiful and captivating.",

It takes the pressure off of someone like me who isn't the best at literature. He showed me that I can enjoy reading old works and erased the stereotype of what can be seen as \"boring\".
