                "I learned how to read and analyze a selection of critical readings developed the ability to discuss how these perspectives shape our current society and media forms (e.g. reality TV)",
                "For one, I was able to improve my reading comprehension skills, since we often read long works before classroom discussions. On that same note, I developed my ability to concisely express my thoughts--daily classroom discussions helped to get the jumbled thoughts in my brain into a sentence out loud. In general though, my biggest takeaway is how I view reality television. It is no longer just a filmed, edited, and published version of someone's life-- it is an entire operation. There is so much thought that goes into displays of wealth or consumption in reality television. There is so much thought behind the simplest camera zoom-ins and sound effects too. Overall, it showed me just how much work is put into what seemed like simple actions--record, and then air.\r\nAlso, this class helped me form connections between what seemed unrelated (like Marxist thought) and reality television. I never realized how philosophical and\/or ethical conversation about reality television could be like. In this way, I developed my critical thinking skills.",

                "I learned to write research papers with much better skill than before. I also learned to critically think about and analyze texts and improved in my discussion and communication skills.",
                "I think my writing improved a lot through the different types of papers that we had to write. I also learned how to look at reality tv through a scholarly lens and formulate opinions on a show that wasn't just based on if I liked the characters.",

                "This course was very engaging and the small class size allowed for effective collaboration and discussion. The assignments were organized well and Eve was very helpful in meeting with us to address any concerns.",
                "A big strength of this course is its emphasis on daily discussion. In my opinion, there was no better way to share ideas, help others improve on their writing, etc than by verbally engaging with the subject matter. \r\nOne weakness I would include was perhaps the order in which some papers were read and discussed. For example, Judith Butler's \"Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory\" was read later in on the course, when I think it would have been a fantastic foundational work to engage with.",
                "The biggest weakness was a lack of routine (i.e. each week followed a different pattern). Strengths include interesting and engaging readings followed by interesting and engaging discussion, good essay prompts, and writing support.",
                "Eve is a wonderful instructor and the subject matter was so interesting.",
                "I really enjoyed the readings and structure of the class. I don't really have any ideas for improvement.",
                "Strengths: The prompts for the papers were always open to individual interpretation and there were a lot of different ways to approach the papers. This makes it easy to come up with a topic that you want to write about and are really interested in which in turn makes the papers much easier to write.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Some of the readings were really difficult to understand.",
                "Some of the readings done in class seemed to not correlate to the essays we wrote because we weren't asked to use them or reference them. It might benefit the class to have one essay that relies on material presented in class.",
                "I think we read some really interesting texts that related a lot to reality television however some of the texts sometimes felt a bit unnecessary."

                "Yes! This class was so fun and makes you think about reality TV in a different light. From watching an episode of KUWTK to reading Marx, Eve fosters an environment of both creativity and intellectual challenge that makes you look forward to coming to class",
                "I have recommended and I will continue to recommend this course to other students. I would not recommend the course if someone dislikes reality television, but to someone who is at least neutral towards it, they will find the course rewarding. The workload is not overwhelming; I would say it's fair. Reality television, stigmatized and painted as low-brow by a lot of society, is surprisingly undervalued. This course challenges students to see reality television as perhaps as culturally significant as documentaries, and other kinds of entertainment, like theatre. This in itself is a quite interesting premise. Finally, its small size makes discussion easier (for those who are shy, at least) and more engaging. Conversations always seemed to flow easily and there was always a new thought that came up. Overall, it's a great course.",
                "Yes! This was a super fun and engaging class (Eve is a great teacher, and reality TV is a super interesting topic), but it also has a relatively low workload and is a writing credit which is great.",
                "Yes, I definitely would! Eve is wonderful and the subject matter is academic while also being culturally and socially relevant.",
                "Yes! It was very engaging and insightful.",
                "Absolutely, I enjoyed the class content and learned a lot.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. The course material covers so much more than reality tv and I felt as though we had incredibly engaging and insightful conversations about our readings.",
                "Yes! Eve does a great job of making this course really fun to take while still being intellectually challenging at times. There is a nice balance of assigned readings and show episodes and it's really cool to be able to take seemingly unrelated readings and apply them to reality tv.",
                "Yes, I think it made writing complex papers more entertaining because of its subject material that differs from a traditional writing course.",
                "Yes for sure. it was such a fun class and I loved Eve as a professor. We always had such interesting conversations."
