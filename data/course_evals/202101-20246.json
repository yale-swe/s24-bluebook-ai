It was an incredibly insightful class led by a passionate professor!",

                "A great thing about this class is the collaborative environment Marc encourages. After workshopping with your fellow peers and getting your script cold read in front of the class, you will much better understand the weaknesses\/strengths of your craft. The professor gives great detailed feedback, and it's just overall a LOT of fun.",
                "I think the smaller screenwriting groups was a good way to structure the class so that people got more than just one class a week out of the class. I also think the final assignment was very doable considering time constraints. However, the time between which the last few students got to workshop their scripts and when the final script was due was very short, which I thought was unfair, so if there was a way to restructure the class so that more time is allotted, that'd be great. I also think the midterm folder is a bit excessive in its requirements although I do see the value in all of the assignments required.",
                "Strengths: Prof Lapadula is a fantastic professor. There was not a ton of guidance on the story until after we had written a first draft. He's very good at the technical side of writing. He also has a very specific sense of humor. But he's super chill. I really liked having the weekly unsupervised small groups meetings. Those were great. Learned a lot from my peers. Weaknesses: Pretty much your entire grade is the midterm folder\/final. If you cannot pace yourself throughout the first half of the semester with the amount of writing required for the midterm folder, be wary of this class. I felt the communication was poor. For the final, no one knew the date it was due. So one person asked and just like told everyone else. I feel like having set dates at the beginning or at least emailing everyone when the date was decided would be a good idea. Granted, this was the covid spring semester when there was no spring break so the dates were a little weird. So, I guess be proactive and ask.",
                "Engaging and interesting lectures. I enjoyed the format of the class but hoped there would be more instruction on how to structure an interesting screenplay.",
                "Strengths: workshops, learn how to format, sub-groups, guest speakers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe more detail on how to structure a story, sometimes seminar feels like it's going a bit off topic",
                "There should be more classes",
                "The strengths of this course mainly lie in the enthusiasm of the professor and how effectively he created a community environment that facilitated our improvement as writers.",
                "Strengths: extremely engaging lectures. Prof Lapadula makes classes fun but still gives you tons of practical advice. You get to have the class read your script multiple times, so there are plenty of opportunities to get personalized feedback on your writing. Weaknesses: You're assigned to meet with a group outside of class, so we ended up meeting via Zoom. This was extremely valuable, but it was hard to keep people accountable. It's easy for the group that you're put into to stop meeting since you're supposed to organize that outside of class. Those sessions helped get even more individualized feedback, so just make sure you all keep that going for as long as possible."

It's amazing how many opportunities you get to share your work with others and have really personalized feedback. Prof Lapadula even calls you to go through your entire midterm folder with you (so you know he reads everything) and talks you through ideas for your script."
