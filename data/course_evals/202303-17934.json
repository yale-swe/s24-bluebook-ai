                "SUCH a great course. At the most basic level I learned about how to read Psych papers (in particular about education) and engage in critical discussion about them -- this is the first seminar for my major where we really evaluated the science, policy and implications. \r\nI also learned a lot about education in general and how students learn best. This applies for both younger elementary students across a range of backgrounds as well as for high-achieving college students. \r\nI had never written a policy paper before (as a Psych major) and this was exposure to a new type of writing that I think is really helpful for future writing assignments / requirements, including thesis work and applications.",
                "Each week, we discussed the assigned weekly reading which were focused on a different topic of student learning. You learned how to critically think about educational/learning research, form questions, and reflect on your own educational experiences. There was also an opportunity to be paired up with another student in the class and learn about their experiences, as well as go into a New Haven classroom to observe a class.",
                "This course helped developed my critical thinking skills with the empirical studies we read throughout the semester. My classmates and I were encouraged to not only just read the assigned content, but to think about whether the studies were done well, what their findings could mean or do in an educational context, and solutions that these findings could inspire to help students thrive. I appreciated the opportunity to discuss important topics or lessons that are important to improving how the education system is structured, and how this course really got me to think about how psychology in general can be translated into a real-world context.",
                "I learned a lot about development psychology generally, and in the specific context of educational developmental psychology. I learned how to better read, analyze, and critique a research paper. I learned a lot about the feasibility of implementation of research into practice, and I feel like I have a better understanding of what goes into a good research design.",
                "- Critical thinking, especially related to evaluation of scientific journal articles and the implementation of science in real life. \r\n- Many psychology and neuroscience studies related to aspects of education, everything from executive function to memory to reward structures\r\n- Other experiences of education from the POV of our peers",
                "I absolutely loved this course! I learned so much not only about this area of developmental research but from my peers in class as well. It really felt like we were all equals and our experiences helped drive the course.",
                "I have gained a deeper understanding of the intersection between developmental psychology, neuroscience, and education. I acquired the skills to formulate research questions and thoroughly design experiments in psychology. Through exploring research about executive function, reasoning, memory, curiosity, persistence, creativity, mindset, and social belonging, I have learned to critically evaluate current educational practices with a multifaceted lens. Overall, this course made me a better thinker and writer. I will especially carry the knowledge Ive gained about active learning and incentive structures to my future learning and work in education.",
                "Thinking critically about whether certain interventions are ready for \"prime time\" and the constraints that are faced in the implementation side of developmental psychology, how to design research experiments for education, how to think critically about gaps that exist in literature and what that means for different stakeholders (researchers, teachers, leaders, etc)",

            "comments": [
                "No weaknesses, prof. leonard is a great teacher and she deserves tenure. Favorite teacher I have had at Yale",
                "I loved how comfortable it was to participate in class. Professor Leonard does a great job of balancing lecturing and discussions. The weekly reading responses were also very helpful for inspiring discussions and staying caught up on readings. I wouldn't change anything.",
                "SUCH a great course and so many strengths. The course format was great with a short lecture based on new material from the assigned papers and a chance to discuss and evaluate findings later. Having a short break in a long seminar class was also great. I appreciated that readings were all assigned so far ahead so we could begin early. Each week two people did an \"extra reading\" which deepened the conversation without creating an unmanageable reading load each week. I also liked having quotes / slides to scaffold the discussion instead of less directed conversation.\r\n\r\nOnly a few things I would change and they are mostly a result of translating the syllabus for the spring into the fall semester. I think the spacing of the white paper due dates (outline and full essay) could be moved to better accommodate breaks in the semester (Fall and Thanksgiving). They only needed to be partway through the semester, not exactly halfway. When coming back from Fall break we had four papers, normal reading response, and first white paper all due after we were supposed to be on break which felt a little unfair. Same for Thanksgiving break and outlines -- it would be appreciated to move these deadlines so there is a break from work when we are away from school. A suggestion would be to modify / lighten the load on reading responses for the weeks that papers were due so that we are still reading and preparing for discussion without spending hours and hours. This could be by splitting up readings across students so we all read one paper instead of 3-4 but can still discuss.\r\n\r\nWould also like to see other students' discussion questions before class! Lots of times the discussion went in a different direction than my writing and it would be nice to prepare for that (like Monday evening before Tues class).",
                "This course was amazing and very rewarding. We learned so much each week, and Professor Leonard was eager to adjust the course to make it even better throughout the semester. Professor Leonard left feedback on all of the weekly reading responses and gave a rubric for the midterm and final papers. It was clear she wanted everyone in the class to do well and be engaged. The only weakness was that there was not enough time to discuss everything!!",
                "Strengths - the professor did a great job with encouraging students to participate in discussion. It was evident that she read through our reading responses and used the questions we posed in the responses to formulate the structure of the class, and chose questions from a variety of students to encourage them to speak about their thoughts on the content. Also, I loved how genuine our professor was and she really did show how much she wanted every student to gain something from the class, and she made it a comfortable environment for everyone to contribute without judgement.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - honestly, I cannot really think of any.",
                "I really loved this course. I think the opportunities for students to share their personal experiences allowed for a really engaged and connected environment. I also appreciate that our discussion was not only based in our personal histories, and I think the classroom visitation was really informative. The discussion papers were helpful, and I liked that the final and midterm assignment of writing a white paper felt like a useful skill for me to develop, in addition to being a diagnostic of my engagement with the material.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Prof Leonard is the biggest strength, she's awesome\r\n- Incredibly engaging, especially since Prof Leonard spent the time every class to include direct quotes from each of our weekly essays in her slides deck\r\n- Growth in critical thinking, I think every student in the class got better at it since we practiced so much each week\r\n- Types of assignments: loved the grade breakdown, opportunity to improve on final essay and count it for more of grade, variety of assessments, weekly reading responses (ensured good engagement with the course by holding you accountable)\r\n- Subject material was really interesting and Prof Leonard chose great topics for each week\r\n- Prof Leonard's personalized feedback on every assignment (#praisedeprived)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Classroom was a little too small but loved having it in 100 College\r\n- Assignments due during/right after break (ex: midterm essay and response paper over October break, Thanksgiving break due date); having a response paper and midterm paper the same week and right by a break felt overwhelming, but I do recognize there was an opportunity to drop one reading response so could potentially do it during that week\r\n- That we didn't meet more often lol!",
                "The strengths are that the course really required participation from all students based on weekly reading responses we completed. We would be asked to elaborate on information we put in those and created interesting discussion that way.",
                "This course had many strengths: The lectures were well-organized and thorough, and the structure of the reading responses made for engaging, productive conversation in every class. I appreciated how our discussions centered around both research and practical implications, especially when it came to addressing inequalities in education. We were given extensive feedback on our responses and papers, and we were given opportunities to learn about our classmates' educational experiences. These factors created a very inclusive and supportive learning environment. The only weakness is that we did not get to share what we researched for our papers with our peers. Some of us did this in class, but it may be nice to add it as part of the course. Overall, this was an amazing, well-structured, and engaging course!!",
                "Amazing class discussions, classes always flew by, best 9am class ever, Professor Leonard is a huge reason to take this course. I felt intellectually challenged but also did not feel too intimidated to participate in class. The fact that Professor Leonard reads out weekly responses, comments on them, and uses quotes from our responses to guide our class discussions makes us feel like our assignments and thoughts really do matter. It's huge to be able to contribute our thoughts in class without always having to create that space for ourselves in the middle of discussions. She really makes it a space for everyone to contribute and created the class in a way that allows for that quite naturally.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: nothing except the classroom was a bit cramped",
                "Loved the format of the course, the content was great and so interesting, really good discussions, engaging assignments, and professor was amazing! We received really excellent feedback as well."

Prof Leonard has so much energy and is really excited to work with students to discuss this exact topic which makes the course that much better.",

It was especially cool to hear diverse perspectives from non-psychology majors and different types of students at Yale. If you're taking this class, it is really important that you are willing to do the readings and engage with the responses and class discussions.",

I really liked how it not only opened my eyes to the current faults, but also encouraged me to evaluate my own experiences at school and how they could be improved based on the information we have learned over the course of semester. Whether we realize it or not, this topic is really important and the professor does a really great job at conveying the information and making this class enjoyable to be in.",
                "Yes. I really loved this class, and I feel like I improved a lot and sharpened skills that will be useful to me in the future (research paper analysis, paper writing, experiment design, etc). I feel like student learning was prioritized, and I still had a lot of fun. There were a lot of different tools used to facilitate learning, and because the class was about educational design, we were able to discuss and think about aspects of the class that were helpful and aspects that were not.",

I'll be thinking about this class for a while, lots of really fascinating takeaways and an awesome classroom environment. Do whatever you possibly can to get into this classyou won't regret it!!",

                "Absolutely, one of the best classes I have taken at Yale",
                "YES!! This is definitely one of my favorite courses at Yale. You will read diverse papers and develop a nuanced understanding of the intersection between developmental psychology and educational experiences. Personally, I have come away from the course very excited to research the potential interventions we have brainstormed in class. The energy of this class is wonderful, and I have high praise for this course!!",
                "Yes! If you're into education especially please take this course. I'm not from a psychology background whatsoever but Professor Leonard makes this class extremely accessible for all majors.",
