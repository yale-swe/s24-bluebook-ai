These included learning about the Air Force history, military customs\/courtesies, Air Force Core Values, and more. I also was able to practice speaking twice via a military-style brief. All of these foundational concepts are important to know and will greatly support my success in future USAF courses.",

                "One strength of this course was its structure and ability to present all the necessary information in a timely manner, preparing us well for the final as well as promoting the actual comprehension of the material. The course also had direct homework\/reading materials which made it easy to prepare for the class. I would say a weakness was the format of the instruction, since it was a lecture for the majority of the classes and early in the morning it is harder to stay engaged in straight lectures, but there were also presentations and occasional team competitions. Including perhaps a break in each lecture to do a short competition\/interactive piece rather than doing competitions on some days and lectures on others would make each day more engaging.",
                "My strength for this course was having some sort of background on the topic and my weakness would be not being connected my fellow classmates as much. The way I can approve this is by attending more activities."

                "Yes, I would, because the community\/bond formed by the students is strong. The information is also crucial to know for future AFROTC objectives, and thus is important for anyone seeking to continue on such path.",
                "Yes, being in AFROTC helps students develop discipline and leadership skills",
