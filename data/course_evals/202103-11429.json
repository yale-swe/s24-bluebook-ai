                "As someone who loves writing but has no screenwriting experience, this class was hugely helpful. I have been interested in film and writing for film for quite a while, but was at a loss for how to go about doing it, both technically and stylistically. I now feel like any time inspiration strikes, I will be able to write a screenplay. I feel like I understand the structure, the necessary components and formatting, and what might make a good screenplay. I learned about what it means to be a professional screenwriter. This is one of those classes where I learned skills that I can actually show for at the end of the semester.",
                "It was good to get like the foundational knowledge of the form. You really learn how movies are traditionally structured and work within\/analyze the three act form.",
                "This course gave a fantastic introduction to the art of screenwriting and storytelling. As someone who had never written a screenplay before, this course was perfect for learning both the technical and more abstract skills when it comes to screenwriting.",
                "I gained the step by step knowledge required to successfully write a feature length screenplay - no easy feat!",
                "I learned the most conventional \"formulae\" for writing and creating a compelling story for film. I learned how to go from a seed idea, to mapping out the major moments of a film, to creating the smaller moments that move us up and down between those high points of tension in the film. I also learned how to write a compelling scene, giving me the tools to write a full screenplay outside of the course.",
                "I learned a lot about the foundations of a classical Hollywood screenplay. This course was very informative in the sense that it helped provide a foundation and a framework for thinking about the way we tell stories through this particular medium. I learned about the general structure behind writing a screenplay based on Aristotle's poetics. I also learned about a lot of do's and dont's when it comes to writing. Overall, the class was a great introduction to this particular craft.",
                "I learned a lot about the fundamentals and building blocks of screenplay, from one perspective.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course include it's clear and logical structuring. Again, as someone who didn't know anything about screenwriting, we started with a manageable, bite-sized introduction to the craft and built upon it throughout the semester until we had the first fifth or so of a screenplay. Every class was very engaging, both because Professor Price is simply a very gifted speaker and teacher, and because the content itself was interesting and felt useful. \r\nWe received thorough and insightful comments on all of our assignments, which offered a great avenue for gradual improvement. \r\nI'm honestly trying to think of something that could be construed as a weakness, and I'm drawing a blank, so I won't go searching for a flaw that wasn't there! This was an incredibly strong course that absolutely accomplished what it set out to do.",
                "I think some of the readings felt a little outdated (just because Aristotle is not someone I think of when I think of screenwriting). But Prof. Price is really helpful and the homework most weeks was to work on an outline\/screenplay. It was nice to turn something in every week so it didn't overwhelm you to turn in 15 pages for the final. I really liked that a lot of the homework was to work on your final screenplay.",
                "This course was excellent for a number of reasons. Professor Price always provided helpful feedback on our work, and made plenty of time in class for us to receive feedback from fellow students as well. The workload felt very manageable, and I liked that we were given a high amount of agency in the films we chose to watch for certain assignments. This really allowed us to tailor the course to our own needs and the needs of our script, which worked very well for me. The only weakness I can think of is that the class only met once per week, and I would have appreciated a bit more class time.",
                "I'm so glad I took this course! I learned so much practical and industry knowledge! The strengths of this course are the professor's engaging lectures and insights, along with the well paced assignments that push us to make more dynamic work. The one weakness in my opinion that I'd note is that the professor would cold call pretty often, which works for some students' levels of engagement but creates an unnecessarily stressful environment for others.",
                "The classes could often feel more like a lecture than a seminar. More reading or perhaps watchings of films that we could discuss in class may have been helpful. I also would have enjoyed more personal time with the professor when receiving comments or feedback on what I had written.",
                "Strengths: Professor Price is a very engaging and charismatic professor. His ability to sustain our engagement and discussion throughout each two-hour lecture is commendable. He is also very approachable, which makes learning feel a lot less intimidating. I also think the way the course is structured really allows for step-by-step skill and knowledge development, which is imperative to honing this particular craft. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the workload can seem a little imbalanced throughout the semester (earlier in the semester there is hardly any work, whereas later on the workload seems to pile up). Also, I do think that the material we look through in class can seem a little elementary (I believe we could have been challenged a bit more in terms of class discussions as well as general assignments. For example, instead of following through with the particular Aristotle structure, it would've been interesting if we as a class could have explored the possibilities of what it would be like to challenge and alter our screenplay structures, seeing how it would change the narrative and the way the story progresses).",
                "The course is a strong and foundational intro to screenwriting. I would have liked to see more collective editing between students and less of a \"lecture\" approach at points!",
                "The organization of this class is fantastic, especially if you're new to screenwriting. Professor Price walks you through each step of the way, which I really appreciated because I initially found the prospect of writing a screenplay quite daunting. By the end of the class, though, I was excited about the screenplay I'm working on and I want to continue to work on it.\r\nThe amount of feedback on my assignments I got in this class was also stellar. For each week's assignment, Professor Price gave us in depth comments so I never felt at a loss for how to improve my writing. At the end of the class, we did individual conferences with Professor Price to discuss our screenplays, which was very exciting because I feel like I got a lot of great direction for where to take my screenplay as I continue to write outside the class."

                "Yes! Definitely take it if you're interested in screenwriting. Professor Price teaches you practical skills and is open about what it takes to make it in the industry.",
                "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to another student, particularly a student who is interested in screenwriting. Again, the class is very well-taught and is a joy to take. Seminars this length often drag, but this course always flew by. I was never checking my watch, and I always looked forward to going to class. I had to miss one session due to a cold, and while I often don't mind a day off from other classes, I was genuinely disappointed to miss the content from the day as well as the fun that I had being in class. Of course, I am a fan of movies and talking about movies, so this class is certainly geared to people like me, but it was such a treat! I am so glad to have had the opportunity to take this class.",
                "Yes! Was not too much work but enough so that I felt I got something out of it.",
                "Yes! If you're at all interested in screenwriting, this is an excellent course to take. It's super accessible to people of all skill levels, and really helps give you a broad understanding of screenwriting as a whole.",
                "I'd highly recommend this course to anyone interested in screenwriting! You get an excellent bedrock from which you can be more successful in all your other screenwriting pursuits, even if you scrap the final project after submitting it. The professor wants to help you however he can, and is super warm and approachable. You also aren't punished for work that has a lot of kinks in it as long as you put in a good effort.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. Professor Price is not only very knowledgable about the industry and about the craft, but he is also incredibly funny, likable and enjoyable to learn from. In terms of the material itself, this is a fantastic way to dip your toes in the water of a process that can be daunting and represent a lot of barriers of entry to people unfamiliar. Prof. Price made this a place where I could fully lean into exploring what it meant to write a screenplay but also gave me incredible and useful feedback.",
                "Yes, I would! If you do not have any experience or prior knowledge on writing screenplays, this class would be a great introduction! Professor Price is amazing, and at the end of the class, you'll have the first act of a screenplay all done! The feedback I received from Professor Price and my classmates were also very useful when it came to working through my first act's first draft.",
                "Yes, for anyone looking to learn about the fundamentals of screenwriting with little prior experience.",
                "Yes, definitely! It's a really fun class but you also get a lot out of it. This was the best residential college seminar I've ever taken. It was a little bit more of an introductory class--you only write part of a screenplay for your final assignment and much of the class is spent gearing up to actually writing the screenplay--but an excellent place to start. I'd never even thought about writing a screenplay before this class but left the class thinking I might seriously pursue this."
