I can now read French books with the occasional dictionary check when encountering an unfamiliar word. I am not yet able to understand the dialogue in French films yet because the language is spoken much faster in real life than in an introductory class, but that comes with time."

                "Strength - I loved Professor Ali, easily one of my favorite professors at Yale. He is so kind, wants to see us succeed, and is very helpful\r\n\r\nWeakness - The French curriculum needs to change. Make it much easier, especially for L1. It is absurd to have a 15 page final exam and like 5+ portions on the lingco verbal portions of the exams. I have taken other languages at Yale and have had far better learning experiences because of the structure of the course. I think everyone in my class wouldl agree that the curriculum for French especially L1 is awful and way too hard and just outright unfair.",
                "I would have preferred more optional paper worksheets to strengthen certain skills such as verb conjugation and understanding 'imparfait vs passe compose'. The entire course relied on the Blinklearning website, which I feel was useful, although I would have preferred if, for each exam, the course instructors made and gave out a 3 or 4-page paper worksheet covering ALL of the vocabulary and content that would appear on each exam. \r\n\r\nAs for strengths, my course instructor regularly showed French music videos in class and made us do group activities which really helped engage the class."

                "Yes if you have had a background in french. otherwise you will likely struggle. languages are supposed to be a fun way to engage with new cultures and try something new, but this curriculum is very discouraging from that.",
                "Yes! This was taught very well--I love Ali, he really cares about the students and their needs when it comes to learning. He also really cares about us personally: he has brought us cake to celebrate on several occasions. Ali is soft-spoken, but he is also very helpful and instructive.",
                "You should only take this class if you are truly interested in learning French. The homework is time consuming and the test are difficult.",
                "Yes. French is difficult, but if you believe the language is interesting and think that you could maintain interest all semester, I would highly recommend the class. It is, however, not for the faint of heart. If you don't already care much about the language and are only taking the class to fulfill a language requirement, I imagine that you may leave the class forever hating the language just because of its difficulty, but if, like me, you dream of croissants and cigarette smoke, you'll find it thoroughly enjoyable."
