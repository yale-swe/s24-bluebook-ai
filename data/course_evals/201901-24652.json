    "Good course.",
    "Strengths are the small class size - you got to know everyone in the class and everyone had a chance to speak during discussion.  Professor Mazzotta was great at encouraging our thoughts and helping guide our analysis.  The reading pace was slow which was really nice, though we could have gone a bit faster and had more structure to our discussions.  But overall, the class was great.",
    "We read so many interesting novels and had so many insightful conversations regarding them. It would have been helpful to have more structure in terms of how the course was organized."

    "Good course. We also had a Skype conversation with Tina Fallani, an Italian film director who had contributed to making \"The godfather.\"",
    "I would definitely recommend this class!  The discussions are interesting and if you show up and make an effort, you will do well.  The workload is very light and it's enjoyable and interesting to chat with Professor Mazzotta.  As long as you are engaged, you will learn and get something out of it.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Great course. Professor Mazzotta is insightful, entertaining, and funny. Reading load was very manageable - interesting, engrossing books",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to any student looking to read some good Italian literature and learn about the lives of immigrants.",
    "Yes!"
