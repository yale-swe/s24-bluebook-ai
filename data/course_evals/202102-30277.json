                "This was a very strong course with few weaknesses. The pace was difficult, but that's expected from an intensive summer language course. I think more direction regarding the oral exam and allotting an extra 15 or so minutes for the first exam would be very helpful.",
                "The course is intensive, so I got a lot out of it but I also didn't have as much time as I'd hoped to do other outside work. \r\n\r\nThe course is structured excellently. It is challenging, engaging, dynamic, and fun! Both professors are lovely as well. I'm going to miss class with them!! I loved how much we learned about various cultures and the longer films from 130 and this course were highlights.\r\n\r\nI really liked the podcast project. The only thing I'd say about it is that adding creative elements to it such as music was difficult because we were in groups. I think that maybe it could be cool to incorporate 1 individual creative project into the class so that we could more easily play around with fun presentations\/editing etc.",
                "The course materials \/ homework assignments \/ announcements are a little confusing and all over the place but overall the two professors that I had were outstanding and I've learned a lot in the course. One thing that I didn't like is that in our politics \/ economy unit, we had to have discussions to practice the vocabulary sharing our personal religious\/ political views which honestly made me a little bit uncomfortable -- particularly the political aspect considering today's political climate.",
