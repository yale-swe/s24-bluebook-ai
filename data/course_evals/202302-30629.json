                "Before taking this course, I had very little prior knowledge about the American Eugenics Movement. Throughout this summer session, I have learned so much about the influence of Eugenics on early 20th century American society and culture. More specifically, we discussed the extent of Eugenic thought at the university level and specifically Yale's role in this movement. In the small seminar-like environment, I have strengthened my communication skills and found that we were able to spend quality time engaging with the material.",
                "I developed insight into the history of Eugenics at Yale and beyond and how it impacts daily life and perspectives today. I was able to better contextualize science, medical, and social science education that I have received in the past and learn how to actively engage in anti-eugenics practice.",
                "History of Racism, Science, and Medicine in the University provides deep critical thinking for phenomena in the real world. From this course, I developed a curiosity and realization that science had layers in history that we should closely pay attention to. I also learned much about the complexity of science that utilizes numerous aspects of life to 'manipulate' society. I never heard of Eugenics before this class, but now I comprehensively understand it because of the course."

                "The strengths are the assigned readings and weekly assignments. The readings helped facilitate the conversations we had in the classroom and they were very interesting. I also found the weekly assignments to be very helpful because I was able to take what we discussed and learned each week and synthesize it into a mini project, usually in the form of a presentation or write up. One weakness is the limited time to discuss the material. Class was held twice and week and I wish that we could have continued our discussions for longer.",

                "Absolutely! History of Racism, Science, and Medicine in the University was nothing like the other class I took. It is always fun to join the class. Time flies away in this class because I never feel sleepy, even for the three hours+ session in the afternoon. It gave me an experience that I liked. I learned a lot from Prof. HoSang, my classmates, guest lecturers, and the libraries and places we visited together for the class. It was a joyful time despite the heartwrenching topic we have to discuss every week."

I am hoping to take what I have learned and be an anti-Eugenist advocate in whatever spaces my future leads me.",

It will help me to dig deeper into social issues about identity that I have always longed for. The fact that women also had to face revictimization because of Eugenics pushed me forward to walk on my desired path for women's empowerment."
