                "Learned a whole lot about poetry, how to write effective poetry, Shakespeare, how beautifully poetic Shakespeare's plays are, and how to critically engage with contemporary poetry through the lens of Shakespearean craft",
                "This class taught me to analyze Shakespeare's plays as poetry and to incorporate his poetic techniques into my own work. Over the course of the semester, I became much more comfortable writing poetry and incorporating feedback into my revision process. I got to do an in-depth study of a selection of Shakespeare's works and got a lot of practice writing critically about plays and poetry.",
                "I gained an ability to find the puzzling, odd, beautiful, and joyful in Shakespeare's poetry and prose, and to learn from those moments to become a better poet myself.",
                "Strangely enough, much as I love both Shakespeare and contemporary poetry, Id never stopped to seriously consider their overlaps and intersections. ENGL 447 was a welcome opportunity to encounter not merely new contemporary poets and two of Shakespeares plays (As You Like It and King Lear) that I hadnt read before, but also to consider the waysovert and subtlein which Shakespeares unparalleled influence on the English language persists today formally, thematically, and sonically.",
                "I gained a newfound appreciation for Shakespeare and for his perhaps lesser known plays. I'd never been much of a Shakespeare fan, and now find myself reciting lines from King Lear and making references to As You Like It and seeking out opportunities to become involved with theater productions of his plays. I never would've imagined. Professor Chapman just has such a sincere admiration for his works that you can't help but to find yourself absorbing. \r\n\r\nAs for the creative writing component, I never felt confident in my ability to write poetry until this course entered my life. The daily writing exercises, the frequent instructor feedback, and the opportunities to workshop with classmates were invaluable. I now feel my poetry is something I can share with others, and have a better understanding of how to revise and improve upon my own works.",
                "I learned so much !!! I hadn't really read much Shakespeare before this class, and at first it was honestly really overwhelming and made me feel a little anxious especially sharing things about my name to the class and feeling like other people knew more, but I ended up really enjoying the class and the final project and diving into Richard and as you like it and king Lear. Having an assignment due can be overwhelming at first but I realized that it didn't have to be perfect and that also really wonderful how Chapman schedule workshops for after break and we didn't have huge midterm paper. I did have to stay on top of readings but you can watch or read or do whatever you have to do and the creative writing got more and more fun as the semester went on.",
                "This course was very helpful in developing my poetry writing and poetry analysis skills."

                "Strengths: the assignments for every class played beautifully into class discussions and helped create strong, informed engagement with the material. Professor Chapman is a phenomenal professor who always gives insightful, actionable feedback on each and every assignment. Weaknesses: none",
                "Professor Chapman's teaching is the greatest strength of this class. She brings so much enthusiasm and care to the course and makes each seminar feel new and exciting. She made poetry and Shakespeare accessible even to those without experience. She gave detailed feedback on every piece of work and was so helpful during one-on-one meetings.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of the course is that sometimes the expectations for major assignments were not entirely clear.",
                "This course was truly excellent. There was a perfect balance of contemporary readings and shakespeare, and the use of video and audio to bring Shakespeare to life really helped me.",
                "I loved ENGL 447 and struggle to think of any major ways in which it might be improved. Personally, it was sometimes a challenge to produce so much creative work in so short a span of time, but this is in large part because I was working on my Writing Concentration project simultaneously, and is not so much a fault of the course itself.",
                "Strengths: the hybridization of critical and creative approaches to poetry, the focus on Shakespeare plays as opposed to Shakespeare sonnets, Professor Chapman\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the critical prompts could feel a bit tedious...or maybe I was just really biased in favor of the creative prompts.",
                "Weakness: the beginning felt overwhelming. Maybe starting off a little slower introducing everyone, watching a clip, reading a modern poem? Talking about course format? Idk \r\n\r\nStrength: Chapman doesn't micromanage your assignments. She provides holistic advice and grades that feel both gracious but also critical in a good way. She is warm without being overly informal and ultimately just wants to know you are engaging with Shakespeare and your writing in a meaningful way. Our class was not super tight, but I think from sharing poetry and Chapman's energy we eventually had a really lovely vibe and I loved how she was flexible on the final project.",
                "I like how the work was structured throughout the course (weekly assignments, one midterm presentation, and a group project at the end of the semester). The group project was especially enjoyable because it allowed me to connect more with my peers and talk about Shakespeare in new and innovative ways."

                "Absolutely! This ended up being my favorite course of the English major even though I came into it not liking poetry or Shakespeare. It is more work than the regular English class (~2-3 hrs of work before each class), yet it never felt overwhelming and the work clearly connected and built upon class discussion. The mix of creative and analytical registers complimented each other fantastically, as creating our own works of poetry helped give a much deeper understanding and appreciation for the texts we engaged with.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are excited about writing poetry and looking at Shakespeare's poetry in-depth. This class is so fun and lively, and Professor Chapman brings a great energy to the class. However, Shakespeare is the topic of the course, so if you don't enjoy his work, you may not enjoy this class. \r\n\r\nThere are usually creative and critical writing prompts assigned for every class meeting, so you should be prepared to write a lot for this course and to share and receive feedback in workshop.\r\n\r\nThis is a great way to get a Renaissance credit for the English major. The class is definitely English-major heavy, especially creative writing concentrators. However, the class is very accessible, regardless of previous poetry-writing experience.",
                "I absolutely would! It made me so excited to come to LC.",
                "Id absolutely recommend ENGL 447 to other students, regardless of whether theyre English majors. The course never felt stale: students who tire quickly of Shakespeare will have more than enough contemporary poetry to satiate them, and students who feel at odds with contemporary poetry will be able to take refuge in the courses Shakespearean focus. Additionally, I appreciated that though I was taking the course for a Renaissance credit, I got to do a great deal of serious creative writing, and even my analytical writings felt places in which I could adopt a poetic tone.",
                "Yes! This is the type of course where you end up feeling rather emotional on the last day of classes. Professor Chapman cultivates a really wonderful classroom environment, and her passion for teaching and for poetry is undeniable---and that passion permeates the rest of the class, it's impossible for it not to. \r\n\r\nThe Shakespeare plays ended up being really fun to read and discuss in class, and the creative writing of poetry was without a doubt my favorite aspect of the course. I loved being able to say things like \"I have a poem due at midnight,\" and I loved the very act of writing the poetry. If you have any interest in poetry writing at all, this class is a wonderful way to explore it. \r\n\r\nThe creative writing exercises all had really clever prompts that were fun to experiment with, and somehow managed to be perfectly relevant to whatever we were discussing about whichever Shakespeare play we were reading. It was just clear that so much thought and creativity went into the very crafting of this course. \r\n\r\nWould definitely recommend!",
                "I think its a great way to get your Renaissance credit if you also want to do some creative writing  ! It's not easy on the daily basis with all of the reading and writing but it gets better once you get into the flow of it and I think Chapman takes classroom directions in interesting fun directions at least for someone who hasn't read these plays before",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Even if you are not interested in Shakespeare, Professor Chapman makes the material super fun and interesting."
