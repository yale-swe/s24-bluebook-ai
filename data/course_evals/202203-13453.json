                "This was the first year the course was offered at Yale, so there were a few kinks to be worked out, but overall it was engaging and productive. I particularly enjoyed the class structure that featured activities and new ways to engage with the reading beyond just your average in class discussion.",
                "Weaknesses: Based on the syllabi, was expecting more information on the legal consequences of white-collar crimes. Much was focused on the action and omitting the consequences left us with half a picture sometimes. Sometimes the readings were very heavy, which made it difficult to fully engage with them. \r\nStrengths: Super engaging course that brought together so many interesting topics. Detailed discussions and overviews on money crimes and how they came to be",
                "All strengths, Dr. Ogle is an excellent professor who structured the course so students could learn in a comfortable environment.",
                "I wish we learned more about legal processes.",
                "I thought the class was well structured and that the course topics were interesting for discussion. I think it could have been improved if students were asked if such crimes were indicative of a problem with the system or a reflection on the individual criminals and what lawmakers can do to prevent such crimes going forward."

                "If you are interested in the history of white collar crime, yes! It sounds obvious but I think this is the kind of class where you need to be bought in going in. If you are only mildly interested in the topics described in the syllabus I am not confident this class will engage you deeply enough to be worth it.",
                "Yes, and I already have! This course truly facilitated student learning and encouraged discussion about the readings. There was not pressure to perform but the course focused on our learning and understanding surrounding the subject material. Prof. Ogle is a scholar and engaged us each class on various historical details that were exciting.",
                "Absolutely, excellent course. We learned a lot and it was a lot of fun",
                "Yes, I learned so much and I am thankful I took a class with Professor Ogle.",
                "Yes if they are interested in the topic. I am a student of economics and history so I naturally found the course to be interesting and would easily recommend to students with similar interests as I do."
