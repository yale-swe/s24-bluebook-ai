This class did not require immense knowledge of biotechnology to enter\/succeed in the course, and therefore is a great beginner\/intro course for those interested in this subject matter. Professor Gonzalez gave us a large amount in autonomy in choosing out project topics, so students who are self-starters and who have a genuine curiosity in this subject matter will enjoy the course.",
