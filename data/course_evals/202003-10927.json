                "Only take it if you're really, really interested in the material and have the time to put into learning the material well. The volume of work in this class is comparably high, even for a language course. Memorizing vocabulary was particularly difficult because there are few Korean-English cognates.\r\n\r\nI took this as a way of exploring a completely new language outside of the Indo-European languages with which I was already familiar, and it was honestly hard to keep up with the heritage speakers who seem to like taking this class. Perhaps obviously, this class seemed to strongly favor those with prior knowledge of some East Asian language like Mandarin. \r\n\r\nThe work isn't necessarily difficult, it's just time intensive. Exams and grading are fair.\r\n\r\nThe class wasn't terrible, but if I could go back in time, I wouldn't take it again. \r\n\r\nI think some of the students in the class took this for their first language credit, and this is not a practice I would recommend, especially if you're a non-heritage speaker. There are better organized and more enriching language credits to take in your early years here. If you're looking for language credit(s), consider our world-class French department. I've also heard great things about the Spanish department.",

                "Yes, it was a great introduction.",
                "Definitely! It's a great beginner course, you learn a lot but it's certainly not unmanageable. It's a challenging but great language too, with great faculty.",
                "Definitely, it's a good introduction to Korean.",
                "I would encourage anyone who is unsure about what language to take to consider taking Korean. Initially the language is daunting because of the new alphabet system, but once that is mastered (within the first few weeks) the language is actually fairly enjoyable to learn."
