It's a great crash course to ancient near eastern literature (something other than the typical Western canon which gets a great deal of attention) and highly relevant to Western culture, its advocates and critics. The course reading selection is manageable and offers a great buffet of types of literature and the content is engaging. Professor Slanski is one of my favorite professors at Yale and truly invests in her students and their learning experience. Can't recommend this course enough",

                "Absolutely. It's very enjoyable. You learn about a topic you might not know a lot about. As a stem major, it was a very nice change of pace as it provided a welcoming environment to relax and discuss and imagine more abstract ideas and (for me) new topics."
