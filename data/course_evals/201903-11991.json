    "In Humbugs, I learned how to critique art for it's historical and aesthetic value. I also learned how to write within this discipline.",
    "I learned so so much about American art and literature!",
    "I learned so much about art interpretation, American history and culture until the Civil War, and overall literary trends and currents of the time. The course was definitely very specific but it was extremely fascinating!",
    "I gained lots of insights into American Art, which i had previously not known about",
    "I've never taken an art history course, or indeed, any art class besides English courses. This class gave me a constructive environment within which I could foster the techniques for critical analysis of the visual arts.",
    "A lot of knowledge about a wide array of American Art. The course is mainly 19th-century but Professor Wolf really connects a lot of the material to contemporary art and literature.",
    "Learned a lot about the writers\/artists of the time period, seeing how the visual and historical narratives shifted through time"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course only meets once a week and jumps pretty significantly from topic to topic, oftentimes not following any clear theme. I would make the class either meet more often or have the syllabus cover more specific themes. The strength of the class was also in it's fluidity, and students were able to devise their own projects based off of what they were interested in.",
    "strength: amazing prof, enthusiastic teacher. \r\n\r\nweakness: none",
    "The course syllabus was fantastic! Both the readings and the works were very conducive to interesting discussion. Professor Wolf was by far the greatest strength of the course! He was an amazing, kind, and extremely knowledgeable professor. In fact, he has been my favorite professor at Yale. I cannot stress how great of a professor and human being he is. In terms of weaknesses, I really can't say there are any.",
    "Maybe more engaging classes? the energy felt low at times.",
    "This is a wonderful class! I would not touch a hair on its head except to suggest that due dates be somewhat clearer and more firm at the outset of the semester.",
    "There is not a single thing wrong with this course and I will fist-fight anyone who might suggest otherwise.",
    "This course felt more like a lecture than a seminar--definitely a leminar. I think there could have been more class discussion. Also, the class is much more about art than it is about literature. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just understand that you are going into an art history class.",
    "Strengths: absolutely loved the weekly slideshows; I learned a lot about how to analyze paintings"

   "comments": [
    "Yes - it's a wonderful, low-stress art history course that does not require significant prior knowledge of art history. Light workload and a great field trip. Professor Wolf is knowledgeable, interesting, and perhaps the nicest professor I have ever met.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially if you are looking for something a little less demanding to add to your schedule.",
    "YES! Amazing way to learn about this material with a friendly and enthusiastic prof. Great for majors and non majors alike.",
    "I would definitely recommend, but an initial interest in the subject matter is necessary. The one thing that bothered me most about the class was the amount of people (around 4-6) who straight up did not speak a word during the entire semester. They were simply taking up space. This is both sad and infuriating because a lot of people got turned away from the class because of the cap. Do NOT take this class unless you are genuinely interested and willing to contribute to discussion. This class is too valuable for people to just take up space.",
    "Yes. It is a great way to get an introduction into american art",
    "I would 2000% recommend this course to another student. Professor Wolf is the kindest and most wonderful professor at Yale, in my opinion. He made each class a true pleasure to attend. We learned so much in an enjoyable, non-stressful way. One of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "Take this class! It is an intellectually engaging, taught by a brilliant and kind professor, and has minimal but always interesting work. Low effort, high reward.",
    "Undoubtedly, but you really have to be willing to A) engage with the material critically and B) break free of every \"section asshole\" trope you've learned over your time at Yale. \"Humbugs and Visionaries\" is a superior class; it deserves a superior student. Can Yale produce that superior student? Unsure.",
    "Yes, Bryan Wolf is fantastic, and this course gives you a sense of what good art historical analysis looks like.",
    "I would, if you are interested in a fun and easy course that gives an overview of American art in the 19th century.",
    "Yes, would recommend; wonderful class discussions and assignments"
