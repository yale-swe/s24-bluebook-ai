I also think more short answer questions instead of multiple choice would be better on tests.",
                "Engaging professor",
                "Amazing course; love how it was structured around broad concepts and how we were encouraged to participate in word clouds even though it was a lecture. Although I wish I had gone to more office hours, I really didn't need to, because my TF gave me clear feedback on assignments and the instructions were always clear enough for me to do well independently.",
                "The strengths are the amount of information you learn and I think the way it is presented it interesting and conductive to learning. However, there is a lot of content and sometimes it feels like we were rushing through material.",
                "A strength of the course is how densely packed it is with information. I definitely feel much more knowledgeable on the subject. A weakness of the course is that it was delivered in a very rapid fashion and while I remembered the contents for the test, I feel like I'm less likely to retain it in the long term.",
                "Strength - engaging material\r\nWeakness - So much material",
                "strengths- engaging, professor was amazing, well paced, \r\nweakness- dense course, though that isn't much of a weakness for an introductory course",
                "strengths: very interesting things we learn (applicable). way class is taught is interactive (experiments, vids)\r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes too much is expected to be memorized. Like a slideshow is showed for one sec and it is tested in depth",
                "Weaknesses: The feedback I received throughout the year was essentially useless, and grading is largely dependent on the TA you get.",
                "Good lectures",
                "very organized, great pacing",
                "Exams were absurd. Could tell prof is really trying to shift the narrative away from intro psych being a gutty course, which made the workload even as someone w a strong bio background unmanageable.",
                "Strengths -- lectures are pretty interesting and exams don't have any surprises on them. Weaknesses - some of the assignments didn't feel like they really added much to the course. Just felt like busywork (especially assignment 4). Also, it would have been nice if lectures were recorded, even if they were only released before the midterm for viewing.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lazzaro is an absolutely fantastic lecturer. She's always incredibly enthusiastic about the topic, her slides make note-taking easy, she has student surveys in most lecturers to keep things interactive, and she literally knows almost every student's name (in a class with 300 students). Much of the subject matter is also quite interested, even if you're not interested in the finer details of psychology. Grading is also pretty fair and consistent.\r\nWeaknesses: The biggest weaknesses are all of those associated with a big lecture courseit's hard to stay engaged all of the time, and there's literally zero student discussion. Overall, though, there aren't many weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Good organization, clear feedback. Topics connected to everyday life, and made me see things differently as a result. Very interesting concepts!\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "No strengths \r\nWeaknesses: heavy exam weighting, low essay weighting, 4 essays involving 0 creativity and super boring",
                "This course was organized very well and all of the information was interesting. The lectures included lots of opportunities for student participation and also had lots of engaging videos/examples, so it was easy to pay attention and I often enjoyed class (which I don't say about most of my large lectures). However, the assignments felt more like busy work than necessary for understanding any course content and I found doing them to be boring or leaving me with a feeling of wasting time. I would like the assignments to be more in line with course content instead of entirely separate. \r\n\r\nWe were also not given our exams back unless we specifically requested it, which made it difficult to receive feedback. \r\n\r\nFinally, grading took forever. Our first assignment and exam each took about three weeks to be returned to us. It's very difficult to gauge how well you're doing or how to improve on the upcoming assignments and exams without having the previous ones. There are so many teaching fellows, it would be great to get grades back quicker.",

Office hours and TFs were available, which was especially helpful for our scientific journal searching and essay writing. I also think that having us participate in psych studies was a great way to experience a psych study on the side of the participant, rather than just reading descriptions in a textbook.",
                "strengths were Prof. Lazarro, she was very good at teaching, lectures were interesting and engaging, and exams were reasonable; weaknesses were that lectures were not recorded, I believe the lectures should be recorded",
                "I didnt like doing the outside of class participation experiments requirements",
                "Little help from TAs, content was interesting but the exams focused on irrelevant detail",

                "Intriguing and interactive lectures, fascinating topics",
                "I think that the topics were fun, but there could have been more effort to relate concepts to larger significance. Some of it felt like the concepts were only learned for the tests and then forgotten.",
                "Lectures were fascinating and often genuinely enjoyable. I found the homework/ testing to be a little dull (felt a lot like an AP class?), but I think this was likely a personal lack of interest in things like literature review.",
                "This class's grading was too harsh.",
                "Strengths: there were a wide variety of topics that were very interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we spent longer on certain topics over others.",
                "I thought the course itself was quite boring and very unforgiving. Theres no recording of the lecture and the lecture hall was terrible for learning. There are also only 2 types of grades that actually matter: the exams for which review sessions are unhelpful and essays for which there is little guidance and the grading is subjective.",
                "The strengths of this course was the organization of the lectures and the detailed lecture slides. I was able to solidify my understanding of course concepts using the slides and supplemental articles.",
                "Some interesting ideas, but not loads of depth.",
                "Strengths: a lot of assignments so grade is diluted, participating in studies is cool, exams are not hard if you do a bit of prep\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures get very boring, dont learn much new info",
                "Strengths - the style of teaching, organized by large questions rather than textbook style lectures. Very fun and interactive, and the research participation credits give a lot of insight. Weaknesses - the weighting components; the essays and research participation credits are not given enough weight despite the large amount of time many people spend on them.",
                "Strengths: very clear and interesting lectures. Fairly straightforward exams once you get the hang of it. Weaknesses: written assignments were tedious and grading was opaque.",
                "The exams were very hard. I would have like other assignments in addition to the papers to help reinforce what was discussed in lecture.",
                "This courses strength lies with Professor Lazzaro. Her lecturing was engaging. The weakness of the course is the excess in busy-work with regards to the research paper component.",
                "I liked the in class engagement. The exams sometimes emphasized small off handed comments in class so I believe if its going to be on the test it should be more emphasized in class.",
                "Huge workload, no room for improvement, if you mess up even one little part of the course, you no longer have a chance for an A or A-. The biggest issue is that the tests focus on asking the material in a way that is not logically intuitive, or cannot be learned, just memorized from the class material. This way the course does not facilitate learning like CGSC 110, instead, it's a memory game.",
                "Strengths: well-organized, wonderful instruction by Professor, engaging classes\r\nWeaknesses: lots of assignments",
                "Cool material, though could be a bit slow at times. Lazzaro and TAs are very helpful",
                "A central strength of this course is how the lectures are organized. I found each lecture to be engaging and packed with useful information. Since this course assumes no previous instruction in psychology, it nicely builds a foundation in the first few weeks that it continues to build on.",
                "Strengths: digestible lectures that cover broad topics\r\nWeaknesses: lack of transparency in regards to grading exams",
                "Expectations were pretty straight forward. The assignments were a great way to become acclimated to scientific writing. The pace of lectures, however, was a little quick.",
                "The whole grade depended on the exam and there was not much margin for error.",
                "This class was very well structured and well taught. Loved it.",
                "I loved the format of learning about different concepts through the lecture question, however I felt sometimes the material leaned too much into physiological aspects.",
                "The course covered a wide range of topics and allowed me to see which ones I found most interesting, which I enjoyed.",
                "Strengths: interesting lectures, interesting assignments\r\nWeaknesses: not a lot of guidance on how to write papers, harsh grading, lectures can be overloaded with information",
                "I really enjoyed the organization of this course and thought it made sense for an introductory course.",
                "I liked how the course was structured by everyday questions; that and the moments of class participation really kept me engaged. I didn't think the course had any weaknesses.",
                "Some of the lectures were a bit tedious and long.",
                "The strengths were the interesting topics and material discussed. It could be improved if there were more studies available for the study credits.",
                "A strength of the course is the lectures. They are pretty interesting and provide examples of the concepts we learn in class that make the classes very engaging. A weakness is that there are few assignments so grading is pretty harsh if you are not careful early on.",
                "I really liked how the lectures were based around a question and found this format very engaging.",
                "Tests were difficult and covered obscured knowledge.",

Another weakness was that test feedback was not automatic and an appointment had to be made to go over the test. Extensive office hours are provided which is a huge strength.",
                "One strength of the course is that the topics were very interesting, fun, and thought provoking, which made me very excited to learn the material. The lectures were also very engaging, and I liked how the essays built on each other.",
                "Strengths: incredibly engaging and entertaining lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",

                "The lectures are clear and engaging. I feel like going to the lectures really helps with understanding and remembering the material. There are great examples of concepts and Professor Lazzaro is wonderful. I think the readings could be improved and that the research participation could count for a greater percentage of the grade because it is time consuming.",
                "The biggest problem with this course is that the tests are regurgitations and the assignments/essays are subjectively graded making it either really hard or really easy to receive a fair grade based on your TF with no room for appeal",
                "This course had extremely exciting lectures, but simply too much writing to not be considered a WR credit.",
                "the content was very interesting. i loved the course. the tests were a little hard for me but overall the writing assignments were very interesting.",
                "Because there is no curve, yet it is such a large lecture, the grading is pretty hard. I felt some of my assignments were graded very hard and that it was hard to get a good grade. I am very good at psychology and am a cognitive science major so this kind of material comes naturally to me, and I felt the grading was nitpicky. The tests are fair but hard to ace, so an A is more difficult than necessary for an intro class.",
                "Exams being a big chunk of the grade made things overwhelming. Also the abundance of readings.",
                "lecture was too big and there was no room for engagement.",
                "The course does a good job in specificity but honestly sometimes I questioned that conclusions presented from some of the studies."

                "Yes; it provides a good introduction to psychology in an interesting way. The lectures are well organized and the slides are helpful. If you show up to class and pay attention, you can do well on the exams with minimal studying.",
                "Only if you're good at memorization -- I am not and it was pretty frustrating since the writing assignments barely carried any weight. I thought I understood concepts well, and found the tests pretty confusing.",
                "Yes, but only if they are interested in psychology",
                "This class was your basic introductory Psychology class. I appreciated how enthusiastic the professor was and how she put the main points we had to grasp at the end of each lecture on a slide. However, I felt like the teaching fellows were not the best at providing feedback; they often docked points for citation errors (?) and such without fully explaining why. Feedback on exams was also non-existent, making it difficult to know where to improve. You got the grade but you are never told what you missed explicitly. The good thing about this class is that all of the exams were non-cumulative.",
                "Yes! This was the course that made me realize I would probably major in psychology or something related. I consistently showed up to this class even though the slides were absolutely clear enough for a sick person to walk themselves through the material.",
                "Yes it's an interesting course that gives you a lot of basic understanding of psychology",
                "I would recommend this course to another student with the stipulation that the work load is a lot higher than other courses I've taken so far.",
                "Yes, it is a fun course but a lot of work",
                "It is an amazing class. Made me want to major in Psychology and take more classes in it. This is a must take while at Yale",
                "Yes. good knowledge to know. Helpful if you're pre med for the MCAT",
                "No",
                "Hard to get high grades",
                "No",
                "No, not unless they were considering psychology as a major. It's just not as interesting as most of the other courses I have taken at Yale, since it is an introductory course that pretty much just gives a broad overview.",
                "Yes. If you're looking for an interesting course to broaden your schedule (and a class that isn't such high workload), this is a great option. It covers a wide variety of topics, all of which are super interesting even if you have zero psychology experience and zero interest in becoming a psychology major. Professor Lazzaro is also an incredible lecturer, maybe the best I've ever hadso if you have the opportunity to take this class with her, you should. The workload isn't zerothere are multiple essays/5-page research papers throughout the semester, in addition to three midterms that you will have to study for if you want to do well. However, for an interesting class with a manageable workload, this is a great option.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student looking for a low-stress social science credit. I would not consider this course a gut, but if you put in enough time to learn the concepts, you will most likely be guaranteed a good grade. Professor Lazzaro's lectures are quite engaging and the topics are fun, since she simply just chooses whichever ones are most interesting to her. In this way, you won't be following a traditional textbook-style lecture. You will have to attend lecture because they aren't recorded, but the content is pretty interesting, in my opinion.",
                "I would recommend this course only to people who have to take it for their major. It is an incredibly boring course, and I do not recommend this class as a social science credit because it is boring and fully dependent on your TA.",
                "I took this course because I need it for pre-med requirements, and I'm sure that's the reason a lot of other students were in there as well. If you need this course for your major or pre-med, sure. It's a great course that teaches fun information and is not very difficult workload or exam wise. However, if you are interested in psychology or want something beyond a broad scope of information, take a higher level psych class.",
                "Yes, very good lecturer and interesting information",
                "Kind of a social science gut if you are willing to cram a little bit before exams and go to class (the slides arent super helpful by themselves)",
                "yes ! good intro info",
                "Yes. As described above, this course opened my eyes to human behavior, and everyday I can't help but notice the patterns and reasoning behind every action I witness as well as those I take myself. I also think that this course could potentially be an eye opener to some people struggling with mental illness and anxiety, as oftentimes they might not even realize how real their struggles truly are, and how there are real ways to overcome these problems and lead happier lives.",
                "Yes, this is a fun and helpful course!",
                "Yes, class was very interesting",
                "yes, it is a good introduction to psychology course, interesting and engaging lectures, and instructor is a good teacher",
                "Lectures are interesting but you really have to work for an A. Not a gut.",
                "Yes this is a very fun class",
                "Yes, I think intro to psych is a class everyone should take and can benefit from. It allows you to understand yourself, the people around you, and our interactions with each other better.",
                "only if you are interested in psychology and willing to put in the work for it. \r\nthis course is  LOT of work (4 papers, 3 exams) for an introductory course and the grading is NOT super easy. With that being said, the professor Lazzaro was INCREDIBLE of a lecturer (i was always so engaged in each of the lectures) and I really did learn a lot of interesting psychology principles, how to review studies, and genreal useful skills.",
                "Yes! Good intro class. Not too difficult conceptually, but still very interesting to anyone who might want to learn a little psych.",
                "Note: if you've taken \"Intro to Cognitive Science\", I don't recommend Intro Psych. There's substantial overlap between the material.",
                "Yes, the lectures presented really cool topics, most of which were definitely applicable to our daily lives",
                "I would. I would caution that it was more work than perhaps initially anticipated, but overall enjoyable.",
                "The course wasn't time consuming, and the lectures were awesome. With that being said, I didn't find it to be a particularly deep learning experience. Probably good information to have been exposed to though, so if you have space/ have to, go for it.",
                "No. There are other more interesting psyc classes. You only get feedback on papers and that only counts for 29% of your grade. Also, Prof. Lazzaro is mean, in my opinion.",
                "Yes, it was a good overview of psychology concepts and allowed me to build understanding of the way our minds work.",
                "If youre unfamiliar but interested or if you want to pursue the major. If you already know quite a few ideas in psychology then this wont break much new ground.",
                "Probably not unless you need to take it. I wanted to take this class to learn about the field of psychology and although I feel like I did a bit, I think it could have been much more engaging",
                "Yes - it is a very good introduction in both breadth and depth.",
                "If the content sounds interesting to you, then yes! Be aware that the exams involve memorizing a lot of random facts.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in psychology. Its a great starting point.",
                "Yes if they are interested in psych",
                "Not really, take Introduction to Cognitive Science instead!",
                "Absolutely, if they want to dabble in psych",
                "Fun and a relatively relaxed social science credit. Be prepared to put work in to do well, but it is an enjoyable class",
                "Yes! This is a wonderful course if it is required for your major, or if you are simply looking to explore diverse course offerings. It is incredibly engaging, the workload is manageable, and the payoff is immense.",
                "I would recommend if you are interested in psychology and potentially surrounding majors - this will provide good insight as to what other courses in the field may look like.",
                "I would recommend only for students who are considering a psychology major.",
                "The lessons are extremely well structured and follow a logical ordering. The teacher seems very engaged in the subject as well.",
                "Yes especially if Lazzaro is teaching it.",
                "Yes! Stephanie is an incredibly engaging lecturer.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I feel like I now have a better understanding of myself and other people.",
                "no, grading is really strict",
                "I would but know that it is not a gut, and it'll take work to get an A",
                "I would! I thought it was very interesting and I learned a lot of worthwhile knowledge.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this course! It's a lot of fun and a really approachable intro to psychology, though there is a lot of information to remember for the exams.",
                "Not really, I didn't think it was that interesting. However it is a pre-req for a lot of other classes and I also have taken a few psyc classes before, so maybe I was just annoyed by the repeating of info.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The material presented in lectures was very interesting and there were too many or any super long assignments that were worth a large portion of the grade.",
                "Yes. The lectures were very interesting and I thought Professor Lazzaro was an amazing professor. This course was well structured. I felt that no lecture was ever incredibly boring. Do keep in mind that this class is NOT A GUT. You have to be careful with how you study for the three exams. They are not easy and require a careful studying plan in order to memorize all the material we are given. The essays are also time-consuming and follow a very strict grading rubric. Messing up on one assignment in the course may greatly hinder your chances of getting an A in this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about the current topics in psychology and gain practice writing research reviews and research proposals.",
                "No, this class was not enjoyable.",
                "I would recommend this course if youre looking for an introductory psychology class.",
                "I would recommend this course to every student because it helped me better understand my own behaviors and tendencies.",
                "Yes. I greatly enjoyed this class and Professor Lazzaro provided a fascinating and exciting learning environment for the class.",
                "Yes - Professor Lazzaro is amazing",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they need it for their major or another requirement. It is well taught and the grading is fair. Be prepared to spend a good amount of time on the written assignments. I think you gain a broad understanding of many topics, but if deciding to take this or another social science credit, it might be more interesting to take a class focused more on one specific topic.",
                "You probably need to take it at some point. I recommend memorizing the slides and readings.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student looking to truly know more about psychology, but not if they already have a heavy workload.",
                "yes if psychology is interesting to you.",
                "Yes it is very interesting material that is good to know",
                "Yes, if you are a psychology major.",
