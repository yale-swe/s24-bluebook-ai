    "The basic knowledge of American politics.",
    "A very clear and systematic understanding of American politics, American political history, and useful cognitive tools for current events.",
    "I learned about the fundamental structure of American political institutions such as the House and the Senate. Furthermore, we learned how to analyze political journals and studies written by prominent professors such as Ansolabehere. I think the value of the course lies in the way we were challenged outside of the classroom",
    "Learned a lot about the development of American politics.",
    "1. How to understand political science articles and logically interpret them \r\n2. How to analyze electoral votes results\r\n3. How to respect people \r\n4. How to understand different kinds of policy"

   "comments": [
    "Overall, it was great.",
    "The course is taught in a very accessible manner, allowing students with all degrees of prior knowledge in American politics to learn and participate efficiently.",
    "I think the course was really good. But in terms of weaknesses I think the only thing was that extra reading was cancelled halfway through due to the course load, and I really enjoyed reading outside of the syllabus and being able to discuss them during class.",
    "The course offered an extremely comprehensive outline of American politics.",
    "Strengths:\r\n1. Professor Turner helps all students to better understand the course.\r\n2. Every one in the class was engaged and willing to study more.\r\n3. The quiz before every class is helpful for preview and review.\r\n4. The articles assigned by our professor is helpful for understanding our textbook and knowledge.\r\nWeakness:\r\nUnfortunately, there is no weakness for this course."

   "comments": [
    "For any prospective political science students or students simply interested in American politics, I strongly recommend this class. It provides a comprehensive outlook and background while prompting students to form their own understandings on the philosophical aspects of U.S political subjects.",
    "Yes. The course is very interesting, I have learned a lot from it, and professor Turner is very helpful.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student. I think that the course fills in details that a student that has taken AP govt or something similar abroad and provides important information on the way the government functions. The extra reading provided earlier also allows us to see the practical application of the knowledge learned in a real-life context.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course not only to students interested in American politics but also to those who are interested in learning about decision making and collective action within a democracy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to all students regardless whether they major in political science or not. This course could help students to better read social and political science articles, enjoy in-class activities and communication, and connect US history with politics to better understand politics."
