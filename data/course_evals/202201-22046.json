                "Strenghts: great topics on biology and our world, was nice that the lecture speakers altered to keep the course fresh.\r\nWeaknesses: some material was hard considering this is a bio class for non-stem majors. I'm especially talking about Professor Paulsen's lectures where we covered the nervous system.",
                "The weaknesses of this course are too far and in between to describe in the space I have here, but I will try. Biology, the World and Us is not only the worst class in the MCB&D/MBB department, but by far, without question, the worst class offered at Yale College altogether. The professors and guest lecturers make science and biology seem like the most flaccid, unappealing topic in the world. Then, after droning on for 50 minutes twice a week, they make you dissect the most intricate topics that they didn't even scratch on during class. The weakness of this course can only be improved if the class was canceled.",
                "Strengths: lectures are easy to follow, and there are no weekly assignments. Weaknesses: it is very hard to foresee what will be on the exams.",
                "The course was not perfectly organized, but I understand that it was the first time taught in this format.",
                "Strength was probably section because of my TF.",
                "Strengths - Topics and lectures were interesting, like the variety of teachers, discussion section was fun\r\nWeaknesses - Some teachers were better than others, tests questions were kind of odd sometimes",
                "It's a worthwhile science gut that doesn't require too much brainpower. You won't have fun, but it won't be too painful either.",
                "Ended up being far more difficult than I had expected. Tests were very hard. Material was interesting at times. Section felt very unnecessary/unrelated to the class.",
                "Strengths: Very useful knowledge of biology and would always connect it to its relevance to the world right now.",
                "This course engages students in a variety of interesting topics within science. The TAs are incredibly helpful and the sections help to further connect biology and the world. The weakness of this course, however, was the amount of information that was covered on the tests and in lectures. We did not fully explore the concepts we were tested on, which made it extremely difficult to prepare for tests.",
                "The main strength is that the lecturers change. It is good because it means that you don't get bored so much. A weakness would be the random nature of the exam questions. Some of the questions are so strange and not really related to what we had learned.",
                "Strengths: The subject matter is very interesting and engaging! Most of the lectures were very good, and discussion section is not necessarily another lecture. Lectures and exams are typically non-cumulative. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While typically at a more elementary level, some of the lectures could be much more technical than others. Studying for the exams was at times difficult, since the lectures aren't really cumulative/string together. Also, I didn't really feel prepared to read lots of scientific studies in advance for the final paper, which requires citing journal articles that can be incredibly specific and involve a learning curve on the subject matter, depending on topic.",
                "The TFs and the professors don't seem to communicate enough so different sections will learn different things and whether or not the exam reviews will be helpful tends to be up in the air.",
                "Good content",
                "The course is designed around biweekly lectures and we have three tests. Sometimes, the connection between the lectures and test material wasn't the most clear and testing grading could be inconsistent. Also, the discussion sections could be more oriented to what the class was covering.",
                "Strengths: I liked the rotation of lecturers to keep things fresh; I appreciate the emphasis on mostly relevant material to us as non-bio and mostly non-stem majors and felt as though I actually learned a lot about topics that are interesting, but that I never would been exposed to otherwise\r\n\r\nWeakness: This course is surprisingly difficult - you do have to work very hard if you want to do well and even then its uncertain; on the last point, I would not say that this course is intellectually very challenging (it is to an extent, but that wasnt the main difficulty), the main challenge wa the way the class was set up - I dont feel like the three midterms were at all very fair and they seemed unnecessarily difficult and stressful.",
                "I think the course was fine. Only thing I remember being frustrated by was that it wasn't clear what information we needed to have memorized (such as full names of proteins and chemicals).",
                "i liked how the units were split up through different lecturers it was nice to hear from multiple people",
                "This class is horribly organized, the content is not well explained, and the level of the content is way above a course meant for non science majors",
                "It seemed from the beginning that it was assumed everyone in the class took AP biology before; there were things I was pretty unaware of all throughout the course that were for the most part presented as prerequisite knowledge. I felt that the tests did not at all reflect the course material or lectures; the lectures were extremely focused on the societal impacts of certain biological topics, while tests required explanation of the science, diagram drawings, etc. I think the courses biggest strength was discussion section. I felt very engaged in this setting and felt like my TA cared a lot about what we learned; most of the material I remember and continue to reflect on was from discussion section.",
                "I think that the course could be advertised better in that the tests are very challenging.",
                "Strengths: section discussion time\r\nWeakness: multiple professors, felt disorganized and lack of cohesion",
                "The strengths of this course for me were the Experience Science section and the useful review sessions before exams.",

                "The strength is the range of content. The weakness are teachers teaching the course with heavy terminology and concepts that were somehow expected to know in an intro/lower level course. Which made it extremely difficult to comprehend and when you asked questions they were also explained in terminology. The professors are extremely talented and smart. The explanations just lacked.",
                "Strengths - lectures were recorded, slides were informative, review sessions were helpful\r\nWeaknesses- felt like it got too technical for a non-STEM major course at times. Some of the material was very hard to grasp and not explained very well.",
                "More clarity over what kinds of questions will be on exams (specifically, telling us whether or not we should know how to draw things). Also, some of the lecturers could be more engaging.",

                "The lectures are very interesting but they are also long, and there is just a lot of information packed into each one. There arent many assignments that count towards your grade which can be both good and bad.",
                "The review sessions were often too close to the exam itself. Additionally more practice tests would have been useful for studying.",
                "strengths- lecturers, variety of topics",
                "Lectures can be more explanatory. Hard to go back and review.",
                "Not time consuming and easy to know what to do to get a good grade. Not very interesting content or engaging lecturers",
                "The strengths were that there were multiple professors teaching, but that was also a weakness because some of the professors were much better than others.",
                "The course is pretty monotonous, just reading off of lecture slides gets you all the information you need.",
                "Strengths: Engelman clearly has the course well organized. When the lecture topic is interesting, the class can be a cool way to destress and learn something interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Often though, the lectures were not interesting. The problem was the level of detail on the science I felt we spent way too much time on the scientific functions \"the bio\" and not enough on the actually applicable \"the world and us.\" To be honest, if you're in that class you are not a Science person. So learning exactly how drugs interact with the neurons is probably far less useful than learning about the health implications of drug addiction, for example.",
                "Strengths are the topics covered, the selection covered pretty much every socially/politically important topic. Weakness was that some of the lectures were really fast paced and brushed over some more difficult topics.",
                "It was interesting but the lectures were very disconnected from the class itself. If there were more opportunities to connect the class to section, I think I would do better on tests.",
                "The course covered interesting material and explored relevant topics. However, due to the variation among professors, certain lectures would be filled with details that later proved unnecessary and others would gloss over topics that could have been further explained. This is more an issue of the exams, which seemed to change in variety of content covered alongside topic.",
                "I liked the structure, could be simplified at times and better idea of what tests look like",
                "Lecturers went a little fast sometimes! Other than that all good, section was really interesting",
                "It touches on a wide variety of topics that are relevant to everyday life and major political and social issues.",
                "The lectures are fine and section was fun. The tests are somewhat hard because you have to memorize a lot.",
                "Strengths: low work level, high applicability \r\nWeaknesses: lack of connection between sections and lecture",
                "I am not a science person, but I found this course to be surprisingly interesting for an easy science requirement filler. The lecturers were talented and the topics were fascinating. The workload was low which made the class low stress and enjoyable. Some weaknesses were that the professors needed to better coordinate their lectures with each other, and the TFs needed to coordinate the section content with the lectures better. The content was all over the place and often repeated throughout the year. Also, the style of lecture and test questions changed significantly from professor to professor, leading to some adjustment periods. I liked my section TF and he chose good content, but the section was often very dry since many students didn't care to contribute much.",
                "It should be better suited to student learning.",
                "Strengths: TFs and their help \r\n\r\nWeakness: slide layout can be confusing",
                "Great lectures",
                "I think it might have been helpful to have a few more ways to be evaluated outside of the exams and final essay.",
                "I think it would be very helpful if some of the lecture slides/notes for the class was a bit more consistent across the lectures from different professors. For some professors, the slides were such that it was easy to pick out relevant information, whereas for others not so much. This made it challenging when studying for the exams. I also think it would be nice to have TAs who were a little bit more engaging and seemed like they at least wanted to be there a little bit, especially during the exam review sessions, which were often incredibly rushed to the point of not being useful.",

                "Strength of the course is that low courselosd and weakness is that there are no psets but the tests are very hard",
                "One strength of this course is the wide variety of material, so you don't have to go beyond a surface level knowledge of specific topics. In addition, the section structure of the course is nice because the sections cover discussions on themes related to the topic, not the topics themselves. Therefore, it feels much easier to participate in section. \r\nOne disadvantage of the course is the make-up exam structure; if you miss one of the exams, you have to make it up the last week of classes, during the same week as the third exam. It's a lot of material to cover in such a short period of time.",
                "Sections were good. Review material wasnt great.",
                "The course is a gut, but well-developed in the sense that I actually felt engaged and learned a lot. I was even able to correct a science major on something related to neuron energy transfer, which is pretty cool.",
                "Strengths- the different lectures made for a good change of pace during the class periods. Each brought different teaching styles and they were all experts in their fields. \r\nWeakness- sometimes there were a lot of complicated details on the slides that were hardly explained and never tested. Also, some lecturers made me sleepy.",
                "This course is a typical lecture course. I particularly enjoyed the different lecturers because it created a change of pace and made it easier to retain information.",
                "I liked the material. I think it could be improved by making it less technical in lecture and focusing more on real world applications in lecture.",
                "The strengths are that all the information was given clearly through the lectures\r\nThe weakness was probably review sessions.",
                "Great lecturers, good asynchronous materials, and helpful discussion sections.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- TA was great\r\n- clear\r\n- minimum homework\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- not all profs the same\r\n- not enough practice material",
                "It would be helpful to have more preparation for the exams, other than one review session. Sometimes slides and lectures were hard to follow, and though I really enjoyed section, it might help to have some days where we went through the material in more detail.",
                "I found that the lack of review of lecture material in section made the course feel disconnected and did not offer as much student support as it had the opportunity to in a smaller group setting. I did appreciate the class' more wholistic view of science in the real world, which felt more approachable to non-science majors that this course was especially tailored for. I most enjoyed the final research paper and its open-ended application to the materials we had studied in the course.",

On a serious note, this class is unnecessarily challenging despite the catfish of the easy syllabus. Please, trust me, there are better science credits out there for my fellow non-stem majors.",

The only real \"work\" that you need to put into the class is studying for the exams (three, non-cumulative) about two days in advance. If you can, try to sign up for the \"experience section.\" We got to go on some interesting field trips and conduct a few experiments that other sections did not have a chance to participate in. These section experiences were probably the most interesting part of the course.",

                "Yes and no - as a non-stem major I think this was a good choice for finding a class with interesting material. But keep in mind, it is NOT a gut. Its not an insanely difficult class, but you will have to work hard to do well.\r\n\r\nIf you do take this course, TAKE THE EXPERIENCE SCIENCE SECTION. I took it randomly (didnt even know it was an option), but it truly was the highlight of the class. We got to do a number of cool things that no other section got to do, like see a lab, see behind the scenes at the Peabody museum, and see a room full of human brains, among other things.

I feel like this course did not succeed in being a gateway for humanities majors into science like the course description said. I feel like I gained very little from this course, but I loved my discussion section. I think the tests did not reflect lecture material and were far too focused on scientific processes rather than real world examples, impact on society, etc like the lectures were.",

                "Definitely worthwhile to take this class, it's incredibly worthwhile to be conversant in basic science which this course achieves. It is also great to learn about the science going on at Yale and get to hear lectures from so many different professors. The workload is fairly light, you just need to study the lecture content well for the 3 exams.",

The level of detail works well for students in the humanities/social sciences as it does not expect prior knowledge but goes sufficiently deep as to explain the topics well. I would note that, despite the lack of problem sets, the three exams and final paper create an inconsistent but substantial workload.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It is an interesting course that provides some basic biology knowledge if you are someone who knows little about science and doesn't plan on taking higher-level science courses. The workload is low overall, but the tests do require careful studying. Also section can be kind of boring and dry, but it is what you make of it.",
                "If you need a gut science, perhaps. But even then, it requires serious studying for exams.",
                "This class was harder than I thought it would be, so maybe not to other students who struggle with science like I do",
                "Yes. Very interesting",
                "I would recommend it. It was an interesting way to learn about the science of many topics without being overwhelmed, especially as a non science major.",
                "I think this is the default gutty science credit for non-STEM folks, when it really doesn't have to be. There are a lot of other great courses out there if you do some digging and just because a science course has lower workload does not necessarily mean it will definitely be easierat least conceptually.",
                "if you need a science credit and are a non science student i recommend",

                "Depends, if you are looking for a generally easy Science credit, then no.",
                "No because the class is hard without psets",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they're looking for a Science credit, but might be willing to put a little bit more work in. Having a background such as AP Bio is a plus.",
                "Yes. Good course with lower workload",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who has a basic understanding of high school biology, is looking for a gut, and wants to learn something.",
                "Pretty easy science class. Would recommend",
                "I would recommend it if you need a science credit but aren't a science person. The tests arent too bad if you go to the review sessions and there is almost no work besides the final paper and the sections.",
                "I would recommend this course because the content was so impactful. The content will serve any student well in everyday life.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this to someone who isn't a stem major who needs a science credit.",
                "Yes, because this course taught me a lot about biology and gave me information that I could use in the future.",
                "Yes, it was a very good study of biology.",
                "Yes! For a non-science major, it was an informative intro to biology course. The TAs were great, and it was fun to discuss in section.",
                "I recommend this course to non-STEM majors heavily. It fulfills a science requirement and is not too taxing. It also gives you a good understanding of science topics that are likely to be relevant in your life."
