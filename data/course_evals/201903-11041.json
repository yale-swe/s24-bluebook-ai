    "The title of the course sums it up pretty well: we learned about the atmosphere, ocean, and climate change. We used basic physics to analyze these systems.",
    "A better understanding of our climate systems and how they work.",
    "I learned so much about the atmosphere, weather, ocean circulation, climate change, and global patterns. I gained the ability to explain phenomena that I experience every day. This was such a great class!! We learned about stuff that was very cool to learn about.",
    "Learned about the atmosphere, currents, the ocean, the ozone layer.",
    "I really learned a lot of applicable information.",
    "I learned that there are multiple ways to describe what we see. In this course, we looked at atmospheric principles from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective. For example, when we discussed what gases make up an atmosphere, we looked at the mathematical calculation of the escape velocity, the velocity a gas molecule needs to escape an atmosphere, and how the makeup of an atmosphere can lead to the greenhouse effect. Each physical phenomena we discussed had both sides explained, and I felt that that was a very worthwhile approach to understanding how the atmosphere and oceans function and influence each other. I learned some seemingly random facts, like the different types of clouds, but I also learned that each seemingly random aspect of our planet is the outcome of a physical process we can describe and quantify. Being able to understand this helps me understand how models can be made for weather\/climate prediction, as well as how they can possibly be improved.",
    "You gain a basic, introductory understanding of the major themes\/topics of atmospheric science. For example, this course is really great if you want to get a basic understanding of how climate change works, and why it impacts different parts of weather systems, etc.",
    "I have always been interested in global systems and I feel like I have a strong foundation of those processes now.",
    "As an EVST BA, I really enjoyed this class for the technical knowledge it gave me about atmospeheric movements and climate change. I didnt realize how much I didnt know about the scientific mechanisms of climate change.",
    "Gained a good overview of earth processes that can serve as a foundation for future learning.",
    "A basic understanding of meteorology, oceanography, paleoclimate, and climate sciences.",
    "I learned to identify different clouds, the major ocean currents, how thermal energy from the Sun drives the global climate system, the composition of Earth's atmosphere. Major insight was that climate science is showing some really scary changes already, especially the melting Arctic sea ice.",
    "I learned a lot of the needed fundamental concepts of how our climate and atmosphere works. It has taught me a lot about the oceans, atmospheres, and how the interactions of both create our climate now and in the past."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Explanations by professors often lacked enough information for thorough understanding by students.",
    "Strengths: Prof Smith and Lora were both excellent, and clearly passionate about the material. Course was well organized for learning; problem sets were not too hard and exams were fair (except sometimes much too long). I also loved the in class demonstrates of the phenomena we were studying.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The powerpoint\/lecture structure repeated three times a week over and over was very redundant by the end of the semester. I wish there was an opportunity for a lab component associated with this class, or more in class demonstrations of the material.",
    "It was great to have two professors with two perspectives and expertise on the same subject. However, there were too many concepts being squeezed into too little time and we weren't able to go into depth in many of the subjects studied which its this course's greatest fault",
    "The grading of midterms is very harsh, most of the questions are worth the same amount of points even though some were complex calculations and others were one sentence answers, it was very easy to drop a lot of marks on the midterms",
    "The PSETs are valuable and I thought that the class really succeeded in teaching largely quantitative concepts with no math requirement. However, the tests were much harder than the PSETs, and points were taken off very aggressively for small mistakes. Essentially, a greater level of detail was required in the exams than in the PSETs. The lecturing style was also hard to follow and Prof Smith followed a 'I'm going to go fast and you need to ask me if you have questions', but often would not notice that a student had their hand raised, or would poorly explain what had just been a question about following the math he had on the board. I felt this class was improved by the addition of Prof Lora and having four different people with office hours available.",
    "I loved how the information presented was always backed up by data and figures; this made what was presented reliable and helped me see how data collection can help lead to some of the conclusions made. The lectures were all very interesting and organized, but I feel like the course could be improved by including some way to summarize\/list the main concepts we have to understand for each lecture; the information seemed to pile up and it was difficult to make sure I was covering everything. In addition, maybe there could be more practice problems worked into the lectures to encourage more participation from students in class, or a group project\/presentation so students could have an easier time getting to know one another in the class.",
    "strengths: the course content was very interesting and the help offered during office hours was very good. its not terribly hard information to understand \r\n\r\nweaknesses: there arent many resources offered like practice tests or answer keys.",
    "For the most part it's a very clear course and both professors are good lecturers. The professors were able to create an environment where students felt they could ask questions and participate during lecture, which was really great and I think helped keep the class active.\r\nAt times, the content felt very disjointed and sometimes a little vague (especially the ocean and ice units). I think some of the units would benefit from more structure and detail. The initial atmospheres unit was great because it was organized around key ideas that wove all of its details (from the qualitative to the quantitative) together. And the p-sets really complimented the lectures and reinforced the ideas the professors thought were central. But other units, such as the oceans and ice ones, felt more just like definitions being thrown together. \r\nIt wasn't clear how much the professors wanted students to take from the textbook. They insisted on students getting the textbook but then could not really tell you what readings you should be doing to keep up with the course. The textbook also approaches a lot of the topics from a very different level of detail and focus. Also, the textbook does not cover the math part of the course, which is probably the part that would most benefit from having secondary material. The textbook also does not cover much of the oceans, ice and paleo-climate units (which is roughly half the course) so it's kind of not very helpful in that sense. \r\nThe math is really fine, and for the most part, it is very clearly explained in lecture. The professors do a good job of keeping the course accessible to students from all math\/physics backgrounds, which is great for a science course. Yet, I think in some cases, some of the math would benefit from more context so it's not just formulas floating around. This would help students understand where it is coming from and how to apply it better, I think, instead of just memorising when to pull each equation down, which can get very confusing.\r\nOverall, this is a good introductory class to a lot of themes. I think a definite strength of this class was the fact that it was co-taught.",
    "I think this course achieves its goals very well. Having a stronger external resource than the text book could be useful for review.",
    "The strengths of the course are the balance between qualitative and quantitive knowledge. We did the math behind things, but we also learned what that math meant. The PSets are very manageable and related to what we learned in class. A weakness is that the class goes at rapidly different paces from day to day, which makes it hard to follow from time to time.",
    "The course covers a lot of material effectively. The reinforcement of the material through homework could have been more engaging as it seemed as though we weren't close to working on any kinds of problems that those who work with this kind of material would come across. The homework was much more memorization than anything else. More thorough engagement would look like quantifying more of what we worked on.",
    "Strengths: great sampling of topics covered and accessible professors\/TAs.\r\nWeaknesses: unable to dive into material in more detail",
    "The class was very fair. Materials were available and helpful, including online lectures and practice exams. Profs. Smith and Lora encouraged students to ask questions, which I really appreciated. Only weakness was that some of the slides are now >6 years old and could be updated.",
    "I believe a strength of the course were the lectures. I felt they were easy to follow and provided a lot of information that the tests followed with. The course was well designed to allow learning in steps to happen to see the more complicated comparisons and connections."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. I took this course because I was interested in the Energy Studies program, and now I am firmly committed to the program and plan on taking several similar classes in the future. This class ended up exceeding all of my expectations for what I though an intro G&G class would look like. I think everyone should take a class like this. We should all know how our world works.",
    "Yes, but know its not a gut Sc credit",
    "Highly recommend to anyone who is interested in physical\/earth systems and wants to learn more about this stuff! I think it's a class that anyone could really appreciate and get a lot out of. Especially recommend if Ron is still teaching it.",
    "Yes, if your interested in the topic but the midterms are kinda hard",
    "If you are looking for an Environmental Studies BA science credit, or a more fun QR this is a good course. I thought that the material I learned was valuable and I will hold onto it in the rest of my EVST classes. There isn't too much work and if you have a friend in the class the PSETs are very manageable. However, the exams are graded harshly and I did not get an A in the class when I had expected to. You may end up having to study for this class a lot more than you would have otherwise expected, but I think it is worth it.",
    "Yes, it was definitely a very interesting sc\/qr credit.",
    "I would recommend this course if the student was genuinely interested in atmospheric science and especially the math involved. Description wise, if someone has a background in environmental science, the concepts will mostly not be new, but the math likely will be. If a student is looking for something more hands-on, this is probably not the right course, but I enjoyed the conceptual look at each of the topics and how atmospheric and oceanic science fit together. If a student is looking for a rigorous course on climate change, this is not the course, as climate change is not mentioned much until the final two or three lectures.",
    "It's a good introductory class to take if you want a general idea of climate\/atmospheric science and are not planning on majoring in something related to that.",
    "Ya I absolutely would recommend this class because I think it is an engaging QR credit.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to someone looking for a QR\/Sc credit, particularly EVST majors. The content was much more relevant to other courses in the major that I initially thought it would be. It feels like a real science class (not a gut) but can be taken without a lot of science background.",
    "Yes, I think that the course is effectively taught and the concepts are not only important but interesting.",
    "Yes, the material covered is important and relevant.",
    "For most, this is N\/A because the course is a major requirement.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course as it has applications to everyday life and anything to do with the environment that surrounds us."
