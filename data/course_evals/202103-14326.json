                "How to inquire better. What types of questions to ask when looking at the premises an author makes. Different philosophical viewpoints (namely Platonic vs Aristotelean views)",
                "In this course I gained an introductory understanding of ancient and medieval philosophy, and learned how to write a philosophical essay.",
                "I learned a lot about ancient philosophy and the foundations of philosophical thinking. I learned Plato and Aristotle's views on the world, arguments about the gods, death, and the world. I also learned a lot of theology. I came in knowing nothing about philosophy and this class taught me a lot.",
                "By taking this course, I learned of the foundational thinkers for Philosophy, and the topics they addressed around ethics, happiness, and the like. We learned about Aristotle, Plato, Maimonedes, etc. and gained a better understanding if the structure of Philosophy. I also learned how to write a Philosophy Essay and how to analyze the argument of an author and challenge/support it.",
                "This course helped me develop an understanding of the landscape of Greco-Roman and Medieval philosophy. I learned to appreciate the central questions of ancient philosophy and the different approaches to answering those questions. I also learned how to write a philosophy paper and carefully analyze and evaluate a philosophical argument.",
                "I gained a strong foundation in ancient philosophy and learned the basics of how to construct a philosophical argument or challenge someone else's.",
                "I had never taken a philosophy course prior to this one, so I was really starting from scratch. I learned how to close read a philosophy text, and how to annotate one/what to look for. I learned how to track philosophical arguments in the margins, and over time got better at understanding the denser texts like Aristotle. Before starting the course, I was nervous about critiquing the philosophers' arguments. The only Ancient Greek philosophy text I had read was Plato's Symposium, and I didn't feel like I would be able to find flaws in the arguments of such great thinkers going into the course. Over time, I felt more confident in finding logical flaws because I learned about how to really think through the jumps of each step and how to examine whether the conclusion really followed from the premises. I had also never written a philosophy paper before, so I learned how to properly structure one, how to write a successful exegesis, and how to make a formal argument either in support of the philosopher's argument or a refutation against it."

            "comments": [
                "I wish there was more specificity regarding the assigned reading. What passages should we focus on? What points are significant? Knowing this before sifting through a hundred pages gives more purpose to our assignments.",
                "Strengths: very fun, enjoyed the discourse, liked how people bounced ideas off of one another and brought up interesting directions for the conversations to go in\r\nWeakness: sometime  we couldn't dig too deep into some of the ideas of a writer",
                "I really enjoyed the class discussions, but especially during the first few weeks, the class felt unnecessarily intimidating.",
                "The strengths are many, Professor Szabo is very good at structuring his class to guide us through the important points of the text while fostering great class discussions. The weakness might be that they assign more of the readings than we actually end up talking about and the readings are extremely dense so it would be more helpful if they could be more specific in what they want us to focus on.",
                "The content we needed to learn for this course was clear, as well as the expectations. One weakness would be writing support. A few students had never written a Philosophy essay before, and so I believe it would be beneficial to have writing workshops for Philosophy.",
                "Sometimes I felt like there was a disconnect between the text and the discussion. I loved the discussions, but it was frustrating that I felt like I did a lot of reading which didn't end up being so relevant. Narrowing the focus of the reading in some sections could be useful.",
                "Strengths: the small format made it easier to take risks in class and delve into the weeds of the arguments. Weaknesses: Prof. Szabo does not explain things clearly--you can never get a straight answer out of him. This is usually fine considering the nuance in the arguments, but for some concepts I just needed more clear guidance than he offered.",
                "Discussions of readings where a bit surface level because we go through texts so quickly and dont have time in lessons grasp the underlying philosophical context or dont know which ones we should be looking for while reading the texts initially. Because we are focusing on the texts themselves rather than the modern debates among contemporary philosophers about the philosophical themes about which the texts are written, discussions cant be fully developed.",
                "I thought one of the strengths of the course was the environment my professor fostered in our seminar. The class really felt like a bonded group, and I felt very comfortable participating. I like how we critiqued the texts as a group, and that my peers respectfully responded to one another. Often times I would bring up a point that another classmate questioned, and from that dialogue I was able to hone my thinking and come to a more nuanced/thoughtful conclusion about a text. I loved how my professor invited us all to not only engage with the text, but share our own perspective on the topics we discussed. For example, our discussion about Euthyphro turned into a discussion about what it means to define a word, allowing us to conduct our own philosophizing. This was a course that every class, I left and felt like my previous views of the world no longer seemed quite so simple. I really loved it. The one weakness of the course I thought was in the design of the Syllabus. I don't think we needed to discuss Republic in both philosophy and H&P for as long as we did because our H&P discussions (which came after our philosophy ones) felt quite repetitive. Furthermore, I think it was too much to assign Epictetus, Epicurus, Seneca, and Lucretius all in one week. The reading load itself felt manageable that week, but there was simply not enough class time to give each philosopher's lofty idea its due (even if the readings were short i.e. Seneca, the discussion of the idea certainly is not!). That is why I really appreciated how responsive my professor was to providing us additional class time to discuss some of the philosophers whose ideas the class felt we had glossed over due to not having enough time that week. One other weakness of the course (and not just this course, but of DS in general) is that there should be an assignment where students actually edit one of their paper drafts according to the feedback given. Otherwise it is difficult to learn from our mistakes if we are not allowed the chance to edit our papers, as each paper is so different from the previous one that it is at times difficult to implement feedback. At least one paper at the beginning of the year where we could turn in a first draft, receive feedback, and then edit in order to turn in a final draft, would be very helpful."

                "Yes. Directed Studies is intense, but the community is incredible. Although I'm dropping DS, I don't regret taking it for a semester (dropping for major-requirement related reasons).",
                "Yes. It was fun and I enjoyed thinking about a writer's ideas and breaking them down",
                "I would not recommend this course. I enjoyed the class environment for the most part, although it at times felt hostile. However, what made this course difficult was that I did not feel supported by the professor. I consistently went to office hours to ask for advice on how I could improve in the class or to ask for suggestions on an essay, but I rarely got a clear response.",
                "Yes, definitely. I'd recommend Professor Szabo's section and DS in general. It took me a while to warm up to philosophy especially since Aristotle can be a drag but Professor Szabo comes in every day with a list of the most important arguments in the reading and lets us work through them. The class is extremely well organized and we have great thought-provoking discussions. While I was originally skeptical about philosophy, I found myself thinking about what we talked about in class in my normal life and bringing it up to my non-DS friends.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially since the themes discussed are interesting. Many of the topics covered carry over to how we think today, and it is interesting to see how it has changed or remained the same. In addition, learning about foundational philosophical thinkers and how they influenced the era in which they lived in was very influential.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It really gives you an appreciation for the depth of thought in ancient philosophy and the importance of very basic questions about the best life, virtue, and knowledge.",
                "I recommend DS Philosophy to anyone interested, as long as you know what you are getting yourself into. Most of the semester is spent on Plato and Aristotle, and the readings are dense and difficult. It's fun to engage with the content if you are willing to wrestle with it and don't mind being proven wrong.",
                "Taking directed studies is a significant endeavor that makes up a quarter of your undergraduate experience. In particular, philosophy best represents the idea that if you are not entirely committed to the content, do not take the course. It can be both demanding and rewarding, but that depends on your interests and intentions when taking part in this program.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Professor Szabo is an incredible teacher and anyone at Yale would be lucky to take a class he led. Multiple students in the section told me that this class was their favorite DS course of the semester, and I also felt that philosophy in particular taught me to think critically in a way I never had before."
