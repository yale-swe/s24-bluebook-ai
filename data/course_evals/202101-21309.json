                "The live Q&A sections--particularly the practice problems, were essential for me to understand the course material.",
                "Strengths: The course is very well organized to facilitate student learning and the professor is always in constant communication with students about what can be expected to happen in class, on the exam, etc. It is very easy for a student to find help when needed through the plethora of resources available (optional class sessions, very frequent office hours and drop-in help sessions, lecture notes, pset solutions). The professor also makes an effort to get to know her students, and she is also a great teacher, explaining things very clearly and telling us what tips may be helpful when doing a particular type of math problem. She is very approachable and I've had many positive interactions with her.\r\nWeaknesses: None that come to mind.",
                "Cant think of weaknesses; Professor Bennett did everything she could to supplement learning during COVID. When I didnt do well on the second midterm, she reached out to me and helped me find resources to improve my learning experiences.",
                "I personally found myself having difficulty comprehending many of the concepts and applications taught in the course, but I think that of the options available for multivariable calculus, it's probably the strongest. Our professor was quite good; she worked actively to facilitate a sense of community among students despite our virtual semester, and she was proactive and timely with updates, information, and clarification. An interesting course made better by a very competent, education-focused, and caring professor. My one criticism is that I think it would have been helpful to work more with applications-based problems prior to the tests, and to spend less time on other, more rote-learning focused problems.",
                "Sometimes the pre-recorded lectures were monotonous, but overall it was good",
                "Professor Bennett is a great teacher. She listens to feedback. She made some helpful changes (like adding extra office hours) after we submitted mid-term feedback. The course is also organized and she provides great lecture notes.",
                "A strength of the course was the format of the course. It was nice to watch the prerecorded lectures and then have an opportunity to ask questions about the lectures and get more practice during the optional biweekly office hours. A weakness fo the course was the length of the lectures. The lectures were very long and difficult to get through.",
                "Professor Bennett was a very engaging lecturer! The recordings were fun to watch :). The only thing I would ask for is an in-person element, but that's definitely difficult now.",

                "Very organized course, concepts flowed and progression made sense in terms of content.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Bennett's amazing teaching, communication, and organization",
                "I think that the lack of virtual class was a weakness due to lack of structure. However, other than that the course is great and allows students to truly learn due to well recorded lectures.",
                "This course was very well organized and the content, while conceptually high-level, was broken up into manageable parts.",
                "I really appreciated the multiple office hours and peer tutor hours that were available for help. The recorded lectures were really long to do in one sitting but the concepts were explained clearly.",
                "I really enjoyed the recorded lectures. Being able to pause and rewatch sections that I didn't initially grasp was extremely helpful. The lecture notes and practice exams were also super useful.",
                "Very good feedback on homework and clear expectations. Extremely well-organized!",
                "Very well structured course with a great professor!",
                "The strengths of this class are clear explanations, very helpful lectures, plenty of guided examples, numerous office hours and drop-in help sessions, and resources like practice exams, lecture notes, and pset solutions. A weakness of this course is that the feedback and grading on the psets can be unclear as to how many points were taken off for a mistake and what the mistake was especially when the feedback was to look at the solutions and the solutions only had the answer with no math done.",
                "I wish that the class didn't use as much jargon and that the tests were more similar to pset problems. I never figured out the key to taking the tests, and since it was online, it was really hard to learn with the recorded lectures.",
                "so hard but so good.",
                "Excellent course, I cannot think of any improvements",
                "Strengths: the lectures were marvelously clear; I have never seen math explained so clearly and so effortlessly. Professor Bennett also took the time to meet her students and get to know them, despite the fact that we were all taking the course through a series of recorded lectures. Help was readily available for those who needed it, through TA office hours, QA sessions, and peer tutor help sessions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very few. I could not think of a better class to take if you are interested in mathematics or the sciences. Exams were tough, and the curve was not as generous ( I think partially because so many people had already seen the material in High School or other courses). However, the grading was straightforward and even someone like myself, who had never seen the material before, could succeed in the class.",
