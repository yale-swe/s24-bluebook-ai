   "comments": [
    "I learned how to use academic frameworks to better construct an argumentative\/investigative paper. I also greatly improved my writing style.",
    "Learned how the tragedy of the commons can be avoided, along with the role of science in politics. Guest speakers shed a lot of light on modern environmental politics. Also, lobsters are cool.",
    "I learned how to apply science to policy and how science can often misinform policy and create more problems than it intends to solve.",
    "Throughout this course, I learned a great deal about the writing process for policy work and also developed knowledge about democracy, environmental justice, science as ONE of the ways to form knowledge, and the implementation of the Colorado Senate Bill 181 through the IAD Framework.",
    "I became versed in the Institutional Analysis and Development framework for policy analysis. The focus of the course on common pool resource management through the study of real-world case studies.",
    "How to use IAD framework",
    "I learned how to analyze the patterns of behaviors when thinking about a policy issue. This class is rigorous and highly recommended for those looking to study public policy.",
    "Tons of them. I learned how to analyse a policy, together with the social context. I learned how important it is to analyse a case without sticking at the superficial stereotype. And with the guest speakers, I gradually got to know about how policy was produced.",
    "I learned about the Institutional Analysis and Development framework and its lessons for environmental policy design while gaining a deeper understanding of some of today's key environmental controversies. Most of this course's lessons came through specific case studies, but the techniques were broadly applicable. The readings and guest speakers provided excellent lessons in evaluating conflicting points of view to understand the assumptions and rhetorical strategies of each.",
    "Theory and cases of people acting in situations with rules.",
    "Learned about Polski and Ostrom's SES-IAD framework as well as Maine lobster fisheries."

   "comments": [
    "This is hands down one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Fotos is one of the best professors this university has.  He leads the seminar extremely well. His class is very well structured and every assignment has a purpose in cultivating our learning and overall enjoyment of the course.",
    "Strengths: Fotos is fantastic, readings are well chosen, and class discussion is great \r\nWeaknesses: some readings can be a little confusing, especially with the theory section at the start of the semester",
    "Strengths - Really interesting readings, good discussions led by the class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - A few classes felt like lectures, some people got off topic, when the guest speakers came I felt like some people continuously asked questions and others were not able to ask theirs, the readings were not discussed much",
    "I think some of the reading material is dense and there is a lot at the beginning of the course that could be better explained in class for students that have not been introduced to policy or democratic engagement as much as others. The class did have a lot of great discussions and readings, but I would have also liked to see more representation of marginalized communities since the only time they were mentioned was from our projects.",
    "I came into this class thinking it would be a lot about democracy and sustainability, and although it does address those themes tangentially, it would be more accurate to say that this class introduces students to the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework. The IAD is helpful in thinking through policy problems, but when reading about it (there's a TON of very theoretically reading), it often felt overwhelming and confusing. The reading load is also a lot to keep up with. I would suggest cutting down the reading load (I think some people don't do it all anyway) and being more explicit about what the class entails during reading period.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Great discussion, especially since the class attracts a certain kind of person. Professor Fotos is fantastic and caring professor. Professor Fotos is great and patient, always helpful and available for us when we need it. I'm thankful he gave us space to talk during the class and he guided discussion well.",
    "Very little structure or guidance on assignments and discussions",
    "Strengths: \r\n- This class provided a good introduction to democratic theory.\r\n- We covered a wide range of interesting topics from China's one child policy to lobsters to oil. \r\n- Professor Fotos coordinated two awesome guest lectures! \r\n- Professor Fotos was a wonderful instructor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- The essays felt very formulaic as we were asked to follow a specific framework by Elinor Ostrom.\r\n- I would have liked guest lectures to have been dispersed more evenly throughout the semester. They were back to back and occurred right at the end of the semester making the class feel a little less structured by the end.",
    "The class is very well-organized and the readings are interesting. The content itself is really useful. One weakness is that the discussion can feel as though the professor is guiding you towards an answer he has.",
    "Strengths - Professor Fotos himself. Absolutely amazing professor who set out the seminar really well for discussion and really organised the readings well. \r\nWeaknesses - sometimes the readings were super abstract and unrelated to the course.",
    "It was great.",
    "The discussions and guest speakers were the best parts of this course, digging into the more difficult parts of the content we covered. The professor provided useful input without dominating the conversation. The readings were interesting and relevant but sometimes felt longer than necessary. By focusing on the Institutional Analysis and Development framework, the course generally limited its scope to local issues instead of global issues like climate change, though guest speakers at the end of the course helped fill in this gap.",
    "Strengths: Very interesting course. Meets once a week. Only 2 papers (though long). Seminar-style. Great class guests.\r\nWeaknesses: Too much reading. Paper assignments unclear without rubric or past samples. Minimal feedback. Arc disrupted by timing of guest visits.",
    "Strengths: DEFINITELY the guest speakers. Interacting with them was the highlight of the course.\r\nWeaknesses: Wish things were graded in a more timely fashion so we could get a better grasp of our standing in the class."

   "comments": [
    "Most definitely. This is hands down one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Fotos is one of the best professors this university has.  He leads the seminar extremely well. His class is very well structured and every assignment has a purpose in cultivating our learning and overall enjoyment of the course.",
    "Absolutely! This course is very interesting and the class discussion is always fun and engaging.",
    "Absolutely, if only to spend time with Fotos",
    "yes but only if you don't mind reading a lot of long and sometimes dry political theory papers. made the class much more engaging if you read! Professor Fotos made the class though he is very funny and kind and an all-around amazing professor. Would take it just for him!",
    "I would recommend this class to someone interested in science and policy, and contemporary issues with free speech.",
    "I really liked this course! I feel like I learned a lot about how to apply the IAD framework (which is an invaluable scholarly technique for anyone in the social sciences), and class discussions were always very intellectually stimulating. As long as you do the readings (which are mostly a reasonable length) and contribute to discussions, you will be fine.",
    "Yes! It was a well-taught course with a very interesting topic that made the readings and discussions engaging. We also had a few speakers come in to talk to the class and they were very knowledgeable and had perspectives that were necessary to understanding the democratic engagement we were learning.",
    "I hesitatingly recommend this course to another student. This class has such high ratings, which I'm not so sure why - I found the class alright and now looking back I learnt something from it, but it didn't blow my socks off. I came into this class thinking it would be a lot about democracy and sustainability, and although it does address those themes tangentially, it would be more accurate to say that this class introduces students to the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework. The IAD is helpful in thinking through policy problems, but when reading about it (there's a TON of very theoretically reading), it often felt overwhelming and confusing. The reading load is also a lot to keep up with.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Professor Fotos is fantastic and caring professor. Now that the class is over I can look back and see what I've learnt, but this class caused me a lot of pain during the semester because of the reading load.",
    "Definitely! This was a great introduction to political theory from the perspective of a very important topic in our time - sustainability.",
    "Yes! Especially if they are interested in Ostrom's IAD framework.",
    "This course provides excellent opportunities to research and discuss environmental issues in their political context. The professor has a very interesting background and perspective on environmental regulation, and he leads discussions well. The course focuses mostly on the management of local resources, turning to climate change only in the last few weeks. Readings and discussions made me rethink many ideas that I had thought were obvious about what environmental management needs and how governments should act.",
    "Yes. It was a lot of work, but worth it.",
    "Yes! I think I went into class hoping to apply whatever I learned to being a better citizen in the 21st century where our world is burning up, but the class is more theoretical\/analytical than prescriptive. The first half of the class moved at a good pace, but the second half is focused solely on the IAD framework and your own research project, so your enjoyment in the class will depend on if you choose a topic you really care about to present. It's easy to slack off in the second half because of its singular focus on one framework. Professor Fotos is very adorable and encouraging, and I really loved learning about his own previous career in energy as well as hearing from guest speakers (one, a spokesperson for Duke Energy, and another, a climate activist, gave us very different perspectives on pipelines). Overall a solid seminar that wasn't too stressful!"
