(legally, economically, through the people they employ, through their organization, their broader influence on society, etc.) \r\n\r\nI also learned a good amount about sociology and anthropology, like what it means to do this work, how interviews are conducted and compiled, what we can learn from it, etc.",

Critique is well balanced and justified, but not emphasized until the history and development of corporation form is fully fleshed out. I really appreciated this about the course. I am still critical of corporations after the semester (as I believe the course wants you to be) but in a much more complex and meaningful way.",

                "Strengths included great lectures which were engaging, organized, understandable and good at connecting concepts from previous classes in a narrative arc that shaped the whole semester. The two essays were also pretty good assignments, more creative and engaging than most assignments in lectures.\r\n\r\nI really liked some of the readings, although others I liked less, and I often felt like they were too long, especially for a 100-level course. I would say section was often a strength too it's one of the few (maybe only) section I've had in 7 terms at Yale that helped me learn more than I could gain from just reading the text myself. \r\n\r\nI do think sometime the concepts in lecture were a bit obvious or intuitive  to me the course felt much better at developing ideas I already had an awareness of, and less good at really shocking me with a brand new idea or concept. That isn't necessarily a weakness, but I think I was hoping for the latter a bit more.",
                "this course wouldve been great if i was a first year.",
                "Strengths: An interesting course with good readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: More work than expected",
                "Strengths - This is a class that makes you think, in a really good way. The answers are not laid out for you on a platter. This is due to the fact that 'answers' don't really exist in context of the way the class approaches corporations. The formation of the course results in a very complex understanding of corporations and their role in society. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Lectures can lean a little too heavily on readings at times.",
                "The course is a very interesting introduction to corporations. I would have liked a little more information and study of the transformation of the corporate model in the class. Although it is the major transformation of the course, we did not critically analyze it, only suddenly started reading authors talking about \"post-Fordism.\" We had one reading about the transition, but did not critically analyze it so much as take it at face value. For a class that brought a sharp eye to everything, this was an exception.",
                "Super engaging and interesting!",
                "I would have liked if the essays weren't so heavily focused on the readings. Maybe a different type of assignment could be correlated to the readings.",
                "Strengths are the structure; having lectures early in the week and section later in the week is ideal.  A weakness of this course was at times I felt as if the readings covered too many different topics each week. The course could be improved by a more focused reading list, as I think it would be more effective to deeply discuss and understand fewer readings than to only understand a high number of readings to a lesser extent.",
                "The course assignments were great for facilitating learning! I loved the larger time frames for them giving students flexibility. I do wish that the first assignment were shifted up slightly earlier to better pace them out.",
                "This was by far one of my most favorite courses Ive taken at Yale. I took it on a whim and will forever be grateful for the way it taught me to think about corporations and our relation to them.",
                "The lectures brought a new perspective to the readings, which I appreciated. Although I thought they got off topic at times. I also would have preferred the sections to be slightly more structured/rewarding, as I felt that I left section more confused that I was going in. The course was also very broad, and I think it left things too introductory and open-to-interpretation for the essays."

                "Yes I would! It has great lectures, pretty interesting readings and concepts, not too much work and my section at least was actually pretty decent! The writing will take some time, especially the background work in the two essays, and some of the readings seem too long but like any lecture course it's easy to not do them. Some of the readings are quite good though, so I would recommend doing as many as you can!\r\n\r\nProf. Rogers is quite engaging in lecture and really focuses on making the class all about students learning. He was open to feedback and responsive to emails. While the assignments are a good chunk of work, if you take them seriously they are pretty engaging and help you learn. The class is definitely driven by the concepts he develops. \r\n\r\nIt's also a great class to get a sense of anthropology/sociology as a discipline, what sort of work it entails and what knowledge it produces. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I would change would be reducing the number of pages in some of the readings, and maybe having 2-3 assignments, rather than four.",

                "I would absolutely recommend the course to other students. It is a fascinating look at corporations that you are unlikely to encounter in many other classes at Yale, especially if you are an econ. student. I came in a little skeptical, and I think some healthy skepticism is always good, but the class has so much to offer in terms of new ways of thinking about and examining the ways corporations and people interact in the world.",

                "Absolutely!! Incredibly engaging and a must for everyone interested in the intersection of politics, history and economics.",
                "Yes, it was the highlight of my semester. Professor Rodgers was so insightful, entertaining, and knowledgeable. My TA was amazing as well, you can tell that the teaching team genuinely enjoys discussing the class and materials. It was such a joy taking this class.",
                "It depends. I would recommend it for someone who is interested in Sociology or Anthropology and wants to take it for those majors. However, I would not recommend it to upperclassmen or people who want to take it for social science credit."
