                "I learned about Ostrom's institutional analysis and development framework and learned how to write specifically in the style that uses that analysis.",

                "Strength: class discussion was very animated and we had a good dynamic. Professor Fotos' memos were super informative and helped structure the week's readings and takeaways. Weakness: we only really talk about one aspect of democracy & sustainability, which comes down to Ostroms' institutional analysis framework. It was helpful for sure, but I think the class is limiting in that it does not really equip you to address the sustainability challenges of the 21st century. Almost all our readings were from 10-50 years ago. We did not address intersectional issues when it comes to sustainability",
                "The strengths of this course was the lobster unit - I absolutely loved it and Acheson's book was phenomenal, clear, and direct. \r\nAnother strength is that it gives you the chance to dive deep into a topic via the paper, because it asks for the IAD analysis calls for granular detail in a way that most other papers do not.  \r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course was the seminar. I often felt bored in the two hours, and only occasionally would organic discussion pick up. Often, what we discussed felt entirely removed from the reading. In future years, I recommend making the course smaller - the size we were at now was too large to have discussion, and too few people would participate.",
                "I thought the actual classes themselves were fun and pretty insightful, particularly the parts about the role of science within policy, but I thought the out of class memos and readings could sometimes be a little tough to get through, particularly because sometimes the content was too dense.",
                "The seminar style is definitely a strength- it encourages all of the students to closely engage with the material. More examples of how to apply the IAD framework would have been helpful.",
                "strengths: Professor Fotos put in an incredible amount of effort into this and it paid off. The class really changed my worldview in a good way - learning about Elinor Ostrom and the IAD framework has made me much more thoughtful about the world. There are a lot of small assignments which can take the stress off of learning any just one.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the assignments could be a bit confusing so I would recommend going to office hours the week before something was due to make sure you understood it properly."

            "comments": [
                "Sure, it's a good policy class, though it can be frustrating at times because the IAD can be tough to think through. The final paper asks you to follow a very formulaic structure, which I found a bit stifling, but it was a good exercise to learn about a topic I was interested in.",
                "I would not. I was often unengaged during our seminar time, and did not come away feeling like I understand the nature of democracy and sustainability better. I would only recommend the course if the student had a topic they wanted to look in depth into and needed a space to do that. Something valuable I gained from the course was exposure to Acheson & lobster politics, for which I am very grateful, but I would recommend that the student just read Acheson's book.",
                "For fulfilling the advanced writing credit for the EVST major, I thought it was an alright class. The topics and writing style we learned were pretty niche so sometimes felt a little hard to find broader applications. It's not a bad option for the writing credit, but it wouldn't necessarily be my top choice.",
                "Yes! The topics are very interesting and it is such a cool intersection between government and environmental issues.",
                "Yes, definitely. But with the caveat that the final essay is a lot of work, so definitely take it if you have enough time to allot to the class. Overall, it's a very rewarding experience. The readings and class discussions are so eye-opening and fascinating. This class equips you with a framework to apply to a variety of political/ecological contexts. Therefore, it's a very relevant class for any student interested in political science, sustainability and even game theory/economics.",
                "Absolutely! This was the best class I've ever taken at Yale. The content transforms the way you see the world and Professor Fotos is the professor most dedicated to teaching well of any professor I have ever had."
