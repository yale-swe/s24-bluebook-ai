This lecture course used to be powered completely by chalk talks, so I 100% understand why some professors opted to go to Marsh in person anyway, and I appreciate the flexibility that was offered to students in terms of how they wanted to learn the material.

                "Please remove discussion section, not a good use of time",
                "The lectures themselves were great for the most part. Some professors went into way way way too much detail than what the exams asked for, and that was still fine. I learned a lot, which was a huge strength. Now the weaknesses: what was really annoying was that we took the midterm on October 28th. But because the way this course is designed, there was not much oversight on the TAs by a specific prof (at least I dont think because if there was, Im not sure that this would have happen), and it literally took them until December 1st to give us back our grades. That was exactly TEN DAYS before the final exam. I have never taken a class at Yale where it took the TAs THAT long to grade midterms. Considering that the midterm is 30% and final is 40%, this delay wasnt okay. Also note, by this point in time, we had grades for two HW assignments, so we only knew where 13.33% of our total grade stood before December 1st. And because of this, there was barely any time (literally ten days only) to improve study methods and\/or fix what we were doing if it was not working. Aside from that, the exam questions, at least the essays, were fairly broad and they took several points off for not including minor facts (in relation to mechanisms) that they did not explicitly ask for. And for quite a few questions, points were taken off without providing any feedback at all.",
                "The course covers a lot of material, and takes advantage of the many amazing faculty in the IBIO department in order to do so. That being said, the professors' lecture materials don't seem to have been coordinated well among each other, and there was quite a bit of redundancy and overlap. Although this helped to strengthen certain key concepts, it also got very repetitive by the fourth time we learned the nitty gritty details about the 3 signal hypothesis. On the flip side, sometimes professors believed we learned about a certain concept (such as AIRE selection) before the corresponding lecture had been taught. I also think that the course midterm (though not the final) seemed to emphasize research-based questions and experimental design, which was okay for people who had research experience in IBIO but probably very difficult to answer otherwise because the lecture did not spend time introducing how experimental thinking worked beyond making us read the appendix on immunology tools in the first week of class. Spending a little more time across the semester (and not just in the 1st discussion section) on experimental design, maybe in discussion sections, would be very helpful.",
                "So many professors made learning choppy. Hard to understand how topics related.",
                "While the lectures were individually really interesting and the professors were incredibly knowledgeable, I feel like more could have been done to tie all the disparate topics together or give a more high-level overview of immune function. Felt piecemeal at times.",
                "Topics are taught by experts in their fields; weakness was grading, which seemed a little harsh in my opinion given that this is an introductory course",
                "The course covers many important topics in immunobiology, but is incredibly packed. While you get many leaders in their own fields lecturing, by virtue of them being at the cutting edge, they often contradict each other when they all talk about overlapping topics, which creates a lot of confusion. The frequent switching of lecturers and the multitude of presenting methods was also incredibly disorienting. This was made worse by video and audio issues, as well as the poor handwriting of those professors who refused to just make slides (those who did usually did not post them), which just made learning the complicated concepts of this course a complete headache.",
                "The course was for the most part conceptually well organized. I liked the flow from innate to adaptive immunity with special topics at the end which required knowledge of the entire semester's content to understand. Some professors adapted to the online format better than others. Overall, it was really interesting to learn about some concepts from the people themselves who made discoveries in the field.",
                "Weakness - grading was unnecessarily harsh at times. It is just a brutal class because there is so much to learn. Only take if you need a primer for some future courses (aka: grad school or medical school)\r\n\r\nStrength - You do learn a lot. And the immune system is awesome. But if you go in knowing nothing\/unexcited about the topic, you're not going to have a great time.",
                "Strengths were the breadth of knowledge we got. Weaknesses include sometimes lecturers would repeat the same things we already learned in another lecture in depth, and there was little practice material given for exams.",
                "A strength of the course is how topics are continuously reinforced despite the variety of lecturers such that you feel that you have a solid understanding by the end of the course. Another strength was how interesting and topical some of the lectures on immunotherapy and vaccination were."

That being said, I was thankful that the TAs walked through how midterm uploading worked and made us practice during section. I do wish that the midterm were graded more quickly though, since the feedback on the midterm could have helped me to practice or better focus my studying during the semester to adjust my thinking modalities for the final exam. Also, not all professors were willing to upload lecture slides, which made reviewing material a little difficult.
