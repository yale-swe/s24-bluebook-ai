The textbook provides a lot of useful Chinese vocabulary and grammar constructions that will be useful in real life and professional settings, and the essays are a great way to develop the ability to present a cohesive argument in Chinese. Besides, Zhang Laoshi is very knowledgeable and really dedicated to helping his students level up in their Chinese abilities.",
