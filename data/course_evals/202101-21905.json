                "The fact that it was taught by one professor but all the problem sets and exams were written by another really did not help with incentive to attend lecture. We basically studied for exams by the TAs/PTs and study hall.",
                "Study hall and office hours are super frequent which is helpful in that you usually have somewhere to turn to if you don't understand something",
                "No textbook to reference for outside help; no method of using the internet to learn difficult topics",
                "Strengths: AMAZING lectures from Prof. Nagai and so much dedication from both Prof. Nagai and Prof. Mochrie. Also incredibly dedicated TAs and ULAs who went above and beyond to help out students throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "strengths: problem-solving skills, lots of resources available to help, great set of TAs (especially Aia)\r\nweaknesses: difficult material without adequate textbook explanations, \"test and forget\" type of class\r\nimproved: more interesting/relevant classes that maybe look at research",
                "A strengh of this class is definitely Professor Nagai's lecturing. Professor Nagai is an effective communicator and truly cares that he students learn the topics. I also think that Professor Mochrie's teaching was really essential to learning the topics as well. A weakness of this class is that there seems to be a disconnect between the lecture materials and the difficulty of the exam content. I think that at times the exams were way more difficult than practice materials, quizzes, or anything else seen before.",
                "Strength: study halls and office hours made problem sets doable Weaknesses: the content was extremely difficult and wasn't taught that well, the exams weren't a good reflection on what was taught",
                "Strengths: Study halls and TA office hours translated extremely well over Zoom, in my opinion. I'd love to see them continued. The class is organized into modules that correspond to the chapters in the textbook, which also makes it easy to organize notes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Just about everything else. Prof. Nagai was good at explaining things, but he would lose himself sometimes in the middle of a problem and confuse everyone. Additionally, he rarely went through the entire problem in class and asked us to derive equations or problems by ourselves using the textbook module. However, the textbook wasn't much help. The diagrams were messy and the explanations convoluted. Many of our problem sets this semester (compared to PHYS170) were literally impossible to try without a TA present, which was discouraging. I rarely learned anything in lecture and instead credit most of my learning this semester to a particular TA's office hours.",
                "This class was very strange since the simple fundaments are taught in lecture but then the assigned work and examinations focus on complicated upper-level problems. In some classes, this method can stretch students' thinking and help them learn, however in this class, for the most part (in part due to the circumstances with COVID), the massive discrepancy between class and PSETs only served to leave students utterly reliant on TA help for problem sets. On the exams that were open-note, students did well when the assigned problem was similar to a PSET problem, but did poorly on all other problems, which were often excessively challenging; on the harder problems, students basically just received credit when their guesswork was on the right track. This often advantaged students with more confidence/high school background in physics even though basically everyone was confused to the same degree.\r\n\r\nThese criticisms were present but to a much lower extent in Phys 170 (fall semester). While the in-class teaching in the spring was more clear, it failed to go to the depth needed to even come close to solving homework and exam problems, so ultimately I preferred how the course was designed in the fall. That being said, the course took up an unreasonable amount of time in the fall, so at least spring had that going for it.\r\n\r\nDespite these flaws, I do appreciate the flexibility of Professor Mochrie and his willingness to adapt the course. There are many wonderful things about this class, and I think that a few adjustments can make this a wonderful course. Overall, I am still glad I took it over 180, I think.",
                "The TA system is the BEST. Office hours are so helpful. Make use of the TA's as much as you can. They make the class much better. Also Daisuke and Simon are awesome. The test corrections system is also very good. Sometimes though what we learned in lecture wasn't always very reflective of what the p-sets/tests were like.",
                "I liked how the professors were flexible. This semester was especially difficult for reasons having beyond just this class.",
                "I felt that there was often a lack of cohesion among the lectures, problem sets, and exams.",
                "Strength: the peer tutors and staff were all super supportive, listened to our concerns \r\n\r\nWeakness: things were a bit rushed in terms of organization at times in that I felt there was too much information thrown at me towards the end.",
                "The course was made manageable by the high amounts of test-corrections/extra credit. However, there needs to be a major shift to not include concepts beyond the mathematical scope of the course. We would be better served by having easier questions with fewer accomodations.",
                "Strengths: the TAs were amazing and I appreciated the greater flexibility in time provided by the professors for the midterms. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The material from the exams reflected 0% of the material learned in the class lectures. There was no way to attend lecture and be fully prepared for the exam or even the PSET because these two things were so different. It was extremely frustrating to be in this class because no matter how much work I put in, the exams/psets were always a curveball.",
                "-",
                "Exams were extremely hard and we were not prepared to take the exams with the practice material and problem sets",
                "Strengths: Kind and accommodating professors. A lot of office hours and study halls to help students understand course content and psets.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Fast-paced. Learn to solve very specific types of problems only.",
                "Strengths: \r\nPSETS are reflective of exams \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the content is not taught in a straight forward manner; this is an introductory physics course but it not taught clearly. Too much time is spend on proofs and not on the simplified equations and their applications. Additionally, all the work is done using letters instead of real numbers, which makes it very difficult to understand what is happening in the problem conceptually.",
                "Often what we had practiced in class was not reflected in the homework questions, which made it hard to do and understand the homework questions alone without the help of a TA. Not only that, but the format and content of the test was completely different from that of which we had seen in class or in the problem sets. This made it hard for me to understand the information as it was being presented and asked in such different manners that I was not used to seeing.",
                "strengths: the availability of TFs and study halls was very helpful and they were all very nice and receptive to questions and explaining confusing concepts. however, students would not need to rely as much on TAs and ULAs had course material been presented in ways that were easier to understand and clearer. the exam accommodations for the course midway through the semester to 24 hr exam window was very helpful.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: presentation of material in lectures and provided module notes was confusing to follow and did not seem to match exam/pset questions very well.",
                "teaching could be improved, lectures and test material seemed disjointed at times",
                "I thought that Prof. Nagai was kind and a good explainer, but I don't feel like I learned much in this course. The exams and psets were extremely difficult and features material that we had never been taught in class such that in order to complete the psets you needed to go to many hours of office hours to get help from the TAs.",
                "I think that the professors are very understanding and are willing to accommodate for a lot of issues, but the way that the course was structured was extremely difficult to grasp the concepts. I think going from what I learned in lecture to solving the problems, there was a real dissonance. Each student needs a different approach, some need more of the physics concepts explained better while others need the derivation explained better. Because this course delves into both simultaneously, it was hard for either type of student to obtain the understanding we really needed.",
                "The professors did their best to adapt to a lot of the challenges that online learning posed. I think that having one professor teach the lectures, and the other write the exam and problem set questions was not a good system because at times there would be learning and assessment gaps due to the fact that each professor focused on different parts of the units. The course could be improved by offering a textbook rather than learning from the modules. The modules are not very clear and made learning the concepts very unnecessarily difficult.",
                "Strength was wide variety of applications of studied topics. Weakness was arguably overwhelming pace and shift of focus with poor communication despite multiple lines of communication available.  The TA dependence on answer keys was also disappointing.",
                "There was a significant disconnect between assignments and lecture material. I felt really comfortable with lecture concepts, but applying them to exams and even psets felt pretty impossible. I also think that professors could have been more accommodating to the pandemic/campus crises this semester.",
                "I think we zoomed through the course content post-midterm 1 too quickly in class; we ended up going through each unit in only 2 or 3 classes, and it was quite hard to keep up at times. I also felt as though what we covered in lecture was not at all reflective of what would show up on homework assignments or on the exams; we would do very basic, introductory practice in class and then the questions on assignments would be almost foreign to me in comparison; everything was much more difficult. Also, exams overall were much more difficult than psets and what we covered in class; for the last midterm I really was taken aback by the level of difficulty of the exam.",
                "Strengths: this course offers plenty of aid from the TAs, and communicating with the professors was easy and very helpful. They were always ready to respond and adjust the course based on our current progress and circumstances.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: occasionally, TAs could not help with problems as answer keys came out late, or were confusing. Some of the problems were hard to follow and confusing, even for the TAs, so there was not very much hope in students themselves being able to engage with the material. The modules were not always clear, and certain concepts were covered very quickly despite being large parts of psets and exams -- like neurons. Additionally, for students who aren't very familiar with calculus or linear algebra, it was difficult to follow the examples because steps in proofs were jumped without explanation.\r\n\r\nImprovements: fleshing out the modules, and properly supporting the TAs would be a big help to students.",
                "Overall the biggest strength was the investment of the professors. It was clear that they truly cared about our learning and wanted us to do well and engage with the material. The weakness, I think, was the structure. It was very confusing at times and hard to follow given the quantity of material in the last third of the semester. The first midterm had a very appropriate amount of material that increased exponentially over the remainder of the semester. By the end of the year, I felt incredibly overwhelmed by the quantity of material that we were expected to be responsible for and I feel this was reflected in the overall scores of the final exam.",
                "strengths: entirely live lecturing\r\nweaknesses: exams not in sync with lecture material or homework material; similarly excessive reliance on reading external modules that don't exactly mesh with lecture material. probably due to these responsibilities being divvied up between two professors",
                "Daisuke was very kind, and he and Simon were both flexible - if students felt unprepared for an exam, accommodations were often made. That being said, I feel like I learned nothing from the class. Daisuke handled lectures exclusively while Simon wrote PSETs and exams. As a result, I would leave Daisuke's lectures (interspersed with PollEverywhere questions and practice problems) feeling like the material made perfect sense. However, the lectures were NOTHING like the PSETs or exams. I had to go through every one of Simon's PSET problems with a TA to even begin to understand the material, and the exams were twice as difficult. More often than not, the exams tested material that was never even covered in the class to begin with (exams covered material that was never even in the TEXTBOOK, which was written and provided by Simon). Because of that, even though I understood the material as it was taught in Daisuke's lectures, PSETs and exams took this material to a ridiculous extreme beyond the scope of the textbook, which left me and other students feeling frustrated and demoralized. Furthermore, because Simon wrote all the material for the course/textbook, it was impossible to get help beyond TAs - I couldn't even get clarity from a different physics textbook. Even some TAs admitted that they sometimes couldn't understand Simon's answer keys for the PSETs. The instructors are really trying to make it possible for students to learn by offering corrections and group quizzes, but the material taught and the material tested upon are too different for that to happen.",
                "The professors were super accomodating and kind, but the content was entirely too much and too complex for the scope of a college level intro course."

                "Study halls and office hours were well-organized, but I would say that TAs should pick a time and stick with it. I understand stuff comes up, but it was common for us to receive 2-3 messages each week rescheduling office hours, which was frustrating.\r\n\r\nThank you for the open-note exams and the extra timing on the last two exams. However, it would have been nice to receive additional accommodation on MT3, which was unnecessarily difficult. The average was about 15-20 points lower than usual and decimated some people's grades. I'm not sure why it was acceptable to give us a one-week notice for this midterm exam and then give an exam so difficult that we all bombed it.\r\n\r\nMy biggest gripe with this class was the AWFUL timing of the quizzes that were due every Monday. I could not BELIEVE that we had required quizzes that were originally assigned early in the morning to be completed before 11:35am every Monday. Many of us had CLASS during that time frame, and they were group quizzes so there were MANY conflicts. The professors had NO foresight in doing this. We had to argue to get the professors to give us Sunday night as well, but then they only posted the exam around 9pm on Sunday. I was taking a physics quiz late at night every Sunday because these professors couldn't give us 10-15 minutes to complete the quiz in class. It was awful and I have no idea why these professors found it acceptable to foist this upon their students during a pandemic. I had no time to complete this quiz when you factor in how long we spent on problem sets each week and the time to understand the convoluted module notes.",
                "It would be nice if the live lecture questions could be answered at any time for full credit (ie. the poll stayed open indefinitely, if possible). Some students can't make it to class all the time for whatever reason! Although I do appreciate that we only had to do a percent of the Poll Everywhere. I guess I also just prefer watching recorded lectures since it lets you pause, go back, and speed up as needed.",
                "Online TA office hours were so good. They should stay like that, I think",

                "Success: study hall and office hours \r\nImprovement: making the exams collaborate would have been more helpful.",
                "The professors were very willing to accommodate for the COVID-19 pandemic situation, and seriously considered the student's opinions when we voiced our concerns over the final exam. I think that the adaptation from last semester to having quizzes on our own time rather than the set class time was a great improvement that allowed us to go over more content in class and not have to worry about rushing to turn our quizzes in if we had an internet problem. The recorded lecture is great as it allowed me to go back and rewatch lectures that I found confusing, and I liked the PollEverywhere questions as it kept the students constantly engaged with the content.",

                "Overall, the group projects were very helpful for connecting students in a time when we often felt very isolated. The remote lectures were hard to focus and stay attentive to but I understand the professors were trying there best and their efforts were very valued.",
                "poll everywhere was interesting and fun to try and get the brain thinking to answer questions. excessive stubbornness and resistance to student suggestions for accommodations during a pandemic semester",
                "Study halls were a bit difficult to work with, but everything else worked fine.",

                "If you have to take this course for pre-med, prepare yourself. This course will not help you for MCAT physics and will most likely be more abstract than you expect for an intro physics course. You'll essentially teach yourself everything and hope that it is enough to carry you through an exam.",
                "Yes, since any student considering this class is most likely choosing between this and PHYS 181 for that mandatory physics requirement (either for major or pre-med). I think the instructors were particularly wonderful, although Prof. Steinacker is also great.",
                "if required",
                "If you are taking this class you most likely have to take this class either for your major or premed reqs. Anyone you ask will tell you it is a lot of work and regardless of how proficient you are in the subject you will need to dedicate hours of your time each week to do well. This class definitely requires that you collaborate with peers and it is to your benefit to go to office hours and study hall or find a group of friends to work through the p-sets together with. I would say if you are deciding between which sequence to take, 171 is not as math intensive as 181 (at least from what I hear) and if you can understand biological concepts 171 is definitely the way to go.",
                "Probably not unless it is required",
                "I would only recommend this course if it's a requirement for your major.",
                "No. If you are not pre-med or if this is not a requirement for you, do not take this course. This course is just as difficult as 181 and organized much more poorly, so please take 180/181 if you are at all able to.",
                "Maybe. For me personally I think I did prefer it over what 180 would have been, but I also had a reasonably strong high school physics class (AP AB physics); students that are less comfortable with physics may have an easier time in 180, though I think the math in 180 is more demanding. The content in this class is really wonderful and Simon does a wonderful job of using the course to explain really cool phenomenon and introduce topics like modeling. But there are major flaws with how the lecture content by Nagai matches up with the psets and exams, which creates a horribly unfair learning environment. This year, the professors didn't realize how certain policies were unreasonable until a few students who were brave enough spoke out, which unfairly burdened them. With some changes, this could be a great class.",
                "Yeah! Between 171 and 181 I think this one is probably more humane. But it's really up to the person",
                "Most people take this because they have to, so take it if you need to. The problems on psets/exams are often harder than problems in the lectures/modules, but there are lots of resources for you to do well on everything, so it is a reasonable course.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless it is a requirement for pre-med or major.  I would also recommend considering Physics 180 and 181 as an alternative.",
                "No. Just take 180",
                "-",
                "Only for premed requirement",
                "No. Take only if you have to. It stinks you have to waste a Yale credit for pre med requirements",

                "I would only recommend this if someone needs to take it for med school applications or for their major. The content is not as applicable to the MCAT as I would have expected. If you need physics for MCAT prep, consider taking an online physics course from another school or buying the Kaplin books instead.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they absolutely need it to complete their major or pre-med requirements. The lecture content is relatively easy to understand, but you will not be able to get through the homework without the help of a TA. The tests are much harder in that most of the time it is on content that we have not really mentioned in class or were never introduced to in the problem sets.",
                "if you know enough math take 180. yale doesn't actually have introductory physics unfortunately",
                "Yes- professors are understanding and good at explaining everything. TAs are very helpful for answering questions/it feels like there is a lot of guidance. Learn a lot & like the life science applications",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who needs physics as a part of the prerequisite for being premed.",
                "I definitely would not. I took the physics 170/171 sequence as a premed student thinking that it would be physics geared towards students interested in biology or taking the MCAT. I feel as though I didn't really learn any physics in this class and will have to reteach myself everything to study for the MCAT. The workload for this class was also unreasonably high. We were frequently given psets on material we had never been taught in class, requiring everyone to go to multiple hours of office hours with the TAs. The exams also were extremely difficult, frequently containing problems that not a single student got full credit on. Whether you're someone that is at all interested in physics or a biology/premed student taking physics for the requirement, I definitely would recommend taking a different sequence.",
                "I would only recommend this if you need to take this course for a prereq, or if you are extremely interested in the intersections between biology and physics. I learned a lot about how certain things worked.",
                "No.  180-181 is better for fulfilling the requirement, even if you are pre-med.",
                "If they need it as a requirement.",
                "Only if you can take it as a pre-req; otherwise, not a great class to take if you are interested in physics concepts applied to the life sciences. There were essentially no applications to the life sciences second semester, albeit some tangential, last-minute connections mentioned at the end of each unit. (Like how electric impulses in neurons demonstrated application of the electric circuits unit.)",
