    "I learned to speak with greater proficiency and expanded the scope of my French vocabulary.",
    "My knowledge of other Francophone countries and their histories drastically increased through the readings we did for class. I also gained a better grasp of certain grammar topics (subjunctive vs indicative, present participle, tout\/toute\/tous, prepositions, etc.), which improved my ability to write more complexly. This course also really pushed me to become more confident in my speaking abilities through the debates and presentations we did.",
    "I really liked the World War II unit and I think I learned a lot more grammar as well.  There's too much to list here but I feel I learned a lot!",
    "French speaking a pronunciation definitely improved!",
    "I would say that my grammar and speaking abilities both improved. I also learned a lot, because the course material was very interesting.",
    "I learned a lot about how to apply my knowledge of French to literary concepts and research projects and presentations."

   "comments": [
    "I wish the reading load for Un Sac de Billes were more manageable -- sometimes I felt really short on time and had trouble finishing all the reading.",
    "Strengths: really encourages participation and speaking in class, learn to read longer and more complex texts, learn to write more complex sentences and forces you to employ new grammar knowledge in writing, small class size allows for more participation and flexibility \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: audio exercises in the course packet were sometimes very tedious and sometimes didn't come with answers which was confusing, the audio exercises also weren't as effective as actual practice worksheets since they were often repetitive and obscure \r\n\r\nImprovements: fewer audio exercises and more practice worksheets",
    "This course was great!",
    "The biggest strength of the course, in my\r\nopinion, is the small class size, because you can really improve at your french. Of course, there were only 7 in my class, so this might not always be true.",
    "The course is based around grammar which is important, but it was sometimes difficult to recognize the concepts in action in the texts we read. Because of the sheer volume of content between grammar, vocabulary and reading comprehension, the amount of daily work was often too great and some parts were very rushed. My biggest gripe with the course and with Yale Intermediate French in general is the utter LACK of speaking practice opportunities in class. There is a huge difference between answering a professor's question and having the opportunity to converse with classmates and ACTUALLY PRACTICE speaking French. I came in as a first year from a high school curriculum where I'd been speaking exclusively in french for two years, and I was fairly proficient. I actually felt my speaking regress during 130 last year because of how little we spoke in class. It improved slightly this year because my professor made a conscious effort to include speaking opportunities, but the curriculum is not designed for the verbal application of the concepts and it is a huge oversight."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you feel motivated to improve your French and don't mind the relatively heavy workload and the daily commitment of getting up early for class, I'd totally recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning about French culture and really improving their writing and speaking abilities. This class meets daily, so it requires a fair amount of dedication and students need to always be on top of their work, but the payoff is huge and it's really sparked my interest to continue studying French.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, especially Mme Burton's section!",
    "Would recommend! The learning experience was enhanced with occasional games like 'Jeopardy' as well as debates, etc. French classes were a fun time.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is very interesting and my french improved, but it is definitely a lot of work.",
    "Yes. I really enjoyed the subject matter of the selected texts, especially in comparison to the 130 curriculum."
