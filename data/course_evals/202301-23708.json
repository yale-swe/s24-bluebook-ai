                "Strengths: rigorous course, very much improves your Mandarin writing abilities, incredible (retweet incredible) faculty\r\nWeaknesses: 90% of grade is determined off of written exams / homework assignments, only 10% of grade is based on actual listening and speaking skills, several assignments that didn't seem meaningful and required memorization instead of learning",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Ao Laoshi is a rockstar teacher. She ensures that every one in the class practices speaking chinese, corrects mistakes in a constructive way. Her energy and enthusiasm make the daily class a delight. I wish I could have her next semester. \r\n- Rigorous curriculum that leads to significant improvement \r\n- Structured curriculum - learning the vocab associated with a passage in the chapter, and reinforcing it with vocab, grammar and listening quizzes\r\n- Assessment balanced throughout the semester\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- Unfair deadline of 9am for all courses (i.e., the 9:35am course gets more time to complete assessments than the 11:35am course). \r\n- On occasion, the daily homework is unevenly balanced. E.g., reading an essay, doing vocab and writing an essay in one day. This is rare, but it would be good to avoid allocating so many tasks to one day\r\n- Listening tests have poor quality recordings that 'skip', so they can be hard to hear\r\n- Kouyu tests are too short and don't reflect actual conversations. The way to do well is to just memorise a response to a question, which doesn't encourage an ongoing conversation",
                "Great syllabus, Great organization, Great professors.\r\n\r\nNo improvements",
                "Strengths: the class was very engaging and I got to know my teacher and fellow students quite well. It was also easier to get one on one help if needed.",
                "Strengths: a well-organised, clear program with incredible professors. \r\nWeaknesses: very little. this course is incredible.",
                "This course is extremely well put together and structured for students of all types of Chinese skill backgrounds. It was very engaging, with the department selecting assignments that both allowed us to improve our Chinese and engage us further in Chinese culture.",
                "This course focuses a lot on reading, and not as much on writing, listening, or speaking.",
                "Strengths: Intimate and engaging environment, very supportive teachers, a very well-organized curriculum.\r\nWeaknesses: Asynchronous classes and ebook projects at the end of the semester."
