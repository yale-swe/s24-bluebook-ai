I developed skills for what to look for when taking a photograph in terms of light and colour. I learnt how to use a digital camera with manual settings including an understanding of ISO, aperture and shutter speed controls. I learnt how to format an image and print it on an Epson inject printer. I began to question why I was taking certain photos and to wonder what it was I was drawn to about a subject and develop a sense of style in my photography.",

I specifically learned how to operate a DSLR camera and how to edit my RAW photo files using Camera Raw and Photoshop. I felt that I gained a lot of confidence in my Photoshop skills."

                "Fantastic class, really enjoyed getting to print my own photos and engage with other students' art. Also great opportunities through Ted and the art school outside the class.",
                "I like how this course is very open-ended. The weekly assignments allow you to take pictures of whatever you find interesting, which makes you really think about what you want to photograph and why, while providing a lot of creative freedom, which also allows you to develop themes and interests over the semester, guided by the instructor. We cover all the basics of digital photography: camera, photoshop and printing. We also got a access to extra resources like visits to the art gallery, the Hass arts library and MFA studios.",
                "Strengths: Ted and our TF Jarod were very knowledgeable, fun, and kind! I especially enjoyed our workdays in the computer lab because we could get their direct feedback on how to edit our photographs. I also enjoyed our visits to various Yale collections because I enjoy looking at/analyzing photographs as well as making my own. The weekly requirement to take at least 100 photos was helpful because it pushed me to regularly practice and improve my skills. I always ended up making many more than 100 photos. \r\nWeaknesses: Can't think of any"

                "Yes. You can really lean into this course creatively. Ted is a great artist and will guide you in your exploration of subject matter. It also a low pressure environment and you learn to see things differently. I really enjoyed this course and learnt a lot of great practical skills in digital photography and came away from the class with beautiful prints! We also got access to extra resources like visits to the art gallery, the Hass arts library and MFA studios and almost went on a field trip to the MoMA.",
                "Yes! Please take this course if you get in! You get to learn with a fun group of people+profs, and you are offered a lot of guidance in developing a useful and enjoyable artistic skill. It's also a great way to escape from other classes that are boring/have a heavy workload."
