                "Strength: Organized course materials, detailed and clear explanations and proofs of theorems by Professor Fan, definitely learned a lot from this course.\r\nWeakness: There were only lecture notes wrote by hand during lecture. Sometimes it's a little hard to read.",
                "The design of the course absolutely forces you to learn the material at a high level. Problem sets are not easy, even if you have a solid peer group to work with. If you are taking this course concurrently with other difficult\/time-consuming ones, you should expect there to be at least one or two problem sets that you are simply unable to complete on time. Exams are similarly difficult - the median on the midterm this year was a 45%. \r\n\r\nAll of the above is made bearable by the fact that Zhou Fan is an excellent, clear, and kind instructor. He motivates all of the material he covers extremely well, and you leave the class genuinely feeling that you've learned a great deal of statistics.\r\n\r\nOne distinct weakness: Multiple students felt that Jiyi (TA) was remarkably unhelpful in office hours and email correspondence. The addition of Tianhao (other TA) midway through the semester was a lifesaver in that regard. Do not take this course if Jiyi is the only TA."
