In addition, Professor Kastan put a great focus on lexicon and close analysis of etymology.

                "This course was hmmm. I learned that not all the Shakespeare plays are as compelling as those big 3 tragedies you read in high school. There was also not a lot in the way of discussion in this course - professor Kastan would say he wanted us to comment, but then he'd talk for the entire class time. What he said was interesting, but I probably would have preferred if we could have had more group engagement. If it's supposed to be a lecture, just make it a structured lecture, a little more planned out. If it's supposed to be a discussion, really make it a discussion. I absolutely learned a ton of stuff in this class, I looked at the plays in new ways, I liked the course fine, but I think it definitely could have been better. Also it's supposed to be shakespeare AND religion, but we mostly just talked about shakespeare. I could have done with a little more religion.",
                "great course, no improvements",
                "Strengths: Professor Kastan and Ben are both very insightful and skilled lecturers \/ instructors.\r\nWeaknesses: For a seminar, there were fewer opportunities than usual to participate. While I enjoyed the plays we looked at, it would have been nice to spend a little more time on each play.",
                "Strengths Professor Kastan really knows his stuff! It's a pleasure to hear him talk about Shakespeare. I also really enjoyed writing blog posts about a particular subject within the play each week this helped keep me stay engaged, especially with a specific thought or idea within the play.\r\nWeaknesses It felt like the class wasn't super tied to the \"Religion\" element... it was a loose addition when I wish it was more central. This could have helped add structure to our discussions... instead it felt like they were a little all over the place. But I know it's so hard to cover Shakespeare in depth, especially one play in two short class periods!",
                "I truly loved the engagement and enthusiasm of Professor Kastan and Ben throughout the course. Aside from their stellar knowledge base, they were consistently supportive and animated during our sessions. The Friday section with Ben was always helpful and interesting, and seminars with Professor Kastan were always filled with insightful commentary. Perhaps an improvement in this course could have been to slightly shorten the number of plays we examined, in order to have more opportunities to spend two weeks on plays that were particularly rich.",
                "Strengths: Professor and TA were great - virtually handed out additional readings or sources as they found them which related well to the plays - I feel this really made the class feel like a working through the material together. Weekly discussion posts were fascinating to read and helped students engage in different and interesting topics; I enjoyed the freedom that was granted during these posts.\r\n\r\nI don't think there are any real weaknesses. Perhaps sometimes class ran over on time but it was never a crazy amount of time.",
                "The course is an amazing way to get to know Shakespeare's works and the connections between them across time and genre. Professor Kastan and our TF, Ben, are truly amazing instructors. Through lengthy weekly reading responses, students also learn from each other. \r\n\r\nI think the course could be improved by a greater focus on religion  in the end, the course felt more like a survey of Shakespeare's works than an examination of their relationship with religion. Also, I would have appreciated greater clarity on assignment deadlines, including those of reading responses."

It is a wonderful opportunity to get to know Professor Kastan, who is truly a treasure trove of insight. The course is less suitable for those who seeking an in-depth analysis of the plays."
