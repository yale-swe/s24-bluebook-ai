   "comments": [
    "This course provided an incredibly nuanced exploration of Morrison's body of work (including her novels, essays, lectures, and interviews) as well as a solid grounding in Black feminist discourses and debates surrounding literature and power.",
    "I finally got to explore Toni Morrison in a deeper context and have thoughtful discussion about her deeply influential work. Professor Brooks really cared about us digesting the material properly and I thought the class did justice to her extraordinary career!!!",
    "Where do I even begin? Aside from becoming more familiar with Morrison's literary canon (both fiction and non-fiction), this course gave me an incredible appreciation for the vast, complex history of black American life and introduced me to an incredibly useful array of literature and scholarship by a number of black scholars, critics, and creators.",
    "This was a wonderful course -- we covered Toni Morrison's novels and her non-fiction work, and studied her writing through the lens of her \"moral imaginary.\"",
    "an exposure to toni morrison's entire body of work. each book and article on the syllabus taught me something",
    "From this course I gained the ability to more meaningfully understand Morrison's work in a way that only a course like this can teach. I developed a better understanding of Morrison's canon and learned to read others alongside her to place her novels and nonfiction in larger discussions.",
    "This course, through the works of Morrison, taught me how to live, think, and feel.",
    "I read not only the majority of Toni Morrison's canon, but I got to deeply engage with much of Morrison's intellectual work and the work of other thinkers who influenced the moral landscape behind her novels. Because of this, the class was able to read her novels enriched with a historical and political context. Professor Brooks taught us how to combine theory and literature in our approach to both her texts and the way in which we wrote our papers about Morrison.",
    "I gained invaluable knowledge of the inner-workings and unimaginable brilliance of Toni Morrison's works. She is a genius, and Professor Brooks is unbelievably devoted to ensuring that we all take this journey together through Morrison's texts. It was my goal in college to read Toni Morrison, and this class has not only offered me the space to explore the vast body of her work, but helped me develop the tools to think critically about these texts and look past plot to really figure out what Morrison is talking about. I also worked on my comparative literature skills, as we often drew connections between Morrison texts and supplemental readings that Brooks assigned.",
    "Immersion in the works and life of Toni Morrison.",
    "This class provided an incredible opportunity to engage with a large portion of Toni Morrison's work. Reader her fiction alongside interviews, documentaries, and literary criticism provided a very comprehensive view of her thinking."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The syllabus of this course is sublime. Morrison's works were always excellent, and the accompanying secondary readings were frequently insightful. Class discussions were illuminating, respectful, and collaborativealmost zero intervention was required to keep our thoughts flowingand our understanding of the texts presented to us flourished as a result. The only weakness is time; this is a course that should really meet as often as possible for as long as possible. A single 1 hour and 50 minute class period each week was simply too little time to relish and discuss fully the brilliance of Morrison's writing.",
    "No weaknesses come to mind other than the fact that covering one Morrison novel a week is near impossible; there is just too much to unpack. But this was a reality that came about because of unfortunate logistics, not because of any fault of the course. Otherwise, I loved everything about this class.",
    "the reading responses in addition to the book and articles seemed like a lot sometimes",
    "Strengths: Obviously reading Morrison each week is a wonderful opportunity. The secondary readings Professor Brooks assigned were also extremely helpful in engaging with Morrison. Professor Brooks's weekly introductions, mini lectures, and overviews of relevant cultural pieces were the highlight of every course meeting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I was fairly disappointed with some of the class discussions. I often found myself wishing Professor Brooks would intervene more in our conversations. Sometimes it seemed like other students had only superficially done the readings and were not truly pushing themselves to analytically digest the Morrison novels each week. I don't know if I'd call this a weakness, per se, but reading one Morrison novel each week was difficult. Her writing is exciting and you can definitely complete the reading, but trying to digest all of that material in such a short period of time is difficult and not something I figured out by the end of the semester.",
    "Strengths: The books, the discussions, Professor Brooks!\r\n\r\nWeakness: In order to get through most of Morrisons work, we had to read through the books pretty quickly.",
    "I thought seminar could have been better organized with probing questions or passage selections. I loved how engaged our professor was and how many times we got to see Morrison speak, which I think is really important when learning about her writing",
    "The strength of the course was the amazing combination of the subject matter of Toni Morrison and supplemental readings to bolster the significance of her literature. I found the class structure to be really helpful. Each week, students submitted a \"historical artifact\" that was connected to some part of the novel in order to shed a bit more historical light on Morrison's complex texts that often involved extensive background research. I loved looking through each student's submission to help me as I read. \r\n\r\nI think the biggest weakness is that because we read about a book a week, we often had to rush through the material and sometimes never got very deep into what we were reading. I think when this class gets taught in the future, Professor Brooks needs to come to class with specific sections of the novel and specific questions and make sure she guides students back to those focusing points so that we do not get too far off track in order to cover enough ground.",
    "Strengths: I had absolute faith in Professor Brooks to masterfully field our insights and questions about Morrison, and then help us generate our own insights about the book. At several times this class felt like an actual community of scholars, and Brooks always made sure to let us know that the work we were doing around that table had significance outside of just receiving a grade, but for our understandings of how Morrison changed the face modern literature, and gave us the tools to imagine blackness, black womanhood, black motherhood, black autonomy, and black life from out under the white gaze. It was an amazing opportunity to think alongside an incredibly brilliant and diverse number of Yalies, and the different perspectives and disciplines we brought to the table was itself a strength of the class. Also, Professor Brooks ensured that we did not silo ourselves into discussing Morrison's works in the classroom, and organized events such as public readings, dinner at her house, and trips to New York art museums so that we could connect Morrison's literature to ideas outside of the classroom. In addition, while the papers felt daunting, Professor Brooks was committed to providing incredible feedback both on written assignments as well as in person during her office hours. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt at times that Professor Brooks was a little unorganized with where she wanted to take the class in discussion, and as much as she gave us free reign of the conversation, I would have appreciated having a system to  people's responses to curtail people's responses so that everyone could speak. Also, I felt like it took incredibly long to get our papers back, and for most of the semester I was unsure of how well or not I was doing in class.",
    "This course engages with really interesting subject matter, however at times there was not enough time to fully discuss the works. I think creating a less ambitious reading list would allow for deeper discussions of the writing and a more manageable workload. Additionally, if the class met more than once a week, perhaps more material could be covered."

   "comments": [
    "100% take it. This class is the best literature course I've ever taken at Yale, and I would take it all over again if only for the chance to re-read all of Morrison's works and have even more in-depth discussions about them with incredibly engaged classmates.",
    "TAKE A CLASS WITH PROFESSOR BROOKS BEFORE YOU LEAVE YALE! Take a class that has Toni Morrison on the syllabus before you leave Yale!!! This class had two, the best of both worlds! I would recommend this course to every single student on campus, especially in seminar style (but a lecture would be accessible to more students, which would still be great). AMAZING",
    "Yes, yes, and yes. Whether you're a lover of Morrison already or haven't read any of her works, this class is not just an introduction to Toni Morrison's fiction but an introduction to the worlds she inhabited and created, to the other minds with which she was in constant conversation, and to the beauty, strife, and power that have characterized the history of black America as a whole.",
    "Yes! It's a novel a week plus several secondary readings -- heavy reading load, but very much worth it.",
    "yes. everyone should read toni morrison. everything she's ever written!",
    "I would recommend this class to other students who are serious about reading Morrison. If you are not prepared to read a full novel and hundreds of pages of secondary readings each week, do not take this class. It requires a significant amount of focus, time management, and dedication. That being said, reading Morrison is extremely rewarding. If you put in the effort, you get a lot out of the class and Morrison's canon. You can tell yourself you'll read her work eventually, but this class actually forces you to read the majority of her literature.",
    "Yes. Reading almost all Morrison books was such a pleasure and discussing them with engaged students was even better",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this class to another student. First of all, there is something so precious about reading all of Toni Morrison from start to finish with a class of students who are passionate about the material and a teacher who deeply cares about the subject matter (often to the point of tears) and also has an amazing mastery over both Morrison's texts and Morrison's political and historical context of her literature. In short: do you want your life to be impacted by meaningful and powerful literature? Do you want to be surrounded by people who find this work important to our lives and necessary to support the often erased stories of the characters that Morrison writes about? Then this is a class you should take.",
    "If Professor Brooks ever offers this again, do yourself a favor and take it. In addition to her amazing teaching style, it was an honor to be able to talk almost exclusively about Morrisonian literature and to learn just how much of an impact her life and work has, and continues to do so, affected American literature and society. If you're uncomfortable digging into long and sometimes perplexing texts, take it credit-D. This will be one of my most meaningful classes at Yale, both because of Professor Brooks' immense passion for her students and the topic, and realizing the imaginative worlds that Morrison has left for us.",
    "One of the best and most important classes I have ever taken.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Toni Morrison is an incredible writer and figure, and reading her works comprehensively provides a particular insight into her writing."
