                "Strengths- Interesting material largely new to all students\r\nWeaknesses- **The TA team** completely unresponsive/borderline disrespectful\r\nSection participation as a grade turns into a competitive learning environment\r\nGrading is harsh..not appropriate for an introductory course\r\nOverall, I actually wouldn't mind the challenge of harsh grading if TA's were willing to advise/help with material\r\nBut they are unwilling to read drafts, discuss any real points of the material, or really meet at ALL even on zoom.",
                "I think the double edged sword of this class is the harsh grading. It can be a huge motivator when you do poorly, and then very gratifying when you do better, however, it can also make people shut down or give up. We all have our different thresholds for challenges that can cause us to try harder or stop altogether and I feel lucky that for me I worked harder, although I could have just as easily quit.",
                "This course is fantastically taught. It's fantastically TA-ed, and all the topics are interesting. However, I don't agree with Prof. Kagan's grading policy. I've spent more time stressing about getting a good grade in this class than I have about actually understanding the material. When your comments are being graded in section, it's hard to feel like the conversation is going anywhere because everyone's just butting in to try and get more comments in to boost their grade.",
                "strengths: compelling course material, compelling teacher, responsive TFs\r\nweaknesses: can't think of any",
                "I loved the course content but discussion section always felt like a rat race of jumping into the discussion to quickly make a somewhat coherent point or two. Overall it wasn't really a good learning environment because it didn't really promote \"discussion\" when everyone is just trying to get a word in, and it definitely didn't reward active listening -- sometimes it even just felt outright hostile! I also didn't really like how discussions were always structured as debates between two ethical frameworks because while I understand the argumentative value of picking a side and sticking with it, I also think there should be room for meaningful contribution to discussion that isn't along the lines of \"utilitarianism sucks and here's why, Kantianism rules and here's why\".",
                "This is a very engaging class. The lectures are presented impressively and they really do force you to think and evaluate your assumptions. The main weakness is that the class can at times seem daunting, however, it is rather fulfilling when that emotion is overcome.",
                "The strength of the course is in Shelly's lectures and the enthusiasm with which he teaches. I liked the way we covered utilitarianism, free will, and contractarianism. A weakness would probably be the grading. It's harder to genuinely learn in discussion sections when your comments have to be good enough to merit a good grade.",
                "Strengths: Shelly is one of the best lecturers you will ever have. He is engaging, enthusiastic, and witty, and he always encourages students to stay on after class to discuss philosophy with him (an opportunity you should not miss). He also did well to mask his own personal views on the topics, which is important in as controversial a field as ethics. Also, this class only requires three papers (albeit adding up to many hours of thought and writing). Weaknesses: although this might be a strength to an odd few (case in point: Shelly), Shelly's grading is gruelling. \"C is for satisfactory work\" was the first disclaimer of the semester. That being said, As and A-s aren't too hard to come by if enough thought is put into each paper; anyway, using up a Cr/D/F on this class is definitely worth it.",
                "I think there should be a better way to actually make sure students do all the readings. I definitely wish Id had more oversight in that department.",
                "This course is really good and the professor is strong. The grading is not as hard as some people have made it out to be, but it is pretty difficult. Getting a straight A is extremely hard, but getting a B+ or A- is honestly not difficult at all.  The class is good for an introduction to philosophy and I would recommend taking it C/D/Fail honestly, so you do not have to constantly worry about the grade.",
                "The course overall was very strong. While I found the first couple of weeks of lectures to be a little slow, once the class got into the swing of things, it was interesting and engaging. Shelly is an excellent lecturer. In general, probably the worst part of the class were the questions from students, but that doesn't really seem like something it would be good to cut down on.",
                "Credit/D/Kagan is real. He is harsh when it comes to grading so I recommend being ready to not succeed immediately. I have to say though, he does it in your best interest and you become a way better writer throughout the course.",
                "lectures are interesting, weakness: variability between expectations of different TAs",
                "Strengths are definitely the teaching; the readings could be improved",
                "Overall a very interesting class. In terms of weaknesses the readings were sometimes irrelevant to the lectures. Also, our participation grade is based off of how much we talk in each section which often led to really unsubstantial discussions being carried by students for the sake of points.",
                "Strengths: Shelly is a very engaging and passionate lecturer. He is clear and encourages student participation. HIs lectures were one of the highlights of this course.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more guidance with writing the papers. I felt like the TFs were looking for a particular way of approaching the prompts, so I would have appreciated more instruction on how to write a philosophy paper (in addition to the handout that Shelly provides).",
                "Strengths: Shelly was an absolutely brilliant lecturer. His teaching style was clear, direct, and he genuinely wanted to help us understand moral philosophy. Shelly would hang around after class for as long as people wanted to answer questions, and his office hours were always a lively scene of discussion.",
                "Strengths: fascinating content, great professor.\r\nWeaknesses: a bit stressful due to the grading, although definitely still worth it",
                "One strength of the course is that Professor Kagan and the TFs are willing to help you understand and extend the material of the course through office hours and other meetings. Additionally, while the discussion sections were always quite stressful, especially given my section had 18 people who needed to speak within our 50 minute section time, they offered some of the most rewarding philosophical discussions I have had in my life. If possible, it would have been better if either (1) the sections are capped at fewer than 18 people or (2) larger sections are given more than 50 minutes for discussion time.",
                "By far the greatest strength of this course is the Professor, Shelly Kagan. Probably the best instructor I've ever had. He made a subject that I am not particularly interested in an absolute joy to learn about. I also thought the discussion sections were a definite strength of the course. They were fun and reenforced/cleared up lecture material. The only weakness of this course was that I thought students asked too many questions during lecture which distracted from what Shelly was teaching. Sure, sometimes the questions were helpful. However, many times I felt as though students just raised their hands to hear themselves talk.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are fun, essays are thought-provoking, and philosophy discussion sections are the best.\r\nWeaknesses: Know what you are getting into; philosophy has a very difficult grading curve and it may be in your interest to Credit/D/F.",
                "Incredibly harsh grading - one of those \"C is fine, B is good\" type classes - so good for credit/d/fail. Readings and workload were all manageable.\r\nVery engaging material, and some of the liveliest discussion sections you will find at Yale.",
                "Shelly is an extremely clear, interesting, and entertaining lecturer, making concepts almost deceptively simple. Lectures often delve into very specific areas, such as the different camps within camps of a philosophical tradition. Essays are expected to be precise and nuanced, as well, which makes them harder than you'd expect -- but a good challenge to have. Sections, and occasionally lectures, were too fast for my poor brain to keep up.",
                "I wish there were lecture slides or some sort of visuals to coincide with the spoken lectures",
                "Shelly is a FANTASTIC lecturer, he uses barely any slides per lecture, but each lecture is extremely organized and flows perfectly from the previous one. Lectures are like an extremely organized continuous stream of thought, except it's the exact thought process you would follow yourself. As for the weaknesses, just credit d this class, grading is so stressful.",
                "Strengths: the material itself was very interesting and Kagan's live lectures were very engaging.\r\nWeaknesses: DISCUSSION SECTIONS. It was the main source of anxiety for me this semester. Because they counted for as much as 25% of the grade, people were literally forced to participate even when they had nothing to contribute, so the discussions often turned out pretty shallow and driven by a couple of (naturally more talkative and extraverted) people. The grading rubric for those was also very unclear.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Shelly Kagan is a phenomenal teacher! His lectures are engaging, and he presents material in a very enthusiastic and novel manner.\r\n- Sections are a great time. Youre bound to meet some very interesting people with very interesting takes, but its very enjoyable. Also, the TAs are amazing, especially Austen Hall!\r\n- The readings can be difficult to get through, but most of class is about the actual ideas rather than the nitty gritty detail. Its more about doing philosophy rather than analyzing the work of a bunch of dead guys.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Grading is pretty rough for papers. This is also a strength, because it will teach you to be a better writer, but this can be a rough spot for your GPA.\r\n-Likewise, participation points are hard to get. This can make sections sometime feel more like a bunch of people talking over each other rather than a genuine philosophical discussion.",
                "strengths: engaging lectures, interesting discussions, good pacing\r\nweaknesses: lack of engagement with texts, few check-ins besides writing assignments",
                "Shelly is engaging, however, there is simply too much course material in order to be able to fully grasp the claims made during lecture, especially since participation in section is graded.",
                "I liked the lectures and sections but sometimes it felt inaccessible for those without a philosophy background",
                "Excellent course. Brilliant Professor and TA.\r\nLoved the Discussion Section format and way in which we conversed and covered topics and questions.\r\n\r\nMore structure and information regarding how grades are determined could be an area of improvement.",
                "I'm sure people will bash the grading philosophy here, but I personally think it is quite fair and very conducive to student progress. That said, I haven't gotten my third paper back yet. My section was the best section I've had at Yale. Shelly and my TF Alex were both incredible instructors.",
                "The grading seemed more critical than other classes",

                "It was difficult to write the paper and the best way to learn was to fail first which was difficult",
                "This course is extremely interesting and well structured. Each module melds well with the next to produce a fuller understanding than can be gleaned from reading the texts alone. As a result of certain grading policies, however, this class introduces a greater amount of pressure and stress than is necessary.",
                "I think the course is overall well designed.  I think the lectures progress nicely and lead from one concept to another.  My personal discussion section was a bit large, which made discussion somewhat difficult, especially in a virtual setting, but that is my only concern.",
                "Strengths: Shelly is an incredible lecturer, even over Zoom, and is capable of engaging with the material at a very profound level; the class is very reading-light as Shelly is \"not interested in the history of ideas\"; TAs are very committed to the course.\r\nWeaknesses: Two 50-minute lectures a week are simply not enough, especially since a significant portion of most lectures was devoted to answering students' unhelpful questions (go to office hours!). This makes the class a very basic introduction to the most fundamental terms and thoughts in the field, but nothing more.",
                "Shelly Kagan is a good lecturer, but I would have preferred some powerpoint slides or some additional material to the lectures.",
                "The strengths are that the lectures are very engaging and the material is very approachable in the way that it's taught. The weaknesses are that the class is structured so that students don't do well on the first essay, but it's very difficult to predict how the final grade will be calculated and assess how well you are doing in the class. I emailed multiple times to ask how I was doing to which I got no answer from my TF. In addition, a lot of students were being given the same vague feedback when it came to discussion sections (which are also very hard in terms of grading). It made for a really frustrating and stressful experience, and as a result I credit/D/F the class.",
                "strengths: topics are really interesting and the professor is very engaging. The material is relevant to the real world and lectures were fun especially when you were imaging yourself in various thought experiments. Reading is very manageable. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: The biggest weakness is the weight of section participation and that you were graded on the quality of what you said in section not just your participation. I think this discourages natural discussion and often meant people were just trying to make any good point and participate for the sake of their grade and not to learn. This also seemed to discourage me from asking the questions i had about understanding course material because I needed to make \"higher quality\" contributions instead. The readings also weren't very connected to what was discussed in lecture.",
                "This course teaches interesting material, but suffers from two major flaws. 1) we do not engage with the reading enough. I understand that many courses assign reading which is not discussed in lecture, but these readings were not talked about in section either. It makes everything feel incredibly disjointed, and a couple of times, I thought we were either missing something major from the reading, or I must have had no idea what was going on. 2) the discussion sections for this class are the worst I've had at Yale- by far. First, sections are graded too harshly. We did not raise hands, just jumped in to speak. This led to only the most aggressive people ever speaking, and some people never had the chance to speak during class. I asked my TF what to do about this, and he essentially told me to be more assertive by TALKING OVER PEOPLE during section (yes, this ETHICS class incentivized talking over other students). I could never get invested in the conversation or engage with the material when I was just trying to find gaps to get a word in. I have no idea why Professor Kagan structures section like this. It was literally terrible and made me despise Monday nights.",
                "Lectures were well structured and engaging. Discussion sections were also well organized and conducive for group conversation",
                "Easy to follow along, really engaging discussion sections, lasting impact",
                "This course was incredibly engaging  Despite its being in a lecture format and virtual. The only real weakness was that sometimes the material we covered in lecture and the material wed read for the week did not at all match up which made it difficult to choose what to talk about in section.",
                "I thought this class was solid and I enjoyed it a lot. Though, to be fair, it doesn't matter what I think since it's a well-established class that is not going to substantively change.",
                "I love Shelly Kagan. He is an insightful, funny, and clear instructor. My only criticism is that sometimes it feels that he finishes his main point of the lecture in about 40 minutes, and then no one has any questions, so he either makes up questions to consider that have really obvious answers, or he just sort of repeats himself, sometimes a couple times. Overall, best lecturer I have had at Yale."

I think it is his excitement for philosophy and how the students can tell that he cares that keeps my personally always listening. Less abstractly, sections were helpful in keeping me on the same page as the course, as well as testing and refining my ideas. I also think the timeline of having pervious papers back just before we began to write new ones, and having two weeks to write it, was a perfect timeline to keep me on my toes and engaged but not bogged down and abnormally stressed out.",

                "I highly recommend this course. Shelly's presentation of the material in incredibly engaging and intelligent (even if some of the ideas are crazy). I thoroughly enjoyed exploring some of the relevant approaches to morality. Unlike many of the thinking classes I've taken, the amount of reading assigned is actually quite reasonable. Rather than rushing through 100 pages every other day, the readings in this class are designed to really give you time to think about and mentally digest the material. Overall, this was one of the better classes I've taken thus far at Yale, and it comes with a glowing recommendation from myself.",
                "No.\r\nOn top of a pandemic, the lack of compassion/decency from the teaching team was incredible.\r\nI went in with an open mind and eagerness to engage in the interesting field of philosophy and left with a real understanding why the course has the reputation it does.",
                "I absolutely would but with the caution that you may do very poorly and feel extremely discouraged. This course heavily rewards improvement and that is what I would stress. Honestly, I was in quite a wreck when I did worse than bad on my first paper, but the amount of effort that I put into my second one and the payoff it had was a lesson I am glad I learned and though I have not gotten my grade back, I know Shelly says his aim is that you leave the class knowing how to write a philosophy paper and not that you came into the course with this skill (meaning he rewards improvement). It can be difficult, but I really enjoyed myself and if for nothing else, Shelly is a very wonderful professor and I even had family members who enjoyed watching lectures with me because of how much fun he is to listen to.",
                "If you're willing to risk your GPA a bit, definitely take this course. It's absolutely fantastic.",
                "Yes, but I would recommend to Cr/D/Fail the course.",
                "Yes, really interesting course material.",
                "By the end of the course, I feel like I had finally figured out what to do, so I would recommend the class because I liked the lesson I learned. So I would definitely recommend the learning process, but the class itself is necessarily stressful and limiting.",
                "Yes. This course is often given a poor reputation for being particularly hard on grading. Though this is not entirely false, it does push you to place a serious amount of thought into your work which I believe to be a good thing. In general, however, the content of the course is gripping and it is a great place to start if you have never taken a Philosophy course. Shelly does an amazing job at lecturing and getting you thinking. That in combination with disucssion sections ultimately produced a challenging but fulfilling and enjoyable experience.",
                "Yes. Personally I ended up using a Cr/D/F (though I initially didn't intend to) but it was still really interesting and challenging.",
                "If you're willing to repeatedly get lost in a thicket of incoherent arguments but want to challenge yourself intellectually, take this course. The content itself might seem somewhat dry at times, but it serves as a great introductory philosophy course through which to dip your toes into the philosophical mode of thinking. Just take a leap of faith, Shelly will make sure you don't regret it.",
                "Do it! Do it! Examine your personal ethics.",
                "I would recommend only if they are interested in philosophy, but do not recommend to everyone. It's a tough course and very difficult to please the professor or Teaching Fellows with your paper.",
                "I would definitely recommend the course as a general introduction to ethics. It was informative and enjoyable.",
                "yes, I would recommend to another student who is interested in ethics!",
                "Why not.",
                "Yes. This class truly isn't as hard as the evaluations make it out to be. If you pay attention in class and don't wait until the night before to write the papers you should do well. Shelly is a very engaging lecturer and the content is interesting.",
                "Yes! I think it's a very interesting course and a quintessential Yale class. The grading is pretty harsh, but the material is unlike what I've learned in other political philosophy classes. Perhaps take it credit/D to ease off some pressure for yourself, and enjoy the learning experience.",
                "Absolutely! It's a great intro course to moral philosophy, although I would recommend having some familiarity with writing philosophy before taking this course. That being said, over half of the class took PHIL 175 as their first philosophy course ever, so it's totally doable even if you have never taken any philosophy before. Shelly and the TFs did a fantastic job explaining ideas, leading discussions, and most importantly, teaching you to think like a philosopher.",
                "If you find ethical moral theory stimulating, then yes I recommend this course. Kagan does a good job explaining this stuff.",
                "I would recommend it. Definitely be deliberate about taking it: while the readings are relatively short, and there are only three essays (no exams or anything), it takes a significant amount of time to write a good essay in this class, both because the content is so abstract and also because the grading is very rigorous. And speaking of the grading, because I know it gets a very ~interesting~ reputation: I would say that it is more difficult than most other classes, but it's not apocalyptic. At the beginning of the semester, Shelly told us that, in an average year, 20-30% of students get an A or A-, 50-60% get a B+, B, or B-, 10-20% get a C+, C, or C-, and a small percentage of students get a D or F. So the grading is not ideal, but it is not terrible. The class content, though, is absolutely fascinating. Not only did I learn about ethics, but I feel like I learned a whole new way of thinking, one that has definitely spilled over to help me in other classes, and one that has enriched the way I experience life in general. So understand that the class might be a bit stressful, but don't let the grading scare you away, because it was definitely worth it. One other thing that I wished I knew before I took the class: don't worry too much about the readings. Definitely do them if you can, but don't bother taking notes, or anything like that. Shelly does a really good job of explaining everything in class, way better than the original authors. I knew that the grading in this class was difficult, so I put a ton of time and effort into the readings early in the semester, but I eventually realized that that really wasn't necessary at all, so don't fall into the same trap that I did!",
                "I think Intro Ethics is a very rewarding course. It allows a thorough engagement with a small number of philosophical texts, a discussion of the consequences of moral theories, and an opportunity to discover where you fall in your own moral beliefs. The difficulty of the grading can be intimidating: Professor Kagan and the TFs grade such that a C is average, a B is good, and an A is noteworthily good. That can add some pressure to the papers and participation in discussion section; however, as someone who did not Credit/D/Fail this course, I think the pressure is manageable and an A-/A in the class is achievable if you do the work.",
                "Yes. This class does not have a lot of work besides 3 papers, weekly discussion sections, and weekly readings. Shelly is an amazing lecturer and the material is fairly interesting too. This course will definitely keep you thinking and engaged. Sure, it is not an easy A. But it is well worth taking this course regardless of what you get.",
                "Absolutely yes if it's for your major, maybe if you're considering it as a fun Credit/D/F class or really love talking with Shelly Kagan!",
                "Great credit/d/fail. You will not get the grades you expect. Prepare yourself. It's okay.",
                "You need a pretty high level of engagement to digest the material, prepare for essays and sections, and get the most out of this class. The class is extremely informative as well as conducive to sharpening your thinking skills, but it's a challenge.",
                "it is a very interesting class, but take it credit d.",
                "Yes, if you are prepared to possibly take a few hits in the GPA department and improve your philosophical writing if you have little experience in that field. Freshmen, be warned: this is a class that hosts all manner of students, from first-years to philosophically adept juniors and seniors. Prepare yourself (mentally) accordingly, and don't be surprised at mentions of texts you don't read or issues you haven't yet had time to contemplate. It's helpful to speak with Shelly after class, and to take the time to write down your thoughts in a formulated fashion before sections.",
                "It depends. It's a nice intro course to philosophy and the material itself is pretty interesting and engaging, but if you are more on the introverted and naturally less talkative side, you probably wouldn't enjoy discussion sections very much.",
                "Definitely! Even if you just want to credit/d/fail it, youll learn so much and have a great time doing it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class. I felt that I gained a great background in a multitude of philosophical thinkers, and I really enjoyed Shellys way of engaging with the works and the class. I thought the workload was entirely manageable, but the class still encouraged me to think deeply about the material and prepared me for future philosophy classes.",
                "I would just say be prepared to have your papers graded very harshly. If youre okay with that, then yes, its quite interesting and to be honest a great challenge.",
                "Yes but take it credit d",
                "I definitely would recommend this class. It is thought provoking, and covers important concepts and texts in philosophy in such a way that you understand the key elements in them. Discussions are also very interesting.",
                "Yes! Great class. Don't be scared off by the grading philosophy. You will do fine. If you want an easy A, take this class credit/d. Overall, definitely among my must takes at Yale!",
                "Yes, interesting and important topics",
                "Yes, if you are interested in philosophy and morality in all aspects of life",
                "Yes because its a pre Rec but itll be the lowest grade youll get on a paper, which is disheartening",
                "I would recommend this course to other students because I think there is a lot of value in learning about the utilitarian, Kantian, or contractarian perspective on ethical reasoning.",
                "Generally, yes.  I enjoyed learning about moral philosophies and flexing my mental muscles in constructing arguments.  My main reservation is the course's focus on dead white men.  I appreciate that that was acknowledged in the course, but that is not quite enough to dismiss the concern entirely.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone with a remote interest in moral philosophy or what makes things right. This is an introductory class, so most of the students had never taken a philosophy course before, and thus is accessible to anyone. Don't be too afraid of the grading in this class - it's tougher than other humanities classes, yes, but it's fair and you really learn how to write a philosophy paper. Shelly loves his reputation as a harsh grader, but the median grade in this class is consistently a B+, and his captivating teaching makes up for it.",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to have a basic understanding of the field of ethics/and or need it for ep&e.",
                "I would not unless you absolutely need to take this class. The stress of taking this course (with a combination of non-communicative TFs and harsh grading) was not worth what I got out of the class. My most stressful, frustrating class that I've taken at Yale. The professor says not to Credit/D/F, but if you need to take this class for your major you should definitely consider Credit/D/F-ing this class for your own peace of mind.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class but say proceed with caution. The topics are really interesting and the things we discuss are engaging and sometimes fun, but it's challenging to get a good grade. Section is graded pretty harshly so you have to make sure you prepare some quality points to make or your grade will suffer. The papers are also graded pretty harshly but you can get a lot of feedback and there is room to improve. Many people end up needing to Credit D, but if you like ethics you should definitely take it anyways!",
                "No, not unless you need it, and not because of the tough grading. My TF made this class terrible. His feedback on my papers made no sense. He told me on ever paper to talk to the writing center to verify if my arguments made sense- which I had done for all my papers. After telling him this, he said \"well sometimes they don't give great feedback.\" One of his major problems with my last paper was that I failed to argue a particular counterclaim, however, that counterclaim constituted an entire half page of the essay. I talked to over half the kids in my section and we all had the same problems with my TF. This class isn't hard: it is confusing. I never understood what kind of arguments I was supposed to be making or how to write a better paper. Very frustrating course, don't take it unless you have to or unless you can ensure your TF is decent.",
                "Definitely! Shelly is a great lecturer who makes the content both clear and engaging.",
                "NO! Only take it if you have to and Credit/D it. Grading is soooo harsh.",
                "Yes - great foundation for philosophy that all Yale students should have.",
                "Yes. I think this course is excellent for any student who wants to get Improve the efficacy of their writing, their ability to think through ideas logically, or to get a basic foundation in ethics.",
                "I would recommend. The reading is short, but it is dense and will take you just as long as a normal reading. If you are interested in morality and ethics this is an awesome choice. The TFs give great feedback, and my TF was brilliant. I am happy I had a basic crash course in ethics before taking this class, but I think you can take it if you are starting from scratch. Professor Kagan is a professor not to miss while at Yale. Take this class credit/d; I re-wrote all my essays and got nowhere with itjust save yourself the trouble from the beginning and just go to learn without bothering with the grades.",
                "Yes. I think all students should take some philosophy courses at Yale. Philosophy seems to me to be a necessary component for a well rounded liberal arts education. If you plan on taking one or two philosophy courses in your Yale education, I would definitely suggest intro to ethics. If you are considering much more philosophy in your time at Yale I would suggest intro to ethics even more. The basic philosophy-writing skills developed and practiced in this course are critical to one's ability to express their philosophical musings, be it for future philosophy papers or to simply have a little more sophisticated YDN opinion piece. Plus Kagan is one of those professors that I just like to listen to."
