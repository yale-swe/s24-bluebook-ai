I was taught different techniques when it came to those papers. We also analyzed other writers' styles and identified their claims, key points, and use of evidence. I partook in class discussions about these writings as well."

                "The way there are four progressively more challenging papers throughout the semester is great for improving your writing skills. The feedback I received about my writing was generally quite helpful. The only problem I ran into is that some of the deadlines were very tight, especially for papers #3 and #4.",

                "I think Professor Jones did an amazing job of choosing varied, engaging sources. The course also included visits to the Yale Art Gallery and I really enjoyed engaging with the topic of beauty beyond the four walls of the classroom.\r\n\r\nI think the fact that you write a lot of different types of papers is good, however I dont really feel like I was *taught* how to write them. I think we definitely went over ways of engaging with texts and putting them into conversation but it also felt very much like you either knew how to write or didnt.\r\nAlso this is a very minor note but sometimes we would get homework due on Monday, on Friday/Saturday as opposed to the Wednesday before when we had our last class of the week. It was rather inconvenient and something I think would be very easy to rectify.",
                "I think this was a well-structured class. The essays we read were interesting and the essay topics allowed for personal thought and experience to be added.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- the professor and her teaching style\r\n- the time given for each paper\r\n- the welcoming class environment \r\n- the constructive help from peers\r\n- the help from the professor outside of class time, flexible office hours \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- the lack of structure in class\r\n- not breaking down the writing steps as I thought the class was meant to do"
