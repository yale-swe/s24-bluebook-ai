                "I acquired such an in-depth breadth of knowledge about psychiatry and how to appropriately engage with the discipline of psychology and healthcare going forward. I'd felt incredibly conflicted about my role as a practitioner in the future and this course absolutely helped to clarify these concerns. However, beyond just this more applied aspect of the subject matter, this course supported my consideration of philosophy in ways that I had not considered prior. I had been entirely unfamiliar with how conceptions of \"the State\" come to be, and this course served as incredibly helpful in familiarizing that understanding of what it means to discuss something in the context of nation-building and state projects. This course was incredibly helpful for me as not only a future practitioner but also as an academic.",
                "How to critically read and think about texts and about the racial implications in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders.",
                "This course, as the name states, really opened up my perspective and allowed me to \"decolonize\" my mind. I learned so much about colonial psychiatry in various places like Algeria, Vietnam, Kashmir, Cuba, and how that affects our perception of mental health and culture.",
                "I learned about different ways to view Psychiatry, past colonialism as a history but how psychiatric practices influenced by colonialism are still seen today. I learned about the asylum as an institution, the role psychiatrists and the government can play in this, and even family members. I also learned how to synthesize my learning, especially through essays and even discussions.",
                "This course was incredibly formative in my understanding of the history of psychiatry. I learned to critically think of history through various anecdotes and niche experiences that spoke to a greater historical theme. I also learned to decolonize by decentering European experiences with colonialism and focusing on the intermingling of cultures and perspectives during colonial periods. Professor Quarshie is especially good at teaching how to put readings into conversation with each other and create your own ideas out of an author's points.",
                "Loved how the readings spoke to the many faces of colonialism and occupancy--the readings were like world tour! We explored classics like Fanon and recent works such as Bedlam in the New World (in a way we could track continuity and a change within the history of colonial psychiatry.",
                "Through taking \"Decolonizing the Mind\", I gained valuable knowledge about the complexities of mental health care across various regions of the global South, especially those affected by colonialism. The course offered diverse perspectives that challenged my existing beliefs and understanding of mental health. I learned how psychiatry was used to establish the bounds of \"normal\" and \"abnormal,\" functioning as a mechanism of power and control, with its foundations deeply intertwined with colonial power structures that have shaped the language, theory, and practice of mental health. This class also encouraged me to think about a potential future for the field of psychiatry and understandings of mental health.",
                "Throughout the course, I've cultivated several significant areas of understanding, expertise, and perspectives, as discussed below:\r\n\r\n1. **Grasp of Colonial and Post-Colonial Influences in Psychiatry:** The course provided me with an exhaustive understanding of the impact of colonial and post-colonial power relations on the evolution and practice of psychiatry. I extensively studied the historical connection of psychiatry to colonial power structures and the necessity for decolonization in this area.\r\n\r\n2. **Interdisciplinary Perspective:** The ability to approach psychiatric studies from varied perspectivessociology, history, anthropologywas a key learning from this course. It helped me understand psychiatry as a field that is interconnected with broader cultural, societal, and political phenomena.\r\n\r\n3. **Critical Thinking and Deconstruction Skills:** The course instilled in me the ability to critically scrutinize established practices in psychiatry and question the status quo. This was particularly evident in my analysis of the enduring impact of colonialism in psychiatric practices and the necessity to decolonize them.\r\n\r\n4. **Appreciation of Cultural Differences in Psychiatry:** I developed an understanding of the diversity and pluralism inherent in human experiences, including mental health and healing practices. This was reflected in my study of indigenous knowledge and the consequences of colonization on non-western societies, especially in the context of mental health care.",
                "In this class, we delved deeper into the term \"decolonize\". We tried to understand (1) how the past/current psychiatric practices are colonized, (2) how politics manifest in every aspect of care/discussion of care, and finally (3) what it means to decolonize the mind. I mainly learned how to synthesize various reading materials (both philosophical or historical and anthropological texts) and discuss them in depth.",
                "I definitely learned that \"decolonizing the mind\" does not just have to do with understanding what \"colonial\" psychiatry is, but also sitting with and imagining what \"decolonized\" psychiatry might look like, which we definitely saw in the last unit. I also got to recognize my own bias in thinking of the asylum or institution as something separate of the communities it is placed in with Edington's book!"

                "Dr. Quarshie was a FANTASTIC professor! He is incredibly well-versed in the topic and the way his course is structured really supported my confidence in my engagement with the subject as well. The course was structured so that students had to guide the conversation for the first thirty minutes before he would comment, which I found gave the opportunity for a lot more students to speak their minds and to get a gauge of how students felt about the reading before having the conversation guided in a particular direction. I wish there were more opportunities to get points for the course to boost your grade because it's really easy to score on the low end of an A for the response papers. The course was described as an opportunity to learn how to write effectively, so I was a little surprised that there weren't as many opportunities built into the course beyond office hours to focus on how to write effectively. That being said, we did work extensively with the ways in which authors wrote, which allowed for us to potentially find authorial styles that spoke with us .",
                "Strengths: Professor Quarshie is an amazing discussion leader, while also letting his students develop their thoughts. He will always push you to be a better thinker and writer. The texts were so interesting, I loved how we focused on the psychiatric institutions of different countries and cultures.",
                "The discussions in this class were really wonderful. Professor Quarshie cultivates an environment that makes students feel really comfortable speaking up and even posing ideas. Also, the texts are insane (in a good way!). Very carefully selected to get us thinking in different ways about mental healing.",
                "A strength of this course is the student-led procedure of the course, which facilitates a natural discussion between peers through pre-prepared questions. This model made the conversations and the course comfortable, as the professor did not engage with our discussion for the first thirty minutes and allowed us to freely express our thoughts and take aways.",
                "Strengths\r\n1. Diverse readings that touched on several concepts. \r\n2. Student-led, we explored what we were interested in and went at our own pace/\r\n\r\nWeakness\r\n1. More support from Professor Quarshie in leading class discussions--like streamlining the conversation so that we can dissect the salient ideas and themes that connect the readings. \r\n\r\nImprovement\r\nI think it would be nice to have some debate form seminars so that we can facilitate more collaboration in the class. This could also improve our argumentative skills which would be helpful for the essays.",
                "The readings provided diverse perspectives, understandings, and insights about mental health care and understandings of mental health across the global South, particularly areas with a history or reality of colonialism. Professor Quarshie structured class well and helped deepen conversation about the text. This class helped strengthen my writing and pushed me to step out of my comfort zone both in the way I think, questioning my existing beliefs, and how I engage in class. I also really enjoyed the last contemporary text we read. I thought it supplemented the topics we covered well in thinking about a different and more radical future of psychiatry.",
                "Strength - The organization of the course was amazing. He divided the semester into four units, each unit structured by 1 week of foundational/classic/philosophical texts and 2 weeks of anthropological or historical case studies. Because he was genuinely interested in reading these texts (that is why he said he selected them), the texts were interesting and diverse. Discussions were led by students, so it allowed for more student engagement. The professor would share the questions with us a day before, and they were often insightful and intriguing. I absolutely loved his writing prompts. They were simple yet thought-provoking (had a more philosophical edge), and it always felt like a puzzle to figure out my answer to his prompts. It's also a great WR credit that doesn't have too much workload. I loved that the prompt for the final essay as we could bring up our own answers to the overarching question that the course challenges. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Sometimes I felt the discussion in class to be dry or confusing (there were multiple times when I was thinking, \"So what?\" to myself). The professor is brilliant, but I didn't entirely click with his way of speaking, either, and I was often more confused when he gave his cents to the discussion. Keep in mind, the discussions were led by students, so the flow of the talk varied section by section.",
                "I think the way that Professor Quarshie runs his seminars are very efficient and force everyone to say what they actually mean, and I think that context for some of the other authors that were brought up (not the ones who's pieces we had to read)/styles of writing were helpful for people who were unfamiliar."

I'm a big fan of Dr. Quarshie but also I believe that this subject matter is so important for literally anyone going into psychology because there isn't presently a structure for us to critically engage with the discipline. I'm hopeful that this course may be taken by more future practitioners because I think that its content is so important. I feel so much more confident in my abilities as an academic and worker in the mental health care field because this course provides a very lucid analysis of the discipline and even offers potential solutions for the future.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. This has been one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
                "Yes! Professor Quarshie is brilliant and his discussions are always so interesting. I definitely feel that I am leaving this class more educated and knowledgeable on the effects of colonialism in our psychiatry and mental health perceptions, and the readings were sometimes long but very interesting. Even on days where I wasn't able to fully engage with the reading before seminar, I still left the class every week feeling like I learned something new. The papers also helped a lot for me to process all the information from the discussions we've had into a cohesive argument and collect my thoughts into a more organized structure rather than just a bunch of information I've collected throughout the semester.",
                "Absolutely. Especially if you are interested in HSHM/psychiatry, but also if you are just curious about the topic. Professor Quarshie is an amazing professor and this is one of those courses I will probably never stop talking about. Would absolutely recommend!",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course to any social scientist, pre-med student, or historian of the sciences. The material is very relevant as it explores the colonial roots and influences in the development of psychiatry and its treatment, a very relevant topic today. The course was also unique in its exploration of various geographies, and comparing the experiences and consequences of various methods of psychiatry was generative in understanding the way psychiatry is today.",
                "Yes, especially if you want to explore interesting monographs and ethnographical work which you would not get to the outside of this class. Especially recommended for anyone exploring a profession in healthcare and global affairs.",
                "Yes! I would recommend and encourage everyone to take this class. The topics covered in this course are essential because they requires you to think critically about how systems of oppression and colonial legacies inform our beliefs and understandings. It forces us to question our current understandings of mental health and codifications of illness, looking through a lens of historical powers.",
                "Absolutely, I would strongly recommend this course to other students, especially those interested in understanding psychiatry from a broader and deeper perspective. The course provides an opportunity to not just learn about the psychiatric practices, but also scrutinize them through the lens of historical, socio-cultural, and political factors. It's a rich exploration of how colonial and post-colonial power relations have impacted the field, which is often overlooked in traditional studies. More importantly, it cultivates a sensitivity towards ethical issues in mental health care, particularly those related to cultural dominance and power dynamics. It also offers insights into future directions for psychiatry, making it very relevant for anyone interested in mental health care's evolution and decolonization.",
                "YES, for sure! The course broadened my HSHM perspectives to be more philosophical and/or anthropological. The professor is fun and brilliant, and the questions he poses us to answer were some of the most interesting puzzles asked.",
                "Absolutely. If you have the chance to take any class with Professor Quarshie, take it. He challenges you in the best way possible to grapple with very complex topics and helps you become a better student and writer in the process. He also makes sure to support you during discussion if he sees that the group is struggling with a certain topic or question. His courses have been my favorite at Yale."
