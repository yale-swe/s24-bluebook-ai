I really enjoyed carrying out many of the techniques that I had learned throughout my biology courses at Yale.",

                "Really amazing class that fostered a positive, enriching learning experience. I loved how interactive this course was being in-person most of the time and have fewer than 10 students. I really got to know my classmates, professor, and TA and enjoyed being able to discuss and learn from each other. I enjoyed that this course can be taken without any prior knowledge/experience and does not need to be taken in conjunction with the associated lecture course. The assignments were straightforward and low-stress.",
                "The strength was the content, the in-person component, and the professor. Our class had so much camaraderie and I really enjoyed coming into class. In addition, I learned so much more from one session here than in 3 lectures in the standard class. Professor Whirledge was clear and kind. She expected the best out of us. This was honestly one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale.\r\n\r\nThe weakness was that not all of the classes were in person!"

                "Absolutely!!  It is a great class where the teaching is focused on your learning not your ability to get a large amount of work done.  Professor Whirledge is great at teaching and also very engaged with the class so you feel super comfortable answering questions, too.",

                "Yes! Very great lab course that I am so grateful to have taken before I graduated. One of my most favorite MCDB labs! Very interactive and engaging. Supportive professors and TAs. Assignments were straightforward and not difficult. The homework assignments were low-stress and were not meant to confuse students and only meant to help us learn and succeed. I learned a lot about scientific techniques that I ended up using in my own research lab. Professor Whirledge was very receptive to student questions and showed how much she cared about supporting our success. We ended the course with interactive student presentations on a reproductive disease and it was engaging and fun.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. In addition to really enjoying the material and activities that we did in class, Professor Whirledge was excellent. Her lectures at the beginning of lab were very straightforward (and helped reinforce material from lecture). She clearly cared about our learning, as well as our interests and what we wanted to do post-Yale. Also, the class is geared towards giving assignment that help your understanding of the material rather than trying to force you to remember nitty-gritty details (this was in contrast to other labs courses that I've taken at Yale). If you can get in, take it!",
