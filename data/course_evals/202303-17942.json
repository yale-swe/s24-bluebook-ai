                "This course was very poorly structured and did not promote student learning. The syllabus was incredibly confusing and each class felt so random.",

                "This course was a delightful introduction to psychology and gender, and Prof Khan did a great job of weaving in related and intersectional studies on racism, settler colonialism, and contemporary political events.",
                "I came into the course with plenty of background in general WGSS topics, as well as an independent study conducted in high school on one of the main topics on the syllabus. That said, I was excited to approach a familiar topic from the lens of psychology -- though the historical \/ political history of gender is familiar to me, I had little experience engaging with it from the point of view of my major. Having now taken this course, I will say I got SOME insight into the psychology of gender from a SELECT FEW of the readings; namely those which used methodology from psychology to understand the gendered brain (Gina Rippon's \"The Gendered Brain\" was a strength). However, the lectures themselves focused on a very basic overview of the history of gender in the West. Most of the psychological knowledge I took from the course came from the readings and my peers, as the professor didn't seem to have the background to answer most of these questions.",
                "I learned about the history of gender through a historical lens. This class was extremely interesting because we learned about how the concept of gender evolved using so many facets, from the Combahee River Collective to the \"Alpha Wolf\" narrative.",
                "This class provided insights into the ways in which gender norms developed throughout centuries. The historical lens which was used throughout the course increased my ability to synthesize many different thoughts together in a cohesive fashion."

                "There was a lot of discussion and I really enjoyed that size of the class -- it wasn't too big or too small. There was a combination of group discussion and larger group which was nice to be able to interact with smaller groups as well as the whole room. I really enjoyed the readings and there was a fair amount of flexibility to succeed in the course.",
                "This course provided a nuanced history of how neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, and gender studies have come to be and how they can be improved in the future for more inclusive and interdisciplinary study.",
                "Great course, the professor cares deeply about and is sensitive to the subject, and always trying to stay up to date with the most current discussions regarding the topics. I loved that we had the opportunity to discuss within small groups, very informal format that allowed low pressure. I also enjoyed the structure and lengths of our reading responses. Weakness might be just the few classes where we really didn't get to talk\/discuss at all because the professor was hard at lecturing away, but even that was interesting.",
                "Strengths: good readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I was really excited about this course, but I ended up being quite disappointed. The workload and grading is incredibly light, which ultimately led to minimal participation and a pretty useless class. I'm pretty sure the class is 45% participation, which Dr. Kahn gets around Yale requirements by having part of this be \"in class assignments\" worth 25% (there were none). Plus, to my knowledge, participation wasn't even actually graded - I think everyone who showed up will probably get 100%. I'd guess 30% of the class never said anything during class-wide discussions. The bulk of the rest of the grade comes from reading responses (one paragraph in response to each reading), which are graded for completion. I get the impression that our responses were being read, but we never got any feedback or engagement with our ideas. In fact, I didn't get a piece of feedback all semester on any of my work. There was no real paper that allowed us to engage with the readings, as the only paper was narrow in scope, focusing on one book. In my small group discussions, at least 2\/3 of the group would say they didn't do the readings each week. If attendance wasn't mandatory, I would certainly have stopped attending. All of my learning happened in the readings, and going to class was not useful. The grading structure and small group discussion format meant that most discussions we had were derivative of the readings and not particularly insightful (hard to have useful conversations when most people never do the reading). \r\n\r\nTl;dr I understand and appreciate the effort to deemphasize grades, but this takes it too far and renders the class useless.",
                "The strengths are that it was discussion based and interactive and that we were consistently asked to reflect on the readings, but it could have perhaps contained a higher workload regarding actually connecting the readings to broader issues",
                "This course needs a strict lesson plan. It was so poorly structured and it was incredibly unclear what we would be learning each day.",
                "I think the strengths are the topics and the readings and the discussion however I think the weakness is sometimes the professor lectures for too long instead of turning it into a group discussion",
                "This course was great, and I got a lot out of the readings and reading reflections in addition to the lectures. Professor Khan is wonderful and very knowledgeable!",
                "Strengths: Good readings on the syllabus, a kind professor, and several in-class film viewings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I have no doubt that Professor Khan is an expert in his niche. However, it is clear that the psychology of gender is a topic he's engaged much less with. I say this because the vast majority of our lessons were dedicated to defining and discussing general WGSS topics (which, although interesting and important, did little to advance my knowledge of the psychology of gender). Furthermore, the lectures themselves were highly disorganized with little NEW information, especially as most of his audience were WGSS or PSYC majors with previous knowledge. Basically, this course felt very, very intro-level, almost like a high school course. While I appreciated the accessibility of the material, I simply wanted MORE. Professor Khan could significantly improve class engagement and course organization with lecture slides, as it was often unclear what we should be taking away from lectures. At least 1\/2 of the weekly lectures was dominated by group discussion or Professor Khan requesting questions from the class, which he would then redirect for other students to respond. I learned a lot from my peers, but if this is the way he prefers his course to be organized, PSYC 315 should really have been offered as a true seminar instead of a 75-person lecture. Lastly, the grading was incredibly unclear. Weekly reading responses accounted for ~40% of the grade -- this was a bit strange as I didn't take much away from these assignments. Even weirder were the \"in-class assignments\" worth 25% of our grade that Professor Khan never assigned. When asked in class about what happened to these assignments, he cited a \"long story\" that felt more like an excuse for poor course planning than anything else. I rarely WANT more work from a course, but by the end of the semester, I felt a bit confused and hopeless about what I could possibly take away from the syllabus itself. More assignments would've given us the structure to engage with course material.",
                "strengths: readings were great, lectures were fascinating, the progression of the course made a lot of sense; all the stuff we were learning built on itself\r\n\r\nweaknesses: it was not a stressful course, which i think is really good, but I think it went too far in the other direction and there weren't really any opportunities to compile our knowledge over the semester. the weekly reading responses didn't need to reference previous readings and the final paper was on one book and also didn't need to reference previous readings so the class was missing the aspect of learning where you have to make connections between different topics; also would have loved a little more feedback on the weekly reading responses",
                "I loved how much interaction we could have with Professor Khan. Class was extremely interactive. We would often break into smaller groups to discuss readings and concepts. This was my favorite pat of class.",
                "A strength of the course is the fact that it uses different perspectives to understand the development of gender norms. Furthermore, the course was structured in a manner which encouraged thoughtful student participation and granted students the intellectual freedom to write about those ideas for which they found most compelling. Perhaps this course could be slightly improved if students received a bit more feedback on assignments throughout the course of the semester."

I honestly believe everyone should take this class during their Yale career. Unfortunate that the ratio of men in the class is rather low when the topics really should be discussed by EVERYONE.",

It is a very thorough look at the history of the field and can point you to areas of interest you did not know before. Frankly I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in studying psychology seriously.",
