                "I learned how to engage with classical materials and classical studies (as a field itself) with a more holistic view rather than defaulting to status quo ways of thought in the discipline. I also learned how to write self-guided papers and engage with ideas that contradict with my beliefs.",
                "We explored a lot of different things in this class about identity, racism, oppression, reception, and ways of studying Classics. Some examples: ancient Roman sex slavery. Disability in the ancient world. Ableism in modern archaeological digs. Latin textbooks that use outdated language. We read a lot of theory about what makes Classical studies \"Classical\" and why there might be elitism in that word. We also had a lot of freedom to explore our own interests.",
                "I gained a lot of knowledge on the origin of Classics as a discipline and its relevance towards shaping the cultures of the whole world. We also spent a lot of time this semester talking about the concept of identity, the various forms of identity, how identity was understood and socially constructed in antiquity, and how we apply modern-day understandings of self to the ancient world. My analytical skills grew, as well as my critical thinking skills."

                "I really like how the course works as a survey of different intersections of identities/ideas with classical studies. I do wish the last few weeks had as much structure to them as did the first 3/4 of the syllabus.\r\nAll the guest speakers were amazing.",
                "Strengths: we looked at a lot of material related to the Ancient Mediterranean that I would never have known about before, like influence of Classics in Latin America or sex slavery in the ancient world. I feel like I am way more aware of all the different modes of studying classics now. We even got a chance to do a show and tell where we find a cool and unorthodox source that writes about classics (graphic novel, modern play adaptation) and share with our class. Weaknesses: I sometimes wish we did less theory and more exploring cool primary sources. Discussions about theory sometimes went on a little long for me.",
                "The strength of this class is that it dives into the history and subfields of Classics in a way that no other course offered in the department for undergrads does. Chris proposed this class after encountering the n-word in a commentary. This class was created to entangle the nuances of what it means to study Classics in the modern age, the legacies of oppression tied to the discipline, and the various ways the field is being reinvented through new scholarship and the arts. The only weakness of this class is that it is not a requirement for all Classics students to take."

                "Yes, especially if you are a classics major! This is an IMPORTANT class. We need to stop thinking about and engaging with classics in the way in which it has been presented to us for so many years. This class pushes the bounds of classics and makes you uncomfortable, and I think thats very important.",
                "Yes! The class feels relevant mostly for students who are majoring in Classics or taking Classics courses and interested in the ethics or justice of doing that. For others, I'm not sure this class is the right fit.",
                "If this class is ever offered again and you study Classics, take it! This class is a great way to critically examine the relationship between your identity and your positionality within the discipline. Classics and the Greco-Roman world have had such a great impact on all of the world, and this class is the only course taught in the time I've been at Yale that allows for exploration and discussion of the discipline and ourselves."
