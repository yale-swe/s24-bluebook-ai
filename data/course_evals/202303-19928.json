I am so, so proud of my improvement this semester and incredibly excited about my finished portfolio for the class. I learned how to write poetry better and more engaging fiction and drama (focused on developing characters!!)\r\nThe exercises in each unit were also super helpful and the guest speakers in this course taught me so much about their experience and tips for writing in their field.\r\nThis class has great potential to give you a lot!! Oh, and the workshops... they were incredibly helpful!! Wow, I learned a lot. I'm so happy I took this course. But you must put in the effort :)",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths- How much you will learn and grow, the opportunity to be workshopped, the opportunity to give feedback to others and learn from other people's workshops, the study of 3 different fields of creative writing, with attention given to each one, the INCREDIBLE guest lecturers, REALLY good office hour accessibility, and the opportunity to engage with them, the interesting and helpful in-class and at-home exercises and the wonderful feedback!\r\nWeaknesses- Grading is NOT transparent and that sucks... I wish I knew where I stood in the class. I think there should be more clear theresholds and that grading should be about improvement. Since it was unclear how we are graded at all, it made writing a it difficult because I didn't know what the prof was looking for. The good thing is it allowed me to write what I wanted and what I felt was right, which is great for a creative course, but this is a college class and I wish the assignments did have some organized rubric. Another weakness was the imbalance in how much time people had for their workshop (it was very unequal) as well as the choice to have the person being workshopped stay silent. It felt almost unhelpful that they couldn't be a part of the discussion. Most of all, I disliked how superficially we addressed the readings and only loosely connected them to our gained skills. To that end, class discussions were sometimes boring when they didn't revolve around the workshop, and professor Spargo was not engaging enough in the first two units at least. I wish there were more in-class exercises and more interaction with learning how to write in the unit instead of just writing about it.",
                "Writing exercises are super fun and really allow you to build your creative sitting skill set. Feedback is also super great in this class and continually helps you improve.",
                "The high amount of feedback from the professor and classmates throughout the course was a strength, but we didn't actually write as much as I expected which was a weakness. Therefore, I think less reading assignments and more writing assignments would be more helpful in achieving the course's goal of helping students develop as creative writers."

                "Yes, I would!! I think if this student is a beginner to intermediate writer, they should absolutely take the class! The benefits far outweigh the problems with the class. I REALLY enjoyed writing my units and learning new skills for each one. I think class workshops were so helpful and interesting and reading other people's work as homework felt like a breath of fresh air from reading so much scholarly work for other classes.\r\nHowever, conversations often ran dry when not related to workshops and it was mostly the prof lecturing and not being engaging enough. Prof Spargo doesn't really teach how to write in these genres, but mostly talks about writing them and gives a few tips. I wish there was a bit more teaching and we could have benefitted from a lot more in-class activities. Also, you basically won't know your grade until after finals which sucks. I recommend checking in during office hours (which is a huge plus in this class!)",
                "Yes I would, definitely take this class, its super fun and very insightful.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student if they enjoy both reading and writing creative fiction. It is also very different from a lot of other courses as it allows students to be creative, so I think it is a good addition to one's schedule."
