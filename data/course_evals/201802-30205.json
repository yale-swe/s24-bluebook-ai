    "We learned the basic science behind a variety of technologies, including power generation, high-speed trains, and electric cars.",
    "By taking this course, I have learned about the scientific principles behind many things that I used to take for granted, such as the cogeneration of electricity and heat and transformers that utilize coils and metal pieces invented by Faraday. I have also learned about the importance of government policies and public awareness along with the advancement of scientific aspects in a society.",
    "Literally nothing.",
    "You learn NOTHING in this class. You learn a little bit about renewable energy and the course is somewhat of an intro to energy studies class but otherwise provides so little academic rigor that it ultimately just feels worthless as a class; it's also just not worth it to put up with Daniel Prober if he is the professor.",
    "I learned a significant amount about energy policy in this course. Additionally, I learned about Yale's history and contributions to the scientific community.",
    "The class covers a variety of topics, many of which pertain to recent advances in eco-friendly tech, with a special focus on Yale (though it includes national and international material as well). No topic is explored so deeply to the point where it the concepts are difficult to understand."

   "comments": [
    "The subjects of the course were a little unfocused (although I may just feel that way because I've never taken a survey course before).",
    "The strengths are definitely the knowledge covered throughout all the lectures. Professor Prober has a huge range of knowledge regarding the topics. It could potentially be improved by incorporating group seminars that demand the participation of every student, so that there could be a more diversity of ideas and that everyone would need to participate.",
    "This class was very fun and very very interesting. However, it the professor is not engaging at all.",
    "There are no strengths. None whatsoever. Never ever ever EVER take this class. The only thing that could save it is changing professors).",
    "Strengths of this course included the dedication of the professor, and the breadth of topics covered. A weakness was the organization\/structure of the course.",
    "The course was decently engaging and included two breaks during the three-hour class to help break up the lecture. The field trips were fun and welcome. The last few classes mostly of student presentations, which were very interesting to listen to, since you get to choose the topic you present on. As for weaknesses, the homework required annoyingly specific details and the TA was of literally no help at review sessions, since they were not an ENAS grad student and did not have to attend class. Also, the exam was ridiculously specific and included material that was only mentioned in class in passing. Study materials and resources were lacking."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in a getting a taste of various technologies in our everyday lives, but who don't want to go too deep into the science.",
    "Yes. It is a great revision of very important physics knowledge as well as the applied aspect of sciences.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that needs a science credit, however, I will say that there are definitely better courses out there with more engaging professors. The workload was close to nothing even for a summer class but it was just so mind-numbingly tedious and it was not worth it.",
    "Absolutely not. Just don't do it. SAVE. YOURSELF.  It's so awful and you'll be frustrated all the time.",
    "I would recommend it if you are looking for a chill Sc credit. If you want a fulfilling academic experience, look elsewhere."
