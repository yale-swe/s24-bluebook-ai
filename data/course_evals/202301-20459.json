                "I learned how to communicate things that have happened. I learned to communicate my plans for the future. I learned to communicate my thoughts and feelings about things better. I am now much better at listening comprehension of Portuguese.",
                "Understanding Portuguese culture, language and community",

                "Strength; it was low stakes with grading so I felt more inclined to learn for my own sake and not having to fear my grade. I enjoyed it a lot like this because I felt I was purely learning because I was interested in the class, and my techniques to get better were for myself and not for my grade.\r\n\r\nWeakened: I would say just a bit more structure with the grammar rules would be good. We did have some slides about some rules but it could be more in-depth.",
                "I had many other commitments and didnt put this class as a first priority. I should do that next semester",
                "I love how this course worked with using the language in very functional ways. I felt challenged every day to generate statements and express my ideas about myself and the things we watched and interact with in class. I prefer this language learning method over focus on grammar and writing, which doesn't as quickly correlate to language comprehension and functional use. I loved the two classes I took with Prof. Gonzalez Parada, and feel she brought valuable cultural learning to the classroom as well.",
                "Lots of support",
                "This course was great in that it prioritized conversation over rote grammar memorization. Just having Professor Gonzalez Parada  talk to us solely in Portuguese was a great help in learning vocabulary."

                "Yes! Honestly my favorite class, it is really engaging but there isnt high pressure and the workload is good. I learned so much because the class is in Portuguese while you learn Portuguese about Brazilian culture, so its like a two in one.",
                "Absolutely! Not only should people want to be a part of the lusophone world in general, but, this course (110 &120) is a beautiful way to explore the language by listening to it and using it to express who you are and your ideas about the world.",
                "Absolutely? It's provided a strong insight o culture and pushed me",
                "Yes. I think its. A great, safe place to learn portuguese. Students were engaged and th e Professor showed great dedication."
