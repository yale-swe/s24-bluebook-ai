                "1. Workload - Ximera could be useful but there is just simply too much work. The problem sets have way too many questions in them. In the end, students end up rushing through the PSET without really thinking the solutions through. Cut down on the number of questions per PSET; it would make the workload a lot more manageable and give students some time to do the work\r\n\r\n2. Course instructors\/ Lectures: almost no worked examples were given during class. All of it was theoretical\/conceptual without any examples being worked through--I will say there were some examples but these were the most basic ones. Try work through some advanced questions in class so students understand how the concepts can be applied to harder questions.",
                "I think the review sessions could have been improved.",
                "Strengths: workload manageable, lots of accessible help \r\nWeaknesses: lectures were often confusing and not engaging",
                "The weaknesses are the differences between who teaches you the material",
                "A strength of this course is that it forces the student to know how to apply the theorems of calculus and explain them in terms of different problems. This expands the view of calculus.",
                "More problems related to the actual topics would've been helpful but the professors were great at teaching. I just found myself doing problems on the test that were never discussed in class",
                "Strength - I believe that I learned a lot any my professor was very good at describing the topics and mathematics. \r\nWeakness - I came in late to the course and felt overwhelmed before the first midterm. There was not a ton of support, but I figured it out.",
                "The weaknesses is the teaching style i think it can be more engaging for students.",
                "I think the problem tests were a lot harder than the exams and in general the psets were very hard to do by yourself so this encourages relying on others for help a little too much.",
                "The teachers need to overall be prepared to communicate better in English. The language barrier is a big issue when it comes to teaching the basic concepts in class.",
                "It was perfect.",
                "This course is a good overview of calc 1. The biggest weakness of this course is how easy it is to get problem set answers in peer tutor office hours, without learning the material fully. More assessments, like low-stake quizzes, would be useful for students to know where they stand.",
                "Strengths: Makes it hard to fall through the cracks. You are always being forced to use the new knowledge you learned. Weakness: If you have taken calc before it may be boring."
