This didn't work out well if our discussion was rambling and we didn't get to cover all of the material from the readings. To improve this, it might be nice to get a preview of the reading, for example questions to consider about each reading, to help digest them as we are reading at home. Another way to improve this would be to ask each of the discussion leaders to meet with you about their presentations before they present to make sure they cover all the important points.",
                "The small class environment was conducive to good and animated conversations. One area for improvement is that over the course of the semester we never really got feedback on the smaller assignments we completed. It was a bit disappointing to never get feedback on our reading responses or presentations.",
                "The class has a lot going for it. The readings are really interesting and well selected. The focus on housing gave an interesting window into the history of Jewish New York. The students really made the class, and discussion was lively and free flowing. But there was something lacking in the organization of the course and the discussions that kept it from being truly excellent. Even though we went pretty chronologically it still felt like we were skipping around. Even when we were discussing the readings it felt like we were poking in our favorite parts to try and find a point instead of being a little more guided through."
