   "comments": [
    "I learned how to read for craft. I learned many strategies for writing & ways to approach essays whether they're ones I will write or ones written by others. I read so many incredible & very different essays & learned how great and how hard writing well can be.",
    "I learned so much! My writing got better, especially my editing skills and my authorial voice. Also really enjoyed close-reading essays for craft.",
    "I learned about reading for craft, which I something I have found to be useful in other areas of my academic pursuits. Specifically, learning this skill from English 120 has helped me to become more intentional about the readings I do for my other classes. I read to not only learn information, but to filter that information through my mind in a way that allows it to inform my path or synthesize it with other things I'm interested in. This has been a really important tool for me that opens up ways to make my academic work more fulfilling and meaningful.",
    "The reading selection with Prof. Robin was excellent. I learned to be a lot more incisive with essaywriting from breaking down sentence structures and techniques to deciding the stakes to take with writing. Additionally, I got to explore very different types of essays: from analytical ones with subtle insertions of personal tone to depravingly intimate comedic pieces laughingly self-indulgent with references.",
    "I really loved the readings we did and the essays we wrote for class. I improved my skills of reading essays for craft, and was able to apply what I learned to the 5 essay assignments. Most importantly for me, I used to be a very shy writer, but I feel like this class has strengthened my personal voice and my confidence in writing. Before this class, writing a personal essay was so daunting, I couldn't imagine turning out a new one every few weeks! But now I am confident in my writing and my voice and will continue writing with joy after this class. \r\nSkills: building a narrative voice in an essay, finding a \"public point,\" making writing more cohesive, writing humor essays\r\nI also became a better peer-editor and listener! I really appreciated the workshops in class.\r\nI loved writing the essays!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths include the small size, variety of pieces read & approaches to class discussion taken, & the flexibility that allowed us to focus on whatever interested us most or whatever we felt we were struggling with at the moment.",
    "The perfect number of assignments, and substantive feedback on everything! Workshopping was really fun - I just wished we had somehow been able to do more of that.",
    "The inclusion of workshops is a strength of this course because it was beneficial both as someone receiving and giving feedback. It also showed me the importance of collaboration in the writing process and was a real application of what we were doing independently by reading the text for craft. This course could be improved by more facilitation of collaboration beyond the workshop. This could look like encouraging the students from the beginning to establish a network of open communication to discuss the work of the class together.",
    "More time for feedback between the drafts and final papers as well as more discussion about each piece with peers would make this course a lot better. ENGL120 really gets you close with all the writers in the room, and just having a space to connect more and critique one another outside of designated workshop times would make it much better.",
    "Strengths: manageable amount of reading (so I could do it and take my time and actually learn from it), manageable workload, great discussions in class, the writing workshops were awesome, fun essay topics! I loved writing the essays!"

    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was a completely different approach to writing & just what I needed to really get the dusty old bones of the five paragraph essay structure from high school out of my mind. I cried doing so many different readings & then had to turn around and figure out what made me cry, which was such a cool experience! The readings will draw you in more than for any other class I've taken here, which is lovely and I'm sad it's over! So much growth in one class.",
    "YES! Personal essays are so much fun, and this course is really well-run. A great chance to improve writing, get to know other students and have fun doing it.",
    "I would recommend this class, because, as I mentioned, I grew as both a writer and an academic.",
    "Definitely, must take if youre interested in any type of writing. Will greatly improve your form and the way you perceive the world.",
    "YES! Take this class if you are interested in reading and writing personal\/narrative essays! It's so fun and you learn so much and build important writing skills. I am a junior, but wish I had taken this class as a first year  I would have improved my writing so much. It's fun and engaging and every essay is a different topic to explore :)"
