I loved learning about how the quantum world helps us understand the macroscopic world. The content, while mind melting at times, was absolutely fascinating. Easily one of my favorite classes I have taken. I'm really excited to take more classes related to this content.",

Specifically, some failures of classical mechanics, freely translating quantum particles, particle in a box, quantum harmonic oscillators and vibrational spectroscopy, barrier penetration, rigid rotors and rotational spectroscopy, spherical harmonics, the one electron hydrogen atom, and multi-electron atom models. All topics were approached with extremely detailed mathematical and physical calculations and quantitative understanding.",

                "This class is awesome. It's incredibly well-organized, the lectures are interesting, and while the topics are hard, Professor Vaccaro has reasonable expectations for his students.",
                "I think my favorite thing about this class is the way Professor Vaccaro uses the psets to expose you to information before you encounter it in class. It seems completely counterintuitive, but it is incredible. While the homework is challenging, there is lots of support to complete it. It was so fun to get to class on Friday and see an equation you already proved to yourself earlier in the week.",
                "This class relies quite heavily on calculus, but Prof. Vaccaro explains the math along the way. The psets did get quite ahead of the lecture material sometimes, so it is crucial to utilize out of class resources (office hours, peer tutors, and discussion) to make it happen.",
                "I really did enjoy how the content was taught in class (although 9:25 is a little early for my taste), my only complaint is that I wish we could be more rigorous with the math involved. I feel like I could have learned and understood a lot more if this class had a differential equations requirement, and we were able to skip some of the explanations of eigenfunctions, operators, and differential equations in general (I might be biased because I like math though).",
                "Despite the material being difficult and there being a lot of it, the class is taught extremely well. The slides and handouts are very well made and highly informative, while the problem sets are fair and give plenty of hints and bits of information to help guide you through the problems themselves. Professor Vaccaro is an excellent lecturer and is always eager to respond to questions in and after class. It's unfortunate that the second midterm of the class is the week before reading period, but at least it makes studying for the final easier since everything is somewhat fresh.",
                "Strengths: interesting material and applications, great p-sets (essential for exam)\r\nWeaknesses: slides, especially towards the end, could use more text contextualizing the equations. Accompanying handouts were interesting but often times too detailed relative to what we needed to know for homework and exams.",
                "The problem sets were very thorough but difficult to complete if you didnt go to peer tutor hours. lecture itself was just going through equations and formulas and it was difficult to see stuff actually come together until the problem sets. the only actual practice we had were the problem sets so i think future classes would GREATLY benefit from more practice problems with wave equations and the different models and such when studying for exams i felt i only had one or two example problems to learn from and i really think i would have benefitted from more practice problems",
                "One of the major strengths of the course is how the material is presented by Professor Vaccaro and how new topics are introduced. There are no weakness of this course",
                "Strengths: an abundance of materials to study with, the professor (Dr. Vaccaro has taught this course for 20+ years and it shows, hes so knowledgeable and good at explaining student questions), very fair psets and tests (albeit harddoable if you go to office hours)",
                "Strengths: very thorough, problems on homework are very informative, lots of documents and lecture notes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this might be just the material being very hard, but a lot of problem statements were very long when it was not necessary, which made completing the question more confusing, no practice midterms or final",
                "Very organized learning, though some times overwhelming.",
                "Strengths: Vaccaros lecturing, for the most part. He is very clear. There are also clear expectations for most assignments and exams.\r\nWeaknesses: the final exam is unreasonably long. Is it also really necessary to have 3-hour midterm exams? No other class needs to. Some concepts could have been explained more accessibly: hell verbally describe complicated equations in a way that is near impossible to understand.",

                "Absolutely! It's a great introduction to some pretty challenging topics, but Professor Vaccaro does a great job of explaining things and has tons of opportunities for further explanation\/help with problems.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you have A LOT of time to dedicate to it.",
                "Absolutely yes. If you struggled with organic chemistry, physical chemistry might be your thing. This class was so interesting and explained all of the big picture chemistry concepts you learned about in high school chem. If you're interested in fundamentals, this class will teach them to you. My favorite classes were the ones where we'd end with chalk on every board or where we proved a principle (and often these happened in the same class).",
                "Absolutely! The class is rigorous and challenging, but so rewarding and cool! Being able to understand the world from such a fundamental (and sometimes a 'lil trippy) level is super exciting. Also, this is probably the best organized class I've ever had.",
                "Yes, quantum is SUPER COOL. You will learn so much in this course, and if your passionate about chemistry you will enjoy the material. Fair warning the math is really something.",
                "If you want to\/have to learn some intro QM, I'd recommend this class. It's a good deal of work, but I think it's ultimately manageable and it gives you an excellent foundation in using wave equations and thinking about the world in a quantum way.",
                "Almost everyone who takes this course does so as required by the chemistry major. It can be really challenging (in my opinion much more than p-chem I) but the p-sets can be kinda fun and play a big role in learning the material.",
                "no. only take it if you need to for the chem major. it was hard to focus on actually learning the material when the problem sets were so overwhelming and i was just struggling to finish them. i only really learned from going to office hours and peer tutor hours.",
                "Yes, please take this course with Professor Vaccaro",
                "Highly highly recommend this course to anyone, chem major or not. Dont need to know a lot of math, dont need chem knowledge coming inleave knowing the underpinnings of the fundamental physical phenomena. Be prepared to work for the knowledge but its so worth it.",
                "I would, with the warning that the course is very mathematical and it is easy to get lost in the details and lose sight of the big picture.",
                "Yes. Its required for many chem majors and great for other interested students. Too much work though if not required.",
                "If you have to; its a lot of work. But not a bad class.",
                "This course is a great foundation to quantum mechanics, just be prepared to put in a lot of time and effort to digest the material.",
                "Would not recommend this course for most students, but would recommend to any student who possesses the necessary prerequisites, has 10-14 hours open per week in their schedule, and is deeply interested in a comprehensive introduction to quantum mechanics."
