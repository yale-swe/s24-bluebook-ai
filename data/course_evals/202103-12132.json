                "I learned so much about Japan in terms of art and culture and history. The class also taught me how much you can learn from art and enjoy art in an academic context.",

                "I was introduced to the history of art in Japan and examined different time periods.",
                "I learned about early Japanese art! And got better at analyzing art objects and writing about them.",
                "A lot of exposure to Japanese art from prehistory to the medieval period",

                "I learned more about Japanese art history",

Images that now seem ubiquitous become far more fascinating in the context of geographical location, foreign influences, and deeply pondering changes over time. Unlike more didactic courses, this one encourages personal speculation and productive disagreement, which makes learning the material much more engaging than simple memorization.",
                "I learned about Japanese history.",

                "I think the discussion sections in the course were a fun place to discuss topics and the lectures were very interesting to listen to. Sometimes it would have been helpful to have a few more words with info on the slides.",
                "This course had many strengths. I appreciated how the class was recorded in addition to the live lecture because it allowed me to refer back to class material when needed. I thought the structure of class assignments (brief notes) was also very fair and engaging.",
                "Honestly, this course is great. I love any classes taught by Prof. Yiengpruksawan.",
                "Strengths: Mimi is great - she is enthusiastic about the material and happy to talk with students. And a wide range of material was covered in the class; it felt like a good overview. I also liked the brief notes as an informal way to learn more about individual works of art.\r\nWeaknesses: I think because we covered so much, it sometimes felt like we moved quickly from thing to thing and they didn't all relate to each other.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Mimi! She is such a caring, knowledgeable professor. She gives prompt, thoughtful feedback.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- more students might have taken the class or been more engaged if it wasn't at 9:25 am",
                "The course is great. Wouldnt reccomdend taking it if your not interested in the subject matter.",
                "i love prof mimi's classes. she is so knowledgeable and meets every student where they are and works to make sure each student retains information in the way that is best for their learning style",
                "The course really allows individual exploration; while periodic written assignments are required throughout, the student always has the option to write on whatever they find interesting in the format that seems appropriate. This format redefines engagement, especially compared to other art history courses.",
                "The course was flexible and relaxed, so it was very conducive to learning.",
                "Strength: this course provides insight about an area of art history that is often not discussed in traditional art history surveys.\r\nWeakness: the majority of the images for this course were unlabeled (no title, no artist \/ culture, no size, no medium) which made it difficult to take notes and then write essays on these objects."

                "absolutely prof mimi is one of the best at Yale i have ever encountered",
                "Absolutely. The course is incredibly thoughtful, in depth, and provides fascinating context to the thought systems and images that pervade Japan, even today. Mimi is very encouraging of students to contribute their own thoughts in an environment that quite successfully becomes both non-stressful and intellectually inquisitive.",
                "Yes! Mimi is great and the material is very interesting.",
                "If a student was interested in Japanese art and writing more creative essays then I would recommend this course. This course does also require some amount of self-discipline to do the readings and the essays as it's more free form."
