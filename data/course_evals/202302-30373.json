Dr. Morrison fosters a phenomenal class atmosphere of open discussions on compelling topics that relate to so many parts of our daily lives and professions, in and outside of medicine. I cannot recommend this course enough!",
                "Strengths: The course explored many different aspects of medicine and how they have been explored through literature. Additionally, the class was bolstered by many eye-opening class trips and guest speakers. Weaknesses: At times, the Professor's personal interests clouded the course's original intent. Some of the lectures felt loosely connected to Medicine."

                "Absolutely! You are missing out if you don't take this class. It is one of the best courses in all of Yale. The class is particularly relevant in today's world because it ties in our sense of humanity into our professions. The readings and course discussions serve as a blueprint and guide for students on how to hold onto their sense of humanity as they enter into their future professions. This course will enrich with you with new perspectives. The list of readings are truly phenomenal as well -- clearly hand-picked with great thought and care for the course.",
