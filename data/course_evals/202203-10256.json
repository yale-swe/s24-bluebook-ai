                "Strengths: cool topics and discussion; Weaknesses: way too much reading, I personally also would've preferred slightly more instruction during our sessions, but the discussion was still good",
                "This class' strengths lie in the format of the textbook and the readings provided. However, the class depends on the other students to determine whether it will be an interesting or stimulating conversation. Luckily, our group had such a dynamic. However, this class could be bad without such a group.",
                "Strengths: Clear expectations for course, routine-like sections \r\nWeaknesses: Very little contextualization on professors part; each class is centered around student discussion which oftentimes steered off topic.",
                "Most of the course relied on one book, Foundations of Econ Analysis of Law by Steve Shavell, and other associated papers. The readings were quite long and difficult, and the class discussions didnt really touch on them, sometimes. The best part of the class was the people. We were all sort of confused and made a group chat and commiserated together. It was so funny to see everyones personalities come out. Class was very funny as a result. Professor Landis never really taught, he just asked us questions in a Socratic fashion and let the class talk and debate among themselves. He really spoke up near the end of the course, when we were doing antitrust stuffthats his area of expertise. His first class was legendary. We went over the syllabus and introduced ourselves. Then class was dismissed. It took a total of 10 minutes.",
                "Strengths: Reading list. There's a solid textbook, and a bunch of good foundational texts. Class is also really good at bringing out a lot of interesting pieces to the puzzle.\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of the reading list is from the 70s and 80s, so quite old. Also, class is not super well led with a tendency for us to overly focus on irrelevant points and with Professor Landis not doing much to guide the discussion.",
                "The strength of this class is it. It had a very good reading. However, I did not find seminar, engaging or instructive. Seminar consisted of people sharing their opinions in response to questions posed by Professor Landis. I felt as though there is no real instruction from Professor Landis about the material. The seminar is often felt disorganized and poorly moderated with the conversation being dominated by a handful of people.",
                "It was a good course! There were great discussions among classmates. At times, the readings were a bit heavy."

                "I thoroughly enjoyed this course and would recommend it. However, if you are looking for a professor who will support you through each assignment or through topics, this is not the class. The class relies on other students and the textbook.",
                "If truly interested in economic theory and the intersections of law, then yes! This course is very theory heavy and you will be expected to read a whole econ textbook to supplement discussion.",
                "Yes I would. A very interesting, niche topic. Class is rather straightforward, one midterm and one 10-15 page final paper.",
                "I dont know if Id recommend it. I got lucky with a good section, but this class has the potential to be very, very boring. But I personally had a lot of fun because of the people in the class. Its an interesting perspective of the law and perhaps worth taking if youre into that.",
                "Here's the deal: If you like the topic, take the course and make the most of it. If you're iffy, or not super into it, I think there are better things to do with your time. Also, if you need a good professor who guides the class and checks the annoying person in the seminar and gives you feedback on your work and sets clear expectations: this is not the class for you. But, if you need another EP&E or ECON credit, think that this is a cool subject and aren't too pressed about having a well-run seminar, then would definitely recommend. Just be mindful of what you're going into, as Prof. Landis' experience is not exactly in teaching.",
                "I dont think I would recommend this course. I think there are plenty of other EP&E courses that are more organized and intellectually rigorous. At the end of the day, Im confident that Professor Landis is very knowledgeable about the course content, but that knowledge did not come across in seminar. The class felt more like a reading group than a seminar, and I think I couldve gotten just about as much out of the class by reading Stephen Shavells, Foundations of the Economic Analysis of Law with a group of friends. All that being said, Professor Landis is a very kind man, and I never doubted that he worked very hard to ensure the success of the class. Also, I was proud of the final paper I wrote, which relied heavily on the readings, professor Landis assigned.",
