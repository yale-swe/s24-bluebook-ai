    "I learned a lot about genre theory and the differences and similarities between tragedy, drama of reconciliation, tragicomedy, comedy, etc. I learned how to write an effective reading response each week and how to analyze plays with a focus on reconciliation. I also became more knowledgeable about the Western Canon, since I was able to read 10 plays I had never read before and learn about writers such as Sophocles, Brecht, and Eugene O' Neill."

    "It was rewarding to have only five students in our class because we were able to each share all of our thoughts, have meaningful discussions, and get to know each other. I also loved the Art Gallery portion of the class. We all got to choose any piece of art and analyze its relation to reconciliation. This was a super interesting and thought-provoking task because we all picked very different pieces of art. My least favorite part of the class was that the first couple plays we read like Oedipus at Colonus and Philoctetes were kind of boring and not very relevant today. I would rather do only one old Greek play at the most, because there are so many excellent modern plays we could do instead. I really enjoyed The Caucasian Chalk Circle and A Moon for the Misbegotten. I also would like it if we got the opportunity to watch more of the plays instead of just reading them. Professor Hagens is very friendly and knows so much about literature, theatre, philosophy, etc. which made this a great learning environment."

    "Yes! Reconciliation is hard topic to talk about, and we barely even think about it, really. But it's worthwhile to discuss and understand, and Prof. Hagens does an incredible job making it relevant and interesting.",
    "Yes. This class is great because the only work is basically reading a short play and doing 1 long reading response each week. This allows you to delve into each play without being stressed out about having to read too much, which can happen in other literature classes. This class is great for people of any major who are interested in reading plays. I hadn't read too many plays before, and this class introduced me to a few that I really liked."
