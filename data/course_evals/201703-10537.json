    "This course is more about exercising previous knowledge than it is about gaining new knowledge, but that being said it was useful to learn how engineering experiments could be setup and run in order to illustrate many of the scientific design considerations industrial engineers must understand when building reactors and other processes.",
    "I learned how to write a technical research paper based on experimental evidence. I learned how to use applicable engineering software such as Origin and ASPEN."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The main strength of the course is the quality of the instructor, Professor Van Tassel, and the engaging laboratory sessions. The main weakness is that this course is probably unnecessary from an academic point of view. The concepts that govern all of the labs are not new, but there is no way around this and the ABET standards require a course like this.",
    "The strengths of this course were its experiments. Though they were easy enough to carry out in one day, the experiments were interesting and packed full of important engineering concepts. The theoretical explanations before each experiment really helped students approach lab report writing. The only weakness of this course was that many of the experiments didn't work correctly. I spent many frustrating hours dealing with technical errors instead of collecting valuable data.",
    "It didn't seem as though lab reports were being graded evenly between students - it was all personal improvement, which strikes me a rather unfair."

   "comments": [
    "This course should be taken by ABET Chemical Engineering majors - people in other majors will not have the proper course background to take this and the course is much more work than your normal Yale course so only take this if you need to!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. It really improved my technical writing abilities, and I am much more comfortable summarizing and synthesizing research.",
    "Required for the chem e major, so no?"
