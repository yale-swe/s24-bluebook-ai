The other students in the class were very strong musicians, which made the class fun and engaging. Professor Boughton also gave helpful feedback. However there were so many students in the class that  each student did not actually get very much time to conduct, as everyone needed to have a turn. So I ended up conducting once for 10 minutes about every 3 classes and not getting much in-class practice. I wish that there had been fewer students in the class or that the time had been managed better.",
