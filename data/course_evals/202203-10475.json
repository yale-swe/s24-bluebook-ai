                "This course prompted a lot of thought about some really cool philosophical problems approached from a literary point of view. In seminar, we approached classic texts and films as thought experiments towards a particular philosophical end, and combined some interesting close reading with the philosophical intuitions they pumped to derive some intriguing conclusions.",
                "I got the opportunity to interact with thought experiments across philosophy and natural sciences, in both their stripped down and literary forms. We analyzed their intellectual and literary merits, while discussing the contents of their philosophical questions in seminar. This class made me a much stronger philosopher and writer -- especially in terms of combining philosophy with close-readings in my papers.",
                "We learned about different thought experiments spanning philosophy, literature, and science. All the readings prompted fascinating discussions about each syllabus unit. I got better at writing (from a phil + lit angle), articulating my thoughts in class, and seeing different problems with different perspectives.",
                "I learnt about thought experimentation in a variety of disciplines which was knowledge that surprised me with its level of complexity, and that I also found really enjoyable!",
                "The basis of thought experiments, suppositional thinking, and various thought experiments that explore various ethical, existential, and logical scenarios. We really go full interdisciplinary and talk on topics such as Frankenstein, qualia, the Trolley Problem, Drowning Child Pond thought experiment, consciousness, Turing Machines, and more.\r\n\r\nI learned a lot about Derek Parfit's Reasons and Persons and Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations. Throughout the course, I also got more confident in my ability to contribute to the conversation and write essays."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Grimstad is an INCREDIBLE professor, and he is very good at facilitating classroom discussions. The material for this course was very engaging, including films, and the feedback I received on papers was helpful. No weaknesses!",
                "It's truly an awesome course. The only weakness is I wish there was more Thought Experiments we could do but there's only so many weeks in a semester.",
                "Strengths: Professor Grimstad!!! He's completely brilliant, hilarious, and kind, and he runs a great class, really interesting course content (great readings and films), fascinating class discussions with a nice mix of student and professor input, lots of freedom for creativity on the papers and within the syllabus\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes discussions got repetitive and it often felt like everyone was fighting each other to get a word in instead of really listening, some of the heavier philosophical texts were pretty difficult",
                "Strengths: 1. The readings/viewings in this class are an absolute treat. Both classic and contemporary literature and film. 2. Prof Grimstad is unique in his ability to produce paragraphs of essay-quality sentences on the fly. It was an experience to watch. 3. He's also extremely helpful and passionate about the stuff he's teaching - it's palpable. Weaknesses: 1. Although seminar oftentimes drifted to unexpected places, I wish Prof Grimstad steered the discussion more towards some interesting thematic ideas, instead of the wide tangents that the class often went on. 2. The class was much more English heavy than philosophy heavy, which was a con for me, but might be a pro for some.",
                "Professor Grimstad is by far the biggest strength of this class. He began each seminar with a little starter of his thoughts on the readings and possible ideas to pursue before opening it up for discussion. The sheer enthusiasm and excitement he had for the material became immediately clear with every class; no matter how dry the reading, Grimstad always had some question to be excited about and to stoke our curiosity about. On that note, the class structure is amazing, with the progression of the subjects we look at making intuitive sense and flowing into each other seamlessly.  That said, I would be negligent to mention how important it is to have good classmates for this seminar to be enjoyable; we had some very diverse perspectives from the humanities to the sciences and that made the class such a joy to be in (even when I didn't do the readings).",
                "The course was very well organized and the discussions were lively and engaging. Essays were appropriately timed and feedback was super helpful. The syllabus shifted a bit as we went along, and the flexibility was a strength. The only improvement could be that sometimes movies (which require some time) were assigned a few days before discussions, but this wasn't too bad.",
                "Incredible syllabus, and very engaging class discussions. Perfect for someone with eclectic interests - probably less perfect as a philosophy seminar",
                "The premise of the course and the works we engaged with were all spectacular, and Professor Grimstad is wonderful and engaging. I did find the vocabulary of the discussions hard to get into, especially the scientific ones, so it might have been helpful for those ideas to have been broken down more concretely first, considering that a lot of English/Humanities majors take this class.",
                "Strengths: Loved the discussion format. Professor Grimstad is a gem and so fun to talk to. He often goes on tangents that are both illuminating and incredibly entertaining. Thus, I learned about many disparate things throughout the course.\r\nImprovements: Sometimes I wish discussions went longer or were smaller so we had more time to talk. We talked about essays as an afterthought, and that sometimes meant I didn't have enough time to prepare as much as I would have liked due to having a week or so until it was due. We skipped a section about simulations, which was really unfortunate."

                "YES! Professor Grimstad is incredible--take any class you can with him! This course was extremely interesting, and it forced me to think in ways I hadn't before. I enjoyed getting to watch and discuss films in this class, too.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! One of my favorite classes ever.",
                "Yes! The course content was awesome and interesting and was a great break from dry and repetitive readings that happen in most courses. The syllabus does a great job building on itself and the concepts throughout the course, and Professor Grimstad gives a lot of flexibility to let students choose what interests them most for class discussions and in the essays. I would recommend this course most of all for Professor Grimstad-he's amazing! Funny, kind, and insanely intelligent. He always had interesting and helpful things to say about the course material, and listening to him was truly impressive because he's so brilliant. My friends and I in the class frequently left talking about how great and refreshing he was as a professor",
                "This is an awesome fourth/fifth class that deals with some fascinating themes from a really cool literary angle. The readings are something everyone should do in life anyway - because they're thought-provoking and instant classics. If you want to explore how literature and philosophy can complement each other beautifully, this is a great class to do so.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in both philosophy and literature! You get to read some pivotal authors in both fields and engage with their core arguments in class. The papers require a bit of experience with close-reading or philosophical argumentation, but Grimstad has a very favorable learning curve and will help you do well on the papers if you need help! Take this class, it made my semester much much more enjoyable.",
                "Absolutely! This was the best class I've taken at Yale by a mile. Especially if they are interested in AI, ethics, or specific readings on the syllabus. If not, it will still be fantastic. Taking it as a STEM major opened up lots of new interests for me, and it was great to hear different perspectives from everyone taking the class. Prof. Grimstad is excellent at leading discussions and there was never a dull moment.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. This course was phenomenal",
                "100%",
                "If the description and syllabus sound interesting to you, youll definitely enjoy it. If youre coming in with a background in English, Philosophy, or something more STEMmy, be prepared to really get into both of the other two!",
                "Absolutely! I highly recommend this course to another student. The interdisciplinary nature of the course allowed for a diverse and fascinating range of discussions on topics. The discussion format was engaging and the professor, Professor Grimstad, was a joy to learn from. Overall, this course was both intellectually stimulating and enjoyable, and I believe any student would benefit from taking it."
