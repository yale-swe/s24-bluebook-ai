In particular, we often discussed how texts related to or referenced each other, which was particularly helpful in understanding how the canon has developed. Also received great feedback on essay writing.",

I learned about Irish history and how it affected its writers (ie modernization affecting Yeats; the Troubles affecting Heaney). I also learned about popular themes within Irish literature (such as the Big House) and was introduced to works from a variety of genres (poetry, prose, biographies, music lyrics, and films).",

                "Course presented an amazing syllabus of authors and their writings, paired with an excellent professor.",
                "Too much reading and not enough time in class to get to all of it, but great collection of literature. Sometimes discussion felt unresolved or not very open (maybe people hadnt read the books)",
                "The course was enjoyable, but I think could have been improved by a more structured approach to teaching the history of Ireland. Also, there was often simply too much reading to do, and I think discussion would have been improved if we'd been able to spend longer with each text.",
                "Strengths: amazing professor, class was generally engaged, perfect amount of work\/writing. Also, very very good syllabus- almost all text were not only great but easy to read and discuss. You didn't need to know any Irish history or literary theory to take the class, but our discussions were rarely superficial and always interesting. The only real weakness was that sometimes the reading load was very heavy and we only ended up discussing some of it, but I think that's a natural consequence of the class being taught for the first time.",
                "Strengths: Professor Cleary is fantastic and his class is incredibly well-organized. The expectations for every week are very clear, and every assignment I write for the class feels like it has a strong purpose and makes me a better writer. The discussion post each week was especially helpful to get me to think about the week's readings. The breadth of the course is also great. We truly got to read works by a variety of Irish authors (from 1900s to now), and we read a variety of genres (from poetry, fiction, and plays to film and music lyrics). I felt truly immersed in the class and got a lot out of it. Overall, an incredibly organized class with an extremely dedicated and caring professor!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",

                "This is one of the best English classes I've ever taken (though I think even non-English majors interested in Irish literature would enjoy the course). So much amazing literature\/culture has come out of Ireland during the time period discussed in this class, and I grew to appreciate both authors I'd never even heard of before and very famous ones I'd never read. Could not recommend it more highly- everyone should take a Prof. Cleary class before they graduate, and this was a particularly good and accessible one!",
                "Yes, absolutely! This was one of the most organized and intriguing English classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Cleary is fantastic and cares a lot about his students and the class. For instance, before each class, he would send out a long, detailed email giving background on that week's readings and a list of questions to provoke further thought. After we submitted our discussion posts to Canvas each week, Professor Cleary would send a personalized response back to every student, engaging with them about their post and their thoughts. I've never had an English professor who did that! Not to mention, the course is also just interesting in general. We learned so much about contemporary Irish history and were exposed to the canon of Irish writers. I also really appreciated that Professor Cleary included a wide range of genres as well as many works by women writers (the course felt very balanced and complete!). All in all, this is truly a gem in the English department. Take it, take it, take it!",
