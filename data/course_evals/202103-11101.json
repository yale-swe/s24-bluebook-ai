If you have never worked in front-end development, the psets can be a little frustrating--you will spend a lot of time adjusting svg coordinates to get stuff in the right place. Definitely ask for some advice on front-end best practices. I asked about halfway through the semester and then everything became much simpler (little tricks like making all positions relative to a constant, so if you want to move every element you can just change the constant rather than having to edit every coordinate). \r\n\r\nMost of the lectures and reading for this course are not focused on the actual creation of visualizations, but rather on visualization theory. Rushmeier is a great lecturer and does her best to make this stuff interesting, but the material is honestly so abstract and bizarre. It is hard to believe that someone even had the idea to write this textbook. By the end of the course you'll be able to able to give a little ted talk explaining the \"why\" of any visualization (I'm sure everyone at Yale can explain a bar chart in 15 seconds, but this course will give you enough material to explain it for 15 minutes). The exams mostly focus on vis. theory, and to do well on the exams and pre-lecture quizzes, you actually have to do the theory reading. So I definitely learned a lot, but I'm not convinced that I really needed to know any of this stuff to begin with.",

                "Strengths: I found the material very interesting, and enjoyed the assignments. Professor Rushmeier is very kind. Recorded lectures were helpful for studying.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are not the more interesting (I usually zone out but I do that with most lectures so maybe it's not this class's fault). Exams seemed sort of overly specific - just a lot of memorization of materials in readings and lectures; multiple choice questions might be more reasonable. I also didn't really appreciate the \"coding\" part of exam 2; it seemed too specific to be useful when memorized.",
                "Strengths: Holly's speaking is very clear. Everyone can follow her.\r\nWeaknesses: Exams are hard for people who are not good at memorizing small details in the slides and textbook.",
                "The guest speakers were really great! And the TAs and Prof Rushmeier try their best. I also really appreciated the flexibility of the hybrid lecture model. \r\n\r\nThe exams were extremely difficult and did not really test critical thinking, but rather just rote memorization of tiny details in the lectures. The course material wasn't really engaging enough to leave an impact. In a year I'll probably have forgotten about 95% of the course content.",
                "One of the strengths of this course was the pre lecture assignments, they forced you to be engaged with the material the entire time, even if you were taking the course asynchronously. I will say, I was more attentive in class when I went in person.",
                "Strengths: The projects helped me practice JavaScript programming. I enjoyed the last assignment in particular because it was more open-ended (I had more freedom with the design)\r\n\r\nWeakness: The lectures are a bit repetitive of the readings. I would suggest covering more new material in the lectures rather than repeating much of what was already presented in the readings.",
                "I wish PSETs were worth more of the grade, because they took me a long time to complete.",
                "A strength of the class were the TAs - they were capable and helpful during office hours whenever I had questions. One place for improvement, in my opinion, would be the decrease of the number of overall assignments. It sometimes felt like there were overlaps of assignments, between reading homeworks, problem sets, exams. Being more intentional about not having those assignments overlap would have been a positive.",
                "I believe the reading responses are a strength that keeps students engaged with the course content. The fact that there is a Zoom option is also helpful, in case students don't feel it is safe for them to attend in person. The structure of the assignments is another pro as they are split up into manageable pieces, where each question also you to display specific content. I believe the early class time is a weakness. Additionally, in past iterations of the class it has been co-taught by Benedict Brown, but now that he is not teaching it feels like there isn't enough teaching of the coding side of things. Since the assignments are code based I believe that there should be more of that whether it means being co-taught again or having supplemental videos or section to focus on the coding that will help prepare you for the assignments. I also believe the exams are another weakness as some very specific details were asked that I didn't always see as necessary to understanding of concepts in vis.",
                "Strengths: good psets, great TAs, generally interesting content. Weaknesses: sometimes I felt the content of lectures/exams was a little narrowly focused on definitions or classifications from the textbook. While I think that information has some value, I think it would be more useful as a springboard for discussing more interesting visualizations. e.g. looking more at visualizations in the NYT, WP, WSJ and what makes them effective or not.",
                "The lectures could definitely be more engaging. The exam is kind of just testing your memory retention rather than anything meaningful. I think having open ended projects and assigning a larger project that is slowly worked towards at the end of the term would be much more fun and engaging! Otherwise, lecture and exam material went pretty much hand in hand with textbook chapters.",
                "Strengths: The problem sets were okay. Took less time than most CS psets and were usually explained pretty well in lecture. TFs were helpful. Final pset was more of a project where you chose your own dataset and visualizations, which was nice. Weaknesses: Professor Rushmeier is not an engaging lecturer at all and lecture slides are so hard to follow and basically useless for review before a test. So hard to stay attentive in class. Biggest weakness if definitely the exams, which were actually so absurdly horrible. They asked questions about the most obscure minimal details from the hundreds of pages of readings we had and required brute memorization which is ridiculous, especially for a CS class. Overall way more weaknesses than strengths.",
                "The strengths were the assignments. They were very applicable and enjoyable. The grading was quite fair for these assignments. However, the exams were obscure details from the course and was sheer memorization of the content from the class/textbook readings.",
                "Lectures and exams cover textbook content almost exactly so that is nice. Psets are much more D3 focused. Exams are very detail specific but they are fair.",
                "This course could definitely use a front-end development workshop or maybe even a section. The course did a great job explaining D3, but as someone new to javascript and HTML, I found myself wasting a lot of time on the assignments fiddling with seemingly less technical features, like centering text or linking a css file. The assignments themselves cover an excellent range of D3 topics, and I feel pretty proficient in the library now. This course is also really heavy in theory and history of visualizations. I'm not sure if this is a strength or a weakness, but I personally found this aspect of the course to not be that engaging. TLDR; this course could have been more technical, and less abstract.",
                "Clear topics and arrangements. Follow the original schedule very well. Useful and interesting assignments, which help me understand the materials in this course much. Really learned many things in this course, which are useful in the future.\r\nWe really need to remember much knowledge to prepare for the tests.",
                "It is very solid and strong.",
                "Strength: a lot of hands-on exercises on the development of data visualization.",
                "I hope the range covered by the exams could be less since it was simply too many things to memorize, or perhaps changing the question form on the exams from free-response types to multiple-choice questions would also significantly help with a smaller memory load during the review.",
                "I really disliked the textbook for this class, and the tests that were primarily based off of it. A lot of times it felt like I was reading and memorizing very complex ways to say simple things about graphs and data visualization. And the tests felt like they tested memorization more than anything else.",

Also if they want a predictable CS elective that has a moderate workload, and they're okay knowing that the exams are very detailed and memorization heavy.",
                "Yes. If you are willing to put up with a few memorization-focused exams, I think the visualization skills in this class are useful, and the lectures are pretty easy to follow.",

                "NO. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. One of my least favorite classes at Yale thus far.  I'm Computing and the Arts and this is one of the classes to choose from to fill elective requirements and I honestly have no idea why. I learned nothing and the exams were so horrible. Problem sets were doable with help from TFs but as I said I learned nothing. Do not take this class. It is not a gut and one of the only CS electives where you actually have to do the readings. Rushmeier should change the format entirely, especially the exams.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone interested in data vis or looking for a manageable CS elective. It was very enjoyable and reasonable.",
                "Its a pretty simple, clear course. If youre looking for a CS elective that is predictable, has clear instruction, and has some pretty enjoyable psets, take this course.",
