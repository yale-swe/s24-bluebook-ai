                "Yes! I would certainly recommend this course to anyone looking to start out learning Arabic. It is important to understand that the course is structured in such a way that you could put in very little work or a very lot of work, but since a lot of the learning happens outside of class time, the amount of effort put in outside of class is a lot of what impacts success in the class",
