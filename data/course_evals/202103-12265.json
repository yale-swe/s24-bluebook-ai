                "The course covers the first 18 chapters of Shelmerdine's Introduction to Latin. It provides a fairly comprehensive introduction to the elements of Latin grammar including the all 5 declensions, all verb tenses and some use of the passive voice, and some syntactical functions of each case. The course emphasized vocabulary and translation. I learned a lot of Latin vocab, and I developed the skills to begin to understand the case system and translate slightly more difficult Latin passages. I improved much more than I thought I would starting from 0 knowledge of Latin, so I am happy with what I got out of the course.",
                "I have learnt much more about the basic elements of grammar, as well as what it takes to approach a translation.",
                "A foundational knowledge of the basics elements of Latin grammar.",
                "This was my first exposure to Latin, so looking back at my progress having gone from zero to so much more has been really enlightening. I enjoyed the process of learning about and improving my abilities to understand the Latin language and the Roman world as well.",
                "I learnt a lot about not only the Latin language and its linguistic principles, but also about classical culture. This has been a great introduction to the Roman world. Grammatical study was rigorous and the regular quizzes gave my term a sense of rhythm and discipline."

                "This was a rigorous and intensive course, which was helpful in learning a lot of Latin within a short period of time. I appreciate the authentic reading materials and the emphasis on learning about classical civilisation at the same time as the language itself.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the course may not suit those who do not have a lot of time on their hands however. I have been wondering if a less intense, half-credit course could potentially also be offered."

                "I took this course sort of randomly. I had to get my language credit and wanted to take something unique. I think that if you are interested in Classics, the course is well-designed and interesting. If you just want to get the language credit out of the way and don't have a specific interest in Latin, there are definitely much easier language credits out there.",

                "I took this course out of an interest in how learning Latin might influence my English vocabulary and grammar. I came into the class with 0 Latin knowledge, which made the first few weeks very overwhelming--it's a bit like learning to walk by sprinting down a hill, forcing your legs to catch up. But even with the constant anxiety over falling behind with the workload, I enjoyed the course and would recommend it.",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed Latin and hope to continue my path with it. The instructors were great and coursework was manageable as well.",
                "Yes, especially if they are interested in classical culture and would like a great way to start. The course covers a lot of ground in a short amount of time, and is perfect for those who are interested in languages and linguistics."
