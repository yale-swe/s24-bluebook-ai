                "Learned about the rich geologic history and ecologic history of the wyoming\/montana\/utah\/colorado region! It's the wild west! (kind of) We read a lot of papers and were exposed to a diverse array of geologic techniques. The constant debate and open questions in class allowed us to really explore topics in depth. Learned how to succinctly describe the key points of a research paper and put them into debate with one another",

                "strengths - I learned about the Sully monster and a ton of fantastic fabulous dinosaurs and wild beasts! Who needs Harry Potter when you have such a thrilling world at your fingertips!!! But in all seriousness, the graduate students in the class brought SO much richness and insight to each class and I loved the format of individual investigations that were shared with the class for discussion and summary. it makes classes so much more dynamic. also loved the poll\/vote at the start of the class which allowed us to choose which topics the class wanted to go into \r\n\r\nweaknesses - the undergrad required summaries got a little repetitive when some of the papers were on the same topic or used the same methods within the same week.",
                "I think this course was very strong- well organized, challenging, plenty of resources, etc. One place to improve could be to connect the weeks together a little bit more. They often seemed very separate.",
                "I thought the workload of the course was very reasonable and I was truly interested in the material we were discussing. I also having a partner for the paper summaries. I did feel a little underprepared to write the paper, especially when an updated rubric for the paper was sent out only a few days before the due date."

                "Yes, absolutely take this course! Each year will be different as it depends on the region you're exploring and the graduate students who re also in \/ taking the class. But the chance to learn such a diverse array of geology  topics in a SINGLE class is thrilling. We learned about rifting in our area, dinosaurs and ecology in our area, ancient climate changes and marine ecosystems, things like the yellowstone hotspot... and anthropology connections and so much more. It was so enriching and transformed my perspective of an area I though I knew well. I'm sure it'll do the same for you. The papers the grad leaders selected were profound and really exciting, and Prof. Evans generally makes this class super fun. There was a lot of banter too which is great  -- the class is overall more laid back, but in many way more enriching, than a normal lecture EPS class. But you really get out what you put in.",
