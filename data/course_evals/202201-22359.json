                "Deeper understanding of the Spanish language & how to incorporate Spanish into literary/film analysis",
                "I got a lot of practice in speaking Spanish just by showing up and trying to participate. I got more comfortable just trying my best to get an idea across rather than trying to make all my conjugation and vocab perfect, which would prevent me from engaging in conversation. I also learned a lot about literature and environmental problems in the Spanish-speaking world.",
                "I learned how to write, read, and speak in Spanish using past participle, imperfect, preterite, conjugations, subjunctive, adjectival clauses, adverbial clauses, and nominal clauses. I learned how to apply those skills into my writing and speaking.",

                "The strengths of this course were that there was a high amount of active learning and foreign language immersion. Varied activities leaning on aural, visual, and written inputs was excellent for improving language use. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course were that the turnaround time between assigning group work and submission/presentation of that work was often quite small, and was not able to markedly be progressed during class time. This led to difficulty coordinating with peers over a narrow time window for project completion, and this group work ended up in reality being independent contributions to the same document as opposed to true collaboration. Additionally, there were not sufficient didactic practica in class, which is essential to furthering comprehension in a foreign language. There were occasional worksheets or practice sentences, etc., but overall not enough of these to solidify new grammatical topics.",
                "Strengths: incorporation of short films and short stories was really interesting, positive and inclusive class environment \r\nWeaknesses: none in particular, but asynchronous activities could be confusing sometimes",
                "I think this course was strong in that it provided a lot of practice. It also informed us about Hispanic culture in engaging ways. I think it was weak in that the grammar lessons weren't that helpful unless you had already learned the skills. I don't know if my conjugation would have been up to par if I hadn't had a sense of things from high school. Additionally, I think some of the conversation topics should be made more relevant to the lives of students so that we have more to say and so that we learn more practical vocabulary.",
                "Strengths - Very interactive, applied a lot of skills to real-world problems and events, integrated a lot of information about Latin American cultures\r\nWeaknesses - Sometimes activities weren't helpful in learning more about a topic because they weren't very substantial",
                "Strengths are that the content was engaging, the professor was understanding, and we often had fun group projects. \r\nWeaknesses was an excess of small assignments that could become overwhelming.",
                "One of the biggest strengths of this course is the wide variety of material it covers. Another strength of this course is the asynchronous day each Wednesday which gave us the opportunity to dive deeper into the content we were studying in class. One way it could be improved is by increasing the amount of group projects we had as I found it both fun and engaging to collaborate with my peers.",
