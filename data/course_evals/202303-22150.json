                "Strength: a pungent potpourri of the ancient philosophy texts. Professor Maxwell is great in spiking up conversations during seminars and even more of an expert in guiding people voice their own precious analysis. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Common to all DS classes. All of the texts could be food for thought enough for an entire semester but we dapple through them with only a week or so.",
                "This course covers the greats of classical and neoclassical thought - all the household names, and then some.  In that respect, it is a fantastic survey course that exposes you to philosophy that is deeply relevant to this day.  However, the nature of such a broad survey course means that it moves through content at a breakneck pace.  A lot slips between the cracks at such a speed, especially towards the end of the course.",
                "This course provides a very broad overview of ancient philosophy, but I think it misses out on some pretty important things, while focusing on less interesting ideas. Our reading of the Stoic philosophers, for example, skips over the very advanced logic, and we instead read Stoic ethics, which I personally found kind of bland and uninteresting.",
                "Strengths:\r\nWriting philosophy papers meant learning a very specific style of writing which will likely be helpful for the future. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nHaving more clarity in what specific sections of the text to focus on. Although we had general assignments on what to read per week, having what we should read per specific day in the syllabus would be helpful."

I mean sure, bruises and bumps and weird cryptic hoofs from people triple your age with accents from all over the world are bound to follow you, but hell, you get to see times square and Hudson river and all the hits.",
                "Yes.  These ideas have shaped human thought since their existence and continue to do so today.  If you do not enjoy reading, writing, and discussing, do not sign up for Directed Studies.  But if you want to learn about the history of human thought and be able to participate more fully in any sort of philosophical conversation or discussion, this course will give you the tools and knowledge to do so in a beautiful way.",
