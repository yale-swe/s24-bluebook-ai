I hesitate because the semester started off kind of rough, and Scott's snarky, prickly personality really rubbed me the wrong way. But to his immense credit, he really turned things around after he received critical mid-semester feedback. I truly respect and admire his willingness to adapt his teaching style after receiving not the nicest of comments, without being defensive or too prideful. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the course, please recognize this is sound *synthesis*. It's all about starting from the most grating and jarring of sounds and seeing what it takes to make stuff that actually sounds kind of nice. This is not music composition using electronic samples, you have to build almost every sound you use from scratch. If you're interested in electronic music composition, 431 seems to be geared more towards that (though I haven't taken it, so idk). This is sound *synthesis*, just know what you're getting yourself into! Things will sound... bad for most of the semester. It definitely makes it quite rewarding in the end when things start to sound good, though.",
