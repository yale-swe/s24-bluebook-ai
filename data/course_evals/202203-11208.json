                "I learned about the ways in which money shapes social interactions and got a solid introduction to relational sociology. I also improved my skills in reading social science papers.",
                "I came out of this course with an entirely new way of looking at economic transactions big and small. One of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. If you've ever wanted to take an econ class but felt like they don't offer an understanding of the everyday realities of everyday people this is for you. I learned about credit, debt, life insurance, the history of how we discuss poverty, gender dynamics in shopping and more. This course shows the ways that the phrase \"a dollar is a dollar is a dollar\" misses the ways that relationships alter our understanding of money, income sources, etc. Rourke is an incredibly kind and engaging professor and class flew by most weeks. He develops a class that feels like a community. I know that each of us were sad to leave class on the last day.",
                "I learned about the social meaning of money in various historical and present-day contexts, got better at reading sociology research, and developed a new framework for looking at any economic transaction",
                "The main aim of this course was to demonstrate a new perspective that can be used to view the role of money within our society, and to look a bit deeper about how people actually convey many different meaning when they use money.",
                "I developed an understanding of the social frameworks and relationships supporting micro-level economic interactions. This allowed me to interact with relationships in my own life in a more critical and curious way.",
                "We learned a very valuable analytical framework which works off a theory talking which holds money as something that still carries and is imbued with meaning in our modern and globalized world. It is a direct rebuttal to so many classic social theorists and paradigms posing money as something cold and impersonal social instrument that voids life of meaning and degrades social relations.\r\n\r\nBesides the main text, Professor Rourke OBrien constantly provided an environment of curiosity and comfort and its hard not to get engaged in our seminar discussions. He definitely made the course and its work something to look forward to every week!"

                "It's a good time! There are some topics I wish the readings covered, but it's a giant topic and the readings provided a great survey nonetheless",
                "Strengths: the class was largely discussion based which was much more engaging than a lecture style course, the class only meets once a week, the professor was great, low work load \r\n\r\nweakness: some of the readings were very interesting, but others were quite boring, especially the more dense research articles, there were also a lot of readings to do so you had to space them out throughout the week otherwise it would be difficult to go through them all thoroughly the night before.",
                "Strengths: highly personally relevant, very engaging, very organized. Weaknesses: sometimes the readings are very theoretical.",
                "Both the texts we covered and the instruction received by both the Professor and the TA were awesome. They were always open to discuss course material through other and opposing angles but provided great instruction in the direction of the courses main text, Zelizers The Social Meaning of Money!",

The material in the course will likely change how you understand everyday interactions in a way that opens up new understanding. I was excited for class each week and couldn't recommend the course more! One of those few classes that I kept bringing up with friends.",
                "If you're at all interested in economic sociology or want to think about how even the (strawmanned-as) coldest, most nondescript interactions are still between real people with real feelings and customs, then 100% yes",
                "Yes, the class was incredibly interesting and gives you a new perspective about how money and the way we use it is very social in nature.",
                "This is an excellent course to take if you have ever been curious about how the world works. I looked forward to going to class every week and actually wish we met more often.",
                "Yes, 100%. I recommend this to both sociology and non-sociology students as Zelizers framework introduced and learned throughout the course, and the kind of analytical thinking and mental contemplation we did through writing creates a very interesting view of money which is very relevant in todays social world and our modern, globalized economy.",
                "Yes! By far the best class I have taken at Yale. It completely changes your perspective on relationships and economics."
