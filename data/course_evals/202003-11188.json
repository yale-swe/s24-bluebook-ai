                "This course was great! I thought the workload was high, but all the assignments help you understand the material and there is very little busy work.",
                "Strengths: small classroom size to practice chinese, Li laoshi really grills you on your tones, fun class, very accepting safe space. Weaknesses: even though the classroom was a safe space for a variety of political opinions, sometimes people were borderline offensive?... Also, because L5 students are so diverse in their fluency\/proficiency level, etc. apparently one of my classmates said something a little extreme and I didn't even realize that because they were using new vocabulary.",
                "-",
                "The strength of the course was it small learning format. I had always been in relatively large language courses, but being in a small class allowed for more direct feedback and guidance. The course was also centered around weekly themes that tackled topics such as China's elderly population, one-child policy, and historical heroes. Through this method, cultural aspects of China were introduced along with relevant language aspects. One weakness would be the shortened course content. Because of the online format, some material (such as traditional characters) had to be reduced or cut.",
                "I found all of the homework assignments of this course to be helpful and worthwhile, as they helped me improve all aspects of my Chinese, including speaking, writing, and reading. I also thought the TF sessions were particularly helpful because they gave me a chance to speak Chinese in an extended conversation. Although there were similar opportunities outside of class time, like the Chinese table and office hours, I would have liked more opportunities to practice speaking with my classmates during class itself, as it is difficult to improve oral skills by one's self.",
                "Strengths: rigorous study and discussion of vocab, grammar, and structures on topics that allow you to talk about social issues and changes in the US and China\r\nWeaknesses: not inclusive for students who aren't from the US or live in the US (many topics asked for students to compare the US to China or to talk about experiences in the US)",
                "I would have liked to have more discussion and debate time. I do feel that I learned a lot of useful vocabulary. Also, we spent a lot of class time reviewing grammar, so I feel that I understood the new structures very well.",
                "Strengths - The textbook readings really try to be engaging, funny, and provocative in thought. From talking about dating to mysteries, they're interesting and reveal a lot about Chinese culture while leaving a lot of room open for discussion. The weekly tutorials are helpful, and the Canvas quizzes (while sometimes difficult) are generally fair and based on the text. I really liked how the oral presentations could be pre-recorded, as it took a lot of stress off of the students in an already stressful time, and the pace for the class was good. The grammar and vocab choices were also very relevant. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I wasn't really a fan of the pre-class \"sharing news and interesting things.\" Like, I totally get why the professors used it, as a way to get better in touch with the students, but I wish it was optional instead of required. Other thing is that classes often went over time by almost 10 mins. Overall, these are rather small things, and the class was great."

                "-",
                "Li Laoshi often \"cold-called\" students--that is, call on them randomly. Though nerve-racking at times, this was ultimately successful in getting us to pay attention in a virtual format. I also think that the discussion breakout rooms and Kahoots were engaging and useful. In all, the course content was well-adapted for online learning. The format of the exams, however, were rather awkward. In particular, the oral exam had many glitches; I had to re-record several of my videos under a time constraint.",
                "Of all the classes I took this semester, I feel that Chinese suffered the most from the switch to remote learning. Zoom made it very difficult for the class to speak in unison and also made it harder to hear the different tones clearly. That said, I think that the quality of instruction overall was still relatively high, despite the virtual format.",
                "Sometimes it can be overwhelming to use so many different online tools like Padlet and Kahoot, and I would have preferred to just have more time discussing on Zoom. I liked the use of breakout rooms to speak with a partner or small group.",
                "Succeeded - breakout rooms with other students. Gave a chance to engage with them 1:1 and recreate that \"classroom feeling.\" Fantastic choice and would recommend using it more. Padlet was also good and a nice way to see other student's work in the same space. \r\n\r\nImproved - the listening and speaking comprehension test on Canvas fell apart due to the length of time it takes to upload something to Canvas. the Chinese department should definitely re-evaluate or fix that testing format for the future (maybe by leaving the exam without time limits and just keeping it to within three hours, like they did after they realized their error, or switching to having students record their own videos and upload them independent of Canvas's built in recording software)"

I also think that Li Laoshi and the TAs did an excellent job adapting the course for an online environment.",

Even though the classes meet only 3 times a week, you still cover a good amount of content without being overwhelmed by characters. The teachers are great and passionate about what they do, the content is interesting, overall, just another good course that lives up to the greatness of Yale's Chinese department."
