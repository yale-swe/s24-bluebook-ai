                "The curriculum in this course was entirely too difficult. Tensor calculus is hard on its own, and being expected to use it for proofs after one week of summarizing the main topics was overwhelming. The in-class problems were much more advanced than what students in a typical Mass Transport (as this course is called at other universities) class solve, and the homework was impossible to do without going to recitation and following the TA's every step. I tried getting help from my math major friends on the calculations, and everything was unfamiliar to them. I even asked real engineers and none of them knew how to solve these problems, as they were way too theoretical. This really should have been a PhD class, not an undergraduate course. \r\nI have to give the professor some credit, however. Dr. Haji-Akbari was aware that the subject matter was very difficult, and so he posted detailed notes for every one of the lectures -- the only way I could make sense of anything in this class was sitting down with a friend and spending a few hours digesting every single line of each lecture. He was also very accommodating in allowing us to take the exams from home with open notes and giving us a generous curve, which is a policy that definitely needs to remain after the pandemic ends. So, to improve the course, I would recommend seriously simplifying the curriculum. Even if we cover fewer topics, I promise we will get more out of it if we actually understand the material.",
                "The professor is super accommodating and goes a long way to make sure that we are doing well in the class. I think he knows that the class is hard, and this is also a hard time to be studying such a hard course. The notes were incredible.",
                "I think that Amir is a good Professor. He sometimes goes fast, but his lecture notes are so detailed that I can always go back to them if I get lost in class.",
                "The lecture notes were very detailed and very helpful in understanding the material",
                "Strengths - It built a lot on differential equations and I felt like I got to apply a lot of principles I learned in that class. Lecture notes were also super helpful, as was recitation and the professors office hours.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Towards the end, we covered a lot of dense material really quickly and I never got the chance to really process it.",
                "Strengths of the course are that discussion sections were helpful in understanding the problem sets. The topics were very interesting and fundamental to chemical engineering. A weakness is that lectures were sometimes confusing.",

In fact, I think that the flexibility provided by having a recorded, virtual recitation was very helpful, and that this should remain after Covid ends as well. I found it very useful to be able to come back and rewatch part of a recitation as I was doing my homework, too. And, recitations are usually in the evenings, and it was quite convenient to be able to stay in my room after dinner and still be able to attend recitation.",
