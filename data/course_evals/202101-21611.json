The workload was also too much in the beginning but got better as the course went along.\r\nStrengths - introduced me to a variety of theory concepts and was interesting to analyze pieces.",
                "Amazing course - Prof. Harrison is one of the best instructors I've had at Yale so far, and his 30+ years of teaching music theory really shines in course. It was a lot of work during the counterpoint portion of the course, but the hw was immensely rewarding, and none of it felt like busy work.",

                "The course is well-organized and engaging throughout! The only weakness I can think of is that the counterpoint homework assignments at the beginning of the term can be quite time-consuming, in contrast to the later assignments which are shorter. I'm not sure what changes can be made to address this, but it did feel like the workload varied quite significantly depending on which topics we were covering."
