            "comments": [
                "The course does a good job when explaining topics, but we constantly ran out of time in lecture because lecture became a place to ask questions about the recorded material. The live lecture should not have spent any time answering questions about previous material.",
                "-Strengths: very focused on R and coding so you can get very comfortable with the programming language.\r\n-Weaknesses: not very thorough with the statistical concepts and understanding when to use certain tests.",
                "Strengths: allows for people of different backgrounds to learn about stats regardless of previous preparation, which is cool because data analysis is relevant to pretty much all disciplines.\r\nWeaknesses: large virtual lectures can sometimes be challenging because of a lot of questions with the added difficulty of concentrating on Zoom, etc.",
                "Strength: Good coverage of how to use R, especially in regards to analyzing data sets\r\nWeakness: Coverage of material at the end of the course was a little quick, and didn't dive into the content as much as I would've liked",
                "I really liked the asynchronous classes and how well organized it was. The final project was super fun- I wish there were more opportunities for group work.",
                "Think overall it's a really good course. My only issues were that it was sometimes disorganized and there was a lack of information about how assignments were graded or details around the final.",
                "The strength of this course lied in the TAs and instructor. Prof Meyers was pretty personable, even with 100+ people taking the class. The TA office hours were comprehensive and informative. R is an incredibly useful language to know. The weakness would be the reliance on Piazza for student participation. I preferred talking with other students and the professor in office hours and during the optional Tuesday sessions.",
                "I enjoyed the problem sets as they were fruitful and helped me learn. I however found them to be very long and arduous, especially since I had no one to work them with. Additionally, the midterm & exam were very poorly administered, as they relied on students having new computers and access to strong wifi at all times. The workload was far greater than any other classes.",
                "A big strength was the sense of community among the students. So many people participated over Zoom through the chat, on Piazza, and in groupchats, in a friendly and helpful way. A weakness was that the midterm exam was brutal, given in too short a time span, and not at all representative of the psets or what we focused on in class. The R content overall was better than the statistics content.",
                "One of the strengths was that I felt very supported in the class the whole time. I appreciated how there was a lot of office hours and really dedicated TAs\/ULAs that were always willing to happen. I also liked the combination of synchronous and asynchronous material of the class.",
                "Strengths: Personally I enjoyed the professor's teaching and I thought he was very reasonable with expectations given the pandemic. He is very humorous, laid-back, and always willing to help during office hours.\r\nWeaknesses: it is a mixture of grad students and undergrads, so commitment levels and past experience vary widely. A lot of the homeworks focused on coding, so the statistical concept-heavy midterm and final could be a bit difficult. Also, grading on the homeworks was unreasonable at worst or inconsistent at best.",
                "The instructor was always asking for feedback, and honestly, giving participation points for answering questions on Piazza was brilliant. The course was also aggressively staffed, so there were tons of resources for students if they were confused about a topic. This course started off really strong. Towards the latter half of the course, though, there was a little bit of a slump. The midterm really came out of nowhere, and I think the average was something like a 68, but the final was super reasonable.",
                "I liked that Professor Meyers often asked for feedback, and adjusted his class accordingly. The half asynchronous classes were a good balance, since I often found myself speeding up or stopping at certain points. This allowed me to learn at my own pace, whereas in class, often he would get bogged down by answering specific questions from the chat. I liked having one homework assignment per week; I think this was a reasonable amount of work, and showed us how to apply new information to real-life examples. Explaining the code and results in words helped me to better understand each step of the process. I do think this class was not the most engaging, so it was more dependent on the individual student to participate or learn, which was okay with me. However, I found it hard to get to know any of the other students, and there were not many opportunities to collaborate, but again, it ultimately did not affect my education in this course much. We also did not receive that much individual feedback on assignments, but in general, I understood my errors.",
                "Well taught and interesting material, but the midterm was harder and non-reflective of the difficulty of the rest of the class. The final was much better.",
                "Strengths: office hours, recorded lectures; Weaknesses: no review sessions, midterm prep",
                "Strengths: lectures were recorded which was good for review and fitting them into personal schedules as needed. Office hours were offered regularly and were very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Homework focused a lot on how to do stuff in R, but exams also covered the finer points of statistics concepts that weren't reinforced much through homework.",
                "Good introduction to coding, but there are many people in the class with varying degrees of coding experience. Should have had better baseline introduction classes for people who have never coded before.",
                "Strengths: teaching of R, TF office hours\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: teaching of conceptual topics, structure of examinations.  There was very little teaching of statistical concepts, yet they made up a decently big portion of the exams.",
                "needs a better way to calculate a participation grade than by answering questions on piazza",
                "I think the course overall was great, it really offered a wide span of knowledge from some advanced statistical concepts to using R.",
                "Strengths: organization",
                "Strength: you learn R. Weakness: a lot of material that is quickly went over or is presented at once. While the skills are good, can get very confusing. Grading is also very picky.",
                "This course required a solid background in introductory statistics and often skipped over the statistics review to focus on the coding part. This posed a challenge since many people were at least a year removed from their intro stats class.",
                "This course was very well taught and the concepts seen were very useful.",
                "The course was structured very well. I felt that I learned well from the lectures and got practice of the problem sets. Also there was always a way for me to get my questions answered. The midterm exam was the only part of the course that was not well put together.",
                "Better in person lectures",
                "STRENGTHS: During remote learning, this was a great class because of the balance between asynchronous and synchronous portions of the class. Tuesday's lecture was asynchronous and the actual class time was optional office hours. Thursdays we had live lecture with participation. Professor Meyers is also great, I think he truly cares about his students and the learning. The TAs are also great, shoutout to Duda, Duda is absolutely amazing! I felt like the class was structured to learn and make the material really accessible. The lectures, class code and PSETS were all related to each other and pretty manageable, sometimes even pretty easy if you're comfortable with the material from the lecture. The first exam was easy but the time crunch really made it much more difficult than it was meant to be. The final exam was much better structured. Prof Meyers loves memes and jokes and they bring life to class :) WEAKNESSES: I think time could have been used better. Sometimes the prof spent a lot of time answering questions during class and we wouldn't get through all the material. It wasn't bad bad but it was frustrating at times that the question period was pretty long during lecture. And this isn't per say a weakness but the conceptual parts of the exams can be tricky. Just make sure to study for those pretty well too, not just the code.",
                "The course was very strong in explaining statistical tests and connecting them to central concepts in the fields of statistics and data science. It was also engaging throughout, using interesting and relevant data as well as jokes and humor in the lectures and examples. The course also prepared me very well to use R on my own in the future to analyze data. I think in the later lectures on more advanced concepts didn't seem to connect as well to the earlier concepts we had learned, so it was harder to understand and remember them.",
                "Prof Ethan was rushing all the content towards the end. Also the mid term was given pretty poorly.",
                "I think this course did a good job of balancing the material online and in person. I think that the course could be improved in the amount of material covered.",
                "Weakness was the difficulty of the exams. All PSETs are coding-based, and the exams are half conceptual questions that we don't have practice with. Unfair.",
                "It's adapted pretty well to an online format. The asynchronous lectures feel like they were made to be that way, and Professor Meyers seems to be comfortable lecturing that way.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it's hard to feel engaged with the class. There's not a ton of critical thinking involved (except maybe the final project), and the majority of it is taking code and ideas from the lectures and putting them into the problem sets. (Also, incorrect answers on the exams are worth negative points. Why? Who does that?)",
                "The strenghts were its' trajectory and lectures, the weaknesses was how little person to person interaction there was.",
                "The weaknesses is that the problem sets do not always connect with the exam material, and I felt they were often too simple to reflect real questions one might address when using data science in regular life.",

                "Strength - helpful homework psets and office hours, engaging lectures\r\nweakness - testing format: R program was crashing during the midterm and final which was timed. Lost some points because of that (didn't get a chance to finish tests due to technical difficulties). Those should have bene take-home since a lot of students had trouble with that (which would have bene much easier to fix during the test if it was in-person)"

                "The prerecorded lectures were great, but the live lectures were too often a waste of time because too much time was spent answering questions about the prerecorded lectures.",
                "The hybrid live\/recorded format was really really nice for this class.",
                "I felt that the asynchronous lectures were great especially when followed up by a live session where the professor did Q&A",
                "Loved the format. Asynchronous and synchronous allowed me to go at my own pace but still have place to ask questions.\r\nAlso to clarify, by \"loved\" I mean that it was great for COVID, a normal semester would be preferred.",
                "I liked the fact that we used real time COVID data during the PSets. I found that the lecture course style translated pretty well to the virtual format. I just wasn't the biggest fan of Piazza as a platform to measure participation.",
                "I enjoyed the recorded content on Tuesdays, but I believe the exams were very poorly run amongst the covid circumstances, given the reliance on newer computers and strong WiFi.",
                "Professor Meyers was very good at facilitating participation in the chat over Zoom, better than any other class I've seen. There was something very camaraderie-inducing about Ethan asking a question and everyone typing the answer into the chat really fast. I also appreciated how everything was accessible on the first pages, especially recorded lectures we had to watch. The R exams implemented over Zoom were somewhat bumpier, but the final was a lot better than the midterm because we had more time and it was partly on Canvas.",
                "I liked the combination of synchronous components with asynchronous components (the fact that it was both live and recorded lectures provided important flexibility).",
                "The homework sets were great since they were coding-based. Office hours with TA's through Zoom and one-to-one debugging sessions were really nice to have. Something that could be improved is the lectures and delivery of material to be more engaging and provide more focus on statistical concepts.",
                "Having a combination of asynchronous and synchronous lectures (and multiple time slots for exams) was perfect",
                "Switching to a half-asynchronous class with an office hours instead was a good fit for this class, as many of the questions seemed to be about individual coding errors. In this way, Zoom was quite useful for sharing screens and identifying issues. I felt well-supported to take this class in my own time, and all the videos and lecture materials were very accessible. I generally felt that I was provided everything I needed to do well in this course, but that I wasn't necessarily required to participate very often. Piazza was quite useful for asking and answering questions.",
                "Half asynchronous and half synchronous. The synchronous lectures were also recorded for those who couldn't attend.",
                "Virtual office hours were a great help. Especially since homework involved coding, screen sharing was an efficient way for peer tutors to give feedback.",
                "Asynchronous learning was very helpful.",
                "I thought that this course transferred particularly well to a virtual format.  The only issue was how the exams worked, especially the midterm.\r\n\r\nThe midterm was horribly set up and clearly caused a lot of problems for many.  Having a time limit on an exam heavy in coding in a class with many students who are coding for the first time is a recipe for disaster.  The exam was especially unforgiving when it came to knitting errors and simple things that really should not matter on an exam.  This format caused unnecessary stress and really took away from students being able to do what they are meant to be doing on an exam--showing that they know the material.  Much time on the exam was spent trying to fix knitting errors when it could have been spent actually proving knowledge.",
                "I think that the asynchronous lectures were great",
                "The format worked well with one live lecture and other recorded lectures",
                "A timed coding midterm exam was an inappropriate way to test our knowledge and skills learned in the class, as it caused many stressors that were unnecessary. Many students were unhappy with this format because they felt as though they werent given a fair chance to sit with the material in time to produce results, since it was so rushed.",
                "Recorded lectures really helped me understand better concepts by rewinding and pausing the videos whenever I found them confusing.",
                "All of the virtual practices succeeded.",
                "Good recorded videos",
                "Mixture of asynchronous and synchronous class time worked super well! Tuesday lecture was optional and we had asynchronous lecture videos instead. Thursday was live and prof Meyers made it so that we could participate.",
                "I liked the recorded lectures, I was able to take notes on the slides and replay concepts or move quickly through things I felt I understood well. I think the live virtual lectures were good for having questions answered but I preferred the recorded lecture format for introducing new topics.",
                "The recorded lectures were helpful, the live ones were rushed and we didn't finish the content he intended to cover.",
                "I think office hours and recorded lectures were very helpful",
                "PSETs, office hours were very engaging and helpful to understanding the content.",
                "Most of the course felt like it transferred online pretty seamlessly, although the beginning was a bit bumpy. The exams, on the other hand, were not adapted well; it felt like both were not planned out well and were needlessly complex to take.",
                "I think the mix of pre-recorded and live lectures was very good. I don't think much could be improved.",
                "The participation grade for posting on Piazza was unclearly delineated. Clarifying how exactly participation works would improve the course.",

                "Making a second optional lecture and using that time slot as OH was a great idea. \r\nComing up with a better way of midterm\/final examination as it was a disaster for some of us living in a loud household with so many things going around and having to deal with program crash during a timed test. A clearer project guideline would also be helpful as it is 10% of the grade."

                "No, I would not recommend this course to someone else unless there is a different professor than E. Meyers. He was oftentimes rude and unavailable for his students.",
                "Yes, workload isnt that bad, its interesting concepts and good for people who don't have a coding background. Could be kind of boring at times",

                "I found this class very useful and practical. Not only did we learn important statistical concepts, but we applied them to interesting real-life datasets, and examined them for patterns and trends. I appreciated coming out of this course with a strong foundation in R, which I am excited to be able to use in the future. The material is well taught, and the assignments are straightforward, though not necessarily easy. Professor Meyer makes the class fun with his incessant dad jokes! Be aware that this class is about 50\/50 statistical concepts and R programming, so if you don't really care for learning R, this might not be the course for you.",
                "Yes - interesting material and useful to learn R.",

                "I would recommend this class as a great way to learn R.  You will get the most out of the class if you already have a stats background, as the conceptual parts of the class are mostly just reviewed quickly or skipped over altogether.",
                "Fine introduction to R, but so much petty work revising psets to avoid missing points for silly things",
                "Yes! If you want to learn R and dip your toe into statistics, this is a great course for that. The statistical concepts aren't too difficult to grasp and a lot of the class focuses on how to implement the use of statistics with real-life data sets.",

                "Yes! This was a great way to learn R and some of the foundational statistical theory needed to use it. If youre deciding between taking it in the Fall of with JDRS, I would say Ethan is a pretty great guy and theres no need to wait until the spring. Im happy with my choice to take it this semester",

                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this course. Overall, it teaches many important statistical concepts quite well and teaches you to apply them to real problems.",
                "Yes! If you want to learn R, regardless of your major, and have some statistics experience\/knowledge this course is very manageable and you gain a lot of basic R skills. Prof Meyers is awesome, and the prof and TAs care about your learning. As a humanities major, this course is a great break from all the reading and writing and you learn skills that really could help you in any field!",
                "Yes, this is a great course to take if you are going to be working with data in the future. It gives you a strong grounding in basic statistics and data science concepts, introduces you to the major types of statistical analysis, and helps you learn how to explain and visually represent your analyses. It also prepares you to use the program R, one of the most widely used statistical programs, to analyze data on your own.",

The caveats are (1) if you already have programming experience, you're going to find the R parts of class to be very frustrating, and (2) like I've said, the exams are a bit of a mess at the moment.",
                "Yes, it was  a great intro into the world of data science.",
