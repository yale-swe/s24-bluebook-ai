                "Strengths: Consistent \r\nWeaknesses: section teachers, course director, the varying difficulty across exams and assignments\r\nI would not take this course with Rachel Diethorn. Her exams are obnoxiously difficult and do not reflect the psets well. She does not post many resources to help you prepare for the exams so you will have to rely on YouTube videos if you want to understand the material. Also, each section was learning at a different pace and it genuinely felt like I was taking two different versions of Math115 when I compared where I was in my section to what Rachel posted.",
                "Strengths: When it came to midterms and final exams, this course provided a lot of help to pass the exams. Many practice exams, slides, and notes were uploaded to help us study. Additionally, there were a lot of review sessions and opportunities to get help when we were struggling. I also really liked how they created random study groups after the first midterm. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the material we were learning was disorganized in class. There were no notes and my instructor would go extremely fast. Also, when receiving our exams back, I wish there were more explanations posted on how to answer the problems correctly, instead of there just being a rubric of points on Gradescope.",
                "A weakness I'd give the course was some of the professors could go really fast. They wouldn't give too much time to ask questions.",
                "The course is very fast-paced and I would find myself relying on myself, instead of class time or office hours, to learn the required concepts. The course was hard to stay engaged in, it was almost like the professor regurgitating information at you, leaving no time for you to process it. However, I learned a lot and I learned how to effectively study for big tests and do well on them.",
                "I appreciated the resources that this course provided and its clear structure. There were many opportunities for office hours, peer tutoring, and review. Additionally, the exam schedule and grade weighting was clear. I think the course could be improved if there were monthly review sessions on what was covered.",
                "The concept checks and explores we did before class weren't very helpful, and having a 7:00 am due date for the explores led to them being forgotten all the time and them often piling up 3 or 4 late.",
                "Not much student engagement during the class. It could be improved by including more activities and ways for the students to participate during class."

The concepts come at you fast and even though I've already taken calculus, I found myself struggling to catch up sometimes. I dedicated a lot of time before tests to make sure I understood everything.",
                "Yes, for anyone who wants to further their calculus knowledge.",
                "I think this course is a good introduction to calculus and should be taken by someone who plans to take future math courses.",
