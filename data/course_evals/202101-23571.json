Aside from general skills, students are introduced to a basic yet thorough understanding of how constitutional ideology was initially developed and some of the critical moments in past and recent history which has challenged these ideologies. Moreover, the course introduces students to various constitutional/judicial interpretations and encourages students apply such interpretations how they best see fit to understand the law. Not only does the course review constitutional law/theory and its application in modern society, but it also reviews the power dynamic and relations among the branches of government, among elected representatives, and with the people.",

                "The material was very well selected and very engaging (though the legal cases were sometimes dull to read). The professor was very good at making us think critically about the material and our ideas on it. This course was reading and discussion based, which was good in that we got to hear other students' different ideas. \r\n\r\nHowever, this leads me to the cons also: I did not learn to place my fleshed out ideas into writing. There was a lot of confusion with the directions for the essays and a lot of the time I did not know what was expected. Combined with not knowing my grade for the course even by study period, this was a bit stressful as I did not have a way to gauge if I was improving.",
                "I thought that the course was designed very well. The readings were very interesting and informative and the class discussion for the most part was robust. I do have a number of potential suggestions for how it could be improved, although I would not mistake the numerousness of these suggestions as an indictment on the course, which I thoroughly enjoyed. First, it seemed as if a number of the readings didn't end up being discussed in class. Given their length, perhaps it would have been nice to have some required readings and some optional ones, or at least indicate which ones would be the focus of each class. Second, I wonder if one way to increase blog discussion participation would be to bring up some of those blog posts in our class, to see if anyone has any additional thoughts. Third, it might have been nice to have more direct engagement amongst students in discussion (i.e., allowing us to respond to each others' thoughts more as opposed to lining up to respond to the same question, although of course discussions are a little harder via Zoom).",
                "The strength is definitely the very knowledgeable professor. The course could benefit from more structure and explicit feedback.",
                "Strengths: content is really interesting\r\nWeaknesses: no sense of community in the class made me not look forward to class",
                "The strengths of the course are the great professor and the close interaction with the material. It was wonderful having a small seminar where discussion was driven by students instead of being lectured the whole time. I thought the professor was great at explaining different ideas and very approachable. I would improve this course by focusing more on depth over breadth. I wish the readings were shorter so we could more deeply focus on them because I often felt like certain readings were completely ignored.",
                "Lots of readings. There could be more discussion amongst students than teacher to student.",
                "Strength: Professor Silverstein is a fantastic and engaging professor and I would take any of his classes again in a heartbeat. He is obviously incredibly knowledgeable about the course material but allows students to learn and develop their own ideas and opinions at their own pace. He is, nonetheless, always available to assist students with the course material (or really anything) and is always eager to meet with students. The class moves at a good pace and Professor Silverstein does an excellent job at guiding discussions so that class conversations are rarely dull. \r\nWeakness: Although the readings were very interesting and thought-provoking, I would have liked to see a more diverse set of authors with various ideological, educational, and racial backgrounds. Also, the essay prompts can seem vague and confusing at first, but Professor Silverstein is always happy to clarify any misunderstandings and help students develop their arguments.",
                "Strengths are the professor, weaknesses are that it got repetitive and monotonous, readings were too long to digest.",
                "Its a good course! I would prefer if we had more regular blog posts, because connecting the abstract, historical concepts we cover in class with the contemporary political examples in the blog posts is the real gem of the class. Professor Silverstein is the best!",
                "Strength:\r\n- students' gains solely based on how well ideas can be bounced and changed between individuals\r\n- safe (albeit left-leaning) environment to engage in discourse"

                "Yes. Despite the kinks in the grading and feedback, I would still recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the content and does not obsess over grades-- because you learn so much. I think the cons aren't hard to fix. This course really opened my eyes to how intricate the Constitution and the system the framers built is. This is in my perspective, crucial to understanding how to solve problems we see today (or at least, understand what the root of those problems are).",
                "Absolutely. This is a relatively relaxed class where students get to discuss constitutional issues in both a historical and contemporary context. The readings can sometimes be too long, but students can probably still engage in class discussions having not read them in too much detail, given that many of the discussions involve broader themes. That said, doing the readings is both very intellectually stimulating and helpful. Additionally, the overall workload is not too bad; there are three short essays and a couple of discussion blog posts.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student, but I do think this course is harder for people that do not have a political science background. The professor is great and very approachable. The seminar structure of the class allows you to really interact with the ideas explored. The material is interesting but some can be dry and at times it was too much material at once.",
                "If you are interested in the topic or want to learn more about the flaws of the country and its government.",
                "Yes! Even if you're not normally into this stuff this is a really cool class. The readings are really interesting, and Prof. Silverstein is really good at leading discussions. The grade is based on 3 essays so as long as you're ok with that I would say absolutely, take this class.",
                "Yes! This was my favorite class during my first-year. Some may recommend this course only to students who are interested in politics or the law, but I think this is a great class for anyone who would like a greater understanding of the American political, social, and judicial scene. With that being said, I think anyone taking this course should be prepared to complete a lot of reading (100-200 pages a week) and consume a lot of information related to current and historical politics and the law. I do not think that this course should be recommended on a basis of how familiar a student is with the law and politics but rather on a student's willingness to dedicate adequate time and effort to better understand the foundations of American society. And this recommendation would be incomplete without mentioning that the success and enjoyability of the class is almost entirely made possible by Professor Silverstein. He is an excellent teacher, very knowledgeable of the material, and an eager aide to his students.",
                "Yes, it's a first year seminar and every Yale College first-year should take one! The professor is great!",
                "Yes! Its an incredible course; whether or not you plan to enter politics, its a must-the for residents of the U.S. Its well-designed to take modern political and social dilemmas and put them in the context of Constitutional history. It took us a while to actually identify some errors in class, but the journey is worth it! While theres a lot of reading, you dont need to read everything. If you get the gist of what the reading is saying, youll be prepared for class discussions.",
                "If only for the fact of it being a first-year seminar, I would recommend it. In regards to the content of the course, seeing how often and readily different conclusions can be reached by two esteemed, educated individuals presented with the same evidence can be extremely valuable (from the founding of our country through today). I also found the course helpful in understanding more the beliefs of several high school friends with different political tendencies."
