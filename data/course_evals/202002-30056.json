   "comments": [
    "The high level of engagement of this course was excellent! If there were any faults it was only that it felt all too short in duration, through no fault of its own.",
    "Strengths: Feedback when given is usually very good. Workshops are fun because you get to see how other people write and can learn from them. Weaknesses: Feedback was only given on about half of the assignments which meant we couldn't get as much out of those writings",
    "Strengths was that Clifton was always a very engaged and engaging professor during seminar meeting time, which is impressive given that the meetings were over three hours and I think almost everyone in the class started to fade a bit by the end. Weaknesses was that he didn't always reply to emails in a super timely manner, which was particularly problematic as there was no 'end of class' time as the course was remote. Also the Assignments page listing everything that was due in one place wasn't made accessible to us until the last couple weeks of class, which made it very difficult to know what was due and when before then. I hope that we weren't penalised for that as I was trying very hard to keep up, but it definitely caused unneccessary stress.",
    "Strength: frequent exercises and feedback Weaknesses: I think it would be best to add a little more time between exercises",
    "There were very fascinating and helpful insights from the professor on how to improve our writing and references to specifically how we can do so -- however, there was not much inter-student discussion and a lot of the time it felt as if we were sitting more through lecture and professor opinion. It would be helpful if we could collaborate and have the space to pause and for everyone in the group to have the chance to share more."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! I was only interested in fiction writing but having to write poetry and drama as well really opened my eyes to different techniques that have made my fiction writing stronger",
    "Yes. Even if the way course information was given out was sometimes a bit chaotic and this did cause some stress, getting to do what is normally a hobby for me as classwork and get knowledgable feedback on it was really enjoyable and has made me much more confident about continuing to write.",
    "Yes, you'll learn a lot and even not, you'll read enough to learn a lot.",
    "Yes"
