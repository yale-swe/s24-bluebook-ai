The readings were always manageable and insightful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have appreciated more in-class or assigned/guided background context about American Romanticism and the poets we read.",

                "I thoroughly enjoyed the course and felt it was soundly structured. The only small thing I wished changed was that the reading responses felt like they should have been due after each class. In many ways I felt like I wanted to reflect on what we spoke about during class and oftentimes the responses were done after doing the reading without any prior discourse. Just feel like it if they were done the other way around it could have been more helpful for me personally."
