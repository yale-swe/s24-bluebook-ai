                "strengths: class discussions, novels were amazing, Professor Habchi is one-of-a-kind; weaknesses: reading a book a week can be a lot sometimes!",
                "strengths: BOOKS! BOOKS! BOOKS! I took this class primarily for the reading list and it truly did not disappoint. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: Sometimes our class struggled in discussion. This was rare, but when it did happen, it did stand out. \r\n\r\nimprovements: Sometimes Professor Habchi would have us break up into small groups to discuss aspects of the books/prompt us with a discussion question. I think this would be better utilized as a mechanism to combat struggles with discussion, rather than at (seemingly) random moments.",
                "Strengths: Prof Habchi is incredibly smart, kind and just a great professor. I learned a lot from her about postcolonial theory. The texts are also all incredibly nuanced and fascinating to read. I very much enjoyed the reading material!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had more theories integrated into the course. We did a lot of theory at the beginning and then switched to learning about the novels but I think this theory could be included in the novel readings so we can reference it in our discussions.",
                "This course is strong in that it focuses on a single novel each week, allowing for in-depth and analysis and discussion in the classroom. However, at times the novels have so much social, historical, and political context that a single class period cannot sufficiently cover all that could be discussed of each text. I felt a little unsatisfied at times after our discussions for this reason. However, the midterm and final papers are a good way of expanding on class discussions.",
                "The class discussions were always quite interesting but definitely felt dominated by a few voices",
                "This course has so many strengths! I really appreciated the student-led discussion presentations at the beginning of each class, Professor Habchi as a really thoughtful and engaging discussion facilitator, and the text selections on the syllabus. One weakness is that the theoretical foundations did not cover everything we discussed later on in the semester, so at times people threw around large words and not everyone knew what their definitions were.",
                "I think this course could be improved with some more tangible assignments and feedback -- but I thought it was truly a wonderful, lowkey experience.",
                "This course format was relatively consistent throughout the term but could have benefited from varied activities beyond just discussion. One of the strengths of the course was the professor's enthusiasm and eagerness about the topics. I really loved  the types of books we read, some were more difficult to get through than others.",
                "Strengths: love reading fictional stories!\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes discussions were too vague and too extrapolated"

                "I highly recommend this course! You'll learn a lot from Professor Habchi, and the texts are all super interesting and engaging. Readings can be long, but they're usually novels and fun to read.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Habchi is excellent, and very kind, and all of the books are definitely worth reading.",
                "Yes I would! Professor Habchi is wonderful and so insightful. She really encouraged student participation and fostered a welcoming environment in the classroom. It is very reading and writing heavy so if you are taking other courses that are similar to that, I would just be mindful of how much you can take on.",
                "yes, though I think with a seminar this long there should at least be a brief break. I really enjoyed the student presententations and a lot of the books!"
