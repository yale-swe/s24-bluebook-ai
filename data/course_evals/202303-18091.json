                "I learned a lot about different cultures by taking this course. There is definitely an emphasis on understanding the culture of the language (by learning raps, reading literature, and researching art works) rather than just learning the language itself.",
                "I improved my Spanish speaking, reading, and writing abilities. I also learned more about Spanish and Latin American culture.",
                "I feel like I have gained so much from Prof. Baffi and her class. She is such an incredible instructor, and her pedagogical ideals are uncomparable. This is the class I feel like has improved my language skills the most at Yale (or anywhere), and I really really appreciated her.",
                "Continuation of development in the Spanish language. Lots of speaking, writing, reading was done during this course and really allowed us to immerse ourselves into Spanish culture while learning the language.",
                "I learned how to explore art in Spanish.",
                "I expanded my Spanish Vocabulary and improved my fluency.",
                "By taking this course, I improved my Spanish speaking, listening, and learned a lot about art, culture, and social issues in Spanish-speaking countries.",

                "Often the work felt repetitive, especially when preparing for class the next day. Additionally, group work felt a little difficult because there weren't many opportunities to plan out work in class and it was difficult to contact others during our asynchronous day.",
                "The strength of this course was how supportive, helpful, and encouraging Professor Baffi was. Additionally, the variety of assignments and projects kept me more engaged with the course. A weakness was that I wish there would have been a greater emphasis on Spanish grammar, as that is an area where I feel I could still use improvement.",
                "Strengths: clarity, brevity, and consistency. Weaknesses: occasionally confusing instructions",
                "Strengths of the course is that it is really organized and really clear what is expected of us as a student. All of the SPAN 130 courses are the exact same and do not deviate from the syllabus so students know what to expect. It could be improved by getting more consistent feedback on the work we had been doing throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: this class will help improve your Spanish as it challenges to think and speak more. Professor Baffia really tries to get the students engaged with the class lesson, although it can be dull sometimes. Weakness: It felt like the in-class activities had no purpose and the pre-class assignments were busy work. However, the class was doable and it wasn't anything too hard.",
                "Some strengths include hands on Spanish activities. Some weaknesses include the redundancy in the everyday course, which can be exhausting.",
                "Strengths: Professor Baffi was an excellent and supportive teacher.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Daily homework assignments did very little to improve my Spanish skills. I think lowering the amount of assignments and instead doing one or two bigger assignments per week would be much better. I also found the jump between Spanish 120 and Spanish 130 was immense and jarring.",
                "Many strengths, including the asynchronous day. I dont have any specific weaknesses."

                "Yes, this was a great course. Professor Carolina Baff was a very fun and engaging professor. She was always willing to help others and encouraged full participation from everyone in the class.",
                "I would recommend it! Through this course, I became more confident in my Spanish speaking abilities.",
                "Most definitely  Baffi is the way to go for L3.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to fulfill the language requirement whether you were placed into it or had to take it to finish your language requirement. The course is much different to a traditional Spanish class and I believe my speaking ability greatly improved because of this reason.",
                "I would recommend it to other students but I'd recommend they establish a good relationship with the professor at the very beginning.",
                "Improvements could be made by adjusting the overall Spanish curriculum. Everyday class, in addition to the asynchronous workload can cause the course to exhausting in this sense. Perhaps adjusting to maybe 3 days a week would be more beneficial.",
                "Definitely, especially with Professor Baffi. She was very kind, willing to meet outside of class, and always conversed with me after class. There was no judgement if you felt your Spanish skills to be behind your peers, and she encourages everyone to speak up and ask questions. It is not difficult to get good grades on assignments as long as you put in an effort.",
                "I highly recommend, it makes you feel much more confident in the snapping language."
