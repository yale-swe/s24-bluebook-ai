I learned how dance is applicable in any situation and that anyone can dance. I learned how to do some super cool traditional and modern dance along with improvising from time to time. I learned what was important in creating choreography. I learned how to do a spin in the air!",
                "I learned about dance, rhythm, the weight of the body and West African history and culture,",
                "I learned about the origins and traditions of West African Dance. This class expanded my understanding of dance and rhythm more generally.",
                "I learned a lot about West African dance and improved my musicality!",
                "Overall, I improved body fitness! The course is primarily focused on dancethis semester, the schedule would be one full day on Tuesday and one half day on Thursday of learning the dance and practicing it, and then the second half of Thursday discussing about overall dance practices shared across West African nations. We learned about the importance of rhythm and the overall key points that differentiate West African dances from other types of choreography.",
                "I learned about body control when it comes to dancing and being intentional with placement and pressure. It was a different learning setting from what I'm traditionally used to like a room of desks, and this was refreshing.",
                "I learned how to dance in the West African tradition. That included learning the physical moves and skills but also a broader shift in how I thought about dance and engaged with it. That included learning a great deal of history and philosophy about West African dance."

                "The course was great! I loved that we just got to dance for about 3 hours twice a week. I do wish that discussions came with a bit more student input versus the professor talking most of the time.",
                "I honestly see no weakness in the course. If you have the opportunity to take this course, please take it! Go in with an open mind and you will change not only in the way dance but also conduct yourself outside of the classroom. I just got so much more confidence from this class.",
                "Strenghts: This course was pretty fun and was a great break from my typical lecture-style courses. \r\nWeaknesses: The discussion-section-esque part of the course left a bit to be desired. I don't feel like the students were able to engage enough with this part of the course.",
                "The actual dance portion of this class taught me so much! The class is very physically engaging. We learned where dance comes from (ex: inspiration from everyday life), how rhythms are made, and the importance of interacting with the drummers.",
                "Strengths: it's just a fun course overall! It's interesting material, and it feels good to have a scheduled, structured time to move your body. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We didn't really learn that much about the specifics of anything?",
                "Strength: It is a unique class that made me appreciate the diversity of culture and movement. I think the class well taught for beginners. I like how each week we learn a new dance, and in the moment it doesn't seem like a lot, but in the end you've learned so many choreographies. We also had classes where we made our own dance. I liked this part as it made me use my own creativity and collaboration skills.  \r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish that there were videos we could watch to practice outside of the class, since sometimes I fell behind on a dance when I couldn't remember it.",

                "100%, the class was so fun and interesting. I learned so much about West African Dance that I felt could be applied to everyday life. The class totally changed how I understand rhythms and music and the reasons behind why we dance.",
                "Absolutely!!! I loved this class and had so much fun!!",
                "Yes! I think a lot of the curricula at Yale de-emphasizes the importance of bodily connection to the world around us, and this was a fantastic way at trying to re-engage that connection. Also, courses and extracurriculars leave little time to actually physically exert ourselves, so it's really nice to have a structured time during the week to exercise.",
                "Absolutely. If you have any interest in the African diaspora, dance, or are just looking for something fun to do, this course actually helped me learn, connect with my heritage, and become a much better dancer."
