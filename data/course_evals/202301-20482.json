Daily classes plus daily homework plus weekly presentations is way beyond a typical workload at Yale, and it makes it very difficult to catch up if you happen to fall behind in the course. Additionally, the structure of the course does a poor job at catering to multiple learning styles.",
                "Strengths: lots of assignments so lots of chances to improve throughout the semester, a lot of support from professor \r\n\r\nWeakness: just a bit fast paced grammar topic wise but I think that is just the nature of the class",
                "The strengths of the course is that it encourages students to be immersed in an environment where Spanish is the main language spoken for five days a week. This greatly helps to develop knowledge and conversational ability. Some weaknesses are difficultly in communication between the professor and students and a good amount of \"busy work\" assignments.",
                "Strengths: prof. Mara Pilar Asensio-Manrique is the best. the asynchronous Wednesday is really helpful too. the presentations we do truly expanded my spanish speaking.",
                "Some weaknesses in the course was that I often found some assignments in the course to be none beneficial to my learning and rather to advanceed for the level of 120. For example, in the spanish textbook, we had to read an article in class about a spanish poem that used very advanced words. Often times I found our class time was being used to read very sophisticated spanish articles that I felt did not increase our learning. I feel like if instead of reading the spanish articles that we went over how to write using the tense we have just learned, it would be better for our learning. For example, lets say we learned the future tense on Tuesday; instead of reading a poem in spanish on Wednesday, we should spend our class time writing a paragraph in the future tense in spanish and do assignments based on reading and writing the future tense. As for strengths, I feel like the course covers the perfect amount of material and has a good grading policy with the assignments, tests, and compositions."

However, with that being said, I would recommend the course to other students because it's amazing to see how one's Spanish skills will improve over the year, and I really appreciated the intimate classroom setting.",
                "If they want to learn Spanish, it is a great way!!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is deeply dedicated to learning the Spanish language. However, I would not recommend this to a student who is not committed to a significant workload, as there will be approximately hour long homework assignments everyday on top of exams and oral presentations.",
                "YES YES YES YES especially with Mara Pilar Asensio-Manrique",
                "Yes, because I believe it builds and emphasizes the necessary skills and basics for spanish speaking that can at least allow you to navigate in a spanish speaking country. For example, it goes over the past, present and future tenses of spanish which allows you to form the most basic sentances for communication."
