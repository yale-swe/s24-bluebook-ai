                "I think the syllabus of the course was varied and well-designed in terms of giving us a sense of historical movement and eras, and I really enjoyed the high level of class discussion during the seminars. I will say in general that I wish a bit more historical context had been given for the texts that we read, and that conversations in class had been a bit more grounded in that.",
                "The breadth of the course is enormous: there is a lot of influential thinkers and ideas that are discussed, who all had enormous impacts on political thought. Being able to do this is pretty cool. However, this obviously sacrifices depth. There is only so much time, and you can feel as though you are missing essential points from some authors and in some texts -- because you are and you have to with the time permitted.",
                "I appreciated the engagement online through posting discussion questions and I also felt like our class discussions were very strong and illuminating.",
                "The strengths of this course lie in the material  all of the texts are extremely interesting and it is easy to make connections between each text and the texts from first semester. In terms of weaknesses, I think we often rushed through the books when we could have spent more time on fewer texts.",
                "Strengths: There was a clear theme amongst the works this semester so it made it easier to understand/make connections between the works. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it felt as if the conversation would be stalled or the flow would make it difficult to continue.",
                "I thought the readings were very well-chosen and seemed to connect with each other (e.g. reading Hobbes, Rousseau, and Locke one after the other worked very neatly). I think there could have been more clarity on what to expect from H&P essays generally. I found this to be an issue both semesters as I think both philosophy and literature have very defined expectations and styles of papers but I was a little confused about how to read and write about H&P texts."

I feel like it didn't require much effort or thought but it was simply an extra task that I had to remember to check off and complete before class. Perhaps taking turns leading or presenting for one class each week (we did this in my DS philosophy class) might be a better option. I think even posting a paragraph or some thoughts after class and encouraging students to comment on each other's thoughts via discussion (although it might be more work) would be a lot more thought-provoking and effective."

I also would just recommend it to anyone: I think everyone has potential to grow and benefit as a result from this course, and this course can really think about everything. This course challenges you: it challenges preconceived beliefs and ideas you may have and takes you in a new direction. Each thinker is different and maybe contradictory, so in attempting to reconcile them with each other, and yourself, you have to really dive into what you believe, what they believe, and how those thoughts can actually interact with each other.",
