   "comments": [
    "Outstanding survey of national elections throughout American history from a living legend. Exposure to solid political science research.",
    "I gained skills in analyzing past elections, comparing them to those in recent times, and developing my vocabulary in the area of Political Science theorem.",
    "I learned significantly about U.S. National Elections, in particular trends that dominate presidential and congressional elections.",
    "I better understand many of the patterns that have emerged from more than two centuries of American national elections. I also know more about the most controversial individual instances, especially 1960, 2000, and 2016.",
    "I became much more adept at writing, engaging with, and analyzing political works",
    "I learned about many different facets of electoral politics and voter behavior, such as party ideology, performance blowback, demographic trends, and districting.",
    "Professor Mayhew is THE authoritative source for everything US elections. Best Political Science class you could ever take if you want to truly understand long-term trends in US elections.",
    "I gained a new level of insight into the sphere of elections in American political science. Class discussion revolved a lot around statistics, history, policy, and politics, of course.",
    "Basic understanding of drivers of American politics",
    "I learned about a number of important phenomena in US Elections - gerrymandering, policy blowback, incumbency advantage, etc. - drawing on Professor Mayhew's extensive, encyclopedic knowledge of every US Election since the founding of the country. I also learned how to approach rigorous analysis of Political Science data through the excellent papers that we read. And the class put in perspective the election of 2016, which so many have claimed is unusual for many reasons, by giving me a much more extensive understanding of elections in the United States through our country's history.",
    "I gained a new appreciate for the American political system and its historical context in this course. I found the discussions to be truly engaging and I found myself shaking my head in awe at the new things I had learned after every session. Taking this course reignited my excitement for American history and politics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great professor, great syllabus, great approach to reading responses. No weaknesses.",
    "The readings are very interesting and manageable. I really enjoyed the class and the discussions that were held. One of the weaknesses is perhaps that some of the readings are a bit technical on the statistical side, which I had little background in, making it a bit harder to comprehend.",
    "Professor Mayhew's stories are truly invaluable. His introduction of many of the readings and what he knows about the authors (in some case, direct personal experience) really set the scene well.\r\n\r\nI would have appreciated concrete grading responses on the comment papers, in addition to some kind of performance evaluation. The grade distribution wasn't made clear at any point.",
    "The only grades I get back are a couple \"well dones\" on the papers, so I have no idea how I'm doing score-wise. Other than that, it's a great, intellectually stimulating course",
    "The required response papers were not too long, but they were frequent enough that they encouraged me to stay engaged with the material, to investigate supplementary readings, and allowed me to make connections with current events. Professor Mayhew was a great discussion-leader, and the class overall taught me a lot about US electoral politics.",
    "Professor Mayhew makes this class great. He is a legend in the field.",
    "This class emphasized reading and discussion, as well as reflection in the form of response papers. I enjoyed that all aspects of the class encouraged interdisciplinary thinking and collective discussion.",
    "WEAKNESS: No assigned grades, seriously this is a big deal. You can't not assign grades for the entirety of a class, it is stressful and unfair to students",
    "I think the course is very strong. The readings were the perfect length and specificity; the classes themselves were run extremely well - I liked that Professor Mayhew read all of the essays written about the week's reading before class and then integrated people's ideas into the discussion, making sure everyone participated substantively. And the course was well-organized, such that it felt like each week's discussion was focused and distinct.",
    "This course is remarkable in the sheer density of information that is available for students to learn and discuss. The fantastic wellspring of information which Professor Mayhew is able to muster is truly impressive and I was astounded at the things I learned about my own country's elections. In order to really maximize the course, students must put themselves out there in terms of asking questions and giving comments, since the train of discussion has a habit of changing tracks quickly. However, for those who can keep up, there is no more enjoyable course."

   "comments": [
    "Anyone interested in American politics and who also can write a solid paper - yes.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Mayhew is one of the kindest professors I have encountered at Yale, and he is truly brilliant. He is basically a dictionary when it comes to past U.S. elections.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Mayhew alone is reason enough to take the course. He has decades of experience in political science and is a leading expert on U.S. national elections. The readings are manageable, interesting, and I genuinely enjoyed class every week.",
    "Take the course if you want to learn more about patterns in American national elections! It's one of the easier seminars, in my opinion. Discussion takes up a very large percentage of the class time, so be ready for your classmates to dictate the quality of the course at large. The comment papers (five different 3-5 page responses to a week's readings) were a fun chance to reflect on readings however you saw fit, and Mayhew rarely pushed back if you backed up claims with facts. Please don't be discouraged that Professor Mayhew is hard of hearing. He uses a remote sound amplifier that usually worked.",
    "I would, if they enjoy sitting and talking for two hours.",
    "Absolutely - taking a class with Professor Mayhew is an incredible opportunity, and he lives up to his reputation. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of US elections (especially congressional), and he is a passionate and engaged teacher. Discussion was robust, and I feel that the response papers allowed me to explore a few topics in-depth.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anybody interested in elections and US politics. Political junkies should definitely take this.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student at Yale. If you have a passion for politics and elections, even if you are not a political science major, you will get a lot out of this class. The readings are almost always engaging and so is the class discussion.",
    "Likely not, though the information was interesting, the grades thing is a really big deal",
    "Absolutely - Professor Mayhew is legendary for a reason, and his breadth of knowledge and care for his students is so valuable. Take it if you can.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone and everyone who has an interest in gaining a better understanding of American elections throughout our history. As someone who had always enjoyed the history of American politics, I was astounded at the number of new things I learned in every class. Professor Mayhew is incredibly knowledgeable, very helpful, and an inspiration for students to become passionate about learning. If at all possible, take this course."
