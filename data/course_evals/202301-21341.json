It also gave a better glimpse of what big contributions to economics look like and what areas seem interesting to me.",

                "One strength was the variety of ideas that were discussed. The weekly quizzes were also helpful because they ensured that we understood the content that he was teaching. Oftentimes, though, the class seemed a bit more like a small lecture than a seminar, and sometimes was not super interactive.",
                "Strengths: light workload, interesting topic that is new each class, meet other first-years, easy to follow along \r\nWeaknesses: slightly boring to me, sometimes hard to understand my professor, I am not a huge fan of econonmics",
                "The strengths are that it is an easy course with a low workload you can take for a social science credit. The weaknesses are that it can get boring quickly and you really don't need to pay attention or take any notes at all because the material covered in class is only sort of reviewed at the end of the week and isn't done so in much detail, and there are no midterms or finals or anything.",
                "I liked that the course covers a wide range of topics in economics and highlights many important milestones (such as first woman, first black person) in the development of diversity in the field (which becomes clear is still quite low). The quizzes were a good way of testing our understanding of class material and the final paper a nice opportunity to explore an idea we were most interested in. I do wish we had a little more student-led discussions where possible; sometimes the ideas were not trivial and we needed some clarification first, but in some of them I think a student-led discussion might have worked (and an extra incentive to do the readings).",
