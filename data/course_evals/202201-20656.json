However, I didn't particularly enjoy the student presentations (nor did I think they were very helpful in explaining the topics), and I would review all the material again after the presentations. It just comes to show how amazing of an instructor Sun-Joo is, and I'd rather her be the one to explain all the topics than my peers.",
                "The course is well designed for students to understand the material. The materials are organized in a way that is logical and interesting. The material is really interesting and lectures are engaging. Some of the classes are taught through student presentation, the quality of these can vary depending on the group, however, there is enough material handed out to help with the understanding of these contents.",

She's also incredibly organized and does not hesitate to help you learn the material. \r\nWeaknesses: There weren't many, but perhaps the presentation expectations could have been a little more clear.",

                "Absolutely! One of the most interesting courses I have ever taken conceptually. The entire course builds to Godel's incompleteness theorems and, although we do not spend a lot of time on it, they are fascinating and critical results in math. The professor is super wonderful and you will love her.",
                "Yes, Yes, Yes! Sun-joo is a great instructor, and you'll learn about the \"flaws\" when you create systems of logic. A lot of the concepts are very interesting and abstract, but Sun-joo does an amazing job explaining what's going on and makes it very accessible (almost trivial) to anyone who's vaguely has a math\/logic background, even though the concepts themselves are not easy. If you're interested in the philosophy of logic or perhaps just want to know about the limits of mathematics and formal systems, this is the class for you! I highly recommend this class to any CS person who's interested in Turing's\/Church's thesis and math people who want to think about the underlying structure in all of mathematics. \r\n\r\nPlease please take this course with Sun-joo!",

                "Yes, for anyone who's is interested in understanding the underlying logic and philosophical ideas behind computability and the historical effort mathematicians put into axiomatizing mathematics. Professor Shin is a funny and engaging lecture, and she is really nice. The course material is really interesting and the workload is relatively low.",
                "Yes! Especially if they are interested in the intersection of math and philosophy.",
                "Definitely, Professor Shin is a great teacher.",
                "Yes! It's an engaging course that teaches you to think a little differently than most other philosophy\/math classes, and Sunjoo is a delight.",
                "Absolutely, I developed a much deeper insight into the truth of math and logic which I thoroughly appreciate.",
                "If you are interested in the topics yes and have strong math and\/or comp sci background yes",
                "Yes, good teacher.",
                "Easily! If you find the content interesting, this is a lovely course to take. The workload is quite light, but enough to get a pretty deep understanding of the course content. Godel's theorems are one both very important to math and largely misunderstood  take this opportunity to learn them properly!",
