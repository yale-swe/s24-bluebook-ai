                "How to write journalism and how to analyze art.",
                "I learned how to become comfortable writing in my own voice - free from the uber cerebral academese we are often bound to.",
                "The class doesn't really teach you how to look at contemporary art, so you either have to 1) feel comfortable with that kind of material coming in or 2) feel comfortable not knowing and finding your way as you go along. I was in the second boat, though I thought we would learn to make sense of contemporary art so I think it's important to have that awareness coming in. The class is intense: you have to generate about two new ideas on a weekly basis and though it's not a lot of work on paper, (short readings and papers are never more than two pages double-spaced) it is very demanding. You learn to write with voice, to effectively convey opinions that are matters of taste, not reason, and to use precise language. This class was the hardest I've taken at Yale (I'm a junior in the HSAR major and always considered WR classes to be the easiest kinds of classes) but you do come out with a lot at the end of it and the conversations were usually very interesting, especially when Prof. Spillane takes a more active role. You also learn to get comfortable with extremely thorough and often harsh criticism of your writing, which I very greatly appreciated, but of course, it's difficult to hear.  Overall, you have to be in for the process of being bad and getting better, not for the results of being great. A lot of this class depends on you taking risks and often failing. If you're okay with that, it will be rewarding, but it is difficult to adjust when the vast majority of classes here are results-oriented.",
                "My writing improved a lot thanks to this course. I learned how to express my opinions about art and how to write about art more concisely. Throughout the course, I also learned how to look at art more closely and articulate what it is that I appreciate about it.",
                "Really refined my writing, specifically writing about art!",
                "Learned how to write in an entirely different way than any other art history class Ive taken much more casual and subjective, developed my own taste in art",
                "I learned a lot about how to write from looking, how to write concisely and clearly. I also got in the habit of reading more art criticism and criticism more generally.",
                "I developed my writing skills in so many different ways: from structuring my paragraphs to learning how to give my opinion through description. I also learned how to critically think about and look at contemporary art and artists."

                "The guest speakers were amazing and the professor had such a large breadth of knowledge. Great facilitation of discussion. The feedback received was thorough.\r\nWeakness: The trip to Met, while extremely fun, was very DIY.",
                "Strengths: small class size, constant movement, interesting content, noticeable progress and gains made over time, good mix of conceptual and tangible exercises (i.e, a discussion of the difference between \"naked\" and \"nude\" vs the development of a pitch given to a panel of YUAG curators for the acquisition of piece of contemporary art on the market). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While Prof. Spillane's feedback is extremely thorough, I did not feel like it was extremely clear. She wants your writing to get better but often doesn't offer many routes for reframing the problems in your writing. She honestly feels more like a very harsh editor than a professor, which was a valuable experience in and of itself that I appreciated, but there were definitely moments where I needed a professor willing to impart wisdom and explicitly guide. There were many assignments that also lacked proper explanation to help me do well (i.e, writing a piece about a portrait, but we never had a discussion about what constitutes a portrait, or writing a profile on an artist without discussing what writing a profile entails.) In that same vein, I think the class would benefit from more structure defined by Prof. Spillane, as opposed discussions about to student-selected articles.",
                "I think the one weakness of this course was the workload. There was a ton of work for a course that meets twice a week. It was also a bit disorganized at times.",
                "The class is very engaging, but the organization was sometimes confusing",
                "This course provides amazing opportunities. The speakers brought in, the \"persuading the professionals unit,\" the feedback from the professor. I felt like this course pushed the bounds of college courses in terms of expectations of assignments.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, I felt this course was not always well organized, and we often were notified about deadlines very last minute. Often, we'd get emails the night before very late with assignments for the next day. Due dates were often on weekends or random times of the day/late at night. I wish there was more consistency and respect of our time/ability to organize this course in relation to everything else going on.",
                "The content of this class was so interesting that I now read art news almost every day! This class pushes you to organize yourself around it: it requires a lot of time and effort but it is all more than worth it!"

It was, however, a great time commitment. I was also really invested in my writing for this course, which on the flip side gave me more frustration when it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be.",
