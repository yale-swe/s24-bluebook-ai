   "comments": [
    "This course is so well structured, it is phenomenal.  Compared to the other language I took at Yale, this course has been much more successful at facilitating student learning.  There are lots of small quizzes which make them low-pressure, but ensure that you are staying on top of the material.  Additionally, speaking practice is emphasized in class which makes you very comfortable by the end of the semester.  \r\n\r\nThe only weakness is that there is a TON of vocabulary and there could potentially be a better way to help students master it , rather than just rote memorization at home.",
    "It was a good class because I feel like I learned a lot.",
    "Strengths - well structured curriculum, systematic, so I learnt steadily\r\nWeaknesses - the content was a bit boring",
    "The course was really structured and students knew what to expect every week with a detailed schedule. There's a large emphasis on speaking in class and every day was interactive, which I thought was really helpful. In general, I think there could be more review of katakana because we didn't seem to learn it as solidly. I also would have preferred that we didn't have to print all of the worksheets ourselves, but that wasn't a big deal.",
    "This course does a very good job of giving students lots of practice with conversation and speaking. It could be improved by having the dates for tests more clearly marked in advance.",
    "No weaknesses for this course. It is fantastically organized and run. Seriously, an amazingly well-organized course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It is a great L1 course because they don't expect you to have any background knowledge, you really start with the basics.  Of course it is a lot of work, but it's worth it if you are interested in taking Japanese.",
    "Yes! Professor Stever is amazing, and she makes class fun to go to every day. She relates hard concepts to those we are familiar with, and makes learning a new language as bearable as it can be. The workload isn't bad at all if you work on it every night. The class is very well-structured... overall a really great class, and one of my favorite classes this semester!",
    "I would reccomend it if the person had an interest in Japanese.",
    "Yes, but be aware the JAPN 110 workload will be daily so it needs consistent effort throughout. And I felt it sometimes if I missed out on a certain grammar skill, then it would snowball and affect the subsequent chapters. So you really need to keep on top of it all the time.",
    "Yes! It was really fun and honestly not a huge workload - the hardest part is just that the class meets every day, but the day-to-day work is pretty quick. It's really rewarding to start a language from scratch and realize how much you can say after just a few months, and you definitely get that sense of accomplishment after this class.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in beginning to learn Japanese.",
    "If you want to learn Japanese, then yes. Yes x1000. The Japanese department is amazing. It's a lot of work, but worth getting yourself involved in. I found the work satisfying and not very frustrating at all. So long as you want to learn the language more than you mind doing the work, you'll have a great time."
