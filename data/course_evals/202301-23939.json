Honestly this portion of the class discussion was severely monopolized by select individuals and was much less engaging to others.",
                "The course material is interesting, but the seminars became lectures with some Q&A instead of discussions. Either need different readings or a different course format.",
                "Strengths: The assignments were fun and different from typical essays, and stretched the way I think. The handouts Professor Wicks created were also very helpful and interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We could have done breakout activities more often. I think they were often productive ways to give people things to talk about during class discussion. I would recommend banning laptops during class discussion, except when given a specific activity involving internet search. I know sometimes students used their laptops to work on other tasks during class, which drew away from their engagement and the overall quality of the conversation.",
                "The course drew from an array of different disciplines when trying to explain something about argument and persuasion. I feel it was a little light on quantitative social science research but overall it had theoretical and practical readings."

                "I think the course is interesting enough to warrant taking it, and the assignments are different and good exercises to complete. I would want to see the format changed though to make the seminar more discussion-based.",
                "Yes. This is an interesting class and one that I feel has subtly changed how I interact with people in arguments. When I say that, I do not mean that I now have a list of manipulative tricks to persuade people, but I do feel more focused in articulating my opinion and better able to reflect on how certain points might work better to convince different people based on their perspective.",
