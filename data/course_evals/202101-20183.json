                "I learned in this course to be very patient and meticulous when writing poetry, just how much range there is in kinds of poetry, and how to be a better reader of poetry. I also learned the valuable skill of editing and bettering my own poems once written.",
                "I was reminded that writing good poetry involves reading lots of poetry. I learned about the value of writing poetry regularly. I learned that poems are not supposed to be random or impossible to understand.",
                "Introduction to Poetry encouraged me to develop a regular writing routine and read poetry frequently. It introduced me to a variety of wonderful poets I hadn't read before, as well as a myriad of poetic forms I was previously unfamiliar with. I was challenged to think outside the box by the prompts, which nudged me to explore topics and styles toward which I might not typically gravitate. The emphasis on revision made me much better at looking at my own work with a critical eye in order to improve it.",

            "comments": [
                "I really liked how we all shared poems that we liked and poems that we wrote ourselves. I am a bit sad that we don't have physical copies of the poems though.",
                "I thought that the course was very strong - I appreciated the mix of looking together at anthology poems and devoting time to reading and discussing each others work. Professor Zarin is a great teacher, and I found her insights valuable.",
                "Just the sheer fact that you have to write a poem each week will help you develop your writing abilities. The fact that you are also able to read so many poems that you might not have read before is also a strength of the class. You will get out of it what you put into it.",
                "Sometimes, I wished my professor would have given me edits on individual poems I submitted rather than encouraging us only to come to office hours and speak to her about them over Zoom  I think it would have helped me understand how to improve. This aside, the professor was extremely attentive and willing to work with us on our poems. Her two forced office-hours were very helpful and I appreciated how much she impressed their importance upon us. The structure of the class was conducive to learning how to improve and give constructive criticism to others.",
                "Strengths - you write a poem each week and read the poems brought in by each student for the class anthology. Workshops can be good. The professor meets with you twice and offers half an hour of feedback on the poems you ask for help revising. Everyone feels comfortable sharing their work and no one's work ends up looking the same (individual voice is encouraged). The professor got to know us personally and tried to make us feel like we were not on Zoom. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - a small amount of feedback compared to other workshop classes makes it difficult to feel like you are improving or assess your final portfolio. The material we learn is based on what poems people bring in, which is theoretically cool, but that format doesn't guarantee learning a lot about poetry.\r\n\r\nHow it could be improved - students should have to offer comments on the workshop poems the night before, like in other workshop classes, and the professor should give written revisions for workshopped poems, if not all poems (every student hands in one poem every week, so every poem would be a lot, but at least revising the workshopped poems is reasonable).",
                "Strengths: the curriculum is largely decided by the students themselves. Some prompts are more specific and formalistic, whereas others are open-ended. There are many opportunities to receive concrete, personal feedback that will allow you to revise your work thoughtfully. \r\nWeaknesses: no \"weaknesses\" per se, but I do wish we had discussed a few more poems assigned by the professor in addition to analyzing the poems that we brought in ourselves each week",
                "I wish there had been more professor feedback throughout the semester (we would turn in poems each week but did not receive feedback on all of them). I liked how we met in office hours before the end of the semester to discuss plans for revision of poems."

                "The creation of the class anthology through Canvas Discussions worked well, as did the workshop/class structure over zoom. In office hours, sometimes the professor would say \"If I were sitting here in front of you we would talk about line breaks\" or something like that but we wouldn't talk about it because we were on zoom and I wished we could have gone into those edits together over Google Docs or some other medium of collaborative document editing"

                "Yes! If you are interested in spending more time with poetry and developing a practice of writing your own, then I recommend the course.",
                "I would. The class is a low-stakes way to really try your hand at poetry or build on skills you already have. You'll get a lot out of it if you're actually putting a lot of thought into your poems and not writing them the night before they're due, though.",
                "Yes. I think this is an important course to take if you are looking to improve your poetry reading and writing skills and become more familiar with American poetry from the 1950s onwards. Zarin is a dedicated professor and creates a good environment to be vulnerable sharing poetry and improving upon your work.",
                "I have taken several creative writing classes and the workshop experience is often a highlight. It wasn't much of a factor in this one, because students don't have to really engage with the poem before showing up to the workshop. That being said there is not much work and you get to spend some time reading and writing poetry regularly, which is nice. Get some friends to take it with you so that the class is more lively; this class could be better with a closer cohort (though everyone was completely nice).",
                "Absolutely! Introduction to Poetry encourages you to incorporate poetry reading and writing into the fabric of your daily life, which is wonderful if creative writing is something you are truly passionate about pursuing. I always looked forward to my critiques because my classmates were so thoughtful and offered such precise feedback. Professor Zarin was a wonderful resource as wellI always walked away from office hours with a game plan for how I would revise whatever I was working on at the moment.",
