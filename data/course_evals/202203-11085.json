The hard skills I learned were how to use adobe premiere, indesign, photoshop, illustrator, as well as how to put together an exhibit."

                "This course was really strong in its emphasis on critical thinking related to the actors that influence communities of a site, and developing our skills for visualization of our research. There is immediate feedback after pinups with the class, from the professor/TF/classmates, and during reviews where they bring in a few people from outside the class to critique our work. The course has a high workload, being 1.5 credits, but having a 2-hour section to ask technical questions and flesh out ideas made it manageable to get the assignments in on time with help from the TF. That said, I would really recommend having the section closer to when the class is during the week - if class is on a wednesday, a thursday or friday section as opposed to a monday would give students more time to work on the assignments after getting initial feedback on ideas. It was a huge crunch time before class every single week on monday and tuesday after monday section which probably could have been avoided if we had a chance to learn the software the week earlier than 2 days before everything was due and run our ideas over with the TF with more time to actually complete the assignment afterward. Our class bonded a lot and the architecture dept took us to iceland which was a huge highlight for everyone!"

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if you are interested in urban studies, the environment, architecture or something related. You should only take this course if you are willing to spend a SIGNIFICANT amount of time on the weekly/every other week assignments, especially if you are not well-versed in creating visualizations using the adobe creative suite. Although an urban lab, I think the course was taught in an architecture framework which really encouraged me to think differently but do be aware that a lot of the assignments feel fairly abstract and it can be a struggle to ground them in your research if this isn't something you're familiar with doing."
