More specifically, we started learning future tense in some of the binyanim, learned useful vocabulary, worked on specific complexities in Hebrew grammar, and learned about Israeli culture by engaging with primary sources (ads, TV shows, websites, etc...)."

                "The language instruction was very strong and the class community made it enjoyable",
                "The course is great for teaching Hebrew, but it does have a high workload. However, it's manageable and, if you do it, you really will learn a ton. You get good feedback, plus it's a very small course so you get a lot of one-on-one interaction with the instructor.",
                "Strengths: This course is well laid out and students know exactly what will be covered in every class at the beginning of the week. I found this very helpful (just to have a heads up about what we'd be learning). The homework is conducive to learning the material (and there's not too much of it), and the Professor cares greatly about her students. The discussion sections are a great chance to practice the Hebrew we learn in class, and the TA was super kind. The tests are difficult but the Professor spends a lot of time making sure students are comfortable with the material on the exam (so that by the time you take them they feel really simple). I don't have any weaknesses of this course to note. I enjoyed our outings and various activities, and I felt well prepared for the material! It's a great continuation of the Yale Hebrew program!",
                "Strengths: the community. This class was the closest thing I have ever had to a genuine group of friends formed off a class. Weaknesses: there is a lot of work at the beginning of the semester, so be prepared, but all of the work has a purpose. No significant areas for improvement. This was a great class, designed with intention, care and purpose. And Shiri is absolutely amazing.",
                "The course carries the strongest, most effective language curriculum I have ever seen. There is an incredible amount of attention to detail in this course. The course is so clearly effective that I wish the curriculum model could be copied and pasted and applied to other language programs both at Yale and at other institutions. Students flourish under this model.",
                "Shiri, the size of the class, and the diversity of resources we used to learn the language were all the biggest strengths. From going on field trips around campus, to having one on one conversations with Naama, to doing our largest projects around interesting materials (Israeli music and TV shows), the class made learning Hebrew fun and engaging!"

                "Yes! It is a great course that's enjoyable to be a part of and you'll become a much more knowledgeable Hebrew speaker.",
                "Yes! I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in developing their Hebrew further. It's certainly not a gut, but if you're willing to do the work (and comfortable asking for help when you need it), the course is a lot of fun. I looked forward to coming to class every morning and I'm sad it's over!",
                "Yes! If you're debating about what level to take obviously consult the Hebrew department itself, but know that even if this class is challenging at first, Shiri will make sure you feel comfortable in the class and that you will learn/catch up quickly. If the class is a bit too easy, rest assured that going over the grammar and topics taught in this class will provide you with an even stronger foundation for future Hebrew endeavors and will give you a lot more practice speaking Hebrew. It's also just a really interesting class in terms of the material covered so you won't want to miss out!"
