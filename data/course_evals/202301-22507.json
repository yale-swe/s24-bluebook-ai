I also learned that orthogonal drawings can easily convey form, shape, and scale, while perspective drawings can easily convey shadow, movement, and materials. A great drawing conveys form, shape, scale, shadow, movement, and materials, whether orthogonal or perspectival. \r\n\r\nI learned from completing small daily drawings, larger weekly drawings, and watching my TA teach skills in section.",

                "Thought the assignments were especially helpful in facilitating student engagement and learning. Though I wish there was a little more structure at times to get students to focus on especially important skills. Though I can understand the difficulties that come with this and teaching a course with students with many levels of drawing experience.",
                "The community in this course is great. George puts himself on a first name basis with his students from the first day, and values his students' insights in critique as much as his own. The critique environment is always engaging, interrogative, and kind. Our section meetings were always confidence boosting and helpful. I love that this course is accessible to all skill levels.\r\n\r\nFor the Portal assignment and the midterm, I didn't know exactly what end goal the prompt was asking for. I would have liked to see past students' work before starting, but that could stress out other students. Also, the full list of materials required for the class cost around $300, and I didn't end up using everything. The required materials list isn't accessible to all. A more thorough system could be created to recycle past students' materials to current students.",
                "This has been my favorite class I've ever taken. Professor Knight is a truly knowledgable and talented educator; he's very good at teaching super difficult concepts/techniques. This made the weekly seminars and assignments a joy, and even though the assignments all took a lot of time, I feel like I learned a lot from each one.",
                "Strengths: incredibly helpful feedback on drawings, support from TAs and professor, overall vibes were amazing\r\nWeakness: heavy workload at times, not as much discussion on work outside from our drawings",
                "This class has no outstanding weaknesses. I have developed the skills to express ideas in more thorough, technical and creative ways. The workload is high, with some drawings requiring a great deal of time and focus. However, students may devote themselves to varying degrees, progressing at a parallel level. The class fosters community and thrives on collaboration.",
                "Absolutely amazing- not really any weaknesses.",
                "Strength - continuous feedback that can be used moving forward",
                "Better time management would have made this course much better. Spending way too much time on some students work and not enough time on other students' work, depending on where in the classroom they hung up their work, was frustrating for everyone. And because almost all the class time was spent on the crits, there was almost no teaching. Most of the skills I learned were skills I taught myself in order to complete the coursework. Obviously seeing everyone's work is important, but I wish that we had been more responsible with how much time we spent doing that so we also could have learned skills and practiced drawing in class. Also we always started late, which was a waste of time for students who arrived early. Everyone knows what time class starts so if they can't show up on time, that's their responsibility.",
                "This was an excellent, excellent course. The assignments seemed very intentional and always helped me to grow. The in-class discussions were supportive, inspiring, and helpful. I could not recommend a course more highly and could go on and on about the experience. I will offer two small suggestions for imrpovement. First, I think the supply list could be refined slightly to cut down on student costs (specifically, the adjustable triangle, newsprint pad, and possibly tracing paper). Second, I think the logisitical execution of the weekly section would benefit from some modification. On weeks where there wasn't much to cover in section, I would have prefered to make time for the demonstration during class, as the amount of effort it took to come to section did not seem worth the benefit. Additionally, since the section was scheduled after registration and written as mandatory, before it was scheduled I was worried that I would not be able to take the course and was frantically trying to keep my other sections clear of times when it might be scheduled. If students will be able to take the course regardless of whether they could make the section time, as it seemed in the end that they were able to, it would be helpful for them to know this during registration.",
                "This class requires a lot of drawing time. I wish more of it could be done with the class. Maybe a longer section that is really more of a group drawing studio?"

And I want to keep drawing!",

At times, the workload may feel overwhelming. However, the time-commitment is worthwhile. Looking back at your work throughout the semester, you will see a clear progression. That being said, if you apply yourself in a shallow capacity, you will not come away with the expertise and skills this class has to offer.",
                "YES!!! Such an amazing class with so much to learn.",
                "Yes, even if it is not apparent, drawing helps with multiple aspects of life. It helps me with clarity and creativity.",
                "I would recommend this course in a heartbeat. All time spent was enjoyable, from the homework assignments (which are all drawings) to the critiques, which are always appreciative and constructive, without being disheartening. I grew a lot as an artist in this course. The assignments had great variety and seemed very intentional. I looked forward to our sessions each week, as well as thework sone in between them.",
