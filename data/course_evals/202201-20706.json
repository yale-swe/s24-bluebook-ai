                "This was a wonderful introduction to Shakespeare and related works! I learned a lot about the politics of adaptation and how loaded that term can be.",
                "I learned a lot about the ways that different cultures and countries process Shakespeare as a playwright and as an extension of British imperialism. It was truly fascinating to read and watch how people react to this \"universal\" playwright, how they/we adapt, revise, reframe, translate his work and his stories to better suit our own narratives and political agendas (there was also ongoing conversation on the language around adaptation that was very fruitful). The course put into context a lot of why I hated Shakespeare in the first place and brought up a lot of new questions for me in terms of how he is taught and regarded. I definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to talk shit about, praise, challenge, and/or learn about how Shakespeare has (positively and negatively) impacted our world.",
                "I became a better reader in understanding how to approach whole plays and texts, in close reading, historical frames, and theoretical approaches. This isa wonderful class for students of all levels.",

                "Shakespeare is the greatest writer in the English language and this class reinforced that but also made me look at Shakespeare in an entirely new way. It made me more acutely aware of his blind spots as a writer (of which there are a couple) and also how the effect the fame of his work has had on the way it was taught, specifically in colonized nations.",

                "Strengths - very engaging, both professors, TFs were all AMAZING. Nothing like learning Shakespeare in high school, the inclusion of global adaptations pulled out the important themes from the source text and how we understand the human condition from the various characters\r\nWeaknesses/Improvements - would love to have the lectures recorded to go back to help with writing essays and such, because they were so great and rich!",
                "I really enjoyed the works we engaged with in this class! And the professors were both clearly very passionate and knowledgable about the subject matter!",
                "I honestly really loved the structure of this course; though at times overwhelming in the adaptation weeks, it works well to break up the Shakespeare material across a week and then tackle multiple adaptations in the next. I loved that we always had the option to zoom into the lecture when we needed to, it was incredibly helpful and made the course a lot more accessible. I also appreciated that each lecture was an analysis of the material paired with actual historical background on it. If anything, the Files folder on the Canvas could be cleaned up a bit, and lecture/slides posting could be more consistent as we get later in the semester.",
                "I loved the rhythm of the course--one week on a Shakespeare play, one week on adaptations. It worked great and structured the semester. I liked the small lecture format, the reading responses, and section. I know Professor Manley is retiring (congrats!), but I will note I thought this class worked great in a cotaught format, showing us different appraoches etc. This could be great to do in the future as well, perhaps in the grad student/professor teaching together program. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't remove any text, but I also know Professor R teaches this class a lot and there are endless possibilities for what we could read. I like our short stories, and wondered if it would be fun to do a novel or more lyric poetry to talk about genre in adaptation.",
                "great variety of works read, good workload between readings and essays, great teaching",
                "no weaknesses, good discussions",
                "The workload is pretty intense. One (sometimes two) plays a week and weekly reading responses. The professors/TAs could be a bit more lenient/understanding in that regard.",
                "Strengths: The professors. I feel so lucky that I got to take this class the one year that Professor Manley is teaching it because he had a more classical perspective on Shakespeare that I don't hear anywhere else. Professor Ramachandran also has her own fascinating more comp-lit based perspective on Shakespeare. For a class about the different ways people have interpreted Shakespeare, it was amazing to hear two different perspectives on the texts from the different perspectives. But none of this would have mattered if both professors weren't geniuses that, regardless of their perspectives, had amazing things to say in every lecture and made me actively look forward to hearing what they had to say.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: One small nitpick -- I was confused on the class's reading response policy. We were asked to write a minimum of 150 words, but most people's reading responses went well over that to the point that I felt like I never knew if my reading responses were good enough or not. We were also allowed to miss four reading responses without it affecting our grade, something I did not realize until late in the year and would have liked to know earlier before I was doing extra work."

                "YES!!! Take this class, I didn't think I would love it as much as I did! Especially if you are an english major, this will fulfill the Renaissance requirement while also being incredibly engaging (and you will interact with more modern texts too!). Also, only 2 papers that are very open for you to write on what you find most engaging, which made them easy/fun to write. Professor Manley is retiring, but if Prof. Ramachandran is teaching, take it!!!",
                "Yes, particularly to English majors looking to fulfill the Renaissance requirement and/or who, like me, wouldn't necessarily say they are fans of Shakespeare but want to engage with his work anyway.",
                "Yes! Especially if you're not crazy about or *are* critical of Shakespeare. I came into this class with a bad taste in my mouth but I really appreciate the expanse that is Shakespearean adaptation and what it means to have been forced to learn, coerced into engaging with, or chosen to tangle with Shakespeare across the globe. Also love that it is part of a larger Global Shakespeares project, or at least works with this project in expanding understandings/lenses of Shakespeare across cultures.",
                "Yes! It is very interesting especially if you are approaching this subject for the first time. Everyone should learn about Shakespeare!",
                "Yes, a very fascinating course especially if you have studied some of Shakespeare's works in the past.",
                "Yes-excellent for major requiremetns or just for fun!",
                "This class provides a wonderful way to reconsider our study (and emphasis) of Shakespeare. All texts were fascinating and engaging and well discussed by the professors and teaching fellows.",
                "yes! It's very approachable to non-English majors and is definitely more of an introductory English course than an upper level one in terms of what is expected of you. Reading Shakespeare along with adaptations is a great way to do it, and the syllabus is awesome. Profs. Ramachandran and Manley lecture in different styles which was really interesting. Pretty low workload outside of the readings.",
                "yes, good intro to shakespeare",
                "Yes!!",
                "Yes! Great Renaissance requirement for English majors who maybe want to take something related to Shakespeare, but not just his plays. This class connects his work to present day authors and issues in very interesting ways.",
                "Yes, it offered a really unique view into Shakespeare's works for those who enjoy Shakespeare, but it also offered insight into how people around the world engage with well-known works.",
                "Wholeheartedly yes! I would routinely have my mind blown by both Professor Ramachandran and Professor Manley's lectures, even in the Shakespeare plays I had already read in a class. Both professors are two of the smartest people on Yale's campus and I felt like hearing their 50-minute lectures was more effective at helping me learn about the plays than even reading the plays were. There were multiple lectures where I did not want to get up from my seat after it was over because I just needed everything to sink in. If you can tolerate Shakespeare, you will love this class, and if you can't tolerate Shakespeare, it gets easier, so take this class and learn to tolerate him. This class is that good.",
                "Yes. This is a great way to fulfill your Renaissance requirement for the English major while also seeing how Shakespeare's works still have a relevant influence on literature and art today. Also, if you're not an English major, it's a great introduction to Shakespeare without having to take a class with a syllabus that is exclusively Shakespeare.",
                "I would. Hybrid lecture and discussion format really works."
