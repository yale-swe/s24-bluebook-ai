                "I thought that this course had a really interesting subject matter. But I have a few problems with it:\r\n1. Our instructors' presence on Canvas was very disorganized, which made it hard to follow when assignments were due, and what they were actually asking of us. For instance, during one of our last classes, a classmate asked when a poster was due and our instructor responded, \"tomorrow.\" The assignment had never been posted on Canvas. This led to a lot of last-minute preparation and cramming\r\n2. Our \"reading quizzes\" asked far too much of the students. We, many of us being non-physics majors, would be assigned several hours' worth of reading on astrophysics and then quizzed on the minutae of it (I.e. what does this term mean).  Even though I genuinely did all of the readings, I found myself not scoring well on the quizzes simply because of the nature of them\r\n3. We were asked to complete a 20-page paper with pretty much no scaffolding. When my classmates and I expressed our confusion about how to even approach a task as daunting as this, our instructor expressed her shock that we had never written a 20-page paper, but did not really offer help or advice",
                "Strengths - interesting and engaging\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes the organization was poor and it was easy to feel like you're not getting it",
                "Strengths: incredibly interesting discussions and projects, productive office hours \r\nWeaknesses: physics portion during the second half of the semester was nearly impossible to understand and I was not able to relate it to what we were learning about",
                "This course takes a uniquely conversational and colloquial approach to scientific concepts. It thrived in its encouragement of discussion, questioning, and collaboration. The instructor's office hours, while limited, were convenient for me and always were helpful. While it didn't necessarily feel like a science course (because it is not lecture-based), I found every class meeting interesting and engaging."

                "Yes!",
                "Yes; I took the course because the name sounded interesting, and I came out of it knowing so much more than I expected both in terms of the universe and the field of astronomy.",
