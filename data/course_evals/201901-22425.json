    "I learned how to apply previous calculus skills to three dimensions. The course builds well off of the previous calculus sequence at Yale and is much more applicable in terms if examples (by nature of it being in three dimensions). Topics include vectors, functions of two\/three variables, extrema, planes, parametric surfaces, integration over multiple dimensions, vector and line integrals, and vector theorems.",
    "Mental yoga, as Brett called it <3",
    "I developed a lot of of skills. \r\n\r\nI learned multiple types of integrals and new derivatives, and I also learned vector calculus. \r\n\r\nI learned how to think in 3 dimensions and even how to draw some functions in 3D.",
    "I learned about multivariable calculus for the first time, and solidified my previous calculus knowledge from high school and Math 115. My ability to visualize graphs, both in two and three dimensions, also improved, in addition to my understanding of vectors. I can safely say that I don't despise vectors anymore.",
    "Multivariable calculus teaches you to think in three dimensions, and functions in three dimensions (and\/or more). The class definitely brings together everything you've learned about calculus thus far and caps off the sequence nicely.",
    "Calculus of several variables",
    "A deeper understanding of 3 dimensional calculus and it's applications.",
    "I learned multivariable calculus.",
    "An understanding of calculus in a third dimension. Fundamental for many other Yale classes."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: There were a lot of opportunities for feedback on your performance between the online practice problems (Ximera) and office hours. The lectures were formatted well to facilitate learning and review important concepts before launching into new material. Exams were relatively clear content-wise; no surprises\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course is very fast-paced, especially towards the end. At some points I felt my head spinning; it is certainly easy to become overwhelmed.",
    "Strengths- good teachers like Brett and Sudesh, Ximera \r\nWeaknesses- Make the second midterm less difficult",
    "The major strength is Ximera. It is amazing. \r\nThe weakness was that we skipped a couple topics in the book.",
    "Spent too long on the first few chapters, too little time towards the end when concepts began to get extremely difficult.",
    "The small size of the class was helpful because I was able to get one on one help when I needed it during class. There was also a manageable amount of material to cover. However, the problems in the problem sets seemed harder than the problems we tackled in class.",
    "Teaches 3D well, but the exams are kind of rough without proper preparation (which is often very difficult to manage along other classes. The problem sets don't take long, but then exam prep takes way longer than you planned for it to.)",
    "Very fast-paced and packed with content, students should be ready to be attentive at all times.",
    "Very well organized and a lot of support to help with studying and understanding concepts.",
    "I think it was a pretty strong course overall, and there weren't really too many weaknesses.",
    "Strengths were the classes themselves. Really profited from the explanations and the level of engagement. No particular weaknesses. I think its a good course overall."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. While I know a lot of people simply take Math 120 to fulfill a requirement, it is really beautiful when everything clicks together at the end of the course. You learn how a lot of the basic problem-solving tools in prior calculus classes are useful in various fields, such as physics.",
    "Good for math\/stem\/Econ people if you take it with either Brett or sudesh",
    "Yes, if the person was interested in mathematics. The course is very interesting, for a math major. The course teaches you to think better, and allows you to develop mathematical problem solving tools.",
    "I would recommend this course, even if you are not a STEM major. I am not a STEM major, but the problem solving skills I learned in this class will definitely be useful to me.",
    "Take multi if you like math\/need it for your major. It's not a fun class if you don't have the technical background for it, and it's not an easy one at that. It, however, did feel easier than Math 115, and is a good checkpoint for your mathematical abilities and path.",
    "If they are willing to put in the time and effort to be at every class and learn the material, then yes.",
    "Yes. This course was very fun and interesting.",
    "Yes! I had a really good professor, which helped a lot. Overall, the course is well structured as well.",
    "Yes. I think the course creates an understanding of the baseline of many other fields."
