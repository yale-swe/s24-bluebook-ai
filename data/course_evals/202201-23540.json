Discussions are chill and often tied to current events (e.g. elections happening in the EU, the Ukraine situation, COVID)\r\nWeakness: sometimes the discussion can get a little monotonous. I also wish the readings were more focused - sometimes the reading assignment for a week is just \"read this entire book from start to finish,\" which is neither feasible nor provides targeted information that we can actually remember.",
