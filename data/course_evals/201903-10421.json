   "comments": [
    "The class was very inspiring and I very enjoyed it. Technical instructions to shooting, developing and printing are all very comprehensive and helpful. Artist talks are also great with a good variety of different artists and perspectives.",
    "I entered the class with no experience using a film camera, and had no knowledge as to how to develop and print. This course started from scratch and taught us everything from camera handling, to content, to printing.",
    "Learned about photo history and how to develop and print my own photos",
    "So many skills learned, so many! How to use a film camera, how to develop photos, how to \"see,\" how to read an image, to name a few skills learned. We also learned a lot about key figures in photographic history. And, Danna also invited quite a few artists to talk to our class about their work and career paths.",
    "I gained technical experience in shooting and developing film. I also was able to see and learn about a variety or artists and styles in order to better appreciate the work of others and to inform my own work. I gained a lot of confidence in my photographic abilities, knowledge, and style.",
    "I learned about the basics of composition and darkroom printing, but perhaps what will stick with me the most are the questions that this class opened up. What do I have to say, as an artist? What do I find truly interesting and valuable? Danna and TF Allison Minto asked us the tough questions about our work, pushed us to separate what was essential and most compelling from what was common and everyday."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Artist talks and gallery visits are great. Some of the crits could be scheduled a bit longer for more discussion.",
    "This course was the perfect balance of viewing pictures and getting feedback on our own.",
    "The strengths of this class were the professors: Dana and Allison and the care and concern they put into facilitating a great learning environment and building a community. They're both amazing and inspiring photographers.\r\n\r\nWeakness: maybe we had too many crits, but I also am aware that you learn by doing when it comes to photography, so maybe more pictures and fewer crits?",
    "Danna and Allison were both incredibly approachable. Art, especially at Yale, can be incredibly intimidating. However, both our professor and TF fostered an incredibly warm and welcoming space that made for exciting class time full of sharing ideas that were meaningful, personal, and oftentimes vulnerable!",
    "This class has lots of strengths! It was well set up to participate and learn. The smaller close-knit class size allowed us to learn a lot about each other's work and help and push each other to be better. In-Class artist talks and museum visits were a huge highlight! I learned a lot of valuable things by speaking with these people, hearing their stories, and learning about beautiful works up close. Critiques of our work were formatted so that we could really learn and grow from our work, by hearing and having a conversation with others about it. Such a well organized, well facilitated, creative and welcoming class that taught me so much!\r\nThe only weaknesses I would say are that hour for the dark room to print photos were difficult to schedule, as printing ended at 10pm, and that materials and such are quite expensive (but this is inevitable with film materials).",
    "You get to form such a wonderful class dynamic as the semester goes on. Seeing others' prints in crit is such a fantastic opportunity to see what you've been missing, to glean new sources of inspiration."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! This class was so much fun, and even though it was a lot of time spent taking pictures and developing them, it was so worth it and so different from my other classes and it was so much fun!",
    "Absolutely",
    "Yes, if you're interested in photo and understanding the basics of photo and where it comes from, you should take this course. Also a great course for self-reflection through art",
    "I highly recommend this class. I feel like a lot of the learning at Yale is really rote and uninspiring, but this class was challenging in a rewarding and inspiring way and the professors were two of the best teachers I've ever had!",
    "YES! definitely. Perhaps my opinion is biased because this is probably my favorite class I've taken at Yale, but if you have the time you have to take this class. As others have stated in previous years, I only suggest taking this course if you're absolutely sure you can dedicate the time that is needed to properly develop photos in the darkroom. If you don't have any experience with developing film\/photos (which definitely shouldn't deter you from taking this class, as most people had never been inside a darkroom), you might not understand how you can spend so long just developing. But, if you want your images to come out well, then you'll need to spend a bit of time experimenting with light exposure and framing\/borders to produce something you're happy with. I also don't know what it'd be like to take this course with another professor, as Danna truly tailored this course to focus on the growth of each individual student.",
    "Yes! Highly recommended! A great experience that is a lot of fun and a low pressure way to learn a difficult and daunting process while also learning about how to create art in a meaningful way.",
    "Yes! You will emerge a more sophisticated artist and a more questioning, less certain human being."
