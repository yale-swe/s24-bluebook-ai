                "This course has allowed me to become a better listener. I can identify musical techniques and determine cultural influences when listening to music. The journey of 1000 years has been eye opening and I feel like I can listen to music with a deeper perspective",

                "This course is very freeform/chill, which is mostly a strength but can occasionally be a weakness when the readings aren't posted until a night before they're due or the final isn't posted and it's almost reading period. In general, though, this course is really fun and provides an interesting look at the history of music. The readings are usually interesting and the songs are too. Prof Z definitely wants people to succeed in the course and is supportive. The midterm is the only test (which is great -- most of the grade is from other stuff) and it required a lot of memorization of terms, but ultimately wasn't too bad. The course also doesn't assume any prereqs/music theory knowledge.",
                "The class was really interesting. I think the music was really fun and the lecture format was really nice.",
                "Strengths: thoughtfully planned lectures, engaging professor, light workload, quick-ish feedback on short responses, reasonable tests\r\nWeaknesses: some awkward silent pauses (during zoom), sometimes somewhat surface level discussions, readings could be kinda dense/boring at times",
                "Strengths; nice sense of community, good feedback, interesting and extensive syllabus. Engaging professor and TF. \r\nWeakness: Some weeks had too many readings, made it hard to retain so much info. Professor seemed to be a bit distant/uninterested in students at times, also seemed to shame/punish students who used their previous music and music theory knowledge in the class discussions or assignments."

                "This course was a seminar so it was built around discussion.

                "I would recommend this course if you're open to learning about/listening to/discussing new musical genres. This course really gives you a broad and interesting overview of music from the 12th century to today. The course is not too much work and usually the homework is to listen to a few songs/pieces and read one or two readings, and then in class you discuss the homework and sometimes watch presentations on related content.",
                "Maybe. I would have to clearly explain what the course is about. When I signed up for the class, I thought there would be less focus on non-english music made before the 1600s. However, I did enjoy some of the things that I learned about.",
                "Yes absolutely!! The course has a very manageable course load, along with a FANTASTIC professor (and TA). The course was very accessible, even for someone with little music experience like me. I imagine that this FYS would be even better in person, so take this course if you get the chance!",
                "This course is very interesting. From its eye catching title to its broad musical appeal, it is a stimulating course for music lovers. This class also takes into account the greater social context of songs allowing us to get a more holistic view of issues they may bring up.",
