                "Having recorded lectures was good for me to catch up on my own time. However, because all the actual content was pre-recorded, I almost felt like the time for live lectures wasn't as effective in helping me learn or reinforce the topics. Mostly this might have been due to the lack of structure to the open Q&A session. Having the quizzes integrated into the pre-recorded lectures required me to stay on track with the lectures but also were a bit stressful if I forgot to do them. At first I thought the debates were a bit extra, but they were a nice addition to the live lecture to hear from my classmates about a focused topic.",
                "Pros: Content is fantastic-- really covers anything and everything you've wondered about healthcare in the US. \r\n\r\nCons: the testable material is everything and anything he's said in class or in a recorded lecture, which is... a lot. The recorded lecture stuff is fine because there are powerpoints and you can take good notes. But the class sessions were formatted as Q&A sessions, and he often didn't even read the question aloud before answering, so I didn't know what he'd be talking about until halfway through his answer, by which time it was difficult to write down what he just said. I think if he had a rough outline of the day's topics that he posted before class, it would really facilitate in-class learning.",

                "The mandatory in-person Q&A sessions seemed a bit pointless, in addition to the in-class activities. I did not really pay attention. The debates were interesting but also difficult to really take something from. The lectures and slides were very informative, but many of the concepts were not clearly explained or outlined on the slides. The organization could have also been improved, as a lot of prior knowledge was assumed so the topics seemed to jump around. The midterm also did not offer enough time and also had vague questions, despite being conceptually easy.",
                "The live sessions were very hard to sit through\/learn at times. I wish they would be more structured by topic rather than a free-flowing Q and A. The debate was pretty fun but hard to make engaging online. The midterm was way too long and was impossible to finish. However, this class was great-the TAs, especially Evie and Arya, were very accessible, as was Howie, holding office hours multiple times a week. I thought Howie was a great teacher to have, was really funny\/was super knowledgeable on healthcare and coronavirus, and would answer all our questions and tried to make the class as interactive as possible.",
                "The overall course material is very interesting and it brings to light the issues in the American healthcare system. As a premed, I loved taking this class because I was made more aware of the shortcomings in physicians, and I feel as though this class really opened my eyes up to the kind of doctor I want to be. However, the course was very disorganized, something I think was attributed to the pandemic. The live lectures had no structure and even the asynchronous lectures lacked structure sometimes. I wish that we had some sort of literature to refer to rather than just Howie's speaking.",
                "Strengths: teaching team was great, Professor Forman is a great lecturer and super knowledgable\r\nWeaknesses: it was a bit disorganized",
                "Strengths: Professor Forman is a gem. This class also has something for everyone from pre-med students to polisci students to economics students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the live sessions dragged a little bit when the questions stopped flowing (because the live sessions were generally Q&A), but Howie would usually just let us leave early if that was the case.",
                "Strengths \r\n- Interesting course material\r\n- super knowledgeable and passionate professor and TFs!\r\n- Guest Lectures\r\n- Prerecorded asynchronous sessions gave students access to course material in a very organized manner\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- Debates were a bit tougher in the virtual setting because all arguments appeared to be pre written",
                "Strengths: Interesting and important content. Howie is absolutely amazing and you can tell all the students love him. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it was hard to tell what question was being answered live",
                "Prof. Forman is very nice and knowledgeable, and clearly organized class well. The asynchronous lectures with live Q&A sessions worked well and allowed us to spend time with Prof. Forman discussing the more complex parts of the material.\r\nI would have liked to study more of the economics behind healthcare. We studied broad trends and economic observations that have been made, but the course realistically did not require much economics background.",
                "Strength: Covers a wide spread of interesting material with good slides to get the main ideas. Weakness: There is heavy use of jargon that is not explained and having recordings from the summer means there was no ability to improve lecture quality during the semester. The synchronous sessions did not really have a strong purpose and more often than not were unclear and did not help facilitate understanding of class material.",
                "The strength is the subject of the course, which is interesting especially if you take the time to look stuff up yourself. Weakness is the structure of the class. The asynchronous lectures felt rushed, the synchronous sessions didn't feel relevant, and overall the structure of the course could have been improved to both better facilitate learning and teach the material more thoroughly.",
                "Strengths Tuesday and Thursday discussions were very nice. (Little to have to worry about other than listening and taking notes on important topics). recorded lectures were well organized and helpful to study\r\n\r\nWeaknesses Tuesday and Thursday lectures definitely did not have to be 1h15m...Could've been a 50 min segment and still would've learned the same amount (or release students earlier than we were)",
                "why did we have Asynchronous and synchronous lectures... why were we in class for double the amount of time. Such a waste. The synchronous lectures were a useless mandatory Q&A. Pointless",
                "Strengths are that the topics are very interesting but a big weakness was having to watch lectures outside of the live lectures which led to a lot of extra work. Another weakness was the Q&A format of the live lectures that didn't allow for a full and in-depth understanding of one topic because we would jump around topics.",
                "The recorded lectures had a lot of important information. However, the synchronous sessions were simply Q&As which did not seem necessary (although attendance was mandatory).",
                "A huge weakness was the required Q&A sessions. Attendance wouldn't necessarily be a problem but when everything that the professor says is potentially testable and on those tests you get an obscure question about something he talked about for about 5 minutes, it's not practical at all.",
                "Strengths: flipped classroom model. I hope they keep that next year, since the lectures are already recorded. Getting to do a Q and A with Howie twice per week was by the best part of the class. Also, I loved the guest speakers, especially Farzad.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I never did the readings, I'm not sure why they were assigned, but I think it would've been better to just assign a \"layperson\" book about the problems in the medical system and call it a day.",
                "Strengths are the content, weakness would be how it was taught virtually (as the pre-recorded lectures plus the required live classes were a lot)",
                "The course gives a great overview of health economics in the US and I gained a lot of knowledge by the end of the course. However, some components of the course lacked structure and I often found myself confused about the ways the various topics fit together",
                "I thought that the live sessions were not necessary and I did not like that some content felt presumed. For instance, in the Medicaid lecture, it begins with \"this is how FMAP is allocated for Medicaid states\" as opposed to something like \"Medicaid is insurance for people who are living close to or below the federal poverty level\". \r\n\r\nHowever, Howie is a very knowledgeable professor and it was great hearing from his insights. I especially appreciated the paper as a creative way to synthesize course material.",
                "Very badly organized and executed. Discussion was extremely boring. Prerecorded lectures were relatively long- usually over an hour. Very VERY little information about exams. In class activities organized poorly, as well as the debate. Only positive is the largely self taught knowledge from the course",
                "I found some of the live lecture redundant",
                "S: Howie is a very good lecturer, TAs are very attentive, and material is very relevant and interesting to learn \r\nW: the way the midterm exam was administered was a little ridiculous. Not only was extremely time-constrained, but there were no practice exam questions given. The justification was that they would give up too much of what the exam looks like, but me and other peers felt like like that was a ridiculous excuse to leave us unprepared for the exam. Furthermore, concern over cheating was a little too much, and the time constraint was awful for those with slower typing such as myself.",
                "Strengths were the content. Weaknesses definitely include the vagueness of feedback, and not truly knowing how well youre understanding the content.",
                "The course covered a lot of material in a well-structured format. The lectures were incredibly relevant to what is currently going on in the world. The professor is always willing to answer questions and evidently passionate about the topics covered. The guest lecturers brought different perspectives on the topics that we covered in class. One weakness I would note is the prerecorded\/live lecture format. Most of the \"learning\" was done through the prerecorded lecture, and we spent the live lecture time asking questions or doing debates. Sometimes the questions asked during the live lecture jumped from topic to topic which made it a little difficult to follow. I would have liked to see some structure in terms of organizing the questions.",
                "Strengths: Howie is a good lecturer, TAs are really helpful\r\nWeaknesses: Weird class format (watch lectures asynchronously then required to show up to synchronous lectures which were basically mandated office hours), felt like at times Howie thought we knew more about health economics than we actually did so some parts of lecture he went over super fast without explaining much and left me confused, could use more econ application",
                "4 recorded lectures and 2 live mandatory classes was a lot of contact time for one class. It was hard to keep up\r\n\r\nThe assignments and exams were definitely a strength however ie the debates and paper were fun",
                "Strength: Applicable content taught, very useful in life",
                "Bad teaching format. The live Q&A sessions were difficult to stay focused in for 75 minutes especially when the professor would ramble. The pre-recorded lectures were also very dense.",
                "This course had some good modules for learning and I really appreciated the way Howie answers questions.\r\nHowever, the course sometimes appeared to be stacked against us in that Howie would constantly mention that we would do badly on midterms. Additionally, there was no point for an in-person lecture along with asynchronous video- that was too much work.",
                "OOf, where do I start..... doing this on zoom was a mess. The recorded lectures were lengthy and hard to follow, and the live sessions were very uninteresting (it was just a Q&A about the recorded lectures). I would have appreciated it if the information was given to us live (instead fo the prerecorded lectures), so we could ask questions as information came up, and be more engaged with the live sessions. Also, Prof. Forman and the TAs kind of did us dirty with the exams... I've never heard of reasoning for not providing practice tests being \"they will reveal too much about what kind of questions we'll ask\"... isn't that the point? It made taking the exams extremely stressful (especially the midterm), in a semester that was already under stressful conditions.",
                "More assignments that aren't the midterm or final to solidify a grade.",
                "Strengths: I liked the debates during class, which allowed students to hear both sides of policy questions and come to their own conclusions. The TFs were friendly and helpful, and I appreciated that they frequently posted Canvas announcements and kept good communication. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The midterm was terrible- too many questions and too little time. The course was a little disorganized (routine quiz questions weren't entered into Canvas until late in the semester). Professor Forman tended to ramble during the live sessions and his powerpoint slides were not always clear.",
                "The recorded lectures were very informative however the synchronous lectures where the professor mostly just answered student questions about the asynchronous videos often felt a little unstructured.",
                "Live sessions were essentially disorganized mandatory office hours... was hard to actively engage\/pay attention; professor seemed often unprepared \r\n\r\nPre-recorded lectures included good overview",
                "I think that this course was really strong in giving overview level knowledge of different areas. I wish that the synchronous classes were a little more structured but other than that it was great!",
                "Strengths: Professor Forman is incredibly passionate and accessible. The class did a really good job giving students a foundation in health policy\/economics that most don't have before the class. Weaknesses: The videos were too focused on the slides (at times, the videos just felt like a reading of the text on the slides). The live sessions could have been more effective if they were less focused on question and answer.",
                "The asynchronous videos were good but all of class was filled with question and answer so it made class very uneventful and it made the exams seem like they were mainly based on the videos.",
                "Sometimes lectures were hard to understand but howie usually clarified confusion in lecture.",
                "Dr. Foreman is incredibly knowledgeable, however, most of the content is in the prerecorded lectures which makes the live virtual lectures somewhat dry.",
                "Strength: the instructor does a very good job of using current examples to break down the impacts that specific things have had on healthcare and this keeps it engaging. Little to say about weaknesses.",
                "At the start of the semester, I remember that a lot of people, me included, complained that lecture was like required office hours, and a lot of people were on their phones the whole time. At some point, I took five days to rewatch every prerecorded lecture and recorded live lecture and realized that the the content was quite interesting after all. The problem is just that once someone loses focus during the discussion of one question, they're pretty much out of the entire lecture and waiting to take notes later off of the recording. I think it might be helpful to have a five minute break so that people can keep up with every question being asked in class.",
                "Strengths: solid content, recorded lectures were very tight.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: live lecture attendance was completely unnecessary, and the course material tended to be too broad and not focused enough on actual economics.",
                "Professor Forman is amazing, such a great teacher, super enthusiastic! Can be a bit boring as a course overall",
                "This course was just a lot of time because there were lots of recorded lectures to watch, and then the class period itself was mandatory and lengthy. I enjoyed it, it was just time consuming. Prof Forman is great.",
                "I think that this course was very enjoyable overall. One aspect of this course that I appreciated was the opportunity to ask questions in the live sessions. One aspect of this course that I think could be improved is the organization of the course material.",
                "Definitely very important and interesting material. I don't think the recorded lecture + live Q&A format was particularly successful (this is just a COVID precaution though).",
                "I thought this course was run very well. Professor Forman and the ETAs were very receptive to student feedback and helpful. Professor Forman is definitely a huge strength. He is so knowledgeable about the topic and explains things very well. I thought the recorded videos before class were also helpful because they gave us a chance to be familiar with the content before class.",
                "Strengths: the TFs are all very responsive and helpful, the Q&A live lectures are great for clarifying concepts, and Professor Forman is really wonderful.",
                "The combined format of recorded lectures and live virtual Q&A's worked very well. Prof. Forman's answers were particularly valuable when they went beyond textbook-like material and into his personal experience or insight into current events. The sequence of topics built on itself nicely, and assignments were well designed to reinforce key lessons without being too much work. I thought that the debates didn't add much to the course, so their time could have been better used otherwise. I'd also be interested to have a conclusion to the course that directly addresses the big picture of why the US healthcare system is so expensive relative to its outcomes and what can be done to fix that, to the extent that clear answers exist."

                "The flipped classroom wasn't the best, as you felt like you had to double up on class time. Live lectures ended up being mostly Q and A and felt like a waste of time. The debates didn't feel super productive.",
                "The pre-recorded lectures were helpful. The open Q&A wasn't as effective for me without a structure, so maybe next time it would be nice to supplement more with what was covered in the actual slides.",
                "Recorded lectures were great. Synchronous sessions could be more structured-- would really help when it comes time to a) relate the session to the recorded lectures, and b) study for the exams.",
                "Thought the structure worked well, although sometimes it was hard to focus during synchronous lectures without any visuals.",
                "I liked that they put us in debate groups, and also into random breakout rooms to meet new people and discuss even though they were sometimes awkward. I didn't like the asynchronous videos at times because there were no subtitles and sometimes for people with little knowledge of healthcare in the US, they were hard to follow because I felt like at times there wasn't any sort of basic framework established, we just dove straight into the details.",
                "The asynchronous lectures before each class made it hard to stay engaged in the synchronous lectures because we were going over material we had already learned about. I wish Howie spent more time live lecturing and allowing for questions in between his lectures instead of synchronous classes being only questions.",
                "I thought the asynchronous videos were very informative and I didn't mind watching them. I think if the live sessions w=started off more structured before moving straight into Q&A would've been helpful -- maybe just spend the first 15 minutes going over the objectives?",
                "Worked:\r\n- Recorded lectures with search options - super helpful for preparing for exams! \r\n- Making the structure open-note (Fair playing field for all students)\r\n- Prerecorded asynchronous sessions\r\n- Guest lectures! - especially on how Covid was changing the work they do \r\n\r\nCould be improved\r\nQ\/A availability during the live session via the Zoom chat  - this worked well to an extent, though it sometimes became redundant when students asked questions about material that may not have been quite so confusing to other students. However, on the whole, I thought this was useful (especially being able to talk about covid!)",
                "I thought everything was good!",

                "The biggest blunder was structuring the synchronous sessions, which took place during normal class hours twice a week, as general question and answer sessions. This morphed into office hours for 10 people, while forcing the other 100 people in the class to listen. I understand the logic behind structuring the class this way, but in hindsight this was a mistake, especially when the asynchronous lectures were already pretty rushed and thin with information. It was clear that many people did not pay attention during the synchronous sessions, both because they appeared to be tangentially relevant and also because the material was not directly tested. Instead, a more traditional powerpoint presentation or lecture review during the synchronous sessions would have been greatly appreciated.",
                "Strengths- Recorded lectures work so much better than in person lecturing. Quizzes on lectures were a good way to grade assignments in the course. Overall I would say this class is one of the best classes I had in terms of pandemic learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses Again, the 1h15m classes were very long and drawn out at times. Should be shortened.",

                "The flipped classroom model didn't work very well. The classes should have been more structured, either as lectures or directed discussions about the prerecorded lectures. The class was still very good and worthwhile though.",

                "I liked the recorded lectures, I think the Q&A sessions got to be a bit repetitive and talked about concepts a bit outside the scope of a student like me, an economics student with no healthcare background.",

                "Honestly, the randomized break out rooms were a great idea. I know people started logging out before them after a while (I did too once), but it's a great way to meet other classmates since we don't have those incidental interactions in person.",

                "The mandatory live sessions made virtual engagement accessible, as students were able to type their questions in the Zoom chat box and Professor Forman would answer immediately. However, there was minimal virtual engagement among students. Sometimes, the TFs would put us in breakout rooms, but no one really wanted to have meaningful discussions so we all ended up leaving the breakout rooms within the first two minutes. Other than the occasional in-class groupwork assignments, the in-class debates also allowed for some virtual engagement.",
                "I think the flipped classroom worked well given the constraints of this semester, but the required live sessions were a waste of time. Maybe instead of two a week, just one could be used? I found myself having to sit in class for hours, hearing about things I'd already learned from the recorded lectures. The sessions essentially functioned as office hours, and as such should have been optional.",
                "I liked that there were pre-recorded lectures because it helped me isolate which topic areas to focus on",
                "The videos were a helpful resource, but the class felt too dependent on the pre-recorded videos. Likewise, the synchronous sessions felt too focused on question and answer.

If the synchronous parts were more interactive\/shorter, or the recorded lectures were shorter, it would be better and easier to be engaged.",
                "I don't think the course should have been arranged as recorded lectures + live Q&A. The live Q&A part made it quite difficult to stay engaged, and I would've preferred if Professor Forman just lectured during the live sessions. That said, I understand this was a challenging time, and I really applaud the teaching staff for doing all that they could.",

                "The combination of recorded lectures and live virtual Q&A's worked well to give students flexibility in learning the fact-heavy content while preserving the interaction with Prof. Forman that is essential to this course. The Q&A's even felt more like direct interaction with the professor than would be possible in an in-person 100+ student lecture. The open-note exams were a great way to emphasize conceptual understanding over memorization and reduce the risk of cheating."

There is a lot of details in the class and you kind of have to put it together yourself\/take initiative to get a lot out of this class, but it is super well structured and there is an amazing teaching team including Howie to help. I loved the guest lecturers because they brought some non-academic perspectives that felt more real-world than just taking Yale classes. We listened to a conservative policy maker, one of the heads of the VA, and the founder of a healthcare startup, and these speakers really brought the material to life and provided interesting perspectives!",

You learn so much about the healthcare system and healthcare financing -- it's a more focused, but interdisciplinary economics course, so if you are interested in that, you should definitely take this class! Although the live lectures did get a bit messy at times, you learn so much and the teaching team is great. Professor Forman definitely tries to get TFs from different disciplines, so it enriches the learning experience.",

                "I decided to take this course because I read many raving reviews and decided it would be a perfect fifth class. After having taken it, however, I really can't see what they're on about. The best thing about this class is the subject, by far, which is interesting (especially once everything starts to come together as you study for the exam), important, and poorly understood. However, the class was not structured in a way to convey the material thoroughly or efficiently. The asynchronous lectures felt particularly rushed and informationally thin. The synchronous ones (which operated exclusively as question and answer sessions) were dry and, frankly, pretty useless. I'm assuming most students didn't care about this since the information was widely available online and could be easily taught to oneself anyways. However, I took this class precisely because I wanted to attend lectures that were edifying, and, unfortunately, that was not the case here. I suspect the reason for the raving reviews in the past can be explained by one's point of reference. This is complete conjecture, but I wonder whether most econ majors who have taken this class are comparing it to other econ courses, which I hear are boring and math-heavy and therefore would make this course, in comparison, pretty awesome (and if you're an econ major and this counts for the major by all means take it). But for the non-econ majors out there, be wary, because if you have a different point of reference, you will not be impressed by this course and you will come away, at the end of the semester, disappointed, as I did.",
                "Yes. Good class if you want to learn a lot about healthcare. Did not have the emphasis on economics that I would've liked (is really more of a policy class than an economics class)",
                "No not at all",
                "Yes you learn a lot.",
                "Yes, definitely.",
                "Yes! Great way to learn about the US health system. It is excellent knowledge for anyone going to be employed because it will help you learn to navigate the health system.",
                "Yes! Everyone should know how the US healthcare system works, and Howie always keeps the course interesting. The midterm is tough but the rest of the course is very fair.",
                "Yes, if you want a good overview of health economics in the US. However, you have to be very comfortable with the format and the fact that the material may often appear confusing and lacking structure. The professor is amazing, but the course might not suit some learning styles.",
                "I would tentatively recommend this class! It's great, especially if you're premed. However, as a non-econ major with little knowledge of the healthcare system, I felt that the lectures assumed that I already had some foundational knowledge which I did not -- so be aware of that.",
                "Not if it is given during COVID. Only take if lecture material is not prerecorded.",
                "Yes, it is an interesting class and a topic worth learning about.",
                "I would recommend to premeds who have SOME experience with economics. I found it much more difficult as my first and only Econ course at yale",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The workload is a lot lighter than other courses at Yale, yet the course material is something I believe everyone should have some knowledge on.",
                "low work econ class but a lot of memorization. if you're at all interested about the intersection between econ and HC or want to learn more about HC and its pros and cons, wouldn't be a bad class to take.",
                "Yes! Very interesting course and different to all the others in the economics major",
                "Yes, very applicable and information that every person would benefit greatly from knowing as they enter adulthood.",
                "It depends. I think an in person version of this class would be better than the way it was formatted.",
                "Absolutely! Im a senior econ major and this is the best econ course Ive taken hands down. If youre remotely interested in this material, give it a go. Howie Forman is very engaging and knowledgable. Guest speakers are phenomenal.",
                "do not take this course over zoom, I hated it. I've seen good reviews from the in-person semesters, though.",
                "Yes I would, it's good to actually understand how and why health insurance works the way it does.",
                "Take it if you're an Econ major-- it's not a bad elective. Don't take if you're not an Econ major-- there are definitely more interesting and engaging courses.",
                "Perhaps; if you want basic overview of relevant information",
                "Yes! It's a great class if you want to learn more about the healthcare system in the US and Professor Forman is really charming.",
                "Sure, I would recommend this course. It's very much an overview class (it does not give lots of specific details on the health care system), but it provides a lot of important foundational knowledge relevant for most anyone.",
                "Absolutely. The intersection of healthcare and economics is critical and Dr. Forman is a great teacher.",
                "Yes, a good survey HC course with some basic economic principles",
                "I highly recommend this course to any pre-medical students who are curious about the intersection of healthcare and economic policy.",
                "Yes, healthcare is an important thing to understand for anyone.",
                "This class is good for getting a better understanding of healthcare in the U.S.. The class does not answer all pressing questions nor provide solutions to healthcare issues, but it certainly informs students about the status quo and the correct questions to be asking.",
                "Yes. Healthcare is something that impacts us all and having a solid understanding of it goes a long way.",
                "Absolutely. If you're interested in learning more about the health system in general, this is the best class you could take. I'd say take this course if you are even a little bit confused about how your insurance works, because you will come of this class knowing more than most of the population.",
                "Yeah I guess, it's mildly interesting and pretty easy.",
                "Yes if you want a relatively easy econ elective, but at the same time, this is not be super interesting",
                "I credit\/D'd this course and i am happy I did. I would recommend it if you are iterested in the subject matter, it is a very well-rounded and thorough look into healthcare.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it offers a thorough overview of the U.S. healthcare system. In addition, it demonstrates how economics can be applied to analyze real systems in our society.",
                "Yes, this information is super important for anyone who wants a basic understanding of how the healthcare system works. If you're pre-med \/ econ major \/ anyone interested in working in healthcare someday, I think this course gives a really excellent overview of the system you're walking into. A lot of people leave college going into medicine with no idea of the intricacies and incentives of the healthcare system (which often explain a lot of what we see in the field today).",
                "Definitely! A super interesting course and very applicable right now. Workload is very manageable.",
                "Yes if you want a better understanding of the healthcare system in the US and the economic forces behind the various components; probably less relevant for international students.",
                "Yes, this course provided an informative view of a part of the economy for which so much public discussion is uninformed. I took this course out of interest in the subject matter, and came away with many of my curiosities satisified, though the course doesn't provide any magic-bullet solutions to the problems in American healthcare. Prof. Forman's perspective on the health system as a whole is invaluable, and Q&A sessions often went beyond the course material into the current state of healthcare. The workload is moderate and seems well-designed to reinforce understanding of what really matters."
