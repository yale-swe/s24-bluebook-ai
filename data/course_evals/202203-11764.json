                "Great course",
                "Only strengths: Very logical structure, easy to understand lectures, great TFs and professor",
                "The content is interesting and applicable to the real world. The workload was also very manageable.",
                "I think game theory as a whole can have some pretty complex notation, but thats just a function of the field itself. I think the class did a good job for the most part of relaying information in lecture that we could then put into practice on the psets to work through the games ourselves. I think that structure is probably the best way of learning something like this. I also think Prof Turners a strength, as hes a really chill, friendly professor who is clearly very interested in what hes teaching and also appears to genuinely care about the students.",
                "I thought that this course was very enjoyable overall! The class did a good job of teaching the basics of Game Theory in a way that was accessible for non-social science majors and those who had not taken college-level math. The class also had a manageable workload. The one weakness I found in the course was that there were not very many opportunities to practice some of the more conceptual problems (similar to the market for lemons example in class or backwards induction in unit 2) on the psets before the test.",
                "Strengths: Professor Weaknesses: n/a",
                "Strengths: fun, easy course that gets you excited about game theory. No exam, only 3 tests and PSets.\r\n\r\nWeakness: not as in-depth as other game theory courses (like the economists one)",
                "I think the class sometimes struggles with connecting the skills we are learning to the real world applications. There are classes about application in the real world but they are extremely complicated and hard to understand. I think a strength is that the TF's are really great and helpful, that is definitely the reason I passed.",
                "The sections sometimes are hard to follow. Lectures are also, at least for me, hard to clearly follow the math, but going over it is actually fun and interesting to learn. Pset groups are good if you find people, grading isn't too strict. Tests are a little rushed because its only 50 minute class time, but just prepare well and the class will go well. And you won't (hopefully) get bored so you want to prepare well.",
                "Strengths: accessibility to recordings, slides, and the full semester breakdown. The TF named Jen was amazing. If you can, get in her section. Non-cumulative 3 exams with no final. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes went too fast. But if you go to Jen's section, she clears up things nicely so you know what exactly will be tested.",
                "Can't really think of any points of improvement. Taught well, learned a lot! It could be easy to fall behind on the work, but that's a fault of the students, not the course.",
                "The teaching style and structure of grading/assignments was well-organized and well-structured.",
                "Maybe sections could be more intentional, it often felt like TFs didnt have a plan. Also, I feel like we could have used more practice problems.",
                "I would have liked more real world examples",
                "Strengths: Amazing TFs, the course was well-paced, exams and psets were very fair. \r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were sometimes very rushed. I think an easy fix would be to spend less time on the formal definitions of game theory topics, and focus the lectures on going through examples.",
                "Strengths: very straightforward, tests matched psets and in-class material very well",
                "The TFs were not often helpful  so there was a lot of self-learning and YouTube watching that took place.",
                "i really liked this course. i liked that classes were recorded so i did not have to worry when i was sick. i wish there was more connections to present day political issues.",
                "Prof. Turner is a very engaging lecturer, and the slides are also very clear. I also appreciated that the problem sets were straightforward and we were always taught the concepts we needed to know to complete them in class. Overall, I enjoyed lecture a lot and the class workload was very reasonable. Having a few more practice problems available might have been nice, since there wasnt too much beyond what we did for section.",
                "This course is taught incredibly well - Prof Turner is very clear and the slides are very informative, which is great for exam prep. The problem sets were straightforward, but sections were still useful and the TAs were always helpful and frequently available. Genuinely interesting content also helps.",
                "Like many introductory level economics classes, it followed an effective structure of problem sets to support learning in lecture over the course of the semester with greater learning benchmarks throughout the class. I appreciated the three smaller unit exams as opposed to, say, one midterm and one comprehensive final. In that way, I thought this class was more conducive to learning and retention than some other classes I've taken that follow a similar structure. As Professor Turner noted, what we learn at the any point in the class includes all or most of what we learned previous to it, so even if certain earlier subjects aren't explicitly tested, expertise in them is demonstrated by practicing those later subjects alone. In terms of improvement, there's nothing which sticks out to me as being in glaring need of revision. The only small critique I have is that, when it comes to studying for exams, it would be helpful to have practice problem sets, former exams, or just lists of questions as study aides. This was done at some points but not at others, and I think future students would benefit from it being a constant fixture in the course. If not only for practice, they would also help to give students a sense of what more abstract questions might look like to help reduce barriers to testing in general and, more specifically, the ability of people to demonstrate their knowledge.",
                "It wasnt always the best organized. Pset problems disappeared after you submitted them which made it difficult to study for tests. And the answers for some psets werent always posted to help study for tests. The material in the lectures didnt seem to focus on what was in the psets. Many pset problems could only really be answered by those who went to office hours since the slides did not teach us how to answer the problems. There also wasnt much engagement with the political science portion of the class. Scenarios were talked about in lecture, but they rarely ever showed up on psets or exams.",
                "professor was awesome. TAs answered all questions.",
                "Strengths: the content itself is very interesting, specifically if you have never learned about game theory before. plenty of real world applications, including in day to day life you will start to notice the game theory at play\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Turner often overcomplicates the material by delving too deeply into the math of certain examples without first explaining the big picture.",
                "It's an easy class, and the Professor's slides are really clear about the material. Unfortunately, this means you don't have to attend class to do well (I didn't go after the first midterm.) There is no final, and the three midterms are easy to do well on. Take this class for a more chill introduction to Game Theory!",
                "Strengths: Jen the TF/office hours! The timeline of the class was well spread out, made it very easy to follow, the lectures are pretty solid and digestible for the most part if you do the readings, prof is cool and chill\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the lecture does get a little too tricky to understand at times when it gets to the more complex and sometimes there isn't a similar problem from lecture that's on the psets, also there is not a lot of material to use to study for exams so it feels a bit like you're in the dark until you've gotten through an exam or two which makes them a bit more stressful than they need to be",
                "The course is very well-structured. Professor Turner is engaging and thorough. The only improvement I might suggest would be resources for further practice problems outside those in the recommended textbook; they're easy to find online, so it's not a huge setback at all.",
                "Office hours with TFs were at super inconvenient times when a lot of students had classes. I wish we had been given more access to practice problems and guidance as to what exactly in the textbook to read. A lot of the chapters we read had stuff in it that when I asked the TFs, they would say we didnt actually need to know that, but it was in the syllabus.",
                "The PSETs and sections were really beneficial for learning. Lectures could be improved by slowing their pace down a little. It might be better to cover fewer examples and just take it slower. This didn't end up being too much of a problem because of sections though.",
                "Strengths: Course is organized. TAs are great. I liked how the course was broken up into units.\r\nWeaknesses: political science concepts seemed disjointed from the game theory concepts we were learning. I think a final project, where we apply the concepts we learned to the real world, would have been more engaging and fulfilling than a third exam.",
                "The discussion section associated with the lecture was very helpful in grounding an understanding in topics.",
                "Strengths: Amazing TFs (shout out to Jen)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think lectures could go more systematically through how to solve games (thinking like white boards, talking it through) because easier to see like a professor solve a game to understand how to do it",
                "Strengths: timed very well, each game was thoroughly explained and detailed\r\nWeakness: the connection to political science aspects were extremely abstract and different to understand",
                "Strengths: Solving problems was integrated into the lectures so we would learn topics conceptually then immediately apply them. Professor Turner was super enthusiastic which made for a very engaging lecture. Problem sets were the right amount of challenge  they didnt feel impossible but required critical thinking and application beyond super simply problems. \r\nWeaknesses: It was unclear how much information we needed to retain from the textbook.",
                "The strengths of this course was the professor along with the structure of the course overall. The only weakness I could think of is the timing in between exams seems to be a little condensed at times and the sections were not incredibly helpful in understanding content.",
                "no, the course is brilliant",
                "One of the strengths of this course is its organization. Professor Turner and the teaching team are very organized and make it very easy for students to stay on track throughout the course. The pace of the class is also very digestible and easy to follow. I also preferred the format of the class being split up into thirds, with three exams testing our knowledge after each unit.",
                "Turner is an amazing lecturer and has clear, well organized slides. The psets and exams are very fair and not trying to trick you. The only weakness is that there are not many practice questions for the tests (the only practice question material is from the psets)",
                "Strengths included the approachability of both the teaching assistants and the professor. Weaknesses include the inability to engage in in-class lectures",
                "The professor is very engaging and great at explaining complicated topics in a way that is easy for everyone to understand. However, the course description says there is no math beyond algebra needed and although that is mostly true, it does help to have some knowledge of calculus. The TFs are not very helpful.",
                "Strengths - Professor Turner is a very engaging lecturer and the content was pretty interesting \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Both TFs were not very good at explaining things during section or office hours",
                "The curriculum was very well structured, increasing in complexity and rigor and building on knowledge from the beginning of the class. An improvement should be to increase the practice material we have before the exams. It would be extremely beneficial to have practice exams before the exam instead of merely redoing psets."

I think the course provides you with a useful and interesting theoretical toolkit for evaluating games, and the policy applications we talk about in class add depth and utility to what you learn. If you get really frustrated by really involved notation, its possible youll get frustrated around the middle of the semester, and you should be aware that everything in the course really does build upon itself and compound in difficulty as you go along, so make sure you understand each concept before you move past it, but otherwise its a really chill class with a nice professor, easy grading, and interesting/useful material.",

It takes time to learn but once you get the hang of it you'll be fine. I did enjoy the class once I got over the initial learning curve.",

I suggest making a study group for checking the PSETs and just make sure to study well for the 3 exams. A tip would be to take notes on an iPad or device so you can just download the slides and write notes on the slides (sometimes the slides are filled with a lot of info and NOT enough time to copy everything down).",

                "Yes, due to the great teaching and the great structure of the course.",
                "I learned a lot about the principles of game theory and how to apply them to political situations. I enjoyed doing the problems and solving for equilibria. I also liked thinking through applications of the principles to political science situations. I have a thorough understanding of game theory.",
                "Yes! This course is a great way to get an introduction to game theory",
                "Yes! If you like political science topics like median voter theory and want to understand how to apply economics topics to the real world - I would definitely recommend this course.",
                "yes i would i learned a lot.",
                "Yes! This is an engaging introduction to game theory that focuses a lot on political applications of the theory and has a very reasonable workload. If you really enjoy the nuances of game theory or want to play games in class, you might prefer Econ 159, but this is a great class.",
                "Yes! Very well organized and clearly taught, interesting content and applications, great professor and straightforward problem sets. I previously dropped 159 because I would have to spend hours in office hours, and this course was significantly more accessible and fun.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students and frankly already have. I think that, above all, EP&E 295 is one of the few classes which I've taken at Yale that explicitly emphasizes and puts a premium on the actual learning of the material rather than mere test preparation. Between that and what I've already mentioned, this class merits a look by anyone.",
                "It is a less intense way of learning game theory than the main game theory course. So I would recommend it for students looking for that.",
                "yeah, good intro course to game theory",
                "I would not recommend this course -- if you have to take game theory, or if you want to, take ECON 159. Even if it's slightly harder, it will teach you the material much more effectively. For this class you essentially have to learn the material yourself.",
                "Take this as a breadth requirement for the cognitive science major for a chill semester and a pretty good introduction to Game Theory if you don't feel like going too far into the nitty gritties of the subject.",
                "Yes, definitely a great option for your game theory requirements or voluntary interest, lectures are only 50 min (more digestible) and the 3 exam and no final system is epic. The psets are solidly reasonable and the media library of lectures is clutch for confusing topics. This was a very accessible class and made life straightforward compared to most yale courses which was appreciated. Small lecture in the afternoon is also nice",
                "Yes, this is a fantastic class to take in order to get a good introduction of Game Theory as a discipline",
                "Yes. It's a great course for students that aren't seeking a math-heavy semester to fulfill a QR requirement and develop logical reasoning in a powerful way.",
                "Yes, but I wouldnt say its a super easy course.",
                "Yes, it really helps you understand game theory when it comes up in other aspects of political science.",
                "Only if you have to take it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. While at first the course can come across as challenging, after more time engaging with the topics, it becomes easier to follow.",
                "Yes, it was a great introduction to game theory and the professor was great at teaching it",
                "Yes! Im not an EP&E major but I still really enjoyed this course and feel like Im walking away with a useful skillset. The course never felt completely impossible but I consistently felt the right amount of challenge.",
                "Yes. Interesting, well taught, reasonable workload.",
                "Yes I would, because I think it offers valuable insights into the minds of people and how game theory plays out in real-life situations.",
                "yes, because it is a nice and moderately difficult course that rewards those who treat it seriously.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to other students, especially those looking to fill their EPE prereq. It is a well taught class on an interesting topic with a fairly light workload. the three exams are fair, if you put in some studying.",
                "YES! Turner explains the material incredibly clearly and the exams and psets are very fair.",
                "Yes, it is such a good gut and just based on psets and three exams that were easy to study for and not cumulative.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning the basics of game theory and how it can be applied to political situations. If you are just looking for an easy QR, I wouldn't say this is the course for you. However, it is very interesting and engaging.",
                "If the student needs this course as a prereq then sure. If this student wants to take a course on game theory, I recommend a different game theory course. If the student needs a QR and doesn't know much about game theory, I recommend a different course.",
                "I would recommend this course, as it is an intellectually simulating way to gain one's QR credit while being exposed to different applications of math.",
                "Yes--if you are taking it as a QR credit like me, it is pretty interesting and not too math-heavy.",
                "I would recommend this course as it is a good introduction to game theory as well as it provides insight on how game theory could be applied in real life politics. The professor is very enthusiastic to help and answer questions and lectures are recorded so you can re-watch in case you don't understand something in class."
