                "Professor was great and very engaging which made the course great all around",
                "Strengths: If you want to fully work in China in the future, it's likely this course will be a necessary base to actually be able to communicateit provides cultural background and vocabulary.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There's so much content covered in such a short time that oftentimes things are lost. Also, learning traditional characters for some of these complex vocab words seems a little worthless."
