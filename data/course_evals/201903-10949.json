   "comments": [
    "This course made me more aware of the connections between 18th and 21st century novels. I not only gained an increased vocabulary with with to describe the formal features of these novels, but also learned how to compare their often similar thematic focuses.",
    "Critical reading and writing skills",
    "Working through our first class's establishing question of \"What is a novel?\" I learned about the history of the novel form by reading and discussing 18th century and 21st century texts, and seeing where the structural and thematic overlaps were in conversation with one another. Thanks to the diverse subject matters of our books and the miniature presentations that each student signed up for, I learned about a wide range of topics beyond just writing itself, from 18th century science to Kantian philosophy to the history of punk rock.",
    "Looking at 18th century novels alongside contemporary texts was fascinating! This course pushes you to look at the novel in its experimental form, questioning what makes up a novel, and how is that different in the 21st century than the 18th century. Every week discussions went beyond the books we were reading to talk about printing, the rise of publication, and the weekly accompanying reports helped us engage with interesting topics that made us think differently about the literature.",
    "I definitely gained a lot of knowledge about 18th century literature and its interesting aspects. I also learned about what \"experimental\" really means and what the different definitions of a novel are as well. I also learned how to compare and contrast new novels that are related to the 18th century with actual 18th century novels. It was very interesting to think about this relationship and all of the incredible techniques the different novelists used in their work.",
    "My ability to read texts in the context of a tradition definitely improved. In a class focused on what makes the novel so, form is important, and class discussion and the texts selected pointed out specific novelistic experiments that enabled critical investigation of the purposes, validity, and capabilities of the novel form.",
    "Comparing 18th century and modern literature, especially of the experimental sort",
    "Prof Campbell identified weak spots in my writing and I worked to improve them in her class. I learned tons about the novel form.",
    "I learned more about novels in the eighteenth century, especially the kinds of people writing the novels and reading them. I dove deeper into the popularity of novels, which re solidified my understanding of the power of novels. I also learned the skills of taking my close reading and applying it on a larger scale."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I appreciated how the course bounced between 18th and 21st century novels. By pairing Oroonoko with Homegoing or Tristram Shandy with A Visit from the Goon Squad, the syllabus helped me understand the connection between 18th and 21st century novels as well as prevented the course from feeling repetitive.",
    "Great texts, relatively high but doable reading load.",
    "I loved how varied this class was, both in its reading and subject matters, as each class was engaging and insightful. We read many books, both 18th century and contemporary, that I hadn't encountered before, and they were all enjoyable. Our frequent trips to the Beinecke to engage with a variety of printed media related to the texts we were reading enhanced our discussion of the novel form and why we continue to read and write novels. I also enjoyed the ample amount of time we were given to write our papers, as well as the option for creative writing additions to our papers, which allowed for experimentation along with plenty of time to meet with Professor Campbell and receive feedback on our writing. If I could add anything to the course, it would be doing readings of 18th century critical responses to the texts we read from that time period, as we definitely engaged with critical writing as related to the more contemporary novels, and I would have been interested in knowing what critics thought of the older novels at the time of their initial publication.",
    "I liked the compilation of texts and thought the older and newer texts worked very well together. I think that the reports were useful to have but having two reports in one class was sometimes a lot, especially because I think sometimes conversations about the novels could have been more connected to the reports. It would have been interesting to have the student who wrote the report for the day facilitate 20 mins of our discussion time.",
    "The biggest strength is that Professor Campbell is an excellent discussion leader and one of the most thoughtful professors I've had! The syllabus is fantastic, and I really liked getting to choose a book to read in small groups at the end of the semester. No real weaknesses to speak of.",
    "I think the main strength of this course was the incredible syllabus. The mixture of old and new, the themes present in all of the works, and just how enjoyable they all were was absolutely awesome. I also really liked that the assignments offered options for creative projects. This really allowed me to interact with the works we read in a very different and fulfilling way.",
    "Sometimes, I felt like class discussion could have been improved, like there were points, suggestions, or claims that were made that would have been generative (if uncomfortable) to argue and that could have strengthened all our understandings of the topics, but weren't dealt with.",
    "Very enjoyable discussions and thought provoking discussion",
    "Dynamic and exciting syllabus and flexible essay prompts made this class very exciting to be a part of. I found myself able to explore threads I was interested in. Throughout the term, I felt very supported by Prof Campbell.",
    "Strength is the conversations and richness of conversation. I also appreciated the time range of the texts, that made the class more interesting. Definitely made fulfilling the 18th\/19th century requirement an enjoyable one. Weakness of the course is perhaps that more time was spent on less interesting books. Also the small group discussions were an excellent addition to the class."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I found the comparisons between 18th and 21st century novels illuminating, and I appreciated that Professor Campbell was willing to discuss both types of novels on the same footing. Although I did not take the class for 18\/19th century credit, I would definitely recommend the course for an English major who needs to fulfill the requirement, but is not (or thinks she is not) a fan of 18\/19th century literature.",
    "The class is great, really interesting texts and it's really interesting to discuss the relationships between the texts. Prof Campbell is wonderful",
    "Yes, this course is a great way to engage with 18th century texts and enhance your understanding of novel writing, especially when accompanied by contemporary novels. Professor Campbell did an excellent job at facilitating the class discussion, and students were excited to talk about the works we were reading, so there was never a lull in our discussions.",
    "would recommend, especially if you need to satisfy the 18th\/19th century literature requirement for the English major. good books. really expanded my understanding of the genre of the novel.",
    "YES! This course's reading material will not disappoint and Prof. Campbell is great! Also there are creative\/fiction writing options as alternative to paper assignments which are really fun and allow you to try something new.",
    "Yes! Though it takes awhile to get used to the course format, which is not chronological and veers from 18th to 21st century works often. I'm not sure everything tied together neatly in the end, but Professor Campbell is such an engaging instructor and did take pains to help us make connections between the things we were reading. If you need a pretty painless 18th\/19th century credit, this is the class for you, since a good chunk of our reading was contemporary novels (all of which were great). And Professor Campbell truly cares about her students, which is always awesome to see.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The syllabus is great, the conversations are incredibly interesting, and Professor Campbell is amazing.",
    "Yes! I think there are some things that need a bit of tweaking (like doing more presentations those formal novelistic experiments instead of just on content while also adding some more contemporary critical theory), but overall this class has a great syllabus (truly a masterwork) and a great, caring and passionate professor, and explores lots of interesting things about the works that we read and our position in language, and a manageable workload that prioritizes the things that produce learning. I looked forward to seminar every time, and always left with interesting questions and thoughts. I also loved how the relatively open assignments enabled some of those experiments we discussed and demanded that we question literature ourselves.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course!! Its probably the best English course Ive taken. The courses structure, which alternates between novels from the eighteenth and twenty-first centuries, led us to really interesting discussions. And it gives you the chance to discuss really contemporary work in an academic setting. Some of the novels we read came out in just the past few years. Even more than the wonderful syllabus, Professor Campbell is everything you would want in a professor. Shes incredibly perceptive and dedicated. Shes always extremely organized and offers very detailed comments on our papers.",
    "Certainly! It's a great chance to compare and contrast wildly different books, and Professor Campbell is fantastic.",
    "Prof Campbell is excellent--supportive, knowledgeable, kind. I learned so much from her course.",
    "Yes! Professor Campbell is a wonderful professor and she made this course enjoyable. The range of classes also helped with the course as well."
