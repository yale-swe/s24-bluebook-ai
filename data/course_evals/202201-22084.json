                "Strengths: the papers were great and the discussion, when allowed to flow freely, was really fruitful. \r\nWeakness: sometimes the discussion was too centered around the figures or methods. We should have taken more time to discuss the overall social implications of the papers.",
                "strengths:\r\ngreat informative papers, engaged class, lots of opportunities to engage with professors/teaching staff\r\nprofessors are excited about the material and love to talk about it\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\nsome of the statistical methods employed in the papers are obtuse and hard to understand even with a stats background\r\nwide range of difficulty in the papers and there is not a lot of time for the student presentations so although you learn how to be concise, i wish there was more time for us to unpack the papers in our presentation",
                "The class was taught in a manner which focused entirely on student discussion, making it feel very organic and peer-led. At the same time, this semester it was taught by three instructors who were all very friendly and open to questions. They helped ensure the discussions stayed relevant and cleared any confusions.",
                "Lack of clarity about how students would be evaluated in the course. This became stressful at the end of the class. \r\n\r\nAlso, more time spent at the beginning of the course reviewing how to interpret genetics data (particularly sequence maps) and common statistical techniques would have facilitated greater student comprehension of papers reviewed throughout the course.",
                "I thought the biggest strengths were the how up-to-date the papers were and the structure provided for discussions until everyone felt comfortable engaging in more open discussions. I can't think of any major weaknesses.",
                "I think that spending more time discussing the statistics and how to interpret certain types of graphs would be helpful in gaining a better understanding of figures in the papers.",
                "I liked the discussion structure and appreciated how both peers and professors were allowed to speak up.",
                "The course was very well-organized. It explored various scientific topics that were very intriguing.",
                "This course is phenomenal and I would recommend it to anyone majoring in MCDB. It has been one of my favorite classes at Yale and I truly have few suggestions on how the course would be improved because it was such a blast to participate in the class. The only thing that might improve the course is a short blurb from the instructor about mid-way through the semester on how individual students are doing or some sort of evaluation since there is no formal assessments to help us gauge our performance (and course correct if necessary) apart from class discussions.",
                "I loved the chill environment  I feel like being less stressed about assignments helped everyone actually learn from the papers. I do wish though that we had like one intro class where we reviewed some of the concepts we discussed outside of the papers. There were a few things that kept coming up (ex. eQTLs) in our papers, but I was never really sure what they were and I felt embarrassed to ask."

                "yes! no busywork, you just get to read and talk about cool papers with a very intelligent and accomplished teaching staff who are at the forefront of this field. highly recommend as an upper level MCDB elective that you will learn a lot from, without feeling overwhelmed or scared by workload/harsh grading that seems to be the MO in this department",

I was intellectually challenged, felt freedom to explore topics I was genuinely intrigued by during the student papers selection week, and always felt supported by my peers and instructors when discussing the reading for the week.",
