It's always really nice to do some reading and I found that I genuinely enjoyed the books and got invested in the characters. I've also never studied films formally, and really enjoyed doing so in this course. This course encourages and teaches close reading and textual interpretation. I learned about the history and unique struggles of Italians and Italian-Americans (from the perspective of peasants, the mafia, working class New Yorkers, etc.) and felt as though I connected with the culture through this course.."

                "Strengths: interesting discussions, fascinating texts (mostly novels), strong class community, understanding teachers, straightforward\/manageable assignment\r\n\r\nI don't think there were any weaknesses, but the class focuses on literature more than history.,and professor Mazzotta came to fewer than half the classes. Megan, the TF, taught most of the course and she is wonderful.",
                "This course provides a perfect blend of discussion and lecture, in a relationship I would estimate to be 85\/15. Most of the time the class is asked questions to delve into collectively, but supplemental materials like short clips or history powerpoints along with the alum. fellow and prof's own thoughts are valuable contributions that enhance the learning environment further. The only weakness I could identify is the pace of the readings, which was balanced perfectly most of the time, but there were a few weeks where I felt rushed. It's hard to fit discussions on such dense books over such a comparatively short period, so all things considering this is a very minor critique. Overall, this is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
                "THIS WAS MY FAVORITE CLASS THIS SEMESTER! Strengths: Megan is a brilliant, compassionate, kind professor and a naturally gifted teacher. The small class size meant we all got very close, and I was genuinely sad to be done with the class at the end of the semester. Megan picked an unbeatable reading list. The assignment prompts were excellent, especially the creative ones, and I felt I had the tools to succeed in this class. Discussion was never boring and I felt that everyone contributed generously. I liked the student presentations as well because I got to know my fellow students. Megan worked to integrate us into the Italian department, inviting us to present our work from her class at the Italian Studies Undergraduate Research Conference, which was a ton of fun (and good for our resumes!). Weaknesses: Professor Mazzotta never mastered Zoom and only came to class once in a while, and when he did, he couldn't keep track of what we had\/hadn't read yet. I want to emphasize that Megan, rather than Professor Mazzotta, was the one who made this course so excellent. Take this course with Megan if it's offered again!."

The small class size provided the space for everyone to contribute, establishing an engaging environment even through a virtual space.

                "If you're in any way fascinated by hyphenated identities in the US,  Italy, or even mafia stories, take this course. The teaching staff is excellent and clearly care so much about the subject and the students. The workload is manageable (three essays, one of which is more creative), and the readings (and films) feel like a nice reprieve from the more typically-academic texts I dealt with in other classes",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The content was incredibly interesting, assignments were compelling, and every discussion was an interactive experience.",
                "Absolutely. The learning environment is one of the best I have been a part of at Yale. I do not particularly enjoy literature classes, but this one is fantastically run and features an incredible lineup of works. The discussions are collaborative and fruitful, and the essay writing process is the most productive and supportive I've seen in a class so far. You would be remiss to not take this class during your time at Yale. It is the finest quality of hidden gem and one I am so grateful to have stumbled upon.",
                "I would give this course a 10\/10 and would absolutely recommend it to other students. It was my favorite course of the semester: amazing books, great class dynamic, creative assignments. I learned so much about Italian culture and I felt encouraged to explore my own relationship with my Italian heritage. I had a lot of fun and am very sad to be done with this course! I want to be clear that I would recommend this course if it is taught by Megan, not Professor Mazzotta. Whereas Prof. Mazzotta never mastered Zoom and was more confusing than helpful, Megan is a naturally talented teacher and really shone in this class. She asked the most interesting discussion questions, picked wonderful readings, and gave very useful feedback. I am so glad I decided to take this class because it was just a wonderful experience that I will cherish when I look back on my time at Yale.."
