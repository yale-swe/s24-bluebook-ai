                "The strength of this course is its seriousness. The topics are all relevant to current events, and Shelly genuinely cares about what each student has to say. His feedback on papers is exceptional - he writes 5 pages of single-space feedback for a 5 page paper. He is also open for office hours whenever works best for students, and will spend time working with each individual to strengthen their ideas. \r\nA weakness of this course is its engagement with the secondary readings. Since the conversations are mostly student-driven, we wound up mostly discussing the textbook, and skimming over the secondary readings, because most people did not compete those readings. As the course was currently structured, the secondary readings began to feel \"extra\" by about mid-way through the semester. The course would be significantly improved if Shelly would guide the conversation towards the secondary readings at the beginning of the semester, thus incentivizing people to continue to do those readings attentively. This would also deepen the quality of the class conversations, because it would ensure that people had deeply considered alternate viewpoints the material that we were discussing that day.",
                "Excellent class overall. Paper support and feedback was clear and thorough; I think I really improved my philosophical writing. Class discussion was super energetic and I looked forward to it every week. To my many friends who have not taken the class but are wary of the grading: Yes, it's harsher than average, but I found it refreshingly honest, and it's definitely possible to score well without being a philosophy braniac (especially once you get the hang of it).\r\n\r\nOffice hours squarely conflicted with Thursday afternoon seminars. Offsetting them by one hour (in either direction) would solve that problem."

                "You might get out of this class thoroughly discouraged to do moral philosophy, but if you already decided to do moral philosophy, this might be your cup of tea. Note that normative ethics is at the base level and can feel divorced from real life at times. While other class might also help you do this, you will probably emerge a better communicator.",
                "Yes absolutely! Shelly is a great instructor and I learned a lot from him.",
                "Yes! This course was a highlight of my time at Yale. I looked forward to class every week, and I especially looked forward to being challenged by Shelly and by my peers. It was exciting to learn how to defend my points, and learn how to productively argue against the ideas of others. The class can feel intimidating at first, but after the students get to know each other better, it begins to feel like a real community.",
                "Yes. Shelly keeps class discussion from getting obscure and hypertechnical (bad in one direction) or trivial (bad in the other direction). Everyone participates. It's more fun and close-knit than other classes I've taken. The readings are enough but not too much.\r\n\r\nOn papers: Shelly will point out the flaws in any argument, but always in the spirit of making it better. And he will also recognize everything you did wellit feels well earned when he does. My writing/argument improved more here than in most WR classes I've taken.",
                "It depends. I found this course rewarding and challenging, but also incredibly frustrating. It actually made me somewhat disillusioned with the field of moral philosophy. That was a worthwhile discovery for me, but others will have to judge for themselves."
