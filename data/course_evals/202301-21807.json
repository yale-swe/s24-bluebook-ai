                "ENGL 465 was my first fiction course at Yale, and the structure of the course meant I was able to assess and improve my own writing through both the lens of other student work and of published work. The course was particularly helpful, for me, in drawing the line between a short story and a burgeoning novel.",
                "I improved my fiction-writing skills and my ability to deliver (and receive) constructive feedback in a workshop setting.",
                "I feel like I learned so much from this course about the craft of fiction and different elements of how to write a successful story. I also learned how to critique others' stories, which is a skill that I have really grown to value as a result of this course!",
                "I learned so much about the craft of writing fiction and how to interact with other writers in the form of workshops and critique. One of the most valuable insights I gained was how to critically read someone elses story, rather than simply thinking about my own. I also learned a lot about myself as a writer and what inspires me and challenges me.",

                "At the end of this course, I have a much stronger writing practice, a much stronger idea of workshop, criticism, and literary theory, and 2 short stories I really like and hope to polish more and maybe publish.",
                "I honed my abilities to write a short story and learned more about the craft.",
                "Writing two short stories for this course is excellent practice. I tend to start stories and never finish them, so having a deadline to work towards was useful. Workshops are equally (or perhaps more) helpful when you're critiquing someone else's work; they'll expose you to common stumbling blocks and how to address them in your own writing."

                "No obvious weaknesses come to mind. I think the course was very well-structured, and it felt we had time to complete each week's readings (be they assigned, for workshop, or both) with the attention to detail they warranted. The class was always lively and imaginative.",
                "The course was very well organized. Having students write a one-page critique letter for each story ensured that everybody was engaged during workshop and left writers with a massive amount of feedback when the time came for revisions. The discussions were always lively, and everyone in the class developed a pretty strong rapport, which I think is attributable in large part to the way Professor Gaige ran workshop and structured the course. I only wished that we could have kept reading and presenting on other stories (i.e., those in the course pack), though I realize that would come at the expense of exercises and workshop time!",
                "I adored this class, and I think that it was an extraordinarily successful one. I thought that it was organized and facilitated well, and so I honestly can't think of any weaknesses!",
                "This was an excellently structured course!\r\n\r\nI was really amazed by the sheer amount of work that we were all able to produce. I think most of this just came from how well the workshop was structured, how much it seemed that getting workshopped was something people actively enjoyed, and the collaborative environment\/feeling that we were responsible not just to ourselves and to Prof. Gaige, but to all the students in the class.\r\n\r\nSomething I found really valuable as a writer was something we did towards the beginning of workshop, which Prof. Gaige called the \"nominal aboutness.\" Essentially, one student per story would begin by saying what they think happened in the story, nominally, and other people would chime in with any additions \/ subtractions. It's a simple exercise, but I found myself thinking about it a lot while I was writing, as a way of making sure I was drawing focus to the right things.\r\n\r\nI think if anything, the sheer volume of the work we were producing shifted the focus from to revision to drafting and building a sustainable writing practice around the initial stages - but it was doing exactly what it was supposed to, understood what it was doing, and was structured completely around it.",
                "Strengths  fantastic engagement by all the students, loved every workshop session and Professor Gaige was great at facilitating discussion. \r\nHow it could be improved - honestly wish the class met more times a week. Sometimes workshop sessions felt too short because three 20+ page stories would be discussed in one class.",
                "I loved the sheer quantity of work we produced in this course. In addition to writing (and revising) two short stories, we completed five 2-3 page exercises. These exercises were a great way to give us extra writing practice when we weren't workshopping for the week, and I loved the prompts. I also appreciated when Professor Gaige saved time for mini lectures after workshop. I almost wish this had become a weekly phenomenon; despite having taken other creative writing courses, I'd never heard of terms like content time or intradiegetic narration, so Professor Gaige's talks (and diagrams on the board) were quite helpful. I loved this course!"

It is absolutely worth it - make sure you are ready though \/ not taking too many other high workload classes!",
                "I would highly recommend, Professor Gaige has lots of experience and is so kind, and the level of writing in this class is just phenomenal.",
                "Absolutely! But only take it if you genuinely love to write fiction. You'll do quite a lot of writing (maybe 50 pages or more in total), and that can be exhausting if you don't enjoy the process. If you're willing to put in the work, however, it can be rewarding to watch your fiction improve over the course of the semester. This was one of the best courses I've taken this year!"
