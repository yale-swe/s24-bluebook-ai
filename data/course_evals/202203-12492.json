After that we got into some specific codes, namely reed Solomon, and finished up with the random weighted average algorithm.",

                "The course was not well organized and did not match what was advertised. Some of the content was interesting, but most of it was very abstract and not that useful to what the course was supposedly about. Additionally, the office hours were not very accessible as they were always early morning and usually during other classes. The course syllabus was essentially non-existent and I still don't know what the grading breakdown for the course was.",
                "I think the course was very interesting and the psets were challenging and gave us a fluid understanding of the topics. I wish the exam format had been a little bit cleared\/that we were given more resources to prepare for the exam.",
                "I think the textbook doesnt relate well to class, so if the lecture is not resonating with you and you need another way of hearing it to learn it you will probably watch a lot of YouTube. The danger in this is there are different methods or teachings that are potentially contradictory .",
                "Lectures were often a hit or miss. Sometimes they made no sense for multiple lectures in a row and other times it clicked immediately. The assignments were pretty rough, but the exams were fair.",
                "Strengths: very math-focused, almost felt like a math class. Problem sets are proof and application-based and exam questions are application based, which is really nice. It's also easy to catch up because the class is also divided into several independent topics. The notes are real-time handwritten so it's easy to follow during class.\r\nWeaknesses: it's hard to enter the course without some knowledge of probability theory, and lots of math notations as well. The notes usually don't cover a lot, so you need to pay attention to the professor and take additional notes.",
                "Very well-taught course. Appreciated the recorded lectures. Could have benefited from practice exams.",
                "Often, this course felt like it was being made up as it went along, where the TAs did not have a great understanding of the material and the problem sets arbitrarily assigned. (the TAs would literally take notes in the course with us during lecture) While the course material is interesting, it was clear that this was the first year the course material was being taught for EENG 202 as opposed to previous years. There were not weekly assignments, and it seemed like would just have assignments whenever the prof. felt like it. ALso, only some of our psets would be returned to us with comments, so I would often just get grades without feedback.",
                "Strengths: Karbasi is a good lecturer - he's consistently engaging and clearly cares about the material.\r\nWeaknesses: The class was somewhat disorganized. The professor mistimed the end of lectures and ended up changing plans for the final to compensate, PSETs were inconsistent in due date and difficulty, and the last one was never assigned. Also, there could be a little more focus on intuition over formulas, especially at the beginning, when we're talking about probability\/information and the material (e.g. Bayes' Rule) really is quite intuitive if taught the right way.\r\nI think a more solid syllabus, given out at the start of the semester, would help a lot with organization, even if the class didn't stick to it completely.",
                "I liked the instructor. The lectures had their ups and downs, some were pretty interesting and others were pretty dry, but the professor did a great job explaining the concepts. Both the midterm and the final were fair. \r\n\r\nThe only weaknesses would be the course organization. Psets were assigned and sue sporadically, sometimes due at midnight and sometimes at noon. It took over a month for our midterms to be graded. We also ended up doing 1 less pset than the syllabus said, because the professor didnt know when our last day of class was. Still enjoyed the class though.",
                "The course was very disorganized and I believe it led me to struggle a lot in the course. It forced me to have to learn a lot of things on my own without proper guidance and while I feel like I was able to do so, I had hope to receive a little more guidance and applications on the concepts I was learning.",

                "Yes, if it was a requirement or they are in STEM and intrigued",
                "Yes. The content is the most interesting stuff I have learned at Yale yet. I think anyone interested in CS should take this course to better appreciate coding and information transfer.",
                "I mean if you are an EE major it's a required course. Otherwise probably no. It's literally a math class so if you are a math enthusiast then it'd be great, otherwise don't expect any hand-on experiences on cool information theory electronic components.",
                "Yes, for electrical engineering, electrical engineering & computer science, BME, applied physics, etc!",
                "Take it is you need to, as an EE major, otherwise, I felt this course was unnecessarily challenging and very disorganized. Even towards the end, the general consensus was that the course was very mediocrely taught at best and no one really understood what was going on.",
                "Yes if they're interested in the material (or need to for a major requirement, I guess), although I would also consider alternative courses on the same subject. This class is good if you want a fairly relaxed introduction to information theory with engaging lectures. The professor isn't great at answering questions, though, and there were no professor office hours. so if you want to explore the material more deeply maybe look somewhere else. It is helpful to know basic probability for this class, and you will be somewhat lost during the first few weeks if you haven't seen combinatorics or Bayes' rule before. If you want to take the class, but don't know basic probability, I would highly, highly recommend taking a few hours to run through an intro stat textbook, or the wonderful and freely available online S&DS 238 lecture notes, until you get to Bayes' rules, just to get some intuition before jumping into the class.",
                "It seems like this is a complete rework of what the 202 class used to be. If you need it for your major, youll be just fine taking this class. It was difficult at times but not especially brutal. If you dont need it for your major, I would recommend only if you are interested in information theory. You will learn some cool things, but there will be some boring times. No harm in taking this course. For what its worth, I liked this better than 200 or 201.",
                "In terms of the concepts being taught, I would definitely recommend this course to another student - especially because it is a prerequisite as a electrical engineering major. However, as far as the current organization of the course goes, I would not recommend it to other students.",
                "It's a mid EE class. Sure, take it if you're interested in this topic (which I'm not sure I know). It's not a bad class."
