    "A much better understanding of early Spanish history.",
    "I had no working knowledge of Spanish history, and this course was a really good overview of the Hapsburg empire. I loved that we read so many primary sources, and I genuinely feel that we got a good understanding of the different social strata in Spain.",
    "I was able to gain insight on the causes that led to the Spanish crown to send Christopher Columbus to the New World. I learned about various religious expulsions and their negative effects on the economy of Spain. I learned of political changes and rebellions that these changes caused. We also learned of rebellions that occurred in the New World. We discussed how the poor was treated in Spain. Furthermore, prophecy was analyzed as a form of politics in Spain. We also discussed piracy in the Spanish empire."

    "Strengths: amazing professor, great course material, engaging readings. overall a complete joy to be in. Maria is a very loving and understanding person, and loves the course material.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: discussion in the class was pretty dead, despite it being a pretty small seminar. this was in part because it was at 9 am in a big, cold room, but i do think that if there were more graded incentives to do all the readings, people would have been more engaged. the class also focused a little too much on Spain, and I think many people in the class would have preferred more reading and discussion on Latin America. As it is, maybe 3 out of the 11 or 12 classes were strictly about Latin America, while the rest focused on Spain. We also definitely did not need an entire class devoted to an essay-writing workshop, especially since most of us were upperclassmen who'd done that kind of writing before.",
    "I think this course did not always offer a very nuanced understanding of different ethnicities within the empire, not of the burgeoning concept of modern race although of course a preexisting definition of race was something which also could have been discussed at greater length. The course does offer a great scope of empire geographically, politically, even gender was well represented (which I have not found in many of my other history courses). Another strength of this course was available Professor Jordan made herself to students.",
    "One of the strengths of this course was the breadth of different topics that ranged from Spain to its New World. I learned about many things that had political, economic, and social effects that I did not previously know or would have guessed based on my prior knowledge of history. This course will give me a larger breadth of history to make conclusions from future examples of history.",
    "While interesting, the syllabus felt a little disjointed and nonlinear. Sometimes it wasnt clear why we were covering a certain subject each week. Additionally, discussion was sometimes forced and awkward, perhaps because people hadnt done the readings or werent chatty in this particular iteration."

    "Yes, definitely.  Everybody should meet Maria, and even if you're not particularly interested in the subject, it's a wonderful class. However, I would warn the course focuses mostly on Spain, and I imagine a lot of the people wishing to take this class are more interested in Latin American colonial history. Also, I think that students who speak Spanish fluently would probably get more out of the experience, since so many of the primary sources are in Spanish (though it is in no way a requirement for taking the class as translations are always provided). It's likely to be a small class, as well. Take this class because the professor is amazing and the subject matter is way more interesting than it may seem at first.",
    "I would if they want a very in-depth look at the Spanish empire in particular. I think the topic was really interesting and I personally saw a lot of connections to many of my other studies, but Im aware that it seems a niche subject to many students.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I took this course off major but Professor Jordn made it a very enjoyable and accessible class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It gave me new perspectives on analyzing history. The professor was very versed in the topics discussed and was both helpful and encouraging to her students."
