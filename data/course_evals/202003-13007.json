                "This was a great discussion-based course that allowed for a lot of flexibility and engagement. I learned about various aspects of inequality in China but the course went far beyond that. We covered social, cultural, and political factors that are highly relevant to understanding China today.",
                "I developed a broad knowledge of many aspects of Chinese culture and life, ranging from the economy to marriage. I feel that I now understand how China works a lot better. I also gained a lot of insight into the Chinese government by participating in the two debates throughout the semester, one of which involve role-playing as government officials.",
                "I gained a lot of insight into China's current state as influenced by rapid social and economic changes. The content that this course provided was very interrelated and I felt like I got a taste of a wide array of topics pertaining to social inequality in China.",

                "The class covered a number of topics which was really great and the student presentations mixed things up every week. More videos would've been good because they really highlighted a lot of the current issues in a real way",
                "I really enjoyed that this course was such a small seminar. Because of that, each class felt like an open discussion with Professor Zang. I think this also meant that there was a universal level of participation which included doing the reading. One of the strengths of this course were the readings, which were obviously carefully chosen and quite interesting. Another strength was the atmosphere of the class fostered by Professor Zang, who emphasized understanding the material and intellectual curiosity over memorizing stuff for tests. I think the greatest strength of this course were the debates included in the syllabus, which were not only very fun but very informative.",
                "Strengths: The small class size created a discussion-led learning atmosphere that is very conducive to critical thinking. You learn about many different topics which give you a broad perspective of China's current condition. Weakness: The prompts for the papers are really vague and did not provide a lot of instruction or a rubric. Although the grading was very reasonable, sometimes it was hard to direct a paper or know what the professor was looking for without much guidance.",
                "This course is fantastic and I just wish there were a few more people in it to add even more perspectives."

                "Discussion was good for virtual learning so that there could be more engagement. Long lectures were less successful.",

                "YES! Take this course if you want to strengthen your understanding of socioeconomic and political aspects of Chinese society. You'll also get to pursue and interview and research project, both of which I found to be super rewarding. It's also a great class to meet other students and become good friends with them.",
                "Yes definitely. I believe the course will be different with more students but still 100% worth taking. The structure of the work is really nice in that you work on an interview project all semester and then have a final paper on a topic of your choice.",
                "Absolutely! China's indisputable dominance in today's global economy and relevance in most current affairs makes this course especially important in revealing the high social costs that come with rapid economic development. Every story of success has an ugly side. In order to gain a full picture of China's current state, it is crucial to recognize China's economic success with context to the many entrenched social issues seen across China at both cultural and insitutional levels.",
                "Without question, this was my favorite class this semester. I learned a ton about Chinese society, structurally and qualitatively. If you have any interest in Chinese history, society, and economics, this class is for you. I highly recommend."
