                "I learned a lot about the historical development of beliefs and religions in relation to 'Utopia', mainly through a philosophical outlook on historical readings. The discussion sections taught me how to further evaluate these readings and look deeper in the meaning of the texts and the beliefs of the authors.",
                "I learned much of how the ideas of what makes a utopia or dystopia in the western world changed over human history. I learned that there is no such thing as a universal utopia, since what everyone values can vary so much. I also learned that utopias are often created and imagined to solve what people see as flaws in their society, while dystopias often are caricatures of contemporary issues take to extremes.",
                "I learned about the history behind utopias and the different kinds. We learned about religious, more realistic utopias like Plato's Republic and more imaginary ones such as Cockaigne. We also learned about eco-socialist utopias and a little about the communist utopias. Dystopias were learned about but there were less examples studied and it wasn't as much of a focal point."

                "This course was truly spectacular. I have loved learning about utopias and dystopias from an academic point-of-view and can't wait to develop these ideas further. I appreciate Maria's ability to adjust readings or projects in order to facilitate the best learning environment for her students.",
                "I thought the reading material for this course was long but very worthwhile. Each reading was carefully selected and brought up new utopian and dystopian ideals. I also thought Professor Jordan had great ideas and was overall a very nice, heartwarming, and understanding instructor, which is important during a unprecedented time such as now. It was interesting to learn how relevant these dystopian and utopian elements are in shaping our current society, and how we can make our society better in the future. However, I thought that sometimes the course materials were a little hard to find, and I wish there was a little more transparency on how we were doing in the class and where we could improve (ie. updating grades on Canvas).",
                "The method of class discussion could have been improved upon to flow more smoothly.",
                "Strength: Professor Jordan made the class feel very comfortable, and the conversation always flowed smoothly.",
                "The class at its core is quite enjoyable if you're someone who likes worldbuilding and stuff like that. There were some last minute changes to the midterm and final though so perhaps it'd be better if those were put in place earlier on.",
                "The strength lies in how interesting and engaging it was, especially with weekly blogs about our personal opinions on the readings. I think the only weakness would be a lack of evaluation on the writing.",
                "Strengths of this course included the dystopia section and the presentations. I thought the presentations were a great way to explore the material in ways that we found interesting and created a lot of thought-provoking scenarios for the class to be able to answer. I think one of the weaknesses was the focus on utopias throughout the course and I think a way that can be improved is by simply exercising how the utopias could seem dystopic. For example, what about Plato's republic made it a dystopia or what about Thomas More's utopia made it a dystopia would have bene interesting to explore so that the class did not feel not feel so utopia centric."

The seminar format worked well, as everyone had their videos on and was contributing a lot to the course. The online discussions allowed students to think a little deeper into the text before the class.",

                "The Zoom seminars succeeded for this course. I think the way they were organized was nice and although the time zones did not work out well for me, I managed to wake up for the seminar and get going. The breaks during the seminars were very welcome and helped to keep our energy up and our participation higher. The thing that could be improved is the Canvas engagement. For the discussion board, I know reminders shouldn't be necessary, but they were easy to forget about when they weren't mentioned and I never received any notifications when they were opened. It could be improved by possibly sending an email when the board is opened or maybe creating an announcement."

The utopia aspect is developed thoroughly and its interesting to see what people thought would be ideal in previous times. However, one of the greatest challenges for me was the time zone resulting in a 6am course which was difficult to accommodate for but it was manageable."
