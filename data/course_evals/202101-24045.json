                "Strength - Professor Tortora was amazing! She was very kind and understanding. I was a bit nervous coming into this class because it was taught in Spanish, but she really helped you get comfortable with speaking. She also taught very well and made some of the more difficult aspects of Spanish grammar easier to understand. She also made frequent announcements that were helpful in knowing when things were due, especially because there are so many assignments and activities. Another strength is the different types of activities. The listening and oral presentations were very helpful in improving my listening and speaking skills. Weakness - the course does move pretty fast so you learn a lot every week, which isn't too bad, but for retention sometimes it's not the best. I also would've preferred a bit more listening practice. Also although they had the mesa de espaol, i feel like they should've incorporated that in the course, or at least offer other times because I wasn't able to attend any.",
                "Every assignment you do goes towards your grade, which makes the class stressful and makes it easy to dislike the course. Too many graded assignments.",
                "Strengths: lots of engagement, a lot of opportunities to practice speaking & writing without being an overwhelming amount of work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a 93 isn't considered an A",
                "It was challenging to learn Spanish remotely. The fact that it was every day was good because it made us engage with the content every day."

If you do, take it with Professor Tortora! She is a gem and very knowledgeable about Spanish and Spanish culture.",
                "Only take it if youre already good at Spanish, or if youre willing to let it dominate your schedule.",
                "Yup. It's very thorough and requires you to practice every component of Spanish, rather than just reading & writing. The listening, speaking, and writing portions challenged me without ever feeling overwhelmed. I often found Spanish a nice respite from my STEM classes.",
