Each week's theme dives into the importance of expanding student-centered and family-centered childcare and early childhood education programs and the challenges associated with them. This was a starting point for me in this aspect of education, so this course was really well-designed to get a vast breadth of the societal and policy landscape"

The activities we completed too were a lot of fun and reminded me of the creativity that should go into this work!\r\n\r\nThe readings were a little bit repetitive. It may be worth cutting a few out or replacing them with non-policy ones. Also, I would really appreciate more guidance on the assignments! Having a page on Canvas that explained the expectations for them would be really helpful!",

                "The course is a great overview of early childhood education and childcare in the U.S. The combination of student-led discussion questions, brief concept overview, and activities made the 110 minutes of class purposeful and engaging. One suggestion to improve the course is to have more structured check-ins for the final paper earlier in the semester. The final paper is a great assignment for self-initiated research into a topic we did not go too much into depth in class (or bring new ideas to concepts we reviewed), but one structured meeting may not be enough to get the ball rolling."

There's time set aside to explore some solutions/approaches to some issues on childcare, which make for very interesting conversations and discussions.",
