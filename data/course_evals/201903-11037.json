   "comments": [
    "I learned how to read and analyze scientific papers, even those that were technically much higher than my level of understanding. I also learned how to write papers synthesizing multiple sources and connecting their arguments to draw conclusions.",
    "I gained a greater understanding of the many challenges facing our species from climate change. I am now better at extracting key information from scientific papers and more well-versed in climate science.",
    "How to cooperate and plan with other people and the basics of environmental science and geology as a whole",
    "I was exposed to many different fields of natural sciences by many different professors. It was also a nice intro into how to closely read and understand technical scientific papers.",
    "I developed the ability to read through scientific papers and adequately identify the purpose, aims, and results of the paper as well as its significance to the greater world. Furthermore, I learned and practiced discussing complex scientific histories and topics specifically pertaining to climate change. I also learned a lot about individual problems and studies pertaining to the earth's history and climate change which is very relevant to the future.",
    "I learned a lot about drawing out important information from very dense, often long scientific papers. I learned a lot about climate change, and I think I became significantly better at writing about scientific things.",
    "This course caused me to become much more aware of the different ways in which human activity is resulting in perverse impacts upon our natural world, and prompted me to look at ways in which my own lifestyle could be improved to reduce environmental harm. The writing assignments were highly beneficial in improving my writing skills, and helped me find effective ways to conduct a successful research paper.",
    "This class was an excellent introduction into the field of geology and environmental science. The material was always interesting and student participation was a big part of this course. It was also a good introduction into scientific writing and analyzing scientific papers.",
    "I learned a lot about the scientific aspect of sustainability, including green chemistry and the technology of renewable resources. I thought it was really interesting to get a lot of different and nuanced perspectives about climate change from a range of scientists.",
    "I've learned a lot of various aspects of Earth systems, and one of the most important things I've learned from this course is how to distill information. The readings were good for practicing taking a dense paper and extracting the most important information. The discussions were also great for making that complex information easy to analyze in a conversation format.",
    "How to process scientific papers, how to communicate opinions effectively",
    "i learned about various earth systems and topics i never even thought about",
    "Scientific literacy and communication skills",
    "I learned how to read scientific research papers and understand the complex language often used in them. Additionally, I learned more about how to ask intelligent questions to accurately convey what I am intending to ask."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: format of the class! I loved hearing from a different expert every week because it exposed me to a broad overview of waht research looks like and some of the really interesting topics people are studying. I also like that after the speaker came, we had a discussion section to process what was said and listen to each others' questions! The term papers also allowed us to dive in deep into a topic that interested us, so I learned a lot but enjoyed it because I got to choose my topic\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there is no big weakness in the class, other than the fact that a lot of the professors' talks weren't related to the papers we were assigned, which made it confusing sometimes.",
    "Strengths: Very interesting lectures and class discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
    "Strengths: gives a good overview into a lot of the concepts pertinent to the climate and earth\r\nWeaknesses: discussions could be more guided and informative",
    "Strengths: The way that this class is structured is an amazing way for students who are passionate about the natural world to learn about all different aspects of it. Through this class, I was exposed to so many different fields in the sciences that I had no idea I was interested in. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel that it was a little impersonal at times, even though it was a seminar. The second class of the week was the discussion day, but there was not much discussion involved. It sometimes felt like it was just a small lecture with no personal interaction with the Professor.",
    "I think on of the strongest parts of the course was the guest lecturer structure because  it was  frankly amazing to hear from so many experts of their fields and  learn about such a diverse array of topics. Furthermore, these topics were structured very intentionally and very well allowing us have a structured theme even when learning from so many different people. I think on weakness of the course was that I didn't end up really getting to know or dialogue with many of my classmates as the Thursday discussions felt more like question and answer and comments than a class discussion.",
    "I really enjoyed the discussion sections, in which we could extrapolate from the very technical information in the lectures and readings and get a more holistic understanding of the material. I feel that this could be emphasized even more in the class, with less time spent on the actual papers. I think varying the homework would help make the course more engaging and informative.",
    "The strengths of this course were the wide array of information I received about a plethora of dynamics within the Earth system, both in the past and present, as well as the opportunity to hear first-hand from many outstanding faculty members at Yale.",
    "I really enjoyed the way that the classes were structured and how we got to hear from experts in their fields.",
    "strengths are wide variety of topics covered and very easy workload. weakness is some topics covered are a little dull",
    "Got a little hard to follow with a new topic every week but overall was interesting.",
    "There was a different lecturer every week, so there was very little continuity to the course. Also, not enough useful feedback on the term papers."

   "comments": [
    "YES! I loved this class because it wasn't too stressful but I still feel like I learned so much!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot about Earth and its many processes and became a better communicator of the risks anthropogenic climate change poses to humanity.",
    "A really great class if you are interested in the natural sciences and the climate",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in environmental\/natural sciences but are not sure what field. Hearing about a wide range of topics from so many professors keeps the class interesting and it allows for a discovery of interests.",
    "Yes, I think its a great course and an exciting structure.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is looking for a fun, relaxed, and very interesting class, and is prepared for the very science-y aspects of the course.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in environmental studies\/development, or anyone who is simply curious about the current state of our environment. If you apply yourself, you will come out of it knowing a great deal more about our world, while also getting to hear from many distinguished faculty members as they break down their own research.",
    "I thought that the course was very interesting and not too much workload.",
    "absolutely",
    "Yes it was very interesting and presented a broad array of topics that everyone could find interesting at one point or another.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. We covered many different topics, and each one was very interesting in its own way, so I think many people would find something to enjoy about the course."
