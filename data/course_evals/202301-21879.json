                "Strengths - Lidya is a great instructor. She gives lots of feedback in a timely fashion. There are extra credit opportunities. The labs are very cool, and make use of samples loaned from the Peabody.\r\nWeaknesses - no field trip :(",
                "This course is extremely well-organized and teaches a thorough overview of sedimentation. The labs provide excellent application of learned concepts, and the instruction is clear and accessible. There should be more labs, and perhaps field experiences. Additionally, the quizzes added more stress than opportunity for retention.",
                "Strengths: The course was very well organized and followed a clear trajectory. I appreciated how closely it followed the textbook, too. The two hands-on labs were fun and useful for learning to apply our knowledge to interpreting hand samples. Guest lectures were very relevant and effective.\r\nWeaknesses: Prof Tarhan's lecture style is long-winded and my classmates and I were often confused about very simple concepts due to her roundabout explanations and unclear answers to questions. Also, there really are pop quizzes, so people were kind of anxious about the class all the time. I think it would have been more effective to have a scheduled quiz every week or two.",
                "I think the pop quizzes could create a really stressful learning environment at times, but I do think the quizzes were the reason I learned/studied so much in this class. Come the midterm, I felt really prepared. Since they were so frequent I think the quizzes would have had the same effect even if we had warning though. \r\nAlso I feel like the textbook did not really mirror the class and could be optional.",
                "There are really only strengths. The class is expertly taught, the assignments do a great job of helping to better understand the material, and grading is very fair. I would take the class again in an instant. The one weakness was the pop quizzes. I think having scheduled weekly quizzes would have all the benefits of regular testing but without the stress of them being a surprise each time.",
                "Lidya's lectures are very information dense, which can be a pro or a con depending on how well you can keep up. We covered about 1 chapter of the textbook per class, and with each chapter being 20-40 pages long it was a lot of material to get through.\r\n\r\nIt was nice not having psets or any other type of regular homework assignments, but we did have pop quizzes so the expectation was that we should always be studying. I understand the justification, but it also caused a lot of unnecessary anxiety, so it'd be nice to have scheduled quizzes.",
                "Lidya is a very organized professor, which is both a strength in that it means she stays on schedule and you know what youre supposed to be learning and a weakness in that it means her powerpoints are sparse on words yet she says a lot in class so its hard to write it all down. We had pop quizzes which were a major weakness of the course. They stressed students out to no end and there was no way to prepare accommodations for them as we would not know if they were happening until she walked into class with papers. It would have been much more beneficial to do weekly quizzes on one day than pop quizzes scattered about.",
                "Strengths: Super organized, you learn so much, the grading is really spaced out across lots of different types of assignments, and Lidya is so passionate and engaging. I looked forward to this class every week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Although the level of detail that we went into was really interesting, I do think that at times it distracted me from learning about the key themes in the course. I think cutting some detail and emphasizing major concepts instead would be great.",
                "The course covers a lot of interesting content. This is mostly a good thing, but it also sometimes meant that we were moving so fast through the material that it felt a bit hard to actually comprehend it, rather than just memorize it. I think that in some instances, structuring the lectures around real-world examples/anecdotes (rather than purely abstract method/theory) would have made them more easily comprehensible. It was also not always the easiest to participate in such a sizable lecture-based class, which I feel made it a little difficult to satisfy the participation requirement of the grade. \r\n\r\nAgain, though, a very interesting class! I certainly learned a lot.",
                "Strengths: awesome professor, very thorough\r\nWeaknesses: jargon-heavy, sometimes hard to keep up in lecture\r\nHow it could be improved: publish the lecture notes in Canvas BEFORE the class so I can better keep up with the lecture as it's going"

                "Although I learned a lot from this course, I would not necessarily recommend it. There is a lot of memorization that didn't feel worth it (for example, we had to memorize an entire classification scheme that could easily be referenced in the field). While the overall topics are relevant and important, the majority of the time I spent on this class was learning things too niche to even be necessary for fieldwork. It certainly depends on your background and goals, but if I could do it again I might not take this class.",
