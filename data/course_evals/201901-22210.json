   "comments": [
    "This course had a well-chosen films and readings that were genuinely interesting to someone who doesn't know much about economics. I thought the film screenings could have been more conveniently scheduled so I didn't have to keep going to the Film Study Center to watch them.",
    "Strenghts - many conversations, presentations; improves speaking skills\r\nWeaknesses - long readings, difficult to deeply engage with course topic since reading and understanding takes time",
    "Most of the work for the course was reading which was very passive.\r\nMy learning and engagement would have benefited from more regular interactive\/proactive work\r\n\r\nVery good, comprehensive feedback after presentations and written assignments. Was very clear and specific",
    "This course could have facilitated discussions better by being less strictly focused on answering questions about he readings, but talking more generally about the themes discussed.",
    "wish i could get more feedback on my writing in a non-assessed way in order to improve writing for the assesments",
    "Strength: great conversations in French and required presentation to help improve speaking \r\nWeakness: the class could use more interesting topics in business for discussions",
    "It is an engaging course with interesting material. It is geared more towards being better fluent in speaking french than writing which was great since most other french courses cater for writing and grammar.",
    "Grades are very heavily based around a couple of presentations and essays while discussions in class mostly cover the readings. Perhaps having fewer presentations and more short reading responses would improve understanding each article\/chapter\/essay.",
    "I found some of the readings a little too technical considering I have no prior experience with business so I felt as though I didnt understand as much from the readings as from the class discussions.",
    "I highly enjoyed the course as it allowed for a lot of in class discussion, which is fundamental for improving language skills. The weekly course load was appropriate and the assignments were fun and engaging. The course could have been improved in terms of its structure. Even though all of the subjects were interesting, it was difficult to find a connection and overview at times."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys studying economics or who knows very little about the subject but is interested in learning something new.",
    "Yes, because the workload is not too high, but French skills are being greatly improved, especially because the instructor is a native speaker.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Great prof, small class which made it very interactive, thought-provoking topics and discussions",
    "yes, if you are interested in learning about the structure of businesses in france.",
    "yes good french credit and professor is great",
    "Yes! please take this class if you want to improve speaking in French and learn about business in France. Professor Tertrain is wonderful!",
    "It is a great course to upkeep or improve oratory and research skills. I would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're looking for a class where you can read and peak a bunch in French and improve your language skills, but aren't looking for a heavy writing\/literature course. Also, if you're fluent in French and really want to learn more about French business.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students because it was really interesting to apply my French abilities so a new topic. It was so different than other French grammar courses that I have taken in the past.",
    "I would recommend this student who has a solid grip of the French language, and is looking to improve their writing and speaking skills. It is helpful if students know about the economy and business in France, but it is not necessary."
