                "I think the difficulties in the course scheduling and the theorists that we read made it hard to recommend this course to anyone that doesn't already have an intellectual investment in Rawls, Dworkin, Cohen etc. If your intellectual training has already caused you to move beyond them  (i.e. to Marxian thinking), there's no reason to go back.",
