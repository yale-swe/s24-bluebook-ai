                "In this course, we read the major figures in the history of political and economic thought, from Aristotle to Hayek. I learned how thinkers from the Scottish enlightenment identified and characterized the emerging commercial society and how later writers responded to its perceived deficiencies.",
                "knowledge of core thinkers of EPE. Ability to analyze philosophical writing and ideas in depth",
                "An understanding of 7 interdisciplinary thinkers and a really good seminar.",
                "Basics of seminal political philosophers throughout history",
                "A tie between all three disciplines of our major (EP&E)! Very challenging texts, so the ability to analyze philosophical writing was something definitely worked on.",
                "This course teaches you a great deal about how to read large amounts of complex information quickly and thoroughly, and it helps develop the ability to participate in discursive exchanges about that information that are productive. In some places there's a heavy emphasis on textual exegesis, so we learned how to parse the texts we were reading and really understand them. It was helpful to develop an especially strong insight into the ways Western philosophy has built upon its past iterations in layers; no generation of philosophers is a blank slate.",
                "I intimately engaged with the political philosophy of seven great thinkers: Aristotle, Hume, Ferguson, Bentham, Hegel, Hayek, and Schumpeter. This course transforms these names from words to extremely meaningful schools of ideas that have shaped the way we think about ethics, politics, and economics.\r\n\r\nThroughout the course, we explored the works of these philosophers and economists, delving into their ideas and theories. We examined Aristotle's concept of virtue ethics and how it relates to the idea of the common good. We also looked at Hume's views on morality and how they differ from Aristotle's, as well as Ferguson's ideas on the importance of social institutions and their role in shaping society. We then moved on to Bentham's utilitarianism and how it has influenced modern political thought, followed by Hegel's philosophy of history and his ideas on the state. Finally, we cover Hayek's views on the role of the market in society and Schumpeter's theory of creative destruction.\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable aspects of this course was the opportunity to engage in lively discussions with my classmates. We were able to share our thoughts and perspectives on these complex ideas, which helped to deepen our understanding of the material. I also developed a much deeper understanding of argumentation and how to assert myself in a seminar setting. I learned to express my thoughts and ideas more effectively.\r\n\r\nOverall, this course was an excellent introduction to the key ideas and theories in ethics, politics, and economics. It provided a comprehensive overview of the works of some of the most influential thinkers in these fields, and helped me to develop a deeper appreciation for the complexity of these subjects."

                "I really enjoyed the syllabus for this class. I thought it was well-balanced and included diverse perspectives. The seminar discussions were enlightening, although at times it was clear not everyone had done the reading or at least had nothing to say, which definitely limited the amount I could get out of the class (not that Yale can do anything about that).",
                "I think we covered too m any thinkers in one semester. There is so much greater content but I would love to spend more time on a few writers.",
                "We jumped from Aristotle to Hume and Hegel really fast. Would have been nice to get some other thinkers in there. The course was well taught and run though will likely be very different without Prof. Kapustin",
                "Strengths: well organized, stimulating discussions, engaging professor who cares deeply about his students\r\nWeaknesses: little feedback or clarity on how you are doing in the class",
                "Strengths: The familiar structure. Each class is the same in that Prof. Kapustin will introduce each text we should have read by that time and then he asks us questions surrounding the text. If we cannot answer them, which sometimes happened, he offered us explanations that would help. \r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Kapustin is so wise, and honestly so passionate about his class. I wish he spoke more and taught us more some classes, rather than hear us all talking (but its a seminar, what can you expect).",
                "Strengths: Lots of opportunities to read interesting writers and thinkers; Boris is an extremely passionate lecturer who does not hold back in telling you his opinions and is also just a lovely person; provides a solid foundation for understanding Western thought (especially the introduction to Hegel)\r\nWeaknesses: Can become an exercise in explaining, not analyzing, texts: the class would sometimes default to talking not to each other about what they thought of the readings, but just about what the readings were saying",
                "A key strength of this course is that it balances a blend of depth and breadth and allows you to go deep into a wide variety of speakers and political philosophers. The only caveat is that it was a little bit more rushed at the end and we weren't able to cover Schumpeter in full detail. However, the wide variety and depth make this course unparalleled and the best course I have taken in ethics, politics, and economics."

                "This course kind of felt like DS Part 2 but with a focus on political economy. Your reaction to that statement will probably tell you whether you want to take it. If you enjoy reading great books and discussing them, then take this class. If you just want to gain insights into the modern political landscape, it's probably less directly applicable, given that the most recent thinkers we read were still from the mid-20th century.",
                "Yes, if you are ready to make the effort to engage meaningfully with the material",
                "The course will be very different without Prof. Kapustin. I would recommend it but see what professor is teaching.",
                "Absolutely! Even if you aren't an EP&E major",
                "You need to pay attention, you absolutely cannot get by this class thinking you can just go on your laptop and do other things. It is a small lecture and if you are not paying attention not only is it excruciatingly obvious, but it will come time to write the papers and you will have no idea what you are doing. Pay close attention in class and you will do fine.",
                "I would definitely recommend taking this course (and for the EP&E majors out there, you have to), but I think it's particularly enjoyable when Boris is teaching it, and I'm not sure what it would be like or how it would change without him. Take advantage of the opportunity to read authors you might not have read before in other introductory EP&E classes, and definitely think about a lighter workload if you want to make the most of the readings.",
                "Absolutely. This course is perhaps the best course I've ever taken at Yale and definitely the best course I have taken for ethics, politics, and economics. You learn so much about political philosophers, how they think, and their argumentation. You also develop critical thinking skills, and the ability to practice in a seminar environment."
