    "Through this course I learned very valuable experimentation and scientific writing skills. I also learned the  mechanics underlying fundamental topics in biology including cellular structure and development.",
    "I learned about the real world application of a variety of different model organisms and of course the laboratory basics behind working with these organisms. More importantly, however I learned about many critical aspects of scientific writing.",
    "I developed the ability to solve biological problems through experimentation. I learned what goes into designing an experiment.",
    "I learned a lot of basic biological lab skills.",
    "Laboratory procedures working with model organisms and living biological material, experimental design and team experiments. How to write a professional, standard lab report and keep detailed logs in lab notebooks."

    "This class is incredibly well structured and well taught. No complaints here.",
    "The strength of this course is Professor Moreno. She is extremely kind and present during class, making this a unique lab experience for me.",
    "I loved how this course was taught. The professor and TA were extremely supportive throughout everything we did, from the experiments to the reports. The experiments were both interesting and designed to facilitate successive knowledge and comfort designing and conducting our own experiments."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! A great biology lab, especially for premeds.",
    "Absolutely! It was the most learning oriented, coherent, and intellectually curious lab I've taken at yale during my premed career.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course because for me it was an opportunity to learn about actually relevant and applicable skills I can use in research without the same stress I've experienced in other lab courses. I think this course demonstrates that we can restructure lab courses to be centered around learning rather than the completion of some obscure and ultimately highly niche procedure (e.i chemistry lab courses).",
    "Yes! Great lab if you need one. Practical skills in a fun setting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It's very rare to find a laboratory course so well designed to develop a crucial base understanding of what it's like to work in a lab setting; a reality which is troubling in a scientific and pre-med atmosphere that essentially requires one to spend time in professional labs. Students were rewarded for asking for help consistently and supportively."
