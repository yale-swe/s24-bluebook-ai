                "I think that this course covers a lot of interesting areas but can sometimes feel redundant.",
                "This course aims to take large conflicts and condense them into a few weeks of learning, which does not do justice to the topic at hand. Although some of the issues studied are certainly complex and could be covered in one course on its own, it sometimes feels remiss to attempt to fit in multiple state-nation conflicts over the course of a few weeks. However, this course does cover a few trends (such as nationalism, state formation) which are taught very well.",
                "Strengths- the professor was very well versed in the subject and had a lot of passion for the topic.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- presupposes prior knowledge.",
                "It is evident the professor knows a lot about Catalonia and censuses and how identity plays a role in these political systems. However, we spent very little time on the parts of the course the professor was an expert in and instead hopped around to various topics the professor was much less familiar with. The course was also not set up to allow for student involvement, so there was very little discussion and very little opportunity for the students to contribute besides passively reading the material and occasionally raising their hand to contribute in lecture. In all, it was a very disappointing course. Perhaps it would be better offered as a seminar.",
                "Strengths: really interesting content, I really enjoyed the class and not too much work either \r\nWeaknesses: a bit hard to note down everything at the start but you get into the rhythm of things",
                "There could be a better synthesis between theories and case studies; more clearly highlighting how they interact. The group presentations were very rushed and are obviously very dependent on who is in your group; if you can deal with that work then thats fine, but if not it may be difficult.",
                "Interesting subject matter and some good readings. Lecture itself was moderately engaging. I wish we had more practical applications of the topics we were learning about weaved into the lecture. One of my favorite classes was when the TA taught a lecture because she discussed real world events and how they incorporated the theories we were learning about. Assignments were fair, but felt tedious at times.",
                "The strength of this course is the knowledge of the professor. The weaknesses of this course are the TF, the pacing, the overall engagement of this class.",
                "The instructor was always enthusiastic about teaching and the lectures were engaging. However it was difficult to keep up with all the content presented sometimes because of the amount of content written on slides."

                "I don't know if I would. I don't know a lot about poli sci and found out through this course that I don't particularly enjoy it, so I wouldn't recommend it to someone who isn't really into poli sci. However I did learn some interesting things and it's not like I expect everyone would have my experience, so if someone wanted to know more about the topic I would recommend this.",
                "This course was an insult to the Yale student's intellect. There was very little depth covered in the topics and going to class was pointless except to get the participation points. Most of lecture was spent recapping the reading that was assigned instead of delving further into those topics or supplementing the reading with additional material or ideas. Likewise, the way the professor talked about ethnic identity was wholly problematic. Calling marriage across racial lines \"mismarriage\" (did she mean to say mixed marriage??- still unsure but not happy either way) or categorizing ethnic minority groups into \"advanced groups\" and \"backwards groups\" and presenting these categorizations as though they're fact is not ok. This material had so much potential to be interesting and to allow for engagement but without discussion and without critical thinking about the readings the course can only be classified as problematic. Don't take unless there is a severe reformation of the syllabus and course structure.",
                "Yes! Take this class - I really enjoyed it and its balanced, interesting and not too much work.",
                "Assuming youre interested in the topic, I think you should take this course. It revolves around a lecture format without discussion sections, so somewhat requires you to engage with the material as opposed to just exist in the lecture room; thought, you can honestly do that as well Still an interesting course content very relavant to contemporary issues; will expose you to a variety of theoretical frameworks and case studies relating to ethnic conflict and identity.",
                "I'm very in the middle about this course. I liked the subject matter a lot, but found lectures to be not super engaging. Overall, a not too difficult course with interesting subject matter.",
                "Absolutely not, unless you are a global affairs major.",
                "If you are interested in identity politics this is a wonderful class to get an overview of scholars and sometimes get specific with certain cases."
