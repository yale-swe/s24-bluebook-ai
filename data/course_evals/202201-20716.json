I have learned new grammatical structures and as well as more about the culture, traditions, and history of Italy through the various units we covered.

This has enhanced my ability to be conversant in the language and have the confidence to speak on any topic that I would like!",

                "Strengths meet every day lots of time to understand and learn. Weakness expected to learn lot of vocab in our own time",
                "The strengths of this course are that it is very well organized and its pace is manageable. This course could be better if there were not 6 exams throughout the course that occurred in short intervals.",
                "Tests not worth enough, other items worth too much that make strangely weighted grading. Teaching was great and class was otherwise fun and beneficial.",
                "The strengths were teaching grammar. I would have liked to do more speaking activities to prepare for the final oral exam.",
                "Strengths: Super engaging, organized, and fun! We immersed ourselves in all forms of media, from film to music to literature, which has been instrumental in forming an effective learning environment and improving our fluency in Italian. \r\nUnits were organized to be about a 1-1.5 weeks long and were well-paced. Weekly compositions helped improve our writing skills and encouraged us to do research on phrases and vocab not covered in class. Presentations were nice and low-key to help us practice our conversational and listening skills. Having spontaneous class discussions on relevant class material was particularly important in allowing us to think and speak on our feet, helping us sharpen our conversational skills.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the units had more material than others, especially the last few, so it would have been nice to split some of the units up and be tested on those heavier units half-a-unit at a time. Sometimes, we had compositions due on the same day as the unit exams, so scheduling them so that they don't conflict with each other would be helpful. Online textbook exercises were helpful for extra practice, but sometimes the feedback\/grading system was not very helpful & not accurate or not sensitive to minor inaccuracies."

                "Absolutely! If you are even remotely interested in learning Italian, take it! The faculty is incredibly supportive and committed to helping you learn the Italian language and culture and history. You will come out of the language sequence having learned beyond what you expect  you will learn about the diverse ways in which humans communicate across different cultures and in turn, learn more about your own. You will develop a globalized perspective and be more attentive to and interested in the ways in which the Italian language and culture has influence over our own communities today!",
