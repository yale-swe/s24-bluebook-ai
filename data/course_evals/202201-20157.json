                "The teaching is a huge strength of the course: profs Samuels and Kaplan prepare captivating, fun, and really insightful lectures and the Q&A/debate they hold at the end is a great way to keep everyone hooked. It goes without saying as well that the content of the class is a huge strength: the professors have curated a really great syllabus that builds a sense of historical, thematic, and literary progression.\r\nSection was also very relaxed and a great time to come together to discuss the books, and my TA was really nice.\r\nThe only weakness I can think of is the heavy reading load at the beginning of the semester, but the class is made so that, if you aren't able to get through everything, you will not be lost, rather it will only feel like you are missing out on great reading.",
                "No weaknesses! The class was taught exceptionally well. Really enjoyed the lectures as well as the discussions",
                "If there could somehow be a French lecture offered as well, that would be helpful for those of us taking the French section who are also looking to practice French and more fully analyze the French language aspects of the books!",

                "Strengths: professors are amazing lecturers",

                "I really enjoyed the structure of the course and thought that the lecture were really engaging, I would have liked some more time for student questions during lectures though",
                "Strengths: Professors Kaplan and Samuels are great, the books are great, and section was usually engaging and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The choices of what to read were sometimes confusing; some of the books required prior knowledge of books not on the syllabus. As it's an introduction to French literature, they could have made it more accessible, or at least included prerequisite texts earlier in the syllabus.",
                "The strength is that it connects history, politics, and literature. Also, it pushes me to read a lot.\r\nBut, I feel like we are reading too many books that we don't have enough time to dive deep into each of them... Maybe fewer books would be better?",
                "Too many books perhaps, but very good ones.",
                "Great reading list is a huge strength, but a weakness is that the reading load is fairly intense, especially during some weeks with denser texts. I loved the co-taught format in which one professor lectures for 40 mins and the other leads a 10 minute discussion after the fact, especially since they're both giants in their fields and have lots of insight to offer.",

The course is a joy regardless of how much you choose to dedicate yourself to it. Obviously you will get more out of the class if you read all of the books and engage with them critically, but even in weeks when you might fall behind, you will still be able to learn and enjoy simply by listening to the lectures.",

                "Like any great books course, it's quite a lot of reading, with 150-200 pages a week. Other than showing up to lecture (at which they take attendance) and section, along with the handful of papers and tests they don't grade too harshly, it's pretty low-commitment. The lectures are good. If you can commit to doing the readings, I would recommend the Credit/D option.",
