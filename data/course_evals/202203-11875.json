                "I learned so much about history, about historical analysis, and about classic Marxist vs Liberal ideologies in this course. I also gained some great discussion skills  our discussions were great and I felt like I had to hold myself to a high bar - a very enlivening feeling. I also learned a lot about how compassion/kindness/humility can be employed even in rigorous academic settings.",
                "I learned more about Marxist criticism than I ever wanted to know, and don't remember learning much of anything else. This course was more political philosophy than it was an English Department Senior Seminar.",
                "This course was very interested in taking nothing for granted about criticism and its value, even as we read foundational texts on the subject. It promoted questioning and probing at the highest level.",
                "I learned a lot about communist theory and intellectual debate.",
                "More than anything, this course helped me understand what it means to be an English major, which is a good thing to understand considering I've been an English major for the past two years. I read works I wouldn't have normally picked up, so I'm glad I got the opportunity to do so in a group of people who also were probably doing this for the first time.",
                "I learned how to write a long (20+) page paper with distinct chapters/sections. I learned to sustain an argument for that long and bring in multiple different sources. The \"pilot final\" midterm/final structure of the class gave me the opportunity to really engage with the feedback I got on the midterm, which was nice. I gained an understanding of Marxist literary theory.",
                "Major and minor socialist and liberal social/literary theory. Reflections on the purpose of the English major.",
                "ENGL 383 comprised an exploration of both marxist and liberal readings in order to understand the role of literary criticism and, more broadly, the role of the English major. Marxist readings included works from Marx, Engels, Morris, Lenin, Trotsky, Luxemburg, and Gramsci, while liberal readings included works from Arnold, Mill, Woolf, Trilling, Richards, and Leavis, among others. Beyond the insights endowed by each of these works, this course instilled in me an open-mindedness that I didnt realize I lacked until I was asked to articulate my own criticisms of each work we read. While literary criticism, as a whole, remains a rather abstract concept, the breadth of perspectives covered helped to instill a practical appreciation for a wide range of literary motives and devices, as well as a more personal reflection regarding my own reasons for criticism.",
                "I learned a lot about radical and liberal political ideologies and had the opportunity to read criticism in these schools from a wide range of Western thinkers. I also strengthened my skills in discussing criticism and political thought.",

                "I developed a broad sense of European literary criticism in the 20th century. Professor North did provide very detailed and helpful line edits for the midterm paper, which I appreciated."

            "comments": [
                "The course was extremely well designed and thought out. Each reading was manageable and very helpful in understanding the various schools of thought on the topic. One minor point of improvement for the class is that I felt the course title could have been more specific to include the heavy emphasis on political thought that ended up being part of the class. Other than that, the political philosophy was a very welcome inclusion, and I really enjoyed every minute of this class.",
                "I think the course is well-taught, well-designed, and well-assessed. The only potential weakness I could point to is that, in an attempt help students orient themselves towards both the close reading of complex theoretical texts, and their consideration at a broad, conceptual level, the course asks too little of them in terms of reading load. The reading load of the course was by not light, but I personally would have preferred a more extensive reading list, since the domains of thought in which we were moving were at times foreign to me. I can think of no other weaknesses; it was otherwise one of the best classes I have taken at Yale, and certainly the best I have taken in the English department.",
                "The course's strengths were that the material was fascinating, the readings were new to most of us in class  a great mix of better and lesser known Communist texts in particular  and all great, and that the resulting discussions were great too. Professor North's way of understanding complex issues and making sense of history was very interesting and inspiring to me  I feel he thinks unlike many professors at Yale and perhaps in a way that more closely resembles my own mode of very associative thinking! Professor North is clearly so knowledgeable about the topics he taught and deeply committed to presenting liberalism and communism in a fair light. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the course were really only that sometimes the idea of 'literary criticism' seemed a bit buried within the other material in the course and sometimes the connection between the intellectuals we treated in class and criticism seemed obscured. Professor North perhaps could have illuminated these connections a bit more for us.",
                "I wish more of this course had actually spent time talking about literary criticism. It felt like this class was more about political theory.",
                "The organization of this course was extremely poor. The semester was broken into three sectors, but it felt like we covered Marxism and a little bit of Liberalism at the end. Our midterm was to write a \"pilot\" paper in preparation for our final. However, at that point, all we had covered in the class was Marxist criticism, basically forcing our hands on what we knew enough to write about for the midterm paper. There were no hard prompts for the papers  which is normal, for a high-level English course  but there was also no guidance on what to do, what to pursue, and how to go about it. For this course to be a senior seminar and endcap to a person's Yale career I can't imagine anything at all was learned in this course, except for the prolific reading we had to do. The readings were in preparation for the course discussions in which I never had any idea what was going on because everything was philosophical.",
                "The main strength and weakness of the course is its formlessnessthe drift from thinker to thinker prompted a lot of interesting discussion, but without more structure it was sometimes easy to get lost in the weeds.",
                "The final paper for this course was the longest one most of us had ever written and there was almost no support for the writing process. Joe was available in office hours but with no prompt and all of the intermediary steps between the idea and the finished product being optional, there wasn't a lot to go on. This paper was not just a longer version of something we'd all done before, but I at least had to learn how to write this kind of paper. I think there was a lost opportunity for instruction on how higher level English papers are written and should be thought about.",
                "I appreciated getting to say any preliminary thoughts I had about the text for that week. I thought it did a really great job of getting us to start thinking about things that might have slipped past one person but stuck out to another.",
                "I would have liked to see the conservative literary theorists presented in addition to the liberals and the Marxists. It felt like an arbitrary choice to leave them out. I would have also enjoyed more conversations about the state of contemporary criticism.",
                "Prof. North is definitely a strength of the coursegreat listener and lecturer. Interesting reading listId love to hear more about the interconnections between these readings. Id also like to read some pieces of literature to which the theoretical readings can be applied",
                "Perhaps both the greatest strength and the greatest weakness of this course is the breadth of materials covered. While covering such a wide range of authors is absolutely necessary in order to gain a foundational understanding of marxist versus liberal perspectives (especially since most students lack exposure to marxist literature prior to this course), doing so limits the time that can be spent toward synthesizing and comparing these two perspectives once the foundational knowledge is gained. One way to address this might be to shorten the works read by each author and to add small, weekly discussion essays, a solution that may also help to alleviate some of the pressure underlying this courses lack of assignments. This solution doesnt necessarily subtract or add time to the students workload, but I do think it could redistribute time in a way that leads to an even greater grasp of the perspectives discussed. For example, rather than reading multiple chapters of I.A. Richards, perhaps the syllabus could be limited to one chapter, yet students could write a one-page discussion essay (half-page summary paragraph with a half-page reflection/criticism paragraph) prior to class, an assignment which would serve to further solidify the students understanding of Richards in comparison to the many other authors discussed and encourage the formation of questions while reading.",
                "Strengths  great spread of reading, great two-part structure, great essay assignments, great discussion leading by Prof North\r\nWeaknesses  potentially too much reading/lacking direction in what to read for (maybe add blogposts and reading guides?)",
                "This course is meant to be an overview of liberal and Marxist literary and arts criticism. It was a bit more haphazard than that, because not all students had the same knowledge of 20th C intellectual history. This made it difficult to have productive discussions in class. The syllabus was also a bit disjointedit seems difficult to provide a coherent overview of all of 20th C literary criticism in an undergraduate course."

                "Yes, this class is wonderful and it provides a really strong grounding for the English major. It asks a lot of existential, helpful questions that I found personally helpful to my study of English.",
                "Yes. Its syllabus is unique, and the questions on which it focuses are not addressed in other similar courses. It is well-taught, well-designed, and well-assessed, and so long as you are willingly to engage deeply and genuinely with the courses large, central questions, taking it is an incredibly rewarding experience. I would recommend it to anyone in the humanities or social sciences with an interest in theory.",
                "Yes! I would recommend the class to any student who is interested in Communist and/or Liberal theory in the context of the arts. The course teaches Communist texts in particular that I doubt are taught in any other course, and treats both Communism and Liberalism with equal scrutiny, attention, and fairness. The professor is deeply engaging, so committed to his students and his class, and willing to put in any work necessary to get discussion off its feet or help you write a good, well-considered essay.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you happen to be an English and Philosophy double major. Otherwise, this was the worst class I have taken in the English Department, and not because of the course material. But the class was structured in such a way that unless you were able to follow every thread of the conversation in the seminar, there was very little benefit to taking this course at all. Please take a deep look at the syllabus before registering for this course; if you can find innate value in the readings (I occasionally did) this course might be of value to you.",
                "I'd recommend this to other English majors.",
                "This is a good class to take if you have a very specific idea of what you hope to get out of it. In order to really benefit from this class, you have to be very self directed and spend a lot of time outside of class thinking about the class. It's interesting, but you can't be in it casually.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in reading theory. While some of the texts (Gramsci) are harder than others, time in class is helpful. Now when I look back on some of the readings that made no sense to me before, I find that I understand them more.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in criticism and literary theory.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. In full honesty, I entered this course rather nervously, given both my lack of exposure to marxist critiques and my introversion while speaking in small seminars. Thus, to any students interested in taking this course, I would say that it is absolutely okay to enter with limited exposure to both the perspectives discussed and the literary devices employed throughout these perspectives. This course beautifully helped me to grow in confidence by forcing me out of my comfort zone, and I am grateful for the ways in which Professor North and the other students alike encouraged one another to openly grapple with importantthough sometimes tenseabstract concepts.",
                "Yes! Prof North was amazing, my classmates were amazing, and I feel like I have a completely new body of knowledge to use in future work.",
                "This course focuses a lot on political theory, in part to make sure we understand each work that we talk about. So if you are interested in learning more about Marxism and Liberalism and how the two relate, go for it. It is also nice that we read different thinkers every week so if one thinker isn't your favorite, you can move past them quickly. This does however make writing the final paper slightly trickier just because you have a lot of source material to choose from rather than one central text. Just requires thinking ahead.",
                "I wouldnt. I think the readings are too difficult for someone who is new to intellectual history or criticism. But, conversely, have some experience makes class discussion frustrating. This is more the problem of the syllabus not being suited towards undergraduates, even seniors. I think the English major doesnt provide enough preparation for a course at this level."
