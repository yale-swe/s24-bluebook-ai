Also it was a little awkward to find the right time to jump in (still am not sure whether we could just hop into the discussion or if we should have raised our hands). \r\n\r\nThe format of the weekly homeworks (taking notes on the readings and submitting those notes) was nice!",
                "This course is super engaging and interesting! Prof. Kockelman is extremely knowledgable on all these topics and reading and he really lets you explore the ideas! The only maybe weakness of the class, which I would argue is not a weakness but something that often happens in college, is that you don't receive grades throughout the semester so you can't really gauge how well you're doing."

Though at times it definitely waxed a little more philosophical and it was sometimes hard to see the practical relevance of a topic. Also the vast majority of readings were by old white men and it really reflected in the content of the readings sometimes.",
