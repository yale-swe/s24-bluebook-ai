                "The strengths of this course are the pre-class videos and quizzes. Many students prefer these than the readings, and they're a great way to prepare for lectures and problem sets. A weakness of this course was the office hours. It got way too crowded for only two TAs, and I would never have time to answer any questions I had.",
                "The course was well-organized with clear instructions and multiple resources to help studying. For learning, we had three resources: pre-recorded lectures, the textbook, and the actual class. For psets, we had peer tutors office hours an instructors office hours. I like the fact that I got to pick among various resources to figure out the most effective way to learn for myself. I also appreciate the fact that we had a one-page formula sheet for each exam (I think they started it this year). They were life-saving!\r\nI personally did not find the pre-class quizzes very meaningful. I really dont see the point of having them at all. I also think the psets deserve more weight in the final grade. I spend so much time and put so much effort into them  they really deserve more than 10%.\r\nReview sessions before midterms and finals are held by different people and extremely helpful, especially the review session before the final exam, which really helped me zoom out and see the big picture of the course. It was striking to see the parallel between 2D and 3D theorems  how the fundamental ideas stay the same as you travel across different dimensions. I truly think math is beautiful after my final review (I say this as a humanities major).",
                "This course does a great job of organizing its material and allowing for different ways to learn. I love the videos on canvas and the extra ximera problems. The only weakness that I can see is the objective high difficulty of the material but there is not a lot to be done about that. I think the way the course is organized makes it as easy as possible to learn the material.",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe pre-class videos are helpful in aiding comprehension and the review sessions tied the material together nicely.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe setup of this course just doesn't work well. I understand it's difficult to have lecture-style math courses, so maybe that's not a strong alternative, but the small sections aren't helpful. The TA's simply work problems the entire class and can't explain the material well, and each TA creates different techniques and adds their own problems to the section so the discrepancy of understanding between the students in one section and those in another is vast.",
                "Strengths: Problem sets, Practice exams, Extra help\r\nWeaknesses: Instructors, Problem difficulty",
                "I think that the course is structured well - there is a lot of helpful supplemental material. I think they could improve by giving us even more challenging practice problems.",
                "The videos, peer tutors, and instructors work well to explain the material of the course, given how fast-paced it is. However, the structure of the course is a bit hectic as it feels more like running from topic to topic rather than building off each one. Also, it was a bit hard to focus on studying for exams while also learning new material at the same time.",
                "The strength is that there is a lot of practice and that there are excellent videos that cover all the content. I think the in class instruction can be a little more structured.",
                "I think the greatest weakness of the course is how the material which is expected of the students to know is presented and tested. The fact that we are allowed to have a notesheet SHOULD mean that our class would focus on conceptual understanding and test for conceptual understanding (like questions on physical phenomena) as opposed to just writing in answers to questions that require the bare minimum of comprehension. For me, completing the exams feels like a matching-the-dots game. As long as I catch the keywords, I can turn to my notesheet and just follow the steps written there. All you need is reading comprehension. While it is true that the class does provide the OPPORTUNITY to understand the concepts of the class in a more grounded way, that's not the same thing as having the EXPECTATION that students grasp these concepts. \r\n\r\nI also didn't really feel the need to attend any lectures because they just seemed to repeat what the videos already taught me, which were technically already mandatory.",
                "The course effectively teaches the basic concepts necessary to do the various problems and techniques of multivariable calculusand provides practice resources and problems to build on that knowledge. However, for the quizzes and the problem sets, there are no solutions to explain your mistakes.",
                "The videos the course provides were extremely useful in my journey to understanding the material. However, I very rarely was given the opportunity to work with my peers. I think it would be beneficial to incorporate some activities that would combat that weakness (ie. group practice problems).",
                "Strengths: the videos and problem sets were helpful for learning. Weaknesses: the class itself was sort of boring."

Whether you like math or not, you will walk away with some solid knowledge. I would not recommend if you love proofs, since this class is all about calculation. Manual labor, not much thinking!",

But otherwise, I think there are major aspects of the course that are severely lacking, and would recommend students avoid it if they could obtain the credit/understanding elsewhere.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Not only is multivariable calculus important for most STEM students to learn, it also involves simple concepts that any student can understand, especially if they have previously taken single-variable calculus.",

                "Not really.  Honestly, the class was not as engaging as other math classes I've taken.  I do love math, but this class dulled my interest a bit."
