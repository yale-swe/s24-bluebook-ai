                "Garsten's H&P class provided us with an excellent balance of examining specific historical figures and commenting on broad themes that capture human comportments and tendencies throughout the span of time. We learned to tackle big questions step-by-step because our professor's strategy was to launch us into the discussion with a general query. We were then motivated to look back into the text to support our findings, but also permitted ourselves to stray into digressions. Moving back and forth between deep reflection, perspicacious textual analysis, and engaging class conversations was very useful for building a historical and political foundation.",
                "How to think more deeply and critically with text.",
                "I learned how to think critically about texts and the deeper questions within them.",
                "Critical reading of history, essay writing skills, etc.",
                "Professor Garsten gives excellent feedback on papers and in discussions on how to improve your writing and thought in the course. Every class was filled with fascinating insights into the material and interesting conversations that connected what we were learning to bigger-picture topics and relevant issues for our time, making studying ancient works like Thucydides and Aristotle especially engaging. I actively looked forward to section meetings as I knew Professor Garsten would always come with engaging ideas and allow us to really participate constructively. The lectures were also generally thought-provoking and insightful.",
                "I developed the ability to zoom into a text and perform a close reading, but at the same time, consider big questions, such as \"can morality exist outside of God?\" I learned to read large amounts of material at once and extract value from them. I learned to write an argumentative college paper clearly and concisely.",
                "I learned to think critically about a diverse array of accounts about history and politics. In addition, I gained writing skills that helped me explore various topics during my papers.",
                "This course pushed my analytical writing into a new sphere of thought; the material was relatively new to me, and challenged me to think critically about the significance of the political philosophy and histories we were reading. Although history and politics are two vastly different subjects, it was fascinating to examine how the two areas cohere and intertwine.",
                "I learned to ask the big questions. For example, what is justice? What is the best form of government? We try to find answers by meditating on the wisdom of former greats - Plato, Aristotle, Thucydides, Augustine, Aquinas, and more. This course challenged my traditional ideas of what works best in politics and government, and I daresay it would do the same for almost any Yale student.",
                "I learned a huge amount in this course. Beyond attaining basic knowledge about the political theorists whose work we read, I learned to think more broadly about the work and its significance--to ask questions that reached beyond the text itself. I learned to balance a deep dive into the text and a pulling back to examine historical significance.",
                "Professor Garsten begins sessions with 'big questions' - on the best form of government, the psychology of power, on religion and empire. The seminar discussions were extremely stimulating for me just to listen to, and their success is largely attributed in my opinion to Professor Garsten's opening questions and the interesting things they call to mind.",
                "- A deeper appreciation for and interest in political thought\r\n- A broad knowledge of historical and political thought in classical and Medieval Western civilization\r\n- A nuanced understanding of the construction of the \"West\" and its problems\r\n- An understanding of the extent to which DS, and indeed all academic study, benefits from interdisciplinary engagement\r\n- Better discussion skills\r\n- An increased ability to read quickly",
                "H&P with Professor Garsten was an incredible introduction to some of the most influential texts and thinkers throughout history. I learned how to read complex works extremely carefully, discuss said works in seminars, and form nuanced opinions on them through the three prescribed essays and final exam. Taking Professor Garsten's class has changed the way I think about essay writing. He encouraged us to think of essays as an opportunity to work through various solutions to a puzzle rather than a mechanism for persuading readers in one specific direction."

            "comments": [
                "The course is not afraid to challenge ideas that are regarded as widely accepted in the contemporary United States. The majority of the authors we read lambasted democracy, which I was totally not expecting when I entered the course. The ability to speak openly about this type of idea and try to get at the root of the author's perspective was enlightening. The syllabus was incredibly well structured for the time frame we had while there were certain jumps in historical continuity, the texts flowed together nicely and the introduction of the Bible at the beginning of the year before transitioning to the Greeks and Romans was an appreciated component of the course. \r\nThe only weakness of the course was when a lecture spent too much time dwelling on a summary of the text instead of connecting it to other works or drawing a decisive conclusion.",
                "Strengths: great introduction to the Western canon, prompted thought\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of discussions were just people repeating one another",
                "One of the great strengths was the fascinating discussions. I just wish there was more help on writing improvement.",
                "Strengths: everything\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The course overall does an excellent job of accomplishing its purpose of furthering your writing and giving you an overview of Historical and Political Thought in the Western tradition. My main complaint is that we do not spend enough time on some material (just two crammed weeks at the end of the semester on the Middle Ages), but this is largely unavoidable given how much this survey course has to cover. I would tweak the curriculum a bit to spend slightly less time on The Republic. Also, there is a TON of reading to do for the course which some people might want to avoid. You can get around doing a good amount of it, but I recommend doing as much as possible to get as much as you can out of the class. If you trust yourself to do most of the reading and show up, you will get a lot out of DS generally and especially H&P.",
                "Seminar sections facilitated by Professor Garsten were incredibly enriching since he asked intellectually stimulating questions and encouraged us to consider various (sometime conflicting) interpretations of the text. As a result, this course helped me grow as a writer and thinker. I also enjoyed the diverse array of authors that we read this year. This allowed me to gain greater knowledge about the western canon through the lens of history and politics.\r\nThe only weakness is that I wish we had more time to spend on each text. This would allow us to discover more about each text and discuss more sections that we were assigned to read.",
                "I think the curriculum is a little disorganized, in terms of the specific materials we read being a mix of philosophy and history (although it is easy to see the connection between the works in the contexts they were written in). However, the strengths of this course lie in the ways the examination and discussions of these texts enable students to understand greater concepts like justice, knowledge, and power in the context of organized society and government.",
                "Strengths: very broad coverage of ancient political thought in the Greek and Roman eras. Acquaints you with foundational ideas that are still highly relevant to politics today. Teaches you to read efficiently but also engage with the reading's challenging sections. Teaches you to write well!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the curriculum is focused on western thought, but bringing in just a bit of wisdom from places like China, Japan, or India could add a lot of value. Suggestion has been fielded, and I get the sense that changes in curriculum could gradually happen in the future.",
                "This class is phenomenal. The readings can at times be overwhelming, but the material is fascinating, and Bryan Garsten does a great job leading discussions. He sees H&P (and DS as a whole) as one of the only times in life you get to ask the really hard questions---eg. what is the best form of government? What distinguishes a good leader from a bad one? How can we apply historical evidence to modern event?-- and expect an answer.",
                "A strength of this course was its breadth (the weakness that goes hand-in-hand, of course, is the lack of depth in each text). Professor Garsten, however, did a good job of making sure we extracted the most from each text",
                "The classroom discussions Professor Garsten led and his insightful comments on DS papers were what made the class interesting - he has a unique, ponderous approach to history and politics that he inculcated in us over the semester and for this I am quite thankful!",
                "Strengths: Prof. Garsten (!!), pre-disciplinary nature of subject, profundity of texts, classmates\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: vague instruction on how to write a paper that feels at once literary, philosophical, historical, and political",
                "Strengths: the discussions, the essay feedback was really detailed, the books\r\nWeaknesses: I think some of the readings could be cut down (especially the latter parts of Herodotus, for example) since DS already has so much reading, and I think (and this goes for all of DS) students should receive more support throughout the process of writing their first essays."

                "Yes - the course fuses political theory, international relations, and history in a way that touches on many students' interests and bridges over to the philosophy curriculum as well. Reading Plato's Republic with a philosophic approach on the side was fascinating and it never felt like we were confined to one discipline in this class.",
                "I think this was a good intro to Western thought, but don't think the discussions were that great. The conversations we had weren't very grounded in the text, and could easily have happened in a dining hall (especially at Yale, where everyone is so interested in these topics).",
                "Yes, Garsten is a fantastic professor and the discussions you have in class will stick with you.",
                "Absolutely! By the time the course concludes, you will have a much better grasp of ancient Greek/Roman history. You will also have developed the skill of reading history critically. Do it!--It's worth it!",
                "Absolutely. H&P was my favorite course this semester and serves as a great introduction to political philosophy with high level professors.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Besides improving the general skills mentioned above, it provides foundation for understanding how ideas and events created the society we know today. The material covered is timeless. I can look at current events in the news today and still link them back to the big questions we consider in class.",
                "Yes - especially if you have Professor Garsten!",
                "I would recommend this course to other students if they have a genuine interest in the subject matter, and will be able to make time to work with the readings outside of class. I had an excellent time, and I really enjoyed discussing the complex issues these texts with peers who were equally interested in the topics we discussed.",
                "For sure! Take this course if you want to think hard about the broad themes of history. The class format is very dynamic, and you'll learn from classmates as well as professor. They'll challenge you on your ideas, and you'll do the same for them. It's a very intellectual atmosphere, and everyone's generally eager to contribute. As someone who's interested in history and politics, this course was basically perfect for me. Even if you're not sure about history or politics, I say still give it a chance and see if this course sparks your interest! Be ready to read a lot though - you may have to spend a decent chunk of each weekend on DS readings. At the same time, the readings themselves are well worth your time.",
                "Yes. I have a much better understanding of the histories behind our conceptions/definitions of governments, equality, freedom, etc.",
                "Yes, if you can keep up with long and challenging readings! In return you will be able to think - a lot - so I'd say it's worth it.",
                "Absolutely. Prof. Garsten is quietly heroic. Also, I am a huge fan of DS as a whole for reasons that are beyond my articulation capabilities.",
                "Definitely! DS has a reputation for being too much work (which is sometimes true), but the authors and the community of students that come with DS makes all of it worth it. It's so fun to be able to talk about the books outside of class and bounce ideas off of each other before writing essays. The books we read are genuinely interesting and have put a lot of modern ideas into context for me. If you're on the fence about DS, please shop it and see if you enjoy it."
