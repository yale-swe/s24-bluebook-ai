The course started with some relatively simple material and we were able to develop into the more difficult material at a great pace. I never felt like anything was rushed. The professor did a great job of tying each and every concept we learned into whatever new thing we were learning. I also like that this was an alternative to MATH 120. I gained some really practical experience with the concepts we were learning and it ended up being a great class for me.",

It built upon concepts covered in previous math classes such as differentiation and integration, but then applied to a multivariable realm. Several connections were made to intro-level physics such as flux and vector fields.",

                "more resources and office hours would make this course better, but other than that the strengths are that there is only one midterm, and both the midterm and final are open notes",
                "Strengths:\r\nCourse was very low-stress. Exams were open note, which allowed us to focus more on problem-solving than on rote memorization of formulas. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nLectures were a little unengaging. I also did not enjoy course instruction being done on a blackboard (which was often hard to read). I would prefer if the course was taught through pre-made lecture slides or examples written out on an iPad projected to the screen. There were also very limited office hours.",
                "The biggest strength is the open-note nature of the course. We are encouraged to work together and use our resources with no penalty. One weakness is that the content was often confusing to me in lectures, but that could just be a personal issue of comprehension.",
                "Strengths: the office hours were extremely helpful, the professor was extremely receptive to feedback about the lectures, twice a week was a great time frame, we were often encouraged to solve the problems for ourselves by the professor which helped us develop our intuition for the concepts\r\nweakness: the lecture notes could definitely be improved (they weren't always entirely clear), more practice problems could be given",
                "It was very helpful to have multiple sessions of office hours spread out throughout the week. I think it was also very helpful that the lecture notes were posted because that made it easy to go back and review. I think the lectures themselves would sometimes be a little bit hard for me to follow in the sense that I felt I would often have to refer to other sources to fully understand concepts.",
                "It's a good course already.",
                "I think the concept of this class was good--having a multivariable calculus class centered on applications instead of purely theory. But the class was not especially engaging and the format of one midterm and one final left fewer opportunities for reinforcing knowledge--perhaps more, shorter assignments would be better. I also felt that compared with other math or physics classes, there was less support--fewer office hours and review sessions.",
                "Strengths: The class discussed several important topics in a way that progressed naturally. Problem Sets are built upon content covered in class, allowing the content to be applied and not just simply put out. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture notes were hard to read\/follow at times. Many steps (and explanations) were skipped or not explained which made them difficult to comprehend. Besides the time spent processing the content, I needed to spend time to just understand what was being said intuitively. To improve this, notes could be written more in-depth. (This does not mean just mean more derivations, but just focusing on the logic\/intuition behind each step). In addition to this, at times, there was an in-balance between making sense of equations and applying them to examples. At the beginning of the class, there was a lot of time spent on just deriving equations which made it difficult to intuitively understand them or see how they worked in equations. Although as we progressed, there was less time spent on derivations and more on examples, it resulted in there being close to no time spent on intuitively making sense of what the equations mean.",

                "Could use better organization",
                "I think it needs 2 midterms not just 1",
