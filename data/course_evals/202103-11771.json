The topics discussed also were extremely relevant for constructing good writing, and the plenary lectures were also fantastic. The readings were amazing and none of them were ever boring.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None for the course, but I wish we had more time to delve into each style more.",

I would say it could be more organized, but this never affected anyone negatively.",
                "Sometimes the deadlines were announced a little late, but Prof Green was also very open and understanding about extensions!",

You become such a better writer and you really learn how to write a story, poems, and a play. You can literally feel yourself improving with each exercise and unit, so it is a very rewarding class. All the stories are also so interesting, so it doesn't feel like work at all.",

                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The beauty of ENGL 123 is that it allows you to try your hand in multiple genres, and it really lets you discover what kind of writing you enjoy the most. You might go into the course because of the fiction unit, and come out learning that you want to be a playwright. I also really enjoyed the workshop aspect of the course, and the feedback I received from my peers was great.",
                "Absolutely, especially with Professor Green. It is well worth the time spent, not to hard to make your schedule unbearable, and really grows your writing skills.",
                "YES! You will love creative writing after this class! I didn't realize how much I would love poetry and drama!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who is interested in the creative writing path.",
                "Yes, definitely!",
                "Yes! This course is phenomenal. You do a lot of writing in a short amount of time but by the end, you have a final portfolio you can be proud of and a lot of feedback on your writing."
