                "Maybe it's due to the fact that we had such a small class this year (less than 10 students), but I truly think one of the strengths was the class size. It allowed us to get close and build rapport, which facilitated the partner presentations.\r\nI also loved the guest speakers that Professor Pepi invited. We read their work and had time in class to prepare questions before meeting them, and the experience was really rewarding as we even had access to chapters of work that had yet to be published.\r\nI think the only weakness is that we didn't get to talk about the sci-fi films as much as I wanted to. This was less the fault of the instructor, and more an issue with scheduling, as that discussion was saved for the last day of class."

She also created an amazing syllabus, where the readings are able to interact with each other. Our class dynamic fit very well, and even in a Zoom format, I felt so welcomed. The course is honestly life-changing and is essential for anyone studying the Middle East.",
                "YES! I think there are a lot of misconceptions about the MENA region, and this class really opened my mind, arguing that singular histories are a political project to maintain power structures. While the reading load is intense, the course is structured to make it very manageable, and the writing assignments serve to allow us space to critically flush out ideas, rather than regurgitate summaries. It was probably my favorite class this semester. I wish it was cross-listed as an ER&M course; the syllabus matches well with major themes in the ER&M department!"
