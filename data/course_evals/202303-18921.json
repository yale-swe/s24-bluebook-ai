                "Learned many topics within mechanics far beyond the AP Mechanics C material. Definitely became a better physics problem solver with the weekly PSETs containing many challenging problems. Learned how to better approach different problems.",

While I did develop my problem-solving skills, the course taught me the process of proving and possibly discovering theorems more. The latter part is arguably the more valuable part of this course.",

            "comments": [
                "It's hard... I took AP Physics C in high school so I thought I was ready for this class. I think PHYS 200 is too familiar for me and PHYS 260 is too hard. Prof. Harris is great at explaining things but it's hard to keep up.",
                "The biggest weakness of this course is that lectures are not recorded - if you miss a class you're behind the entire semester and it gets very difficult to understand the material on your own.",
                "Strengths were that it lived up to its name of being an intensive course. It embraced that messy math or physics that other classes probably would've handwaved away, which is good, and it really did feel like I was learning more about how we formulate physics on top of just learning how to use it to solve problems. Weaknesses were that classes could be overwhelming sometimes, especially with Jack Harris never solving problems out on the board and just having avalanches of typeset math on his slides instead. Exams also felt disconnected from the actual content, as many of them relied on problem solving experience and mathematical tricks instead of the ground-up derivations we were doing in class.",
                "The many, many office hours offered by this course were extremely useful in helping me catch everything that was being thrown at us throughout the semester. The difficulty of this class was actually a blessing in that it made us get together to knock out the problem sets, which was great for making friends and for eventually studying in groups for the exams.",
                "Strengths: the material and slides were most excellent. In particular, I enjoyed Prof Harris's way of inquisitively explaining things. It felt like he was walking us through the reasoning used to derive the equations, rather than simply throwing the equations at us and expecting us to memorize them. Many of my previous instructors (both at Yale and elsewhere) would do well to emulate his style.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses and ways to improve: I legitimately can't think of any.",
                "I think that the preparation for the midterms can be improved and the course is very challenging but my knowledge of how to deal with that has also greatly improved.",
                "I think the strength of the course is it is intellectually challenging and the topics are arranged in a good order. However, I think it could be improved if some of the topics we covered in homework/exams was more physics concept based and less of just mathematics problems phrased with physics concepts.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The content is good and it is quite a solid and fun introductory physics course, the problem sets are also good practice of the things we learned in class\r\n- The instructor explains how theorems come about (e.g. their basic assumptions and their derivation)\r\n- The support for this course is quite good (e.g. the TA office hours)\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- This course is pretty good actually",
                "Strengths: Lectures were engaging and interesting; I gained a different understanding of mechanics and greater intuition of core topics\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures felt a bit all over the place at times in terms of pacing and how long we would spend on things; sometimes problems that we focused on seemed very esoteric and exams tended to be centered around those specific problems and examples we worked through in class rather than testing the concepts we were learning more broadly. Additionally, practice problems provided before the exams were very disconnected from the actual exam content.",
                "I think the main strength of the course might also be the biggest drawback for some. This course is made as a challenge and it expects a lot of knowledge beforehand. However, it is also really fun and the lectures by Prof. Harris were always something to look forward to.",
                "The course was extremely well-taught. Dr. Harris explained topics in a very deep and ground-up way. The homework and exam problems were usually very interesting. The class was conceptually challenging but very manageable with sufficient effort, due to Dr. Harris's awesome teaching skills. Dr. Harris allowed a lot of time for questions from students during class and always gave deep and helpful answers. He also clearly cared a lot about helping students learn and about helping students keep their confidence when they encountered challenges. Furthermore, while I did not attend TA or ULA office hours often, I heard from other students that office hours were great and the TAs and ULAs were wonderful."

            "comments": [
                "I mean if you're a physics major and did well with AP Physics C in high school, sure. Be ready for it to be challenging and do not take it with a high workload semester.",
                "Be very careful before you take this course. You need to do multivariable calculus BEFORE taking 260. If you take it as a co-requisite, you're in for a lot of pain. The PSETs for this course and incredibly difficult, and can take upwards of 12 hours a week. The exams are also tough, and in general the course material is taught at a very high level, with a lot of stuff left for students to read and do on their own. Unless you're sure, 99% of the time you should take 200 instead.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you're ready for the workload the class is genuinely enjoyable. There are philosophical discussions on physics, extremely cool concepts in special relativity, and a lot of general learning you can only get at 260. Professor harris is a great teacher, and the small class size made the learning environment really really fun. If you can take this C/d/fail, that would be the best option.",
                "Yes - it will help you understand the mathematics behind physics at a much deeper level.",
                "For most prospective physics majors, there's really no reason to take this over PHYS 200: 200 is much easier to follow, lighter workload, easier exams, easier grade, and provides all of the same practical benefits as 260. However, if you think you might have the math chops, then there is definitely an extra layer of understanding to be gained from this class, as well as a higher tolerance for weird and annoying problems.",
                "Yes, but only if you _really_ want to do a lot of physics. This class appealed to me because I'm a physics major, I already did what I felt was a lot of physics (especially intro physics) in high school (3 AP classes and some competition stuff) and because this semester I took a lot of non-STEM classes, so I figured taking this class meant I'd be redoing less introductory physics and it would take up more of my time compared to other subjects. This class definitely worked for all of that. That said, I couldn't see someone that doesn't have a similar thought process as me getting much out of this class.",
                "Be cautious incoming first-years! Students in this class are among the best physics first-years, and the course is tailored to that level.",
                "Yes - with a few caveats.\r\n\r\nFirst, I would only recommend this course to people who've taken physics in the past. Although you do learn many of the concepts from the ground up, I would say it's somewhat difficult to apply them to problems unless you have experience with how a system behaves on a bigger-picture, more simplified scale, and consequently what assumptions you can make. Because I found myself learning familiar concepts with greater detail and rigor in this course, I'd imagine it would be easy to get \"lost in the weeds\" of the math and derivations for someone seeing these for the first time. Still, learning where formulas and equations came from and how they could be generalized to different situations was very illuminating and worthwhile for my understanding of physics.\r\n\r\nSecond, you should have a solid calculus foundation to at least Calc 2. It's definitely doable to take this concurrently with Calc 3, because div/grad/curl only show up for certain computations, but you should understand infinitesimals, limits, and where derivatives/integrals come from, not just how to do them. It also helps to know some differential equations (second order in particular), but that can be picked up throughout the course.\r\n\r\nThird, if you don't want to major in physics, or are very confident in your skills, this class might be a much larger workload than it's worth. Still, I would enroll in this class if you're interested and determine whether or not to switch to PHYS 200 or PHYS 180 as it progresses. In general, talk to previous students, go to office hours, and work with your peers to make a judgement for yourself.",
                "Absolutely. Not only is the teaching incredibly clear and well done, but the concepts presented are incredibly interesting and fun to learn. Furthermore, office hours is super helpful, and the other physics students are very fun to interact with.",
                "Would strongly recommend starting with this course if considering a physics major and have the proper prereqs i.e. taken AP Mech C, and have some basics ideas of multivariable calculus. It is definitely possible to complete without having taken a standard multi class, as long you take the time to self study some of the basics such as line integrals and triple integrals. This class is very enriching if you only took a AP Mech C class in high school as it will cover many different topics that you will have never seen.",
                "I would only recommend this course to a student with a very strong background in physics (at least AP mechanics level). The course is great, and covers a lot of interesting topics in depth, but if you're struggling to learn the foundational material it won't be productive or fun.",
                "I would if they are a physics major but not otherwise.",
                "I would recommend this course if you have a strong mathematical background, you are passionate about physics, and want to dedicate more time to learning and studying for this class. Otherwise, if you don't feel like physics is your priority, I would recommend taking a different intro physics sequence because you cover the same topics but the course is much less overwhelming.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any person interested in physics who has a relative solid background of physics and math in high school. It treats physics topics we've seen in high school and before in a relatively mathematically rigorous way, and the deeper understanding of the logic of physics you eventually get is very enlightening and satisfying. The discoveries and derivations are also very interesting and fun to do more of yourself. So, definitely recommended as an introductory physics course.",
                "It greatly depends on the student and what they hope to get out of this course. If you are taking another difficult course this semester, I would highly recommend taking 200, as this class requires a great deal of time and engagement to succeed, especially if you aren't coming in with as much confidence in your physics abilities. It is a very intellectually rewarding class and builds up physics in a different way than traditionally taught; I think the decision to take this class ultimately depends on how much you care about your grade vs your desire to be challenged.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone who has taken the full Intro Physics sequence but doesn't have the math background to do courses like PHYS 400 off the bat. This course works well when taken together with MATH 120 - but it's partly because you will encounter many concepts in PHYS 260 before you encounter them in MATH 120 and so you'll kind of be forced to be ahead for math a bit.",
                "Absolutely! I would recommend this course to all students who have fun learning conceptually challenging material, who love to understand things deeply,  and who seek to gain a strong understanding of how physicists model the world around us using math - regardless of whether they are physics majors! I am not a physics major, and I loved this course. It changed the way I think about the world around me and I already see a ton of applications of what I've learned in things I'm exploring now. I am someone who really wants to understand everything as deeply and thoroughly as possible (i.e. not just formulas that you apply as needed), and if you're like this too and think physics is cool and useful, you should take this course!"
