                "Strengths were the quizzes which allowed us to do less p-sets and also ensured that we were constantly up to date with the material.",
                "A strength of this course was that real life examples were incorporated into lectures, tying the concepts to them. A weakness was that some of the lecture material seemed to have little relevance to the tested material, making it difficult to discern how to best prepare for assignments. Also certain details of concepts were glossed over and not gone over thoroughly, making revision more challenging.",
                "The strength of this course were the TFs and all the help they were able to offer whenever you needed it. The biggest weakness of this course was the professor. Although he is very accomplished and smart, he was not able to convey the concepts in a convoluted manner and that really hindered my understanding of macroeconomics. It felt like I could go to discussion sections alone, and I would get the same material, if not more, if I went to lectures as well. If the professor spent more time talking about the concepts rather than what he found interesting about the concepts, this would have been a much better class.",
                "Strengths: assignments never felt unfair or overwhelming, and I appreciated the lighter workload throughout the semester for an econ class\r\nWeak: lack of resources to practice numerical problems that show up on exams",
                "Strengths: Readings and topics were well-organized in terms of students knew what they needed to read and prepare for each lecture. Psets and quizzes encouraged regular learning. \r\nWeaknesses: There was an extreme mis-match between material that was covered in lecture and material that was covered in section, and on psets/quizzes. Lectures and sections were not sufficient to prepare students for the level of assessment that was expected. Answer keys, and lecture slides (from section) were withheld from students, making learning very difficult.",
                "Every single aspect of this course was a weakness, but I'll name a few. Lectures had nothing to do with homework. The homework assignments were poorly written. The lectures differed greatly from the (admittedly) good textbook in a lot of areas. The lectures did not prepare you for the quizzes ( which were terrible too!), let alone the midterm or final. It was disorganized in every way you could be disorganized. We moved from a nice big room in WLH to a small cramped room in Dunham for no reason. Accommodations were hard to arrange. The quizzes were very very very bad. Super difficult, almost completely unrelated to the lectures, and far far too long for 20 minutes. \r\n\r\nBy the half-way point, having an average of 70% put you in the A-range. Not because it was hard material. It was just terribly ran.",
                "Really standard course, so hard to make it interesting, but Prof. Nordhaus was quite unhelpful with regards to making material accessible or telling us what would be on the PSETs and quizzes. In fact, there was so much ambiguity in some of the tests that people lost points for interpretation instead of knowledge.",
                "weaknesses - the professor just ranted about his own research the entire time",
                "Strengths: The Teaching Fellows, who did an amazing job creating study guides, hosting review sessions, and answering questions. \r\nWeaknesses: The lack of organization in this class impeded my ability to learn- there was only one peer tutor and oftentimes the lectures were completely different from the textbook, so if I didn't understand a topic, it was incredibly hard to find the information I needed. It was also unclear which of the content would be examinable, which caused unnecessary stress. I think that this course needs a Course Director. There were also way too many assessments- the quizzes should be replaced by problem sets.",
                "Most of the valuable material was taught in section not the actual class",
                "Strength were some of the TFs, super helpful. Weaknesses were some of the lectures that fell flat. But most of it was really interesting, you can tell Nordhaus knows what hes talking about",
                "The quizzes were often more time consuming to study for than doing psets and could cause high stress",
                "This course is not taught well and is extremely hard to follow. The professor can improve the course by teaching in a more engaging way and posting slides before class starts.",
                "weaknesses:\r\n    - answer keys to psets and solutions seem like they were written by someone who doesnt actually know whats being taught, often references material I had never seen in class\r\n    - literally no feedback on most assignments, just a grade and eventually an answer key would be posted\r\n    - on par with the general theme of the course, which is poor organization, communication, and a disconnect between class, psets, and the textbook",
                "weaknesses: much of the learning had to come from section, office hours, and outside studying; lectures werent always clear and often there were discrepancies between textbook and lecture information\r\n\r\nstrengths: responsive and reliable TFs",
                "Strengths: Nordhaus is good at making the lectures applicable and drawing on his real world experience. PSETs offered good practice of analyzing real world data.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course was not facilitated to encourage learning. There were no practice problems with solutions posted, the notation used was not consistent across lecture, section, and the textbook. How to approach solving the problems on PSETs often was not taught/never discussed. Lectures were not recorded and slides were not posted until days after lectures occurred. The combination of these things made the course inaccessible and the material covered harder to grasp.",
                "I felt like I never really knew what material would be on quizzes and tests. The class covers a lot of material but very little of it is relevant.",
                "I would recommend making section notes and practice problem solutions available to everyone.",
                "strengths\r\n- plenty of office hours and review sessions\r\n- use of ed\r\n- TAs open for email help w psets\r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n- lectures not super duper helpful\r\n- textbook a bit of a burden to deal w (especially since notation for certain equations differed between class and textbook, making things confusing)\r\n- would have loved to get answers to practice problems released to prep or final exam",
                "The course could benefit from clearer lectures - in terms of standardizing notation, doing full derivations of equations, explaining the effects of certain shocks in a particular model etc. However, the TFs are excellent and will help you get up to speed on everything. I particularly appreciated their review sessions and compilation of practice problems.",
                "Strengths are that studying for the quizzes help you review the content throughout the year so you don't feel like you have to cram TOO much when you're studying for the midterm/final, lots of weight is put on PSETs and quizzes so it's OK if you make a few mistakes on the midterm/final, and that it's honestly really cool to be learning from a Nobel prize winner. Weaknesses are that the course feels a little disorganized at times (slides sharing incorrect formulas, consistent discrepancies between textbook and lectures, lecture slides not being posted), the exams are difficult, and PSET/quiz/exam questions can be vaguely worded.",
                "No feedback on most psets and assignments and lack of clarity on what will be on quizzes and midterms. No practice material for exams.",
                "I have many serious reservations about how this course was taught. It felt like the result of the principle of a curved class taken to the extreme. Rather than focusing on teaching us valuable concepts, concepts seemed to be intentionally kept vague and exams seemed to focus on algebraic minutiae in order to pit students against each other so that a clear (though extremely arbitrary) class ranking could emerge. Sections slides not shared on canvas-making reviewing course material unnecessarily difficult- simplistic lectures with cryptic slides and then Psets, Quizzes, and Exams that delved into minutiae whose relevance I seriously struggled to appreciate. I am left seriously disappointed by this class; Yale's economic department should reconsider how this class is taught.",
                "I don't think the course had any strengths that stood out to me. It was overall a fairly standard lecture course supported by discussion sections with problem sets and quizzes, a midterm, and a final exam. In my opinion, the biggest weakness of the course was Prof. Nordhaus's teaching style. While I recognize that he is certainly an extremely knowledgeable expert in the field (Nobel prize winner and all), I did not really like his lecture style. Lectures were somewhat disorganized, and it felt rather difficult to figure out which content was important to remember and which content was simply contextualization for our own interest. It was also somewhat frustrating that, oftentimes, the lectures, sections, textbook, and readings covered similar topics in different ways, and it was sometimes difficult to parse which methods we should use on quizzes/exams. The professor's slides also frequently had typos that often made content more confusing. Finally, this is the only lecture course I've taken at Yale that had small but significant quizzes between the main exams. I think these quizzes made sure we learned the content in smaller chunks, which did help when reviewing for the midterm/final, but I think many students found them very difficult, and it was sometimes frustrating when we had a quiz without having gotten any practice on a PSET yet.",
                "Strength of this course were the TAs who were wonderful at walking us through the material and explaining it all to us. Weaknesses were that the course evaluations (psets, quizzes, exams) relied wholly on material self taught from the textbook or from sections. This led to serious discrepancies in information learned between students in different sections, including some students being taught how to do problems that then showed up on a quiz while students in other sections were not taught this material in section and were at an unfair disadvantage. Another weakness of the course was the no regrade policy. Even when there were mistakes in the grading of assignments contradicted by the answer keys released students were not able to request regrades. This again led to disadvantages to students whose assignments were graded improperly as there was likely less care taken to grade accurately.",
                "I liked the combination of psets and quizzes, as the quizzes helped me to study along the way such that studying for the final did not feel as overwhelming. I would appreciate greater guidance on what parts of the course diverge between the lecture and textbook, and which we should be using.",
                "Strengths: sections and review sessions (for the final) were pretty useful, moreso than lecture in my opinion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nFelt like there was a lack of good practice. This class, with Nordhaus, is 4 quizzes and 4 PSETs. In my opinion, the PSETs need to a bit longer. Some of the problems are not at all useful for practicing the material (specifically, the questions that ask you to go online and source data for GDP, etc.). Not applicable to exams lol. I dont think the psets gave me enough practice of the course material. Also the practice exams that were released didn't have solutions.\r\n\r\nLectures are dry; honestly for me personally I wouldve been better off just reading the slides. I felt like Nordhaus rarely added to what was on the slides. I think one of my biggest issues with this class was a lack of worked examples. I think going over practice problems maybe just once a lecture, especially for some of the more math-based sections of the course, would be useful. Sure, we went over some in section, but not much in lecture. If youre taking this class with Nordhaus, I would recommend you go to the section. They are much more useful than lectures.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother issue I had with this course was a lack of consistent notation. Notation would defer between lecture, section, and the textbooks sometimes. For example, sometimes h would be used to refer to the growth of technology; other times g there is also some notation that I had never seen until the final exam review. Its not a huge issue if youre able to understand what each means, but its a bit inconvenient. \r\n\r\nAlso, TAs and peer tutors were not allowed to give answers to PSETs. Honestly, this is a fair policy in my opinion, but every other core economics course Ive had, TAs would be allowed to work through problems during office hours.",
                "Strengths: TAs were LIFE SAVERS of this courseshoutout to Matthew Schwarzman for being the GOAT TF, but also the others were amazing. It turns out that basically everything we do in this class whether is reading the textbook, going to section, going to lecture, psets, etc... the most important of all of these really is just the notes that from the discussion that Matthew/TAs lead. He is really the only reason I even stayed in this class because I felt that there was hope for me by going to the discussion sections. This class also goes through a lot of the Jones textbook, so we covered a lot of different topics. For reference, I was talking to some friends who took the class with a different professor, and their notes covered barely even half of what we covered in Nordhaus's class, so from this perspective I liked that we got to learn more different concepts rather than just a repeat of Intro Macroeconomics. Professor Nordhaus is also so funny and approachablekind of like your neighborhood grandpa. \r\nWeaknesses: Honestly was trying incredibly hard not to fall asleep in lectures. Professor goes through lots of info but honestly not that much info that is actually helpful to what we will be tested on in class; the background and history is all great since I like history, but in terms of being what is tested on, it's not the most conducive to help us learn the material. Additionally, the class feels structured in the way that nothing feels \"connected?\" For instance, it would be really helpful for the class to put an emphasis on why we use a certain formula and how it connects to everything else, but most of the concepts we learn in the class just feels entirely separate from one another. Additionally, the psets and the quizzes feel very different from what we learn in the class, like we learn one thing in class but are tested on another, or we might overcomplicate what we learn in class and the quizzes are actually just super simple and easy; ultimately, some more clarification or instruction on what types of problems would be helpful so that we can study for themit feels like we don't get any practice for any type of problem and we are just immediately tested on them in quizzes, etc. The midterm was similar to the quizzes and psets, but the final was just like 3 times harder, so honestly we thought we knew what we were getting ourselves into for the final because there was a trend for the midterm quizzes and psets but then we got caught offguard. It also feels like the professor thinks all the students know more than we actually know, which definitely adds to the miscommunication and understanding.",
                "This course was great at showing the math behind intuitions. I don't have any suggestions on how the course can be improved.",
                "I felt like the teaching left some to be desired. The information we were supposed to know was often not explicitly available to us and most of the time I learned more in a 50 minute section than 2.5 hours of lecture",
                "Strengths: Topics are naturally interesting/engaging. TF sections were very well-run and helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Hard to learn in this course and unengaging. Lectures often appeared disjointed and/or didn't cover material that would be in problem sets/quizzes/exams. They were hard to follow as well. It was challenging to get answers to questions my classmates & I had as ED discussion site often evaded answering questions and/or TFs/profs didn't want to answer course-related questions because it might show up on a graded assignment (e.g., practice problems and practice exams had no answers). Consistent discrepancies between material taught in class, section, and the textbook.",
                "match course slides with textbook",
                "It was hard to anticipate what would be on the quizzes and exams, as well as what information to prioritize whether that be the lecture slides or the textbook. The professor was prompt in starting class and responding to emails.",
                "Weaknesses: Many. First off, Professor Nordhaus provided very little clarity and structure to the course, and his policies were strange and not conducive to learning. Students were not allowed to request regrades for their problem sets or exam scripts, a policy that I have never experienced at Yale. The problem sets were confusing, not only for students but for TAs who clearly were befuddled during office hours, for only Professor Nordhaus knew what he was trying to make us write. Additionally, there was only one (ONE!) peer tutor for the entire (large) class -- a sophomore who didn't even show up for his peer tutoring sessions. He would cancel his peer tutoring sessions the very weeks that the problem sets were due, because he was never sent the solutions. Seeking help for this class felt like a war. TAs each held sections, but were not allowed to share any section materials with students, again, because of another one of the class policies that are, in some way unbeknownst to us, supposed to be beneficial.The exams and most quizzes were much too difficult, especially given the utter lack of practice materials given to students. The lecture content barely scraped the surface of what he wanted us to learn, and students were thereby forced to learn everything either by themselves or through the 50 minute weekly sections, during which TAs would frantically try to cover the course content while we stared blank faced and confused. The slides prepared for the lectures were sparse, confusing and clearly haphazardly put together. We were all asked to buy an expensive textbook for the course (a cost prohibitive requirement, if I may add), only for the course to deviate strongly from the textbook at liberty. While I truly admire and respect Professor Nordhaus and his contributions to the field, I would absolutely not take this class with him, ever again. Perhaps if he taught a class about the economics of time travel, I would take it to see how I could finance my time machine to add drop period, whereupon I would promptly drop this class.",
                "Covers great content, the slides are not that useful but the textbook is great. Not much feedback on assessments."

                "I would recommend this class to students who need it for the major, but otherwise, there are better economics classes to suit people's needs.",
                "I would because it does have basic concepts that are crucial when continuing on the economics pathway, but I would not recommend it to those students who are interested in taking an economics class. Although macroeconomics is interesting, I felt like a lot of the flair was lost because of the way the professor taught this class because he wasn't talking about stuff he found interesting everytime.",
                "I would not recommend with Nordhaus as the professor, but would consider it if it was with another prof. This has been my least favorite course at Yale because section, lecture, PSETs and exams and quizzes have all been disjointed and the through line was not always clear.",
                "Only if you're an Econ major. It's a dry class to learn macro theory, so take it if you have to, if you don't, not worth your time.",
                "I would not recommend this class to students just seeking to take an economics class to try. It had a high workload, it was difficult to learn, and time-consuming, given material was withheld.",
                "Under a different teacher perhaps. I'd the reccomend the Macroecomic Textbook Charles Jones, that was actually okay. The course under Nordhaus was appalling though.",
                "Well, it's a requirement for most people, but if it's not, taking a class with Nordhaus really isn't that worth it.",
                "only if its a requirement for econ",
                "No. The lack of organization made this course much more difficult than it needed to be.",
                "Not really",
                "If you are an Econ/glbl/epe, yes. If youre just hopping in, no",
                "Yes",
                "absolutely not. one of the worst Yale courses Ive taken.",
                "This course was highly stressful and very difficult. i would recommend taking the class with Professor Nordhaus to students who already have a strong grasp on macro, or who have a lot of extra time to study outside of the classroom",
                "Not unless you have to take it probably.",
                "yes",
                "Not unless the course is reorganized and Nordhaus becomes more flexible with offering practice problems or examples of what he wants you to know. Just take it with anyone else.",
                "Once in a lifetime opportunity to learn under a Nobel laureate, just be prepared to work significantly outside of lecture",
                "I would not take this course if it is being taught by William Nordhaus. While he is a legendary researcher and economist, I did not enjoy his teaching style.",
                "it's a core class for the econ major so sure lol",
                "Yes, but most people considering the course probably have to take it. I wish I took macroeconomic theory instead for more of a challenge.",
                "No!! This was definitely my least favorite course at Yale. Having taken econ 116 with tsyvinski the previously semester and greatly enjoying it, I thought it would be best if I just took 122 this semester so that some of the things I learned in 116 would carry over. Unlike 116 which was very well organized with lots of resources in terms of office hours and practice material, 122 was a jolt in the other direction. For starters, we were provided a single practice midterm and final for which we weren't even given the answers to!! The psets were also very difficult to work through as the slides were useless and I often found myself having to teach myself concepts that were not covered in lecture to solve pset problems. I think everyone was simply in a state of uncertainty throughout the whole semester in regards to what we needed to learn and know for exams and psets. I think its pretty telling that the person that was able to most effectively teach the course material was the sophomore peer tutor.",
                "While an advanced appreciation of macro is important for all in my opinion, this class is so discouraging. I wouldn't strongly discourage someone from taking it, but they should be prepared for an underwhelming experience.",
                "The course was fine. It's required for the economics major, so most students don't really have a choice anyways. I wouldn't say it's a great course, so if it isn't required for you, it's probably best to just try it out and see if you like the professor's teaching style more than I did.",
                "Yes because it is a good foundation for understand and applying macroeconomics in a way that is not just spoon-fed answers.",
                "Dont know if I can in good faith recommend someone to take this class with Nordhaus. Sure, you get to take a class with a Nobel laureate which makes for really cool conversations/something you can bring up later but with that comes the sacrifice of a well-structured course. Economics is the most popular major here at Yale, and Im surprised that a core class such as this could be so poorly organized.\r\n\r\nNordhaus makes class harder than it needs to be by releasing practice problems with no solutions and not letting the TAs post slides from section.\r\n\r\nFor future students here are the cutoffs for grades this particular semester:\r\n\r\n330 is the maximum score. The grading scale is:\r\n\r\nA: 269 < rawscore < 321\r\nA-: 239 < rawscore < 268\r\nB+: 220 < rawscore < 238\r\nB: 195 < rawscore < 219\r\nB-: 172 < rawscore < 194\r\nC+: 157 < rawscore < 171\r\nC: 130 < rawscore < 156\r\nC-: 100 < rawscore < 129\r\nD: 50 < rawscore < 99",
                "Really hard for me to say, honestly, because it terms of just learning concepts, I would say yes, as a survey course or do it pass/fail if it is not a major requirement. However, because of how the class is structured with psets quizzes and also barely getting practice on anything we learn but then still get tested on it, it makes me really hesitant to say yes. Professor Nordhaus is a great person, but I just feel like he is already so far up in the knowledge of econ that he sort of doesn't even know how to see from the students' perspectives. Overall, I recommend taking it pass/fail if you are just interested in learning more about macroecon, but you won't have a choice any way if you need it for a major credit. Also, if you are just a macroecon genius then this class will be good for you so that you can talk about higher level knowledge with Professor Nordhaus.",
                "I would, as the course provides a great insight into the mathematics behind macroeconomic policy.",
                "The course had interesting material, I wouldn't recommend it unless it's a requirement.",
                "recommended to anyone looking to pursue economics as a major",
                "No, I would not recommend this course to any students who are not Economics majors unless a have a penchant for the subject.",
                "NO!!! Do not take with Professor Nordhaus.",
                "Yes. It was so fascinating."
