                "The immersion in the language was really useful and made me more interested on studying on my own. There are a lot of assignments though.",

The workload was a bit much especially when we had projects because the other assignments continued as usual though.",

You'll have to get use to always correcting your tones but it really does kick start your Chinese abilities. Also, we start at the true basics for writing, and I am a lot more confident in my reading and writing abilities.",
