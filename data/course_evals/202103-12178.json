                "The immersion in the language was really useful and made me more interested on studying on my own. There are a lot of assignments though.",
                "Strengths: The course set reasonably high expectations for students, the teacher was very kind and encouraging, course material was interesting",
                "I really like the 4+1 model where the last day of the week is asynchronous. I think it really gave the students a chance to integrate all that weve learned the previous days. The workload was a bit much especially when we had projects because the other assignments continued as usual though.",
                "Daily meetings were crucial to retaining the lessons. Professor was great and small class size helped.",
                "Strengths: constant refreshing of vocab and lots of speaking and writing practice.",

                "Yes, if you grew up only listening to Chinese but barely speaking, this is a great course. You'll have to get use to always correcting your tones but it really does kick start your Chinese abilities. Also, we start at the true basics for writing, and I am a lot more confident in my reading and writing abilities.",
