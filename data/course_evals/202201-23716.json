                "This course taught me how to effectively and critically read through literature and scholarship. I love music, so it was especially enjoyable to be able to learn these important skills while learning more about my passion. On top of learning how to efficiently read, I also gained experience on how to write. This course is a great writing credit, as prof. Macmillen not only gives you detailed and helpful grammatical advice, but he also shows you how to more clearly structure your arguments with regards to your evidence. \r\n\r\nThis course helped me develop many new insights on the significance of all types of music on protest movements and propaganda. I came into the course with love for jazz and a basic understanding of how that has been a protest music since its inception, but this course broadened my viewpoint by showing me different types of protest music (such as punk rock in East Berlin during Soviet occupation!) in different places throughout history! The chronological fashion of this course was effective in guiding us through the evolution of protest and propaganda music, culminating in how music is still used in our present day as protest and propaganda music.",
                "My knowledge of the history of music in protest has increased.",
                "In this course, I learned how to distinguish protest from propaganda, and how to identify both concepts in historical examples, as well as my everyday life. We focused on various periods in musical history, as well as numerous regions, such as the post-Soviet sphere, South Africa, and the United States. Moreover, we listened to a variety of pieces and analyzed how various elements therein contributed to their value for protest. We furthermore looked at how concepts such as authenticity, sincerity, space & place, nonconformance, the underground, etc. played a role in music over time. We also looked at how art and film (not just music) were often used for protest and propaganda. Taking all this into account, I would say that this course provided a very broad overview of the music of protest and propaganda around the world and over time, and allowed for me to learn about numerous unique applications thereof not in just music, but other prominent aspects of culture as well.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of music in the context of protest and propaganda in the second half of the 19th century. I learned how to analyze songs in their historical context and how they were used to convey a political message."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Very broad readings on many different time periods, styles of music, and cultures. It broadened my horizon and understanding. The literature and scholarship that Prof. Macmillen chooses for our class are interesting in that it fosters lots of critical thinking. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think it would have been nice to cover some more genres and time periods, but I understand that there is limited scholarship on these things. I would have liked to talk more about jazz as protest music and propagandistic music during the Mao era, but these are very personal interests. Additionally, I think that taking some time to teach students how to effectively read through literature and scholarship to develop opinions would help, especially if this is a college student's first ever writing course (prof. Macmillen has already improved this aspect a lot by providing reading prompts and questions to think about while reading each assignment).",
                "The discussions in class\/in the readings strayed away from what the course advertised, but discussion itself was very interesting.",
                "This course provided a variety of materials to prepare for class, such as readings, podcasts, documentaries, and movies, which helped me stay engaged and interested in the course. It also focused on numerous regions, which made the class furthermore engaging. Moreover, this course included a variety of field trips (ex. to the art gallery, various libraries, etc.), which made the course very interesting as we could engage with various forms of media, not just music. Finally, I appreciated that we could use our research throughout this course and build on it in consecutive essays - this let me go very in-depth into a topic I was interested in, and analyze various different facets of it throughout the semester.\r\nOne weakness I found in this course is it at times moved too fast through regions of the world, so it did not feel like we could truly dig deep into a topic before we moved on. Therefore, I would suggest that some of the shorter topics (only 1-2 classes) be cut out of the syllabus, to allow for a more deeper conversation on some of the other topics that may merit it. Furthermore, at times the paper topics we were assigned seemed too vast to be fully discussed in the page limits we were given. Therefore, I would have appreciated our prompts to be more succinct so we could cover them given our restrictions, or our page counts were slightly more flexible.",
                "I really enjoyed the in-class discussions; I benefitted a lot from hearing my fellow students' perspectives on our readings and materials. I think that some classes were we listened to a small presentation about a certain topic also helped me learn, but could have been better interspersed with class discussion and engagement."

                "I would definitely recommend this course. If you aren't into music, that's completely okay, as this course isn't geared towards musicians. It simply looks at how protest and propaganda has shaped societies throughout history and today through the lens of music, which I personally find much more engaging and interesting then just reading about history. \r\n\r\nProf. Macmillen gives you great feedback on your writing, gives you the opportunity to develop your thoughts and ideas in class through our class discussions (as well as leading one class discussion), and is generally very kind and attentive. He puts a lot of effort into preparing for our classes. We are always impressed by his ability to get actual authors, filmmakers, and prominent professors to talk to our class about what we're learning. The class trips we take to the art gallery are a really nice touch.",
                "Yes - if you are interested in different genres of music, and want to learn a lot about music as a form of protest in the Soviet Union and other East European countries.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student wishing to learn about the intricacies of music, protest, and propaganda. It deals with a lot of topics I did not know existed, and is therefore very interesting. It also includes a lot of various opportunities for learning, such as readings, podcasts, and field trips. Therefore, the course is rather engaging, although the readings at times were somewhat long. Overall, I think the topics covered in this course were very unique and engaging, and would therefore recommend it to other students.",
