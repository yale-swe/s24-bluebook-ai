                "Strengths: The professor was amazing! Very enthusiastic, knowledgable, approachable, and willing to help. The course was structured very well and moved at a good pace. Weaknesses: None!",
                "Professor Lim is very kind and encouraging! The strength of this course was that most assignments are graded as complete\/incomplete which takes the pressure off of being 'perfect' as you're learning a new language. A weakness was that the assigned TA for my section was not great.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lim is amazinggg. The class is really fun and he really cares about his students. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the homework (especially the open your ears wide listening) didn't quite correspond to what we were learning in class.",
                "Strengths - each class was very interactive and relied on participation, which made it easier to grasp Korean. Weaknesses - very few weaknesses other than homework not doing much to assist my learning as I felt the exercises were either too easy or too difficult.",
                "The amount of interraction with classmates was really goodspeaking practice and made it fun to go to class every day. I also think the homework system of grading on completion was really helpful as well for an L1 level. You are free to try your best and be rewarded for that.",
                "It provided a good basis on which to learn Korean without too much pressure on grades while doing so. It is test intensive which does take up studying time, however the overall structure and pace of the class felt good. The main weakness of the class is the disparity between students' levels in Korean. Some had a much larger basis of knowledge for Korean or other similar languages, and therefore the class sometimes felt catered towards them rather than complete beginners.",
                "The course has strengths in that meeting every day helps reinforce member of vocabulary and grammar patterns. Another strength was that our instructor had us frequently practicing speaking with partners and, on occasion, mingle with the whole classroom practicing speaking. I would have liked to have even more of these classroom-wide mingling activities.",
                "Korean 110 is a great introductory language course! Not a lot of work compared to the other east Asian languages, and the instructor really care for you!"

                "Yes!! I took this class for fun as a senior, and I'm so glad I did! Just make sure you're up for meeting every single day, because that can get tiring. But overall, Korean seems much easier than many of the other languages, but you still learn a lot and it's fun.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning Korean. It was well-structured and allowed for an easy transition into the class. If you struggle with learning alphabets, I would try to review beforehand as we only spent a week or two on learning how to read.",
                "Yes! It's a great language and L1 was a very approachable introduction.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The professor was incredible, I was constantly engaged in the class, and the material is very useful.",
                "Absolutely. Korean is a very interesting language by itself but the main thing is Hyunsung Lim. If he continues to teach the course, than I would recommend it wholeheartedly given its relative ease and the overall enjoyable experience.",
                "Absolutely! It was a fun and approachable learning environment.",
                "Yes! Korean offers a surprisingly laid back atmosphere. Despite that, I learned a lot in the language, and none of the work really felt like busy work. The instructors are also really amazing! They really care about you!"
