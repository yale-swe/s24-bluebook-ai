                "For somebody like me who had zero background knowledge about African politics before taking this class, this course was a good introduction to some of the basic issues African countries and the African continent as a whole face today. I was exposed to some mainstream ideas and issues in African politics, like the lingering effects of colonization, oil's role in African politics, ethnic conflict, and levels of democratization on the continent. This class, as a kind of survey course, was great in introducing me to these topics. However, I did not feel that I learned very deeply about most of the topics. For that, I think, I would have to take a seminar or a more specifically-focused lecture course.",
                "This class gave a broad description of political trends in Africa. It was particularly interesting how many of the trends that were described are antithetical to the mainstream trends we see in the rest of the world.",
                "Insight into the history and legacy of the pre-colonial and colonial eras, understanding of current types of political systems, academic theories about democratization, development, corruption, natural resources, and conflict",
                "I learned a lot about some of the history of politics in Africa. It was a really fun class that served as an intro to the political landscape of the continent.",
                "Incredible course. I have learned so much about contemporary politics in Sub-saharan Africa, and specifically Nigeria.",
                "How politics in Africa have evolved from the 1990s to the present. The ways in which current trends in African politics have roots that stretch back to the colonial period. Possible future evolutions of African politics, and by extention, African nations.",
                "I learned a lot about African government systems and how they have impacted development. The election report we had to write was also really fun and a good research activity with freedom to write what we want about.",
                "Through this course, I was able to acquaint myself with several foundational themes of comparative politics. I also improved my analytic and argumentative skills through the eclectic range of assignments we had this semester.",
                "My biggest takeaway was learning some frameworks for approaching the study of African countries.",
                "I learned about the data-driven large study side of political science and predicting elections as explained by behavior. It was very different from the law side of political science.",
                "I learned the intricacies and the complexities of the African countries due to this class. I also think I learned how to memorize better.",
                "A great introduction to African history, politics, and economics. Interesting assignments and a good syllabus",
                "I've learned a lot about the history and theory of the political development in Africa from pre-colonial period to modern Africa. Methodologically, it's also quite helpful to learn how political scientists understand the study related questions.",
                "I learned more about sub-Saharan Africa and some of its politics.",

            "comments": [
                "This class's greatest strength is its content, particularly in the first half. It is engaging, interesting, and highly relevant to modern African issues. The mechanism by which the content was delivered, however, was often a little too slow for my liking. It was possible to only half-listen to lectures and still understand a majority of the content being discussed. Readings were discussed at length in class, so reading them typically served no external purpose, and sections generally didn't contain enough content to justify their length. On the other hand, Professor Baldwin is a genuinely wonderful person who cares deeply about her students' learning and works hard, and successfully, to ensure individual engagement, so I was never bored in class, and felt that everything we covered had a definite purpose.",
                "Prof. Baldwin and Mel, our TF, are both fantastic people and together made a great teaching team. Prof. Baldwin is extremely kind and helpful. She scheduled the syllabus in a way that made the final exam earlier than other finals, which was really nice because it was one less class to worry about during the last week of class going into reading period. Also, she's very knowledgeable about the course content, which shows in her lectures. The biggest weakness of the course, I would say, was the readings, and relatedly, engagement in the course. The readings were often not essential and to be honest I hardly did a single reading after spring break. But maybe that wasn't a weakness of the course but just a weakness of mine or a result of my schedule.",
                "Super high quality course. some of the film selections could be a bit better but they are informative either way.",
                "Strengths: organized course structure, a reasonable balance in readings\/materials covered over the semester, and quality of professor and TA. \r\nWeaknesses: more discussion of current events and a different book for the second part of the semester",
                "Strength: The professor. She was a true gem and just so lovely. She used practical examples to enhance our learning and we had a couple of fun class exercises to enact some of the scenarios we were learning about and that was helpful\r\nWeakness: paper grading... grammatical errors are severely penalized",
                "No weaknesses. I loved the course and the instructor is incredible.",
                "Strength: well-organized: designed to be front-loaded with work, which meant that all assignments were due before finals period started for other courses. covered an enormous range of material in a short time\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: because of the range of material covered, lectures often felt frustratingly vague",
                "So many strenghts! Professor Baldwin is fantastic, very enthusiastic about the content, is very good at explaining it to students in a manner that is understandable without becoming overwhelming, and very understanding. Another strength of this course is that the workload is very manageable, there is a reasonable amount of readings each week and typically not too much more other than exams and the paper. In addiiton, the TF, Mel, is another strength as she made section fun and the entire class was enjoyable. No weaknesses in the course (I truly appreciate hte opportunity to do an optional final to replace one of our previous grades, I believe this really helped me enjoy the class because I did not have to worry about the grade of each assignment because I knew at the end of the day that I could replace its grade if need be, I really think this should stay and be a component in all classes.)",
                "This course is extremely well structured. Every lecture had a centralized theme and by the end, all the themes worked together in order to provide students greater insights on both pre-colonial and contemporary African politics.",
                "Strengths: A really good baseline overview for understanding African politics at a high level\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of in-depth case studies - I felt our course was too focuses on the theoretical (which, quite frankly, I understand if the that's the goal of the course), but I would have enjoyed it more had I gotten to learn about a couple countries more in-depth.",
                "Very strong course, no notes on improvement.",
                "The strengths of the course is that it's highly well scheduled with the patience of intellgence of Prof. Baldwin and our TF Mel. I don't see any weakness of the class.",
                "The course material has interesting moments, but the lectures can be rather dull. Moreover, the attempt to cover almost the entire continent prioritizes breadth over depth, leading to a general lack of specific takeaways.",
                "Strengths - Really enjoyed doing the readings, and the classes were short and straightforward \r\nWeaknesses - Probably a subjective view but the class mainly focused on West Africa - Nigeria particularly.",
                "There were probably too many topics covered on such a large continent, so it was hard to fully defend explanations of political development across the continent",
                "One of the strengths of the class was the structure of sections and lessons, I felt that they really complemented each other and I felt engaged in both classes instead of feeling a bit disjointed between the two classes."

                "I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in the topics which it discusses; the content is covered clearly and comprehensively, without too much work added on top of it, and Professor Baldwin is a fun lecturer. A student who lacks interest, however, will likely find the slow pace and the taking of attendance too much to bear.",
                "If you have zero or minimal knowledge of African politics and want a survey introduction to the topic (and want to take a pretty chill course with an extremely nice professor), I would recommend this course. Also, this class has a significant but not too heavy of a workload. Good comparative government credit for political science majors. However, if you want in-depth study of African politics, I might look elsewhere.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any political science major or anyone who finds themselves interested in governance because it provides new insight into how the political economy is developing in Africa.",
                "Yes! Fantastic introduction course to African governments and politics.",
                "Yes, it is truly a really nice class. It is gut-y (but you need to go to class and actually listen to do well on exams)",
                "Absolutely.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to any person who has an interest in politics in Africa, how African countries have developed, and what current-day politics look like. I would preface it with the fact that ther is not enough time to go into all countries, and there is a focus on particular periods and countries in time but overall i tis a lovely course.  Iwould also recommend it to people who haven't taken a political science class before and are looking for a relatively low stress interesting course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning the fundamentals of political science. The course material is extremely engaging and digestible for non-majors and students in the political science major.",
                "It really depends. This course wasn't all that I was looking for, as I was hoping for more in-depth case studies. That being said, the information learned in the course was still valuable, and I feel that I did take away some new approaches for understanding the history of these countries. Basically, the course sets the student up for further learning, rather than learning in the moment. I feel that this class would be more valuable if, let's say, it was taught as a two-semester thing. The truth is, \"African Politics\" is such a broad topic that it just cannot be reduced to a one semester lecture.",
                "I would recommend, great introduction to African politics.",
                "I would highly recommend and encourage students to take this course! It is a unique and amazing experience",
                "Absolutely. If you are all interested about the political landscape of Africa this course is a must-take. Easy to understand concepts and interesting case studies.",
                "Yes. I think anyone who is interested in African politics should take this class, as it will give students a systematic overview of the field and trigger interests.",
                "Not really as currently structured. The course has interesting and engaging moments, but overall it lacked a strong emphasis on a particular message or takeaway that would have left me with a lasting impression.",
                "Definitely take this class if you want to get a beginner's analytical view of politics in Africa. The workload is pretty light and mainly concentrated in the first half of the semester, meaning you get done with it earlier on",
                "If they're interested in politics in sub-saharan Africa then yes, but I don't think the material was particularly challenging and I don't think the feedback was reflective of the project descriptions.",
                "Definitely take this class! It was super interesting as someone who had no background knowledge of African politics, and I feel like I learned a lot in a short amount of time. The class is also very well structured and I felt well supported as a student throughout the way. I liked how even though its a lecture, there are opportunities for students to be more engaged in class and in section to their comfort level. I really enjoyed this class and would definitely recommend it to others."
