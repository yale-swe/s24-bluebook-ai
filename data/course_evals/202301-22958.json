                "The course is great for learning how to read scientific literature, particularly in the biological/biomedical sciences. The first half of the course focused on COVID-19 research, and the second on cancer. The readings were accompanied with lectures on experimental methods that were very helpful for my understanding. We also learned skills like scientific communication (verbal and written) and grant proposal writing.",
                "By taking this course, I learned how to read scientific literature and analyze the figures along with the key concepts. In addition, it was a course that truly helped me to better communicate science to peers and gain the experience of presenting papers. Another invaluable part of this course is the opportunity to write a grant proposal and receive detailed feedback. Dean Chang provides dedicated attention to each pset and presentation while also helping us to reach out to research labs for interning. The feeling of accomplishment once the course is finished and you look back at all the ways you were able to grow is incredible.",
                "I took this class before I took any biology courses at Yale. This course is mainly centered around complex biology that can become confusing if you are not well-versed in the language and terminology. However, Dean Chang is a very good teacher and he will not leave you in the dust if you are not a biology expert. I learned so much about the intricacies of cancer biology.",
                "This course is definitely not for the weak. You will learn a lot, from reading journal articles to analyzing a dense amount of material in a quick amount of time. I grew a lot as a person and a scientist and had a love-hate relationship with the class because of it. You will get as much out of it as you put in, so just be mindful about what you are hoping to get out of the class before taking it.",
                "This course helps students learn about how to read and understand academic research papers. Additionally, through the class you learn how to write STEM research proposals/grants and learn about how to present scientific data. Finally, through the class you learn some biological concepts about COVID and cancer.",
                "I learned how to more efficiently read scientific papers and understand the logic of how research studies work. I got a chance to practice presenting scientific information.",
                "Read papers, create research presentations and present to an audience, analyze papers, write grant proposals",
                "In-depth process of writing a grant and learning more important techniques for research. Learned that biology research is possible at any experience evel and it is very cool.",
                "I learned so many skills from this course--not only did I learn how to read scientific literature, but I learned how to prepare grant proposals, critically think about experiments, and how to present in front of a crowd. It truly was a wonderful course for a STEM person like me, and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in research or scientific literature in general!",
                "I gained a lot of knowledge on how to read scientific literature, write proposals, and engage in scientific content.",
                "I learned how to read research papers, make a grant proposal, and present research. There is a lot of creativity and teamwork that goes into this course, which was why I loved it."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Great for newcomers to research, very positive class environment and Dean Chang is a good mentor for pre-medical/STEM students. Workload was balanced and grading was transparent. Weaknesses: Groupwork could be taxing at times and workload is high.",
                "The strengths of this course include the opportunity to get in depth introductions to cancer and COVID in your first year. The material you are exposed to and the literature you read are all groundbreaking fields that are advancing at rapid speeds so it is valuable to understand. Learning how to interpret scientific literature and present it is also an experience you cannot easily get as a first year. It definitely prepares you incredibly if you plan on doing research in the future. The weakness of this course might be that it can easily become a large time commitment and you may get a little overwhelmed with what is expected and the workload as a first year. However, it is the ability to plan out your week and time manage that is something the course will teach you as well.",
                "The weakness of this course is that it is a first year seminar but it requires a great deal of time and effort to be put into the class. The strength is that it is taught by Dean Chang, who is a fabulous teacher and an even better mentor. I would not be as far along in my Yale career in terms of my goals if it would not have been for the mentorship of Dean Chang.",
                "The course is amazing as a seminar, especially because you get to know everyone and get pretty close to your project group. However, it felt like too much work for half a credit, especially with the addition of quizzes.",
                "The course is well organized and you know what work you will have every week. The content is very interesting and the course does a very good job of preparing students for summer research opportunities. The course is a lot of work for only 0.5 credits but provides students with very valuable skills and opportunities.",
                "The work load of the class can feel very high despite the 0.5 credit each semester. I would say you are able to build community in the class and learn about how research studies are conducted if the field is new to you.",
                "Strengths: lots of learning, very intensive intro to science",
                "Pros: Very good professor; strong classmates; summer funding; interesting material; stimulating class\r\nCons: Second semester dragged on more than was helpful; quite a bit of work for a 0.5 credit class",
                "The greatest strength was definitely the people--Dean Chang and my classmates were wonderful to know and interact with! As many of my peers will also say, it was so wonderful being in a class and getting to be in such a welcoming environment. The p-sets were also challenging and made you critically think about the topic, and the presentations were engaging. I would say that the topics sometimes became repetitive, especially when groups were re-presenting the material we read for our p-sets the week before.",
                "I liked the overall format of the course, along with the required MCDB lab, and found that all aspects of the course ultimately helped to further my knowledge of science and research.",
                "Strengths: Teamwork -- you get really close to your classmates. I met my best friend in this class. Really interesting assignments such as designing your own vaccines. You're also able to get close to Dean Chang, who is such a great resource at Yale. Intriguing and capturing lectures but very hard p-sets. You feel accomplished when you finish assignments in this class. The learning curve is steep, but you'll get quickly adjusted. \r\nWeaknesses: Only a .5 credit class for a great work load. Enjoyability also depends on the vibe of your group which you will be working with a lot."

                "I would recommend this course to another student who has passion for research or is willing to get through the hard work and come out of the course feeling accomplished. It was extremely rewarding to attend the last class and feel the sense that you will carry all the knowledge and experience acquired throughout your next four years and beyond. It was a difficult course, but the intellectual challenge and intense feedback is necessary to boost you as a prepared and equipped STEM student. This is a course that will introduce you to almost everything you need to know going into a STEM major and especially if you plan on doing research in the summer.",
                "Yes, but make sure that you understand that this class will challenge you greatly, as do most courses at Yale. However, you will receive wonderful connections from the class and hopefully a tight knit community within your class. You also do get summer funding from this class (even though you likely could without taking the class).",
                "I would recommend it if they were looking to improve their research skills and had a strong biology background. I enjoyed it, but also hated it so I would make sure that the person knew what they were getting into before taking the class.",
                "I would recommend this class to any student interested in doing biology or chemistry research at Yale. This class does an extremely good job of preparing students for STEM majors or acquiring positions in labs.",
                "I would recommend others to take this course. It is challenging, but the material is interesting and there is progression in understanding if you put in the effort.",
                "Yes, but be aware of how much work it will be (a lot)",
                "Absolutely; you learn a lot about biology and it is a very good way to get into the field as a first year",
                "As long as that student is a STEM person and/or is interested in scientific research, 100%! Not only was the teaching wonderful, but it was a great introduction to the kind of intellectual challenge and topics that Yale students will have to face in future STEM classes. Especially for someone like me who has never done true research before, it was also an amazing launching point to have Dean Chang's mentorship and guidance for finding PIs over the summer.",
                "Yes! I have very little background in science and research, other than taking AP science courses, and found this class super helpful for introducing me to the research side of science. I feel prepared now to conduct research over the summer.",
                "Yes! This class was the very reason I want to go into medicine now. I enjoyed all the assignments despite them being hard. This class is a great intro to research and medicine at Yale.",
                "TAKE THIS COURSE! It literally changed my life - it was such an amazing class. I learned so so much throughout the entire year I had this seminar. Dean Chang is an absolutely amazing mentor and you will grow close to all the people in this class. You learn about different techniques and ways to critically think that are important for the rest of your life. I developed a greater passion and love for bio because of this class. You get to work with amazing people, with an amazing professor/mentor, and you get to work on projects that will prepare you for your future. I HIGHLY STRONGLY recommend you take this class if you're interested in bio, MCDB, MB&B, any other bio/chem/science major, and if you're interested in grad school. This class prepares you very well to do well in your other classes, especially prereqs, and helps prepare you for research. Writing grants and presenting in front of people will be easy as pie once you finish this class. TAKE IT!!!!"
