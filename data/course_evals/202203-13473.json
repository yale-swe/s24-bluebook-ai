                "This course primarily helped with synthesizing secondary source material and with learning the basics of cultural anthropology. I learned how to take different sources and work with them in concert for the prompts on the exams, which helped make sure that I retained the material.",
                "I gained a broad overview of Amazonian society and archaeology from the time before contact with European settlers to the present day. Moreover, the early discussion of the theoretical evolution of archaeologists' views on Amazonian sociopolitical complexity framed later discussions in a clearer light.",
                "I learned about the history of anthropology in the Amazon, different narratives about indigenous culture and agency in the Amazon, how archaeology is used to learn more about societies, the diversity of environments and peoples in the Amazon, and general challenges and complexity in understanding the past.",
                "I developed an understanding of the archaeology of the Amazon, which included introductions to researchers, theories, and methods. My critical thinking skills were exercised.",
                "I learned a lot about Amazonian cultural diversity, history, current events, and anthropological and ethnographic approaches to the region. It made me much better about thinking critically about research and articles.",
                "This course was incredibly good at developing my skills of analyzing different data in context and making decisions about which data are more relevant to supporting different arguments. Alongside this, the course taught me to revaluate how social systems guide knowledge production and how evolution in science/archaeology has major consequences for humanity",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: taking this class is an opportunity to be immersed in a culture and history that most students don't ever have exposure to. You will be surrounded by a huge amount of expertise - in my class there were two professors, several grad students who'd done research in the field, and several Brazillian students familiar with Amazonian politics, so there are lots of people who have interesting contributions to make. The course makes the field of Amazonian ethnography seem approachable and small enough to really understand the nuances of, which is a result of great reading selections. It's nice to bring in politics, art, and religion as well and there is room for all of it in the course.\r\nWeaknesses: The readings vary wildly in approachability, and each student will probably struggle with some of them depending on their interest and background, but this is sort of inevitable in a course that treats with essentially five different academic fields.",
                "This course had a ton of reading, and you really needed to do all of it to be able to follow class and do well on the exams. If I were to improve this course I would add some kind of note-taking or homework assignment to make sure I'm getting the important information out of the readings every week.",
                "The course was well organized into multiple chapters. Mr. Herrmann always communicated with students in a timely manner when there would be a change to the syllabus. He would upload the new syllabus onto Canvas. He also was timely about what readings we should focus on for class discussion. Another strength of the course was the diverse group of scholars that we were able to hear from. We benefitted from the two visiting scholars, Mr. Estanislao and Mr. Thiago as well as the guest lecture by Dr. Shephard who happened to be the father of one of our peers. I'm aware that the same guest scholars can't be there each time this class is offered, but we really did benefit from hearing more from people doing active work in the Amazon. \r\n\r\nBecause this was the first time that this course was organized, I felt that I was missing crucial information that would have made the readings and discussions more fruitful. I would recommend further fleshing out the second week's topic on Amazonian ecology. As much as reading about the major biomes in the textbook was somewhat helpful, I think future students would benefit from spending time looking at a physical map of Amazonia. We could have a better mental picture of where the major rivers, ethnic groups, and countries that include the Amazon are. I don't assume that everyone knows South American geography. \r\n\r\nI wonder if this course could be split into two related courses over the course of one year. I was discussing with Mr. Herrmann once on how much context I was missing simply because I did not know the history of the South American nation states that include the Amazon. This is important because each country's government has had differing relations with Indigenous Amazonians and vice versa. I'd completely support a fall offering that focuses mainly on Amazonian archaeology and a spring course focusing on the colonial history integral to understanding how the Amazon got to where it is today.",
                "Strengths: the breadth of topics and readings covered, the amount of knowledgeable people and instructors in the seminar, the variety of readings (articles, movies, stories, etc), not an insanely high workload or stress purely from grades. Weaknesses: in-class discussion was sometimes not as active as other seminars, lots of emphasis placed on the midterm and final exam, some context for the readings provided after the readings were due",
                "The course was very well organized and readings were well selected. The course was designed to help students understand the material. The instructors always had interesting things to say so I would have appreciated if they gave more formalized presentations/lectures.",
                "The course is very strong and I like the dynamic seminar style of it, but one improvement could be putting it in a bigger classroom -- it was a tiny space and many people wanted to take the class.",
                "This is a wonderful class overall. I would have, however, appreciated a slightly closer look at how archaeology impacts modern political movements in the Amazon.",
                "Lots of interesting readings and perspectives but I really needed more basic background information on geography and tribes of the amazon",
                "The expansive course materials and discussions allowed for a deep and diverse engagement with the topic of the Amazon. Offering the class for the first time, the professors did an impressive job of providing so many angles of this complex subject. This is such an important course, and I hope it keeps being offered in the future."

                "Absolutely, it was the highlight of my semester! The reading material is extremely interesting but not easy, so plan to give this course a decent amount of time in your semester. This course is great for someone who is academically adventurous and who is intrigued by the fantastic title. You have the chance to be around many professors and grad students who have endless amounts of great knowledge to share. This course will make you a better thinker by being around people with such interesting ideas, and if the subject matter is new to you this course will feel like uncovering a new world. Even for this course's first iteration it was organized well, tackling archaeological studies from prehistory to the present, ethnographic viewpoints across scientists with wildly different styles and theories, and even doing a great job considering religion, art, and politics. Corey and Richard were a great duo and divided the topics and lecture time perfectly between their own styles and areas of expertise. One word of caution though: much of the course material is approachable but the pure archaeology readings which are about 1/3 of the readings are difficult and I wasn't able to engage with them critically. I think that for some of the course material, it's only necessary to read the intro/conclusion and let Prof. Burger explain the significance of the data.",
                "This course had a tiny workload - outside of readings and in-class discussion there was no homework, though the midterm and final exam were both pretty daunting because of this. I had no idea how I did on the midterm until I got it back, and because it's such a large portion of the grade (given no homework assignments to bump grades up) you would need to be dedicated to doing ALL of the readings basically on your own. Still, the content was very interesting, and if you have a good memory this could be a good 5th course for a student taking a lot of credits. You could put it on the back-burner while you focus on other classes more.",
                "Absolutely take this course if you can. Such a gem. I had never learned about the Amazon before, and so I'd recommend future students jump to the opportunity to enroll. Students interested in Indigenous history, archaeology, and cultural anthropology are sure to enjoy the class. Even though the topic appears niche, I was pleasantly surprised at the diversity of my peers who each brought something insightful to our class discussions. Because the class was primarily discussion based, I'd recommend students trying to do at least some of the readings. In our case, there were primarily two or three students who always volunteered to start off discussion. Of course, this class is but one of many that Yale students take, so please don't be so hard on yourself if you can't get to all the readings. I'm so grateful to Mr. Herrmann who never made us feel bad or guilty about not bringing our 100% each class. Even if you can't do the readings, you will still walk away from class with something valuable learned.",
                "Yes! I think it is a great course to take if you are interested in studying the history of indigenous peoples and changes in the way archaeology and anthropology have been done. There are a wide variety of topics in the course from archaeology to political organization to environmental change to culture/shamanism, so there is kind of something for everyone. There are a fair amount of graduate students and anthropology majors in the class, but I was a non-anthropology undergrad and still liked the course and have learned quite a bit. Having multiple professors and visiting doctoral fellows/candidates was also really great.",
                "Yes, this is a great introduction to Amazonian archaeology, ethnography, and politics.",
                "Yes! It was very informative about Amazonian cultures and current events, which is super important to know about. It was also a very dynamic class due to the seminar style.",
                "Absolutely 100% this is an incredible class to learn about an important set of people and part of the world",
