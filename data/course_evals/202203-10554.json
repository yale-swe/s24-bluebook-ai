                "The course is very well organized and its content is interesting and well taught, but its pace was just very slow, especially for those of us with more quantitative backgrounds.",
                "I think the course is pretty typical for a math lecture. It was helpful that the course was recorded and that no attendance was mandatory, given that my need for extra support in the course varied week to week. I was able to only go to section and lecture when I was struggling and devote time to other things when I wasn't, making the course fit nicely into the rest of my schedule.",
                "It's a shame, because I enjoyed the course for most of the semester, but the structure and experience of the final exam totally ruined it. \r\nDuring the semester, the only problem was that the lectures were far too slow at the beginnings because Meehan paused a lot for questions, and then were always rushed at the end.\r\nThe final exam, though, was the worst part of the course. It was extremely, ridiculously difficult. It was given as a take-home exam which you could take across a period of 72 hours. We were told it was supposed to take 3-5 hours. It took me 10 hours. Nothing in the course prepared me for an exam with that difficulty. It was harder - by a mile - than anything we'd been given as preparation. I was not ill-prepared, either. I had not missed a single lecture, gotten a perfect score on all homeworks, and had a lot of time to study and review the practice exam. I think it's actually not allowed to give an exam that lasts longer than 3 hours. \r\nI just think it's pretty unacceptable to give stressed students (who have four other exams!) an exam which is that time consuming, and which we have not at all been prepared for by the actual learning we've done in the course. \r\nFurthermore, since it was take-home, it was semi-open note, in that we weren't allowed to look anything up, but we could review our notes and the class materials. It's just frustrating because that structure means that people are very likely to cheat, especially on an exam which is so stressful, which puts students who do not cheat in a very stressful and awkward position. \r\nI also think that the exam should be in a time-limited period. As it is, even after I turned it in, I couldn't feel any relief because I technically could have just kept working on it all weekend.",
                "I cannot really name any weaknesses. The class was very thorough and I understood everything in the end",
                "Strengths: Pace of content exposure, structured support for success, and teacher engagement with students during class\r\n\r\nWeakness: None that I can think of",
                "Weakness: The courses final was much harder than the two midterms. Very stressful.",
                "Strengths: designed to set every student up with success in terms of exam policy\r\nweaknesses: felt the class was way too fast paced-- proof of this is that as we got more advanced, I finally started to feel comfortable with the topics that I couldn't understand from previous weeks. I also feel that Elogic is a weakness-- being forced to get my answers correct didn't help me on exams when I couldn't check my answers. Would've liked more handwritten assignments",
                "Strength: Extremely well-organized. TFs are capable and knowledgeable, and section time is well-spent.  \r\n\r\nWeakness: The pace of this course is poor, as was the construction of the final exam. The first 6\/7 weeks of the semester, as we progress through Levels 1 and 2, are unbearably slow. From there, through Levels 3 and 4, the course accelerates in a dramatic and unfair way. L1 and L2 are vastly easier than L3 and L4, and yet we spend a majority of our time discussing them. Among a student body where almost everyone are pretty good mathematicians and have taken at least some computer science, we should spend the majority of our time on L3 and L4, and particularly on L4. \r\n\r\nThe other weakness of this course was its final examination, which was maliciously unfair. First, Professor Meehan said that the take-home exam would take approximately 3-5 hours to complete. To be safe, I budgeted 8 hours. It took at least 16 hours, and I probably got 50% of the content wrong, despite having attended every lecture, completed all the homework (by hand), and attended every section meeting and multiple office hour sections with my TF. It is indisputable that the content on the exam was far more difficult than anything covered in lecture or on the homework. It is highly debatable whether the length and difficulty of the exam even gave students an opportunity to share what they had learned (it didn't).  \r\n\r\nI had three other final exams that weekend (not to mention needing to fly home, as logic was my last final), and was simply unable to finish the Logic exam because it was so long and intensely difficult compared to my other classes. This is wrong and unfair. I know of many students for whom Logic was their only final exam, so they were able to spend the entirety of the 72 hour period working on it, whereas students like myself were forced to bite the bullet.\r\n\r\nBarring a commitment to adjust the pacing of the course and retool the final exam I am unable to recommend the course to other students.",
                "Strengths were the engagement in lectures and the use of Elogic, also having lecture slides and recordings openly available made it very accessible.",
                "The biggest weakness for me of the course was that we were tested on deeper concepts of the course that were mentioned in passing during lecture, and there seemed to be a disparity between the skills we were being tested on for the homework assignments and the concepts that came up on the final exam in particular. I don't think a student should be able to get 100% on every homework assignment but then struggle on the exams -- in particular, I think we could've started practicing the skill of argument analysis much earlier in the course to be prepared for the final exam.",
                "Strengths: amazing TFs, engaging even though it's a lecture\r\nWeaknesses: easy to get behind and it feels like you can't ever catch up",
                "Strengths - the class moves at a very comfortable pace, which is good because everything builds off of each other; Elogic (the homework program) doesn't mark you down for wrong answers as long as you get to the right one eventually; I found the homework actually fun, it was like doing puzzles; take-home final was nice to have since I got to go home early; section feels helpful. Weaknesses - I found the final to be WAY harder than any other part of the class, I hadn't struggled for any other part of the class but the final took me 12+ hours when it was supposed to take 2-3.",
                "It was stressful because the homework assignments started lagging up to two weeks behind lecture content, which made it really difficult to engage with lectures when still juggling mastery from lectures prior. I think it hindered learning, not only my own. Because I couldn't process many new topics and found myself conceptually overwhelmed when exams came around.",
                "This is overall a great course! Strengths: the pacing was great. I really appreciated working out homework on ELogic so I learned how to do things correctly. Lectures and section were helpful and engaging.",
                "great instructor presenting interesting information in a good way. no complaints.",
                "The first part of the course moved very slowly and the pace picked up to a more engaging level towards the end. A faster pace throughout the course would help a lot; perhaps two semesters of logic can even be combined into one.",
                "Logic ended up being my favorite course this semester! It always moved at just the right pace (not too fast, not too slow), and Dr. Meehan made the material accessible and fun.",
                "Strengths: Putting the course together towards the end and introducing puzzles throughout for us to apply our skills \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures were a bit slow-paced",
                "Very interesting material and Professor great lecturer. He also clearly cares about his students.",
                "Strengths: super knowledgeable professor and TFs, interesting course content, good feedback on psets.\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked the content to have a more clear relationship to philosophy and linguistics, rather than it being something isolated and rather obscure. I sometimes felt unsupported in learning and unable to figure out what I needed to, and it is very easy to fall behind.",
                "This course was very well balanced. Both the discussion sections and the lectures were engaging and informative.",
                "This course is fantastic at teaching what it aims to teachthe basics of first order predicate logic. Assignments and instruction are clear and engaging. \r\n\r\nHowever, it would have been great if the philosophical relevancy of these lessons had been more foregrounded. As long as the course is considered philosophy (indeed, required for the major) and not math, I think there should be more active discussion or argumentation from the students (perhaps in section?)or, at the very least, more discourse about how these topics have been utilized within philosophical traditions. I came away knowing exactly how to do the problems, but with little insight on why it was actually a helpful thing to know how to do.",
                "The course was well-equipped to ensure everyone had access to the lectures and learning material. They were all recorded and published for us, and I dont think there were any true weaknesses.",
                "Strengths are in the course's clear organization and teaching. I overall learned a lot. However, I wish we focused more on the applications of symbolic logic (like using symbolic logic to settle arguments or debates), but we did rather little of this. I also believe the final was really more difficult than the previous years', and I think it tested material way more difficult than what we have practiced in class and took very very long.",
                "I think the course is great already",
                "strengths: very fair exams - if you study and do the practice problems, it's not hard to do well; Prof Meehan is adorable and dedicated; TFs are great at explaining and willing to make time for students\r\nweaknesses: just that Prof Meehan sometimes talks in really overcomplicated ways, but that might just be how his brain works"

                "Yes! For humanities majors or anyone who wants an interesting QR that uses different skills than many other kinds of math  (which I personally find to be impossible) logic was a perfect course.",
                "I would recommend if you want a relatively chill QR credit. But I would recommend only if they change the final exam format.",
                "Yes, First-Order Logic is a great course and it was the most fun course that I took this semester; Professor Meehan is a a great professor as well",
                "Yes, Dr. Meehan is amazing and the weekly problem sets are very satisfying once you understand how to do them.",
                "Absolutely, it was kind of fun doing the work and I heard this from many of my peers. Never felt like homework. Just some fun puzzles to solve on your downtime.",
                "If you're a philosophy major you have to take it, but for good reason- I think logical thinking is really important, especially in analytic philosophy. If you're not a philosophy student, it's a good QR credit that you learn a lot from, and for pretty little workload too.",
                "If a student is more quantitative oriented, I would definitely recommend. As a humanities major, I felt like I had to work extra hard to receive a decent grade and thought the material was difficult, whereas STEM\/Econ peers did not.",
                "Yes.",
                "I would if you like philosophy and know anything about it. If you're just looking for a QR requirement (like I was) I do not recommend it. People say it's really easy but it's so easy to be lost in this class and you'll find yourself struggling to get the grade for the QR requirement.",

                "I think it is useful as a course and that most students should take it, but I think that I heard from prior students that the course did not reach such advanced levels pre-elogic. And I think that elogic was really helpful for learning, but somewhat a double edged sword in the way it increased expectations as to what we could handle.",
                "Yes! This course was great for beginners and veterans alike. As someone who has been exposed to a bit of FOL in the past, I found it a pleasant break from the intense STEM classes I am used to, as well as a refreshing dive into a topic I otherwise knew only at a surface level. It was great to learn about FOL from a foundational level and understand it in a more theoretical and fundamental way. With the aid of the teaching staff, it was also paced in such a way that I saw my peers with no logic background navigating successfully through the class. Overall, it was a great course which I highly recommend!",
                "Absolutely. It is not easy but if you apply yourself and keep up with the material, the subject matter is interesting and psets can even be fun.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student, no matter what they were studying. I think it's a great way to understand language better\/to take a closer look at what we mean when we speak.",
                "Absolutely!! No matter what you're considering for a major, this course will improve your overall thinking skills and how you approach English arguments, which is a super useful skill that will serve you forever. The workload is low while the intellectual rigor is high, so as long as you're up for the challenge, take it!",
                "Definitely! If the syllabus looks interesting to you and you like doing proofs then yes.",
                "Maybe. Everyone says that this is a gut QR credit, but it really isn't. It's not for the faint of heart; you really have to put a lot of work into the course, go to section and office hours, and ask questions to learn well. The content starts off as easy, but becomes exponentially more challenging very quickly, and it can be difficult to adjust to the rapid pacing. It's also a whole new way of thinking, unlike continuing on in the calculus sequence, for example, where all the terminology and skills stay the same and build off of one another.",
