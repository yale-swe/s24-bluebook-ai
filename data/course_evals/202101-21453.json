The papers we read detailed how the techniques are used in a practical sense and also got us to more practice with how to read papers. Some days only required us to spend around an hour in the lab to do final steps and look at our slides, but I appreciated the thoroughness in the protocol, since that's what we would encounter in a real lab setting.",
