                "Great for developing a project to talk about in interviews; way too much time spent planning and not enough focus on the actual coding.",
                "Lecture is a lot of slides and information that you arent necessarily tested on in any way, which is a weakness in terms of lecture being worth the time it takes. Working on a project, however, is a huge strength because its the closest thing you get to real world experience in a class at Yale for CS.",
                "Lecture a bit boring, would love for him to teach a bit more of the hard skills as opposed to the high-level SWE topics.",
                "Building a team project is very fun (is you like the people you're working with) and demoing your semester long work is also very fulfilling. Lecture is oftentimes dead since not many people go, think this could be improved with more active engagement \"labs\" during lecture time or something like that",
                "Very good",
                "The course is well taught and well structured. Professor Timos does everything in his power to ensure students a) learn what is necessary out of his lectures, b) have a balanced workload, and c) learn how to use new tech stacks.",
                "The lectures could be made more technical.",
                "Strength is grading entirely dependent on project. Weakness is high amount of writing for assignments (mostly filler content).",

                "If we had more guidance for our semester long project it would be appreciated.",
                "Strengths: lots of flexibility in the project that you choose, excellent professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of variety in individuals' starting abilities, tutorials for getting various stacks set up are outdated.",
                "This course offers a lot of freedom to people participating and really embraces the team aspect of software engineering. You get to call the shots and this places a lot of responsibility on students but also encourages students to grow a lot. This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale and Timos is a great instructor.",
                "Amazing course overall:\r\n- project-based learning\r\n- team collaboration fosters leadership skills\r\n- well-planned milestones and homework assignments",
                "This course is very hands-on, and students have a lot of liberty regarding what their project looks like and how they go about the development process. While there is a lot of freedom to basically \"do what you want\", it does feel like the class is unstructured at times, and everyone rushes the few assignments that we do have last minute.",
                "No midterm no final, group project throughout the whole semester",
                "strengths: lots of flexibility -- you get what you put into it, you have the chance to pursue your interests, the class is super chill and you don't have to attend every single class meeting, opportunities to present what you've created, Timos is super kind and a good lecturer, the guest lectures are very thoughtful and add to the overall learning experience, workload is fairly light weaknesses: not much support for learning a new tech stack, could be better if we had assigned meetings w\/TAs",
                "I think there was too much emphasis on both in class material and the project from the instructor. I think I would focus on one or the other, but not both, or else everything becomes really complicated really quickly.",
                "strength: combine practice and theory",
                "You need to get a good team if not you will need to do alot of the work yourself, some of the individual homework submissions are not realistic in software engineering at an industry level. Other than that, the course was good as you get to actually build a proper project.",
                "Strengths- you get to work on your own project and you get what you put into it\r\nWeaknesses - little to no guidance, if your group sucks youre screwed",
                "I feel like the homework assignments which were ~1500 word reports could be replaced with more emphasis on coding instead. The evaluations for other projects were important but a general sentiment I've heard is the word requirement is something that just encourages superficial feedback from other students reviewing your project.",
                "This course is very open-ended so students with lots of different interests can get something out of it. The projects covered a wide variety of industries and types. The lectures are not very engaging though."

                "Yes, it was the first time that I built a large scale project from scratch and it has made me a lot more comfortable working in software in general.",
                "Yes, you can learn software engineering skills which can help you find a good job",
                "Absolutely! From what I hear, this is a better elective to take than full stack if you want more freedom in what you learn and what you create.",

                "Definitely take this class if youre looking for a CS elective. Its probably the best way to work on a side project for credit. I loved this class and Timos is a great instructor. Besides learning real-life engineering skills, you also get to learn a lot of theory and ideas behind software engineering, interact with guest speakers, and improve your coding abilities.",
                "I recommend this class for anyone looking to undertake a big software project that can go on their resume. There's lot of autonomy, but also not very much structure. This class is very much \"you get out of it what you want to put into it\". So students should keep in mind that they need to maintain motivation to manage and work on a single project throughout an entire semester.",
                "A good option you need a lighter workload CS elective",
                "yes, but I would recommend taking full-stack or another programming course first if you don't have much web\/app development experience. I would also recommend going into this course with friends so you have people to work with. having done an internship already, I'm somewhat familiar w a lot of the SWE lingo that this class taught, and I wish I took this class before so I could get a good grasp of what the day-to-day SWE life looks like. The lectures are actually super insightful but not many people go",
                "if theres looking to develop connections and work on something together with others, then yeah",
                "recommend for those who want to be a software engineer",
                "Yes. If you want some experience building a project, I would recommend.",
                "I would recommend this course to those thinking about doing SWE. This is a good way to see if SWE is for you, though I would recommend taking full stack engineering first if you have no school or internship experience with SWE, since that course has a bit more guidance.",
                "Yes, I think it provides a good environment where you can focus on pushing a product out through the semester and was a good way for me to explore different development practices and technologies.",
                "Would definitely recommend this class! It was very fun and rewarding to create an application from the ground up with a team, and it is also a good CS elective.",
                "Yes but only if you are really passionate about the project you are doing and you come into the class with a team already."
