                "Strengths: Covers a lot of important biochemical topics\r\nWeaknesses: Far too focused on memorization instead of problem-solving.",
                "Very engaging lectures, clear structure for learning",
                "The class is very hard, but it is fair. The grading was helpful and the midterms at least were straight-forward. the final was really hard, but i appreciated how less stress the homework was.",
                "Strengths: 3 Professors teaching different sections of the course, 10 min supplements at the end of most lectures that allowed us to apply what we had learned to the real world, readily available to assist with questions\r\nWeaknesses: not sure",
                "The biggest weakness of the course is that the assessments are graded out of fewer points than regular (out of 67), so each point counts greatly. Additionally, the exams often test small points that seem arbitrary or unimportant even though the \"broader principles\" are supposedly the emphasized points. However, the professors are great and the material is quite interesting, and everything pulls together in the end in a culmination which gives visible progress and a feeling of joy.",
                "Professors are passionate and have clearly organized slides",
                "Strengths: The teaching assistants, peer tutors, and professors were all great and very helpful. The problem sets were very informative and were not too long. Weaknesses: The exams were very difficult to prepare for. Instead of asking about broader, important concepts, the exams would often choose tiny, random, details to ask us about. It was very frustrating. Additionally, sometimes, questions on topics that were essentially not discussed in the class were presented.",
                "There are pros and cons to having three professor teach the class. Each professor brought their own unique teaching style which not everyone is receptive to. However, I felt like it was nice to hear about the research that each professor is doing. I particularly enjoyed the supplements after the lecture (although they were often times skipped we would run out of time). The exams were very fair.",
                "strength: lectures were very well taught. Engaging and interesting and the right level of challenging. The supplements at the end of each class were also excellent and inspiring.\r\nweakness: there are review sessions where well-meaning TAs point to the precise things that one does and does not have to study for in the exams, which I feel defeats the purpose of learning and all the effort the professors put into making this NOT a course about rote memorization.",
                "Strengths: the professors are all so amazing! They each have a unique lecturing style and the exams were fair game. I found the textbook incredibly helpful when preparing for exams\r\nWeakness: N/A. I wish there were more supplements!",
                "Love, love, love the professors down. If this was my first introduction to the MB&B department, these three would make me change my major. They're absolute gems, and I can't say that more as a non-MB&B major. Yes, the content is hard, and no one can sugarcoat that. They're all so patient though and really do work well as a unit. I wonder if they hang out outside of the classroom because their dynamic is giving friendship that radiates to the rest of the class.",
                "strengths: very necessary biochem knowledge, amazing TFs (shoutout to Eason, the best TA I have ever encountered), good structure (grading breakdown is good)\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the slides are kind of overwhelming sometimes, as well as the volume of information, especially for the final it is hard to anticipate what we are expected to remember, the quizzes are kind of dumb",
                "I loved this course because I am fascinated by the material and I think all three professors did an amazing job keeping the material alive in their lectures and teaching in a super engaging way. I love that there were three midterms with the lowest grade dropped -- gave me a lot of flexibility and took away the anxiety of getting a bad test score.",
                "Strengths: weekly PSETs facilitate learning, exams are written mostly fairly, all 3 instructors on the teaching team is excellent, having a good TA is essential to performing well in the course\r\nWeaknesses: grading on the exams can be a bit gimmicky, where the question is unclear but the correct answer is hyper specific, and aren't always fair to students who haven't taken other biochem courses due to the high saturation of MBB majors",
                "This course is well taught The exams could be longer with less of an all-or-nothing style.",
                "There is a lot of materials included and the lectures taught by different professors are fun.",
                "The class is well-organized and made to help students understand biochemistry. Though the quizzes seem scary, they are quite manageable, and the psets are very doable. The exams, while somewhat difficult, are not hard conceptually; rather, there are just some random \"trivia-like\" questions that you will get wrong unless you know every single thing on the slides. I think these random questions could be removed, or improved to a point where they are more conceptually-driven, to make the class more fair.",
                "The course was split into units 1, 2, and 3. I think I had different feelings about each section.\r\n\r\nUnit 1 focused on building a foundation for the remaining units, perhaps with a focus on the chemistry part of biochemistry.\r\nUnit 2 focused on furthering that foundation, focusing on niche cellular features (perhaps a focus on the bio part).\r\nUnit 3 focused on applying knowledge from units 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nI think that a lot of the course was structured around rote memorization rather than application. I know that the course is supposed to be focused on application, but it felt like much of the course revolved around memorizing exact terminology and specific numbers rather than applying that information in new scenarios. This was by far and away my main qualm with the course, I think with it being most prevalent for unit 2. We were given cheat sheets for some pathways on the final and 3rd midterm, and I feel like this was a good way to shift the focus more on application rather than memorization.\r\n\r\nFor me, unit 1 was really engaging, even if a lot of it was memorization. I felt like some of the memorization was ultimately necessary for future application, and there was a lot of application within unit 1 itself.\r\nUnit 2 felt not-as-applicable, and filled with lots of useless memorization.\r\nUnit 3 felt the most focused on application, which I really liked.\r\n\r\nOverall, individual units will have their own strengths and weaknesses, and it can be a good thing that the class is effectively 3 different classes combined into 1 since one weakness doesn't persist for too long. For better or worse, the course is likely to have a good deal of memorization. With that said, I'd recommend that future students cram a quizlet (even if just for a few minutes) for memorization before each midterm.",
                "Strengths: great teaching team who deliver engaging and interesting lectures. It's a class where you actually gain a strong understanding of the concepts and the exams were very reflective of the materials taught in lecture, so I always felt very prepared. The TA team was also great. \r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Exam 2 material was the least interesting to me/required the most memorization. I wish there were a way to make this section of material more intuitive to commit to memory.",
                "Strengths: great teaching team, obviously passionate staff, clear expectations for learning, helpful study materials, well-paced (though the 1st 1/3 of the class was the best-paced imo/had the best ratio of in-depth info:digestible info), very manageable workload. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it's a little dizzying to switch professors 3x in a semester, and I also wish the profs had led a few more of the review sessions. Also, Prof. Koelle's slides could have been more engaging.",
                "Changing of teachers was difficult to adapt to, and not much practice for exams was given.",
                "The PSETs helped me learn the content conceptually but the exams will ask you to regurgitate specific lines directly from the slides which is not proof of learning just of memorization.",
                "Strengths: Excellent teaching team and lecturers; homework and practice exams were helpful; generally light workload, but study well or do poorly on the exams; dropping a midterm is also nice, as well as no curve Weaknesses: As hard as the team tries, this class has quite a bit of memorization, for better or worse; grading often can feel overly picky for short answers, even when you feel like you understand the content; some may find the 3 different lecturers jarring, but I found it fine",
                "I found the class to be strong all around. The exams, while difficult, clearly relate to the material, the homework is well crafted, there is excellent support around the lectures, and the lectures are engaging, fun, and understandable.",
                "The strengths of this course was the amount of resources available. The teaching staff for this class provided lots of resources to facilitate additional learning. The problem sets were fair-game as were the exams for the most part. If there was any confusion, attending the office hours and peer tutoring hours really helped to solidify key concepts. I utilized all of the resources that were given and went to weekly office hours which deepened my knowledge and understanding of biochemistry; going to all of these office hours made me feel extremely prepared for the exams and quizzes. The weakness of the course was how all the three professors somewhat taught a bit differently, so it took time to adjust to their different teaching styles. Sometimes the pace of the course was a little fast especially in lectures. It definitely took some time outside of class to process all of the information that was discussed in lecture.",
                "Profs have different teaching styles so you have to adjust in the middle of the semester and theres a lot of content that feels like just memorization and not learning knowledge or concepts.",
                "Strenghts: I liked having different lecturers who could talk to their own specific experiences when teaching. I also liked the supplements that added much-needed impact to the science we learned. For a class that usually has a lot of memorization, we were able to focus more on the large concepts. \r\nWeaknesses: None although I would've liked to go into more details at some points such as seeing organic mechanisms for metabolism (not for everything, but just to see a little of what it is like).",
                "The course was extremely well-taught and well organized with clear expectations. The study guides were immensely helpful. The weekly psets only took 12 hours at most, but they provided valuable practice with questions from past exams and were often worked through during office hours. Having three exams helped prepare us for the cumulative final, and it was nice to be able to drop one of them. Exams were of reasonable difficulty, and as would be expected, some memorization is involved.",
                "Strengths: Lectures were fairly well organized. Materials on the slides are enough to do well on the exams. \r\nWeaknesses: The content as a whole does not establish a clear direction compared to other classes in biology, and splitting it up into even more sections doesnt do the students any favors. This class is unfortunately stuck in a weird limbo where not enough chemistry is taught to build sufficient groundwork and not enough biology is taught to demonstrate the meaningfulness of the content as it relates to biological processes. For example, another class, Physiological Systems (MCDB 310), was able to do a much better job of explaining both WHY membrane potentials are so important and HOW they are established/maintained despite spending overall less time on the topic. It seems as if instructors are reluctant to focus on the systems aspect of why processes matter, and students have a harder time understanding as a result."

                "Yes yes and yes. Recommend for all pre-med students because the course is honestly set up to facilitate learning. If I could, I'd take the full year. Don't be scared by the potential for a full year's course. By the end of the first semester, you'll want to take second semester, and it's so heartbreaking for me to not be able to right now. Their supplements were always 10/10 and brought the course to life (even more alive than biochemistry already is).",

I can't imagine continuing biology without understanding biochem to the depth that this class encourages you to grapple with. Its tough but manageable and especially because there is no curve there is a direct incentive to learn with classmates, make friends, suffer together.",

                "Yes! I deeply enjoyed this course despite not being a STEM major. My only caveat is that I hear MCDB is a bit easier if you're not an MBB major so MCDB 300 is the course most pre-meds take. (The percent of students who get A/A- in MBB and MCDB is almost identical.)",

                "yes. take this instead of mcdb if you are an mb&b major or just someone who wants more intuition behind what you'll need to memorize. It's nothing too complicated, but thinking about biochem in terms of thermodynamic favorability was very helpful.",

                "You are probably taking this because you have to, but I think that this class is worth taking over MCDB 300 is you enjoy biology enough; otherwise, it is an upper level biology lecture with similar strengths and weaknesses to other bio lectures. I don't think the course is too bad, but is challenging to do well, so study hard",
                "Absolutely! This class does a great job of laying a foundation while being manageable.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a requirement for MB&B majors, but from what I learned, this course is exceptional especially if you want to truly understand biochemistry. Great for MCAT preparation if you are considering or are pre-med because it goes beyond just memorizing topics, and it is more about learning why things are happening and what might change under different conditions.",
                "1) TAKE MCAT / STUDY BIOCHEM BEFORE THIS CLASS. you CAN self-study biochem.\r\nit seems counterintuitive, but taking the MCAT before this class made it a breeze. already knew a lot of the info. you 100% can self-study biochem, don't let ppl tell you otherwise.\r\n\r\nobviously this class will also help you a lot for the mcat, if that is the only timeline that works for you. would recommend.\r\n\r\n2) JOIN EASON'S DISCUSSION SECTION",
                "Yes, I learned a lot of the fundamentals of biochemistry, making me more scientifically literate and productive in lab.",
                "From what I have heard, I would recommend this course over MCDB 300 if you are a non-MB&B major. You are probably taking this course because you have to, but I found it to be interesting and particularly well-taught and well organized. In order to not fall behind and completely understand the material, you have to put in a substantial amount of work. You'll get out of the course what you put in, and although there of course is some degree of memorization involved, you'll find that topics from different parts of the course come together nicely and generally have a logical basis in terms of which they can be understood.",
                "No. This class will probably not make you like biology/chemistry more. You will not feel like you learned meaningful content that will be retained. Taking classes that are either more focused on biology/biological systems and chemistry will be far more comprehensive and interesting. However, you will likely have to for your major requirement. I took this class as an MCDB major because many of my friends from Orgo were in this class."
