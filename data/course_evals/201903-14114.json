    "I have a much larger knowledge of film theory and and all aspects of production after taking this course. I have genuine insight into the filmmaking process and where I can see myself fit into it, which is truly invaluable. This class also dramatically improved my collaboration skills. I have learned more actually practical skills in this course than in any other Yale course I have taken thus far. I really hope that Yale promotes the creation of more courses like this.",
    "I learned editing in Adobe Premiere, filming on Filmic Pro, and how to use different sound equipment.",
    "Filmic pro, basics of camera use, storytelling. Really taught me how to work with my peers",
    "I learned so much! I learned how to edit videos, which is actually really exciting. I also gained directing skills and I think I got stronger in all areas of filmmaking, like writing and producing.",
    "I learned about film equipment and how to use them, like a gimbal and sound equipment. I also learned how to use the Adobe Premiere editing software which is extremely useful. I now understand what it is that makes directing difficult. But most importantly I learned that it was better to give Sandra exactly what she wanted and not argue because she'll think she's right no matter what and won't take any time to understand your vision.",
    "I learned helpful technical skills for working with Filmic Pro on the iPhone and Premier Pro editing software, though we were expected to teach ourselves most of these skills through online tutorials. Still, I was happy the class emphasized these practical and hands-on filmmaking skills. The assigned readings, while lengthy, were interesting and dove deeply into different theories and philosophies behind directing and editing.",
    "Better working knowledge of physical camera elements (white balance, saturation, etc.), and editing tools"

   "comments": [
    "The course truly shows you what it is like to be a film-maker, and since the job of a filmmaker is extremely difficult and work-heavy, the class is a lot of work. Even so, there were certain assignments and expectations that professor had of us that were a bit extreme. For example, in one week, we had to cast, rehearse, shot, edit, and thus finish making a recreation of a scene from Ordinary People, do a 200 page reading and reading response, and generate solid ideas for our final projects. The combination of all of those assignments in the one week led to a poor quality in the submission of all three. The strengths of this course are too many to list. I have learned so much about film and feel so much more confident in film-making.",
    "The readings were extremely helpful and interesting. The assignments were difficult but taught me a lot about what it takes to actual create something. It was often difficult to do the assignments because not much direction or guidance was given prior to trying to do the assignment.",
    "Strengths:\r\n-good group of enthusiastic film makers \r\n-ling projects so lots of practice \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-feedback often not constructive \r\n-High workload that did not always have a point to it\r\n-expected to know a lot",
    "My classmates were so amazing-  I feel so lucky to have gotten to know them throughout this course. \r\nI enjoyed making the final project and was a fun, collaborative process. \r\nThe class can be frustrating and unorganized. Most of the in-class time isn't spent on filmmaking instruction, or learning about editing techniques, or equipment, etc which seems a little absurd since it is four hours long.",
    "A strength of this course is the class community. It was absolutely wonderful to get to know the other film majors interested in directing and we have all formed friendships as well as professional relationships as a result of this class. Maybe that is more specific to the people - this was a great group - but without each other none of us would have been able to survive this 8 am class. The other strength of this course are the projects - there is no better way to learn directing than to just start doing it\r\n\r\nA weakness of this course is its poor organization. Sandra gave weekly reading responses that were incredibly long and frequently repetitive - in two senses because several times she gave us the same text multiple times.\r\n\r\nThe largest weakness of this course however, is Sandra herself. She interrupts students in the middle of their sentences constantly, refuses ideas before she can have heard what they are, and strongly discourages critique of her selected texts . You are to take what she says without question, because, as she will frequently remind you - she knows much more than you do about film-making. Sandra is self-righteous and egotistical, despite not having any major film success since her award-winning documentary from college to lend her credibility. It makes me wonder why she is in charge of this class.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the semester she had early complaints about her other class and brought them to us so as to compliment how we were not the same. She reveled in creating an us vs. them dynamic, but it wasn't long before each member of my class had apparently committed some minor offense and joined the documentary class on the outs with Sandra. Just as it sounds, this is easy to do and happens almost without notice.\r\n\r\nIt is unclear what she appreciates from her students. At the beginning of the semester she told us to \"arrive within the hour\" between 8 and 9 and she would be happy. By the middle of the semester she was giving us grief for tardiness. She told an anonymous class member that they should've spent less time on one of the directing projects (one of TWO opportunities to actually direct something in the class). Sandra is moody and can be very unpleasant and has an indeterminable method for choosing favorites. It's not clear that engagement or passion earn her respect, so what does?",
    "Strengths: You learn practical technical skills rarely taught in undergraduate courses. You get to practice directing actors, acting, editing, lighting, scheduling, rehearsing, shooting. The \"acting workshop\" class was enjoyable and rewarding. Also, the class became a tight-knit group. \r\nWeaknesses: You are expected to teach yourself many of the technical skills (FilmicPro, framing, lighting, editing) with the readings and online tutorials. It would have been much more enjoyable to learn these skills in class, from the instructor and with classmates. I often wondered why the class was so long when most of the valuable information I gleaned from the course was from doing readings or shooting on set (both outside of the classroom).",
    "- Strengths: the community you build with the rest of the people in your class (truly a tight bond, and so amazing to collaborate creatively!), access to and familiarization with editing software, one of the only practical production classes (non-theory) taught at Yale\r\n- Weaknesses: the class time is far too long (could be shortened to 2 hours with what we cover in our 4), commentary on projects is always overly critical (although sometimes helpful), clear favorites in the class from professor, reading responses are tedious"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are truly invested in film. If you don't love topic, the work will be too much. If you love film though, its more than worth it.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are eager to start making films and are ready to put the work in. This course is extremely time consuming and frustrating but you will walkaway knowing you learned something and ready to take on more projects.",
    "If you are really interested in film. Not a fun gut to take if you arent that interested or just want to try it",
    "It's a lot of work, it can be very challenging, and you must rely a lot on other students. I recommend if if you are passionate about film and filmmaking- I genuinely did learn so much. But it was also extremely frustrating at times because it only meets once a week and it was sometimes unorganized. I would not take if you are only slightly interested in filmmaking because it requires dedication and perseverance.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student interesting in directing. Directing is an incredible thing, and this class will provide you with a lot of information about it and an opportunity to try it. It has good resources and it's important to form a film community on campus. However, make sure you do your research on Sandra and seriously consider if the class is at 8:25 am again if it's how you want to spend precious Tuesday mornings!",
    "If you are interested in pursuing filmmaking, this course will be useful as it allows you to practice hands-on skills like rehearsing, shooting, editing, lighting. Unfortunately, there are not many courses that allow you to practice the craft of filmmaking. I wish there were more of these courses from which to choose. While I thought the course could have been structured better (I wish more of the learning happened in class as opposed to from readings and google), I did gain helpful directing knowledge and skills.",
    "I would recommend this to another student. Although it can be hard at times (harsh criticism of personal work, long hours of shooting\/editing\/doing assignments), if you are interested in film\/tv at Yale, this is a must-take. I also cannot stress how wonderful having the community of students in your class to work with is!"
