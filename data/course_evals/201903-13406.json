    "I really learned how to write in this course. Through Sean's comments on my essays, I was able to refine my writing through in-depth editing processes. I also think this course taught me how to read a substantive amount of material in a short amount of time, which is a really valuable tool.",
    "I learned different writing styles and how to write more clearly and concisely. I also learned about different perspectives of the Cold War including nostalgia, spies, and nuclear weapons.",
    "I gained SO much knowledge about the Cold War and its different components (i.e. proxy wars, nuclear proliferation, spy warfare, etc). I also developed skills to participate adequately in a seminar setting. Most importantly, I improved my writing skills in a variety of different essay-writing styles, along with my ability to analyze texts\/sources.",
    "This course really polished my writing skills and taught me the methods by which one must write a research paper. It also gave me enhanced, nuanced knowledge on the Cold War.",
    "I developed my writing skills and my ability to be more critical about my work.",
    "This class really helped me practice and develop a certain style of writing that will be helpful for other classes in college. A good introduction, and while the class will not revolutionize your writing as long as you go in with a relative degree of familiarity, it was a helpful introduction to college specific writing requirements.",
    "I learned how to write both formally and informally in multiple contexts. For example, during the class, we explored how to write research papers, personal essays, and short literature analyses. Also, we learned how to analyze different forms of sources and media such as movies, academic journals, and music."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the content of this course; I have always been interested in the Cold War, and this course allowed me to look at the conflict from a wide variety of angles, ranging from spycraft to proxy wars. I think the course could've been improved by incorporating more time to examine popular culture and media from the Cold War, as these aspects of society undoubtedly influenced American thought about the conflict. I also think that the English 114 structure doesn't allow teachers\/professors to work through class material on their own timeline, so I would suggest moving away from utilizing the same paper assignment structure for each English 114 class.",
    "I liked that there were only 4 papers and they were spaced out really well. Sean was also very communicative and helpful for any assignment we had. The small class size was also a plus because I felt like I got to know my peers and Sean well.",
    "The strengths of this course primarily involve the paper submission timeline, which I found very adequately spaced with enough time for good revision, and the course material, which was fascinating (books, shows, policy papers, public announcements, you name it). My main issue with the course was a lack of discussion about writing itself. I found that my analysis skills improved significantly, but I didn't feel like there was a lot of explaining, teaching, and discussing when it came to actual essay-writing. I think the classes need to be wrapped up with some key takeaways towards writing; sometimes I felt like what we were doing wasn't helping me to improve my actual writing abilities.",
    "I enjoyed the atmosphere of the course cultivated by the instructor, which was one of non-judgement, relative relaxation, and intellectual curiosity.",
    "The sources and material we discussed in class we very interesting, as was the topic in general. The genuinely fascinating topics made a class that otherwise could have been dry actually something to look forward to. The readings from the writing textbook I found to be very unhelpful and basically a waste of time if you have any experience writing beforehand, so those could be cut and replaced with something either more helpful or more interesting. The different style of each paper and the buildup of requirements and expectations was a helpful track for writing development.",
    "This course allows the student to set, to some degree, how much about writing they learn. You get what you put in in terms of how much you improve your writing. Thus, for some students, this might be a weakness of the class and for others a strength."

    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially one who is interested in history. I think this class allowed me to work both within and outside of my comfort zone; I definitely took risks with my papers while writing about a subject I want to continue to explore. I think it also helped me tighten my writing skills, which is useful for everyone in college.",
    "Yes! Great intro writing course.",
    "I would recommend English 114 for sure to first-years. I think it's a good way to improve essay-writing skills in one of your first writing seminar settings, and I think it's super cool how each 114 class has a different topic. This topic was absolutely fascinating, and I'd definitely recommend it to a friend; there's so much going on-- nuclear annihilation, spy novels, Bert the Turtle. I also think just having the experience of analyzing sources and writing papers about them is very useful for a beginning college student as they transition to a college writing level.",
    "Yes, this course was a great way to learn about a niche topic of interest while simultaneously improving your writing skills.",
    "I wouldnt recommend it for someone who wants to learn a lot about how to write, but it is an interesting course for someone to practice their writing about a topic they enjoy. Its a good writing practice.",
    "English 114 is a good call to take even if you think you already know how to write at a college level, because it makes sure you have all your bases covered and as long as the topic you pick is interesting (which Imagining the Cold War very much was) you get to make sure you are prepared at the same time as learning something fun. If you don't think you can write at a college level, then this course is a great way to get there. Highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in the topic of the Cold War as well as interested in improving their writing skills."
