    "i wish that we learned more about hearing spanish, as i think we focussed a lot more on reading it. I always feel like i know the language well unitl i hear a spanish speaking person speaking at normal speed and c ant understand a single thing theyre saying",
    "The pacing of assignments could be better, we had to read Relato de un Naufrago in under a week, which worked out to ~3hrs of reading per night.",
    "The course taught me to translate English to Spanish, not how to be fluent in Spanish.",
    "Well taught but the grading was very harsh. In high school we were taught to try to expand your grammar even with errors. Here, I did that on the first exam and it resulted in 8 point reduction and I had no idea we were not supposed to do it.",
    "Strength: Instructor\r\nWeakness: too fast paced",
    "I would suggest more oral evaluations over written exams",
    "I liked that we had class every day for a shorter period of time. Sometimes the readings assigned were not as interesting or helpful.",
    "My professor was a great strength of the course. It is generally fun and engaging. However, the readings at the end got a bit boring\/didn't seem that helpful.",
    "I think a major strength of the course is that it meets everyday which really helps to keep you thinking in Spanish."
