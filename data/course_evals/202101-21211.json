I also learned how to analyze the writing decisions, motifs, and styles of various other authors (both my classmates and the assigned readings). I became way more comfortable in experimenting with my writing, and also the value of peer review. This class really develops your writing skills, and does it in a very low stress environment. The papers were all pretty short (4 total papers that were 1500-1750 words), which taught me how to make each of my sentences matter.",
                "I was able to work on my essay-writing weaknesses and improve on them. I also read a lot of good essays, which allowed me to pick out stylistic choices that I might be able to use in my own writing and apply new techniques to my writing.",

                "I like how the course is structured around 4 essays: personal, social issue, profile, and place. Though the types of essays can overlap, it really helped to have one thing to focus on at a time. You get a week or two for the draft, and then another week or two for the final draft after reviewing feedback and making edits. I like that you get a good chunk of time to really focus on writing your essays. The small homework assignments are also very helpful too--unlike some classes where assignments can feel tedious and irrelevant.",
                "Strengths are the essays that we read were incredible and also the writing prompts were narrow enough to be challenging but also broad enough to be creatively liberating. Weaknesses are thinking about the writing in a more systematic way (personally).",
                "Strengths: very comfortable class structure. Seminars were very engaging and everyone was able to contribute in a meaningful way. The syllabus is clear and the assignments and expectations are made clear at the beginning of the class. Feedback on rough drafts were also very helpful and encouraging.",
                "Strengths: Lizzie is an amazing teacher who gives very thoughtful feedback and who is always open for writing conferences or further clarifications on comments left on our papers. My classmates were also very open, thoughtful and kind to one another. It is also great that the class is in a seminar format, which allowed all of us to get comfortable with one another. Another strength was the writing prompts: memory/experience, social issue, profile, and place. They are all so broad, which gave us the freedom to truly express our thinking on paper. Another strength was that everyone in class was such talented writers, and you really get to read and soak in different writing styles.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None really. The online format sometimes made it awkward when we ran into a dead-end in the discussion, but Lizzie did a good job with guiding us. I think this weakness is only because of COVID sadly."

All of the readings were easy to find, there was no confusion with due dates and it was nicely organized."

The instructor gave very helpful and constructive feedback and workshops with students were absolutely so helpful.",
