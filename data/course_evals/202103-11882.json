            "comments": [
                "PROF. RACHEL DIETHORN!! She is phenomenal. She preprints packets for the class that outline exactly what we have to know with dozens of practice problems. She is prepared and goes through the packet thoroughly every class. She is also energic and genuinely cares about her students. She'll even extend office hours when we're struggling.",
                "Strengths: I liked Rachel, I liked that there were office hours \r\nWeaknesses: Almost everything else. To try and understand grading was near impossible, things were graded on different scales",
                "Strengths: Professor Diethorn's teaching was by far the biggest strength. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course content was not always very interesting and could sometimes get confusing. The problem sets were too hard at times compared to what we had learned in class.",
                "Course was well designed to learn in class and then practice knowledge in between classes.",
                "This was a cumulative class in the best way possible. The topics built on each other nicely, and the progression of the class clarified misunderstandings along the way. The review materials were very helpful, and I always felt prepared for the exams. Opportunities for collaboration, however, were limited by the sheer amount of material we had to cover.",
                "This course provided guided notes, which allowed us to not only learn the material in the best way, but also gave us the time to write our own notes upon the guided ones, which I believe was an excellent decision. Additionally, our professor was always there to assist us in our learning, and did an amazing job of facilitating this.",
                "A huge strength of this class was my teacher Rachel and how she organized her class. I'm not sure about the entire MATH 115 department, but Rachel was an AMAZING professor, and I know I couldn't have learned as much as I did if she hadn't taught as well as she did. The lectures were extremely organized and very accessible. A weakness of this course was the disparity between sections as some of my friends have talked about how badly they think their sections are taught. Also, the tests had some poor grade distribution at times. There were questions that were worth wya more than they should've been.",
                "I thought that the course was quite well-organized, and Prof. Diethorn was a great instructor! The problem sets and exams felt like very reasonable amounts of work, and there were lots of resources to help outside of class periods.",
                "Rachel was incredibly organized; her packets for each class, which we would fill in with definitions and examples, were incredibly helpful!",
                "Students' experience with this course varies highly depending on the professor. My professor, Rachel Diethorn, was wonderful and I highly recommend taking the course with her if possible. Strength: she gave us note templates for every class that she printed out but could be completed on tablets, she gave thorough review packets for every test, she was very accessible through office hours. Weakness: the curriculum is not standardized so I had friends that struggled with disorganized professors. Many friends asked for my professor's notes and some came with me to my professor's office hours.",
                "The explorations should be allowed to be submitted afterwards",
                "Professor Diethorn was a brilliant instructor. The course was structured and paced very well. The range of assignments, from explorations to post-class exercises to p-sets, were integral in helping me understand the material.",
                "It took me 3 different sections before finding a prof that I enjoyed and engaged with. In every section, the person teaching it knew the material but just was not a good teacher of the material. Rachel was and that is why I enjoyed the course a lot.",
                "The strengths include its organized structure and plentiful support from professors and tutors.",
                "This class was very strong in its layout, material, and engagement. However, I would have liked to see more \"Why does this matter\" type problems. For example, real world applications of series and why they are important to learn.",
                "Strengths was my instructor and the organization of the material.",
                "my weakness was keeping up with the fast pace of the class. it felt as if we were learning new material up to the day of the exam or learning material on the day of the exam that did not relate to it. i felt as if this was extremely rushed.",
                "It is a fine survey of Calculus II but is not particularly engaging.",
                "My instructor Rachel Diethorn was absolutely the best math teacher i have ever had. Her lessons that she crafted (with note packets printed for each student) always managed to engage every student in the classroom. Everyone participated because Diethorn was intensely vibrant and uplifiting. Her lessons outlined each step and went slow enough to ensure every student was on the same page. She provided a plethora of resource material and posted the completed notes on canvas which helped immensley during finals reading week. The only weaknesss in this course was that problem sets were always due the week of midterms which made reviewing for these exams extra challenging.",
                "Strengths: Allowed to use a cheat sheet for every exam.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Puts a lot of weight on the exams, especially the final and doesn't allow adequate time for practicing and mastering concepts before the midterms. The professors are hit or miss in terms of their ability to explain things and their reception of questions.",
                "I feel like the course pacing was steady and to our benefit. Psets were organized oddly in terms of use for student learning. There was somewhat of a disconnect between pset material and the lectures/exams. This made it so that I would sometimes put a lot of effort into learning something that I wouldnt be tested over, so before realizing that, Id study things that werent relevant. Pset grades also took forever to come back.",
                "This course moves at an incredibly fast pace. I do wish that we were given time to fully digest the information. We also have little room to improve. If you bomb one test, best believe it is over for you.",
                "Rachel was amazing",
                "The pre-class explorations, digital note sheets, and concept checks were all very helpful to master the material. However, the \"story\" assignments that showed us the real world applications of the material would have been more helpful if it were presented earlier in the course.",
                "Sometimes I found the problem sets challenging because they only used very complicated problems and didn't give me the opportunity to practice the skills I learned in class before diving into complex problems. It would be nice to have a few easy questions throughout the problems sets to help get me started.",
                "I thought I was very well rounded in my understanding of the content. My weaknesses were sometimes rushing integral solutions because I knew them and making slight math errors."

                "No. While Rachel was great, the class itself seemed designed to weed out people who don't want to be math majors, which was very disheartening. Some people (a lot of people) take the class to have a base for things like economics or physics, and just want to learn, not be basically told that they aren't up to par. There's very little incentive to keep doing math at this university because it's not intellectually fun, kind of depressing, and there's no way to understand how things are graded.",

Professor Diethorn is really lovely and an excellent teacher, Id highly recommend taking it with her!",
                "Yes! It was a great course with a great instructor!",
                "Yes, very worthwhile and you will learn important skills outside of math that you can use elsewhere",

                "If needed for a pre-req then yes. Otherwise, [probably not.",

                "Yes. I think it's probably the best course in the intro math sequence in terms of the difficulty of psets and midterms.",
                "Yes! Youre probably taking it because you should, but this is still math that is close enough to the ground to still be applicable in life outside of the classroom. Being able to model and understand data is an important skill for everyone, and many of the concepts you deal with are important for that.",
