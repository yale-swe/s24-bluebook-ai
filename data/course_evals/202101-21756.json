            "comments": [
                "I think the strengths of the course would be that it covers a wide range of topics and gives students a wide breadth of knowledge. I think one thing that could be improved is a little bit more review of the basics, especially with environmental chemistry. Additionally, slides more catered to note taking would be nice. Although, there was never a question on a test that I would deem unreasonable, so overall the material presented in class and the material represented on the tests were very reasonable.",
                "Strengths: We covered a lot of ground without getting bogged down with too many details, and I found that very helpful and useful. The math we used was helpful in showing how environmental phenomena could be modeled, and it was coupled with/acted as a supplement to a strong conceptual emphasis. Professor Fortner was wonderful, and it was clear that he was invested in the class. PSETs were not terribly difficult or time consuming, and our class was quick to set up weekly review sessions to check answers with each other--so that was a nice bit of community as well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The conceptual basis of the lectures was great, but they moved through examples and applications of formula very quickly, so PSETs were kind of a self-contained endeavor. All of the formulas and most of the information we needed was easily accessible in the book, but it would have been very difficult to do PSET work based off the lectures. I understand that it's a tricky balance in a intro class where most formulas are just plug & play, but it was something I definitely noticed.",
                "It was an engaging course and I liked listening to lecture and talking with other classmates about the PSETS.",
                "Strengths: The psets and tests were very manageable, though I feel like some of the reading was not necessary. Professor Fortner was aware that this is just an introduction class and didn't demand anything too complicated, which is really appreciated. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the problems in the problem set, especially the ones that weren't from the book, required an unnecessary amount of online researching that was quite tedious. Also, Professor Fortner doesn't seem to have a clear idea of what educational background students have coming into his class, so there can be a bit of a disconnect there.",
                "Strengths: course has a great balance of qualitative and quantitative, well-organized and good opportunities to participate in the lecture. Weaknesses: a very broad course so a lot of the quantitative work seems oversimplified to the point that it is not genuinely useful",
                "Strengths: introduces some of the major concepts of environmental engineering\r\nWeaknesses: spends a lot of time on water treatment, though this does seem to be the professors main interest, so it made sense",
                "The course successfully covers the basics of several important domains of environmental engineering and gives the student a flavor of what environmental engineers are concerned with, how they work, what problems they tackle and what tools they use. The course is well structured, tying the units together with common ways of thinking in an order that makes sense. \r\nHowever, I think the course would benefit from deeper, more qualitative and freeform explorations of the complexities involved in environmental problems, maybe allowing students to research challenges or solutions interesting to them and discuss with the class pros and cons of several approaches to a big problem. I would say the course relies a bit too much on applying simplified entry-level mathematical models to give a general taste for how real-world issues are tackled, without fully exploring the various factors and competing interests that go into an environmental solution.",
                "Strengths: Professor was great, and the lecture was sort of small which allowed us to engage with the material more rigorously.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I personally did not engage with our TA that much.",
                "Strengths: Professor Fortner was very knowledgeable and had lots of cool stories to tell alongside lecture content (especially about water treatment). There was a fair workload for the course.\r\nWeaknesses: The class was taught for slides, so we never worked out example problems in class. We also went really fast through the material.\r\n\r\nI think it would be helpful to actually work out live example problems instead of just showing worked out solutions on the slides. I also think it would have been helpful to slow down on the complex material (especially the part about the bioreactors)."

But I know there are other classes that do that, so this is a more math-oriented version of that. Take it if you want real-world applications of math for that quantitative reasoning credit.",

By the end of the course, I did develop an appreciation for it and I'm glad I took it, but at some points along the way the material got pretty boring. Professor Fortner is such an incredible guy though and I felt very supported in this class, he really clearly wants all students to succeed.",

You have to interested in the subject, because it's not easy and especially not easy if you're not a science person (I am not a science person) but it is really cool if you are into this sort of stuff. And it's practical if you want to discuss water. Professor Fortner is pretty great, but I'm sure whoever is teaching it will also be great because it is a niche enough course to have a fun professor teach it.",
