I am coming out of the class familiar with each of his Broadway shows, with the general trends of his career, and with the context of his work within the greater traditions of the American Musical Theater. Lots of Sondheim trivia, too! In terms of hard skills, I have gotten a lot better at writing about theater and about thinking critically with very detailed evidence as support. You will use all parts of your brain in the class  theater, music, staging, direction. It's really the synthesis of a lot of different disciplines.",
                "I learned a lot about Sondheim's work and about his role in the history of musical theater.",
                "We learned a lot about Stephen Sondheim and his work, as the title of the class suggests, but I also learned a lot about the conventions of the American musical theater and how Sondheim followed, broke, or shaped those in various instances. I also learned a lot about the value of collaboration in musical theater and how to think more critically about how musical, theatrical, narrative, and other elements of musical theater come together to achieve a particular effect.",
                "Through this course I learned all about Stephen Sondheim and his composition and lyric writing throughout his various musicals. We also discussed more broadly the development of musical theater and the role Sondheim had in influencing the Broadway stage.",
                "This course gave me a broad knowledge of all of Sondheim's broadway musicals as well as the ability to look at musical theater from many different perspectives. As a musician by training, this course taught me how to analyze Sondheim's works as pieces of theater instead of just pieces of music.",
                "We covered ALL of Sondheim's repertoire in chronological order by listening to OBCRs and watching bootlegs or formal recordings when available, so that in itself was enlightening! Developed an appreciation for Sondheim and American musical theater in general. Learned some music terminology as well.",

                "Took a very in-depth look at the career of SS. Spoke about musical analysis, text analysis, character analysis, theme and so much more. Developed a stronger vocabulary  when speaking about musical theater."

                "I can't think of a single weakness. This class was incredibly well-run, even over the Zoom format, and the organization of the course was really conducive to student success in the course. The enjoyable material (listening to musicals and writing about them) makes the class a joy. I wouldn't change a thing!",
                "The course was really interesting and covered a huge body of work.",
                "Something I found to be a strength of this course is the varied types of work involved: the weekly prep for class involved reading, listening, watching, and sometimes analyzing things while keeping in mind a guiding set of questions that Professor Egan provided at the end of the preceding class. If you have a semester with a lot of reading (which was my case), being able to take a break from doing just that can be quite refreshing. The actual speed of teaching and discussion is pretty fast-moving, since Professor Egan does a hybrid of lecture and discussion where he'll cold-call people to get everyone to participate. (It's intimidating at first, but you get used to it.) One slight weakness I'd point out is that it can be kind of hard to approach certain facets of the topic material depending on what your background is, but I think that's probably by nature of the course (and musical theater in general) being interdisciplinary. I don't have a super strong background in music compared to a lot of the other people in the class, so sometimes it could be a little difficult to follow discussions that were hyper-focused on that, although it often helped to just ask when something was unclear. Also, this isn't so much a strength or a weakness as much as it is something to keep in mind, but the weekly workload was decently front-heavy, because the first half of the course is a survey of the vast majority of Sondheim's shows, and then the second half is more thematically-based. There was lots of listening and watching work involved with the first half, and it was a little daunting to try to achieve familiarity with two shows a week (especially since I didn't come in knowing a ton of Sondheim shows), but I think that's probably inevitable.",
                "This class is very approachable to people of all levels. It is a really cool combination of study of music and the study of theater, approaching the subject matter from all different angles.",
                "Dan Egan is an incredible professor. He knows so much about theater, is an engaging lecturer, and always makes time for his students outside of class. As I took this class during Covid, I wish we could have gone to see a Sondheim show in person, but in a normal year I'm sure that would be a big strength of the course.",
                "strengths: Dan Egan cold calls, which is terrifying at first, but he cold calls with care and understands each student's background. This keeps all of us VERY engaged and on our toes. He also creates an environment that is welcoming, one in which we can feel free to say \"I don't know\" or ask questions when things move too fast. For me, as an artist, I certainly grew more in my admiration for Sondheim and co. Now I feel like I can appreciate even non-Sondheim musicals much more, \r\nweakness: we move at a breathtaking speed (hours spent reading, watching, and listening per week), BUT it is all worth it once you get through all of the repertoire as you can spend the last few seminars synthesizing his work as a whole.",
                "Professor Egan is an incredible instructor who takes care to engage all of his students and facilitate discussion. The only weakness of this course is that it was taught virtually, and therefore engagement was much more difficult as was getting to know other students."

                "The virtual seminars were really great! Additionally, Professor Egan would often send video links in the chat rather than doing screen sharing. This was really helpful, as students could watch the videos on their own screens (and see / hear everything clearly) before returning to the class discussion.",

Maybe encouraging people to remain unmuted during class could help this.",

If you are a director, performer, actor, composer, theater appreciator  this is the class for you. You will get something out of the class no matter how you approach it, and the diversity of the students in the class across background disciplines made all of our discussions feel very interdisciplinary and collaborative. The reading and listening workloads are high, especially towards the beginning of the course (analyzing/listening to 2 musicals/week), but it is not impossible; the work is so enjoyable that it always feels worth it, and don't let that dissuade you from taking the course. Take any opportunity to take a class with Professor Egan that you can get! You will not regret it.",

I came in generally unfamiliar with his work and as not a huge fan of the works I was familiar of (with a couple exceptions), but I left with a healthy interest in his work and its place in the theater, even if he's still not my favorite. I really appreciated the value of studying musical theater through the lens of one artist, especially one with such a long career and who has talked and written extensively quite a bit about his own work and its origins.",
                "As long as you have any interest in musicals, I would definitely recommend! Professor Egan is very engaging and the homeworks are fun (listening to Sondheim's musicals and reading about his work).",
                "Absolutely. If you are a theater maker or appreciator, this is a fantastic class to take. It changed the way that I view all theater, not just Sondheim's works. It is also extremely rewarding to listen to all of Sondheim's musicals. Dan Egan is also a great professor, so definitely take this course if you can.",
