    "I learned Hebrew.",
    "Basic Hebrew grammar, past, future and imperative tenses.",
    "I learned how to speak, read, and write Hebrew with proficiency.",
    "I continued to learn Hebrew, specifically the future and command tenses and more vocabulary.",
    "I got better at speaking, writing, and reading in Hebrew. My vocabulary, fluency, and reading speed increased in particular.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths- The course is small, a lot of engagement\/speaking with other students + personal feedback\r\nWeakness- I did not like that this course scheduled assessments\/presentations on the week back from Fall Break and Thanksgiving Break... I don't think that was very accommodating to students or allowed them to really take a real break. I also think the extra commitments- hebrew tables, class events- should be more optional.",
    "The class has a really unique semester long focus on social businesses in Israel and in New Haven which makes it super interesting. The course itself is centered around future tense and an assortment of vocabulary themes. There is some busy work for homework, but overall everything we do in class is very engaging.",
    "It should meet everyday. It should also focus more on the concepts of Hebrew grammar rather than just pure memorization.",
    "I think this course would be better if it met every day",
    "I thought that the class was very organized and homework assignment worksheets were very helpful. I think it could have used more talking opportunities that were part of class. The class had a lot of outside of class time commitments that proved hard to satisfy but were the best parts of the class (movie, talking sections).",
    "The main issue with the course, as I see it, is that there are regular hours kept by the course which are not stated on the ocs page. That caused a few scheduling issues. Other than that, twas very pleasant."

    "If you are interested in Hebrew, I would definitely recommend! It's a fun and enjoyable setting to learn, and not to difficult\/stressful.",
    "Yes, Orit is an amazing teacher and she makes class so fun that I was willing to take it at 9 am.",
    "If you want to take Hebrew, yes!",
    "Yes, this is a great class to learn Hebrew.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to keep up their Hebrew development, but it will not get your Hebrew close to fluency.",
    "If they want to learn Hebrew, sure. The course is great but the desire for modern Hebrew is not common."
