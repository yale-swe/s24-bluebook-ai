                "I learned to do research although this seems very much to be a choose your own adventure class. That said, having to propose/make a poster for your project does provide some rigor.",
                "In my research, I learned a lot about my topic of choice through the research. I also benefitted from meeting with my mentor. It was the first time I had self-directed a research project from start to finish, and that was a valuable experience. However, I don't really think I learned anything from the course itself.",
                "The process of completing my senior project was wonderful! I really enjoyed a lot of the learning that I got from it and the ability to pace myself. Additionally, my advisor was super helpful throughout the process while allowing me to be pretty independent. It was interesting to work on such a long project on my own, something that I have not really done without much more hand-holding in the process.",
                "The only useful part of the class was getting to see peoples work during the final presentations.",
                "From the actual course, basically nothing, but from my project I did for the course, I learned a lot about something I hope to study in grad school.",
                "Independent construction of code / research / thinking of interesting things to do",
                "Working on a personal project with a time scale of an entire semester is a huge challenge, and I was surprised by how different it felt from any other course projects I've done. I learned to manage my own time better. I was kind of indecisive about my project concept in the first half of the semester, and I've learned that sometimes you just have to commit to an idea and work it out, which might lead to more ideas later. But you have to start somewhere. Also.... learned that for long projects like this, you unblock yourself faster when you have regular meetings with your advisor. Wish I had met more with them over the course of the semester tbh.",
                "Given its nature as an open-ended capstone project, you really learn whatever knowledge, skills, and insights that you want and have time for, though there are a few core skills that most successful projects would teach you. Namely, for theoretical projects, you will likely gain familiarity with reading and compiling other research papers/projects, and for more applied projects, you will likely learn some kind of language, framework, or tooling, along with additional debugging skills. However, the weekly class does not really teach many useful skills, with a focus on either casual and unengaging presentations of projects or surface-level and unhelpful instruction regarding research."

                "Some class meeting sessions are not entirely helpful, and I feel like time could be better spent elsewhere. If the goal is to get students to get to know each other, I think it would be fine to have \"work sessions\" for a few classes, instead of presentations on things like how to read research papers, especially since not every student's project involves doing that.",
                "I think the group meetings typically had low attendance, and this made it a little bit more challenging for the class to run as intended. Perhaps there is some way to further incentivize attendance for future iterations of the class?",
                "This was the first time this course had a synchronous meeting time. While I admired the effort, the experience felt disrespectful to both the students and professors. There's too many people doing a CS thesis for it to work, the research topics are too diverse. I had to present my project twice in front of an audience that didn't understand it and didn't care. Perhaps a better approach would involve splitting us into much smaller groups based on research areas/advisers and using class time as a more informal way to talk about our projects with our peers. We'd feel more inclined to actually share and solve issues we're facing. The class in its current state felt like a waste of my time.",
                "This course was a huge disappointment. I totally get that there needed to be reform and accountability was low for the thesis, but this new course was a complete waste of time. I liked having checkpoints but I really feel like they could have just been submitted as a few paragraph update, rather than a whole presentation. This course would definitely be improved by removing the class component and replacing it with group work time for your actual thesis, or more structure meetings with advisors for guidance.",
                "they shouldn't have turned it into a class, or if they did, they should have turned it into a helpful class",
                "I appreciated there being talks but I don't think they were well attended. I think that seniors would always have something better to do with the 2 hour chunk of time assigned to this class, whether it be other class work or the project itself.",
                "The strength of this course is that you have a lot of flexibility in what you work on and how you work on it. That can also be viewed as a weakness if, like me, your time management skills have room for improvement.",
                "It was nice that the project requirements were pretty open ended and you could do whatever you want. I dont think this class needs to meet weekly. While it was nice to have deadlines for midterm progress, etc and be held accountable that way, I wouldve rather had those 2 hours a week to work on my project.",
                "they tried to make attendance mandatory which kinda ended up being a joke but just let the class stay as a thesis not try and turn it into whatever they tried to. Just makes more unnecessary work.",
                "I do like the thesis but adding all these new requirements (I.e. a proposal, two presentations, a poster, and a report), did feel like a lot (and for many hard to include new content for for each). That said it did force some level of work to be done per week.",
                "I liked my advisor and the experience of having a senior project. It was great to get a course credit for research, which gave me more time to do a project that I wanted to do anyway.\r\n\r\nI understand that the course was created partially because some students were not putting much effort into their work in previous semesters. This was done by adding extra deliverables and a class. However, my advisor already required pretty much everything the course requires in terms of deliverables (midterm reports, presentations, etc.), and had been doing so long before this year. So the extra deliverables did not make much of a difference for me, since I had to do them anyway. In fact, sometimes they were counterproductive, because I had to make two different presentations (one to the department and one to my advisor), which I didn't feel was a great use of my time.\r\n\r\nMy advisor didn't seem to be at all informed about the requirements of the course, and generally seemed happy to basically ignore the course entirely. He said he hadn't gotten much communication from the department about it. Luckily for me, he required similar things; if he had required different things it would have been an issue.\r\n\r\nThe actual classes were not very useful for me. The classses either were about subjects unrelated to my interests, or about developing research skills that I already had. I understand for many students 490 is the first time they do research, but that wasn't the case for me.",
                "It looked like the course staff tried their best and I appreciated the effort, but the synchronous part of the course made very little sense. Often I felt like I was just wasting my time and wish I could've dedicated a lot of that time toward actually working on my project instead. I strongly suggest that the course returns to being asynchronous.",
                "I think the class part of the senior project this semester was not super useful. I did like that we had a couple of progress presentations throughout the semester since it kept me on track, but the classes in between those presentations and the poster presentation at the end felt slightly superfluous. Additionally, the timing of the class (on Friday afternoons), especially for seniors, was not a good decision. It was difficult to mentally switch to the idea of having class on Friday afternoons after going through my entire Yale career without needing to do so.\r\nAdditionally, the mechanism by which we had to submit our final projects to the Zoo was extremely frustrating and overly convoluted in a way that perfectly matched the vibe of the Yale Computer Science Department. In a way, it was almost fitting that we ended our time in the CS department with that.",
                "I think the new version of this course added extra busy work without adding much value",
                "There was not much benefit to attending the weekly lectures.",
                "Strengths: The course does a good job at keeping you on track throughout the course of the semester, by forcing you to keep your advisor in the loop, the midterm report, etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Didn't seem to be clear if attendance was mandatory, lots of broken links on the canvas site, my advisor was not looped into things I thought he'd be notified about through the course (my midterm report, final submission).",
                "In person meeting was completely unnecessary. Too many small extra assignments and things to do such as the midterm update and poster",
                "I think this course is very weirdly structured. I'm not sure how to improve it. I enjoyed it personally, but I can imagine some people would not get the most out of it with potential lack of engagement -- given it is required but feel like it completely relies on student being interested in the topic (which I was)\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed working with my advisor Professor James Glenn. (I'm unsure how to review this whole class because, is it the class that Professor Park set up or is it the class as was advised by my advisor?",
                "I don't think that the in person meetings were that helpful, or it would be nice if we could meet some other day than Friday",
                "There was increased structure and Friday class which was annoying but its a required class so theres nothing to be done.",
                "I absolutely loved working with my advisor, and I did find the midpoint and final deadlines useful in gauging how much progress I should have made by those times in the semester. However, the senior project class as scheduled to meet each Friday was not really a great use of my time. I did not feel motivated by the class so much as discouraged by the lack of enthusiasm from all the other students. During midpoint presentations, people appeared to leave immediately after their own presentations, and it seemed that no one was really listening to each other. I personally think that my senior project quality would not have differed very much if there had been no class meetings at all. The \"assignments\" we got for this class (e.g. the ethics essay?) were a little strange... they were distracting, and there's no way the department can make up for a lack of ethics training throughout the major with a single class meeting and writing assignment in senior year. I really think that if 490 continues to have class meetings in the future, most students will continue to skip. When you're a senior at Yale, and your precious days here are dwindling, you just aren't going to want to go to a 2 hour senior project class with no real content on a Friday. Especially when the weather is nice (as it often was, this fall semester). Even if you enforced and attendance policy with a grade penalty, I think most students would just accept the penalty and continue to not attend, given that senior year GPA doesn't really matter for CS recruiting. I think the professors in the CS department should meet and discuss the usefulness of 490 having a class at all.... because I don't know a single senior student who was actually happy about this development. If for some reason you continue offering the class, then maybe you should ask Prof. Ted Kim to plan your guest speakers. He knows what's up.",
                "The only real strengths of this course were the typically caring professors and the somewhat fun final presentation day. Generally Professors Sohee Park and Holly Rushmeier were very attentive to the students, asking questions during our presentations and responding quickly to emails. Likewise, some of the advisors were also quite supportive, with help finding ideas and availability when project assistance was needed. This also resulted in a solid final project presentation day, as students and professors alike were engaged in everyones projects; moreover, there was a raffle, snacks, and cake, which also added some fun.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there were many weaknesses to the structure of the CS senior project, with significant issues in both the weekly course and actual advising. While meeting weekly as a group was supposed to help people stay on track, the almost 2-hour classes turned out to be generally unhelpful and poorly attended, effectively taking away 2 hours that could have been spent working on actual projects. Presentations were often a drag, and no one was particularly engaged in listening to their peers for hours on a Friday afternoon, even if they were interested in the projects. I think a better alternative would definitely be to have group work sessions of some sort, maybe with advisors around for meetings/office hours; this may encourage actual work on the projects by providing a fun and collaborative atmosphere among the students. Moreover, the assignments always just felt like extra work that distracted from my actual project, and they should be replaced with weekly work submissions explaining what you did that week or showing updates to your project. Likewise, the advisors should have more structure, as some were far too harsh and expected too much of students (especially for lab work), while others were barely present and allowed students to fall through the cracks with little or no direction. Again, this could come in the form of weekly or biweekly meetings, maybe during the designated class time instead of unengaging lectures. Overall, many changes need to be made to help what is presumably a very skilled and passionate group of students complete suitably engaging and complete projects."

                "Unfortunately, this course is a requirement for the computer science major (and several joint majors), so many students must take it. However, I would recommend taking it in the first semester of senior year to get it out of the way, and I would strongly recommend establishing a fun and engaging project with a chill and attentive professor before the course begins. The actual structure of the course will not help you much at all finding a suitable project, and there are many advisors who are ill-prepared to mentor undergraduates doing a final project (too harsh, not enough time, etc.). If you are focused and passionate about an idea before starting the course, I think you can definitely succeed and have a good time with the senior project. Otherwise, you can end up wasting a lot of time and being generally unhappy with the results, outcomes that are unfortunately far too common in CPSC 490. As someone who loves self-directed projects, especially in a group setting, I would love to recommend this course more highly, but the poor structure was really disheartening and de-energizing. Try to focus on your project and have some fun, and ignore the chaos that might get in the way.",
