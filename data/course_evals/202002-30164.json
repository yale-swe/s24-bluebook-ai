    "I learned how to better understand my own mind in a very short span of time. I loved being a part of the class.",
    "normative way and descriptive way of thinking is very different",
    "Learned about ways people think as well as the flaws and how to address them.",
    "I learned both interesting and useful psychology studies that reveal important findings about human behavior. Not only were they applicable to the provided situations, but they had real-life implications in almost every area of study. Whether in law, medicine, political science, or other fields, understanding the psychological implications of the studies covered in class is critical to enhance one's performance and productivity in their career. The studies from class also offered advice for one's personal life, to enhance their mindfulness, productivity, decision making, and more. Overall, I think every college student should take this class."

   "comments": [
    "Good recorded lectures and good discussion sections.",
    "Fascinating topics that are applicable to everyday life is a definite strength of the course.",
    "The strength was that every area covered was both applicable and fascinating, even for students who do not usually study psychology. I think the course could be improved if there were a few more application assignments or where students are tested to see if they fall into some of the psychological traps or fallacies we cover in class."
