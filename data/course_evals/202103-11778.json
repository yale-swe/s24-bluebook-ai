                "This course helps with confident participation in class discussions and engaging with/analyzing readings. It broadens your view and perspectives on poetry and its social impact",
                "I had never really interacted with poetry before this class, so I feel more comfortable using poetic jargon and analyzing poems. I felt this course did a good job of creating a poetic timeline, so I could understand which famous poets would come after one another.",
                "This course was a great introduction to modern poetry",
                "I learned about close reading, canonical poetry- specifically a lot about Pope, Wordsworth, and Gray.",
                "I didn't believe it was a possibility going into the class, but I genuinely developed an appreciation for poetry in a way I had never had previously. As someone looking to go into non-fiction writing, I had always just kind of brushed it off as not very impactful, and I'm glad this course made me rethink that mindset and I came away from it with a lot learned!",
                "This course helped me immensely in improving both my close reading skills and my writing technique. I believe that the course made me a better writer, a more critical thinker, and a closer reader of poetry.",
                "Pretty good overview of some notable English poets of the past few centuries. I felt like I came away better at analyzing poetry and with a little more understanding of the development of the form over time. Most of the class is spent in the beginning/middle of the time period it covers; the more recent stuff was talked about only rather briefly. I tend to prefer more modern poetry, so found a lot of the reading fairly dry, but the discussions in class were pretty interesting."

                "Strengths: Professor, class discussions, feedback",
                "Strengths: introduced students to the canonical poets, provided students with flexibility (like offering various prompts to choose from for papers and letting us post a discussion post one of either days of class)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: barely any marginalized poets were studied and, when they were, theyre marginalized status was the only thing discussed (like reading a Black poets poem about memory to be about slavery, as an exaggerated example); sometimes discussions that can drone on \r\n\r\nImprovement: rework the poets studied entirely or even add a third level to the English Poetry course series, maybe add some activities every now and then (even though its a seminar, it might add some variety to get people engaged)",
                "Strengths: close class dynamic leads to meaningful discussions\r\nWeaknesses: some of the poets/readings were much less engaging than others",
                "The strength of this course is that it can be taken by any student, even one that had never interacted with poetry. Not once did I feel left behind by this course. \r\n\r\nWeakness, the format of the seminar was the same every single class, twice a week. Just got a bit boring, unless the seminar discussion landed on a particularly interesting piece.",
                "The course is wonderful as is. Very interesting topics, manageable workload, and great class environment",
                "Strengths: assignments were really cool with room to explore and expand. I also liked how we started every class by sharing an updates.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there had been more queer women of color on the syllabus, even if it was towards the end.",
                "This course's strengths greatly outnumber its weaknesses. I think the variety of authors we studied was appropriate for a diverse selection of voices that still reflected the development of trends and important works. The workload was never too much for a student who can keep a regular schedule for responses. The only thing I'd say is that the three paper assignments were all pretty much the same, and they got repetitive after a while.",
                "The course leans heavily on Alexander Pope in the beginning of the semester which was honestly far from my favourite. The end felt a bit rushed (although perhaps this is the nature of a course attempting to cover so much ground). I would have preferred to have read a bit more modern to contemporary poetry with less Alexander Pope.",
                "I felt like the course would have benefited from reading a bit of analysis of poetry as well as the poetry itself. We did eventually read a couple of works on Keats, but only once and quite late in the course. I think doing a bit of that at the beginning would have been useful since it would give the students a slightly better idea of what kinds of ideas and writing we were supposed to generate in our own analysis."

                "Absolutely, especially for those considering the English major. This class had super interesting readings and laid a great foundation for academic and analytical writing. Also, Kramnick is one of the most kind and understanding professors I have ever had. He gives extensive feedback on every essay you submit and is very validating during discussions. You'll leave this class thanking him!",
                "I would recommend this course to someone else because it definitely introduces you to the foundation of poetry that anyone interested should be familiar with. There are literary movements and classical allusions that I learned through the poetry we studied  this semester and it all just makes me feel a little more intellectual and deserving of being here at Yale than I felt coming into this class.",
                "Yes, for students who are really passionate about poetry and who are looking to engage deeply with it, or for students who want to increase their confidence in analyzing poetry or finding their footing in class discussions",
                "I would recommend this course as a foundational English course. I find poetry to be far more interesting after taking this course, which is also a success. Particularly, the ability to revise our papers with the grade/feedback given was helpful. I felt that I could actually apply my learning and critiques to make my portfolio better, which is something I personally value, and do not find often in other courses.",
                "Yes! Take this course. Its super interesting and the selection of poetry is great",
                "Yes! Especially for someone like me who had no real interest in poetry coming in, this Professor Kramnick will change your perspective!",
                "I would recommend that a student who wants to pursue later work in poetry take this course as it provides good background. It is, of course, also part of the English requirements.",
                "Obviously it's a good choice if you're an English major. For non-majors, I'd only really recommend it if you have a specific interest in the time period it covers, or really want to develop your skills at analyzing/writing about poems. If you just have a general interest in the genre, something dealing with more modern works might be more to your liking."
