It is my belief that every student came away from the course with a better understanding of how healthcare works in our society and how much work is being done and how much research is being pursued in these fields."

                "The course brought in readings across virtually all of the social sciences and were even broader geographically. The reading load every week was manageable but it also provided an adequate stimulus for discussion in that week. Since the course only met once a week, one helpful tip could have been to give a short lecture before each discussion to clear up any discrepancies and just provide an even stronger basis for the discussion that would follow. The various discussion posts as well as the major assignments of the course helped refine my comprehension skills and how to understand the context an author is operating in, as well as the nuances that they may be highlighting or potentially hiding."

It was incredibly effective in highlighting the nuances that complicate healthcare and biomedicine as well as highlighting the number of approaches to improving the state of the two in a highly complex world."
