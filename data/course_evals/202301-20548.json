                "The course is engaging and covers a wide variety of topics. Classroom sessions are interesting with a large amount of spoken practice to work on pronunciation and grammatical structures. The course offers a large number of resources for the student, including language clinics, the textbook and the associated website, as well as the in-class powerpoint presentations. \r\nThe main weakness of this course is that it is very rushed. Each week includes at least one assessment, and preparing for biweekly lesson tests requires a significant time commitment, taking away from time that could be spent on other courses. This leads to a learn-test-forget mindset, in which everything is learned the night before a test and the knowledge is not fully retained afterwards. The course could be improved by covering less material but actually allowing for it to be covered in depth.",
                "It was very engaging during class time, and we practiced new grammar a lot with speaking. In terms of improvement, perhaps there could be some exercise or way for us to practice new vocabulary more explicitly, rather than just expecting that we will incorporate it in conversation. I think this would've helped me. Other than that, the class was pretty fun!",
                "It was great. I loved spending time learning",
                "I enjoyed the continued emphasis on conversation in L2 Japanese and some of the interesting assignments like the paper we wrote up vertically or the end-of-semester project. I also enjoy the Japanese clinic sessions that allow me to go more in-depth into things I need practice in. The main weakness is just the structure of testing. Kanji tests which cumulate all the kanji characters in a unit come before Kanji quizzes which target a select few kanji to go over. I feel it would make more sense for the quizzes to come first to make studying more of a gradual and continuous process."

                "You cant exactly avoid this course if you are planning to study Japanese, so the term recommend is not exactly applicable. I would underline that this course is a significant time commitment and should not be taken in conjunction with other high workload courses. A potential Japanese 120 student should plan their schedule with the expectation that at least an hour every day will be spent on Japanese homework alone, with more time required to properly prepare for tests. The 1.5 course credit the course carries is an underestimate of the effort required to succeed in this course. The challenge is not that something is hard to understand, but just that there is so much to learn in so little time. \r\nAt the very least, the course is fair. You get out of it what you put in, and you are given the resources to succeed if you work very hard.",
                "Yes I would. It's definitely an effective class for teaching and letting us practice Japanese. It was also quite fun and engaging.",
                "Yes. It was essential in increasing my learning",
                "Yes! Stever Sensei is the best Japanese teacher!",
                "Yes if have already taken L1 Japanese, I would recommend sticking with it and continuing the track as it's an enjoyable class with about the same workload as L1."
