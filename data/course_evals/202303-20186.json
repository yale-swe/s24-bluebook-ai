                "I think this is a hard one to address as it depends both on the familiarity of the students with the subject at hand as well as everyone's comfort with discussing the papers. One initial improvement would be to include a 15-minute break within the 3-hour seminar time. I think including a short break will help everyone to maintain better focus and to remain engaged. Depending on the article subject, including short lectures or reviews on foundational knowledge would be appreciated. I think either assigning certain students to this task or having an instructor provide background information would be fine. Additionally, I think it could be useful for the instructors to discuss their views on each article's methodologies, conclusions, etc, to conclude each class. As I develop a critical lens for methodological choices within research articles, having guidance from faculty would be beneficial to help me learn what to look for and what questions to ask. My final recommendation to improve the course would be to create prompts to allow for discussions to flow better in class. It would be ideal to minimize awkward pauses during the course. Even including a little brainstorm at the start of class on concepts people didn't understand or need clarity on, or issues they found in the article may help to foster better discussions. Overall, I enjoyed taking this course and learned a lot."
