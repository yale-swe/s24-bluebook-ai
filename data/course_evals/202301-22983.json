Although you might expect an art and technology course to solely focus on 20th century works (or later), we began the course with a study of parietal (cave) art. We then quickly moved through some of the major art historical developments in the Renaissance and mediums such as textile and photography. Although you wont cover every major development in art history through this technology-specific course, you do get a good sampling and you will emerge armed with knowledge and vocabulary to analyze any work of art.",
                "Insights: Art and technology have never been separate but have informed and responded to each other for millenia. \r\nKnowledge: I learned about a wide and  wild range of artworks, from the cave paintings to NFTs and generative art. I am familiar now with art and literature both from the canon and outside of it, and I feel I have a good sense of contemporary explorations in art and technology.\r\nSkills: visual analysis, formal analysis,  synthesizing and making connections between artworks.",
                "I learned about art and history and tech and all their intersections",
                "I learned a ton about art and technology from Paleolithic times to the modern day. I learned how to write a visual analysis paper, typical art history paper, and how to place artworks in conversation with texts/readings.",
                "I gained a broad overview of the history of art (from cave art to NFTs) from a technological perspective. I really appreciated how Professor Lee always put art and technology/contemporaneous historical events in dialogue -- it was very helpful in situating art in a broader historical context.",
                "I learned about the history of art and how intertwined it is with technology. I learned how to write visual analyses too and critically think about art.",
                "I learnt a lot about how technology has developed over time and the role that art has played in its reception and evolution. I also learnt that the line between art and technology has always been blurred even before the days of AI art and NFTs.",
                "I felt like I was introduced to a more organized, foundational set of text/theory regarding art and technological development. Since the intersection of the two is simultaneously so new but also very historical, it can be challenging to know where to begin. Art and Technology gave me a place to begin!",
                "art visual analysis, history of art and tech involvement.",
                "Learned about the intersection of art and technology, from prehistoric times (looking at cave paintings) to modern day tech like NFTs and AI-generated art. It was my first art history course and I learned a lot about how to write about art, and things to think about art while writing about it.",

                "Strengths - you learn a lot about a lot of different types of art and theories. Pamela Lee is a great lecturer. Weaknesses - the workload is pretty high if you're not pass/failing the class (section, readings, lectures, papers, and midterm/final) and there's a lot of content.",
                "This class is essentially a crash course in the vapid intellectual fads of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Its perfect for anyone who is in need of the correct opinions as they move through the art historical discipline, but is not particularly interested in critically engaging with any issue. The metric by which artworks were chosen for the syllabus was largely informed by the variety of marginalized groups that could be wheeled out in discussing them. This resulted in a pretty dull and un-engaging class, I found.",
                "I think your experience in this course greatly depends on your investment and level of engagement. As a CS major with an interest in art history, I found the tech lens to be fascinating. Although I could have gotten through the course with very little work or engagement, I spent my free time doing extra reading on some of the artists we studied.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lee is a starI always loved attending lecture and listening to her brilliance. If you can take a course with her, definitely do!",
                "Fascinating, relevant, and fun lectures, material, and discussions. I cannot think of a weakness.",
                "Honestly really liked the class. Would appreciate less memorization on the exams. Loved the trips to the yuag though",
                "Strengths: The ability to go to the Yale art gallery to look at and analyze works of art discussed in lecture was incredible. Section was definitely a highlight of this class. The guest speakers were also an excellent addition and a highlight. Weaknesses: the course tries to cover so much, which is great, but I think it could benefit from discussing fewer works of art in each class. Lecture sometimes felt rushed (which is clear from the fact we often didn't make it through all the works). It also felt like the midterm grading was unclear and a bit arbitrary; clarifying the expectations / rubric ahead of the exam would be important in the future (this was done for the final).",
                "Strengths: the lectures are amazing! Professor Lee is always prepared and somehow manages to cover a lot (though not an overwhelming amount) in a fifty minute lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: For a 100 level HSAR class, it is definitely a lot of work -- probably the same as 200 level art history classes.",
                "Strength: I thought that exams were pretty straightforward, Prof. Lee definitely knew a lot about the class's content and taught it in a very engaging way\r\nWeaknesses: There is a lot of information to memorize but everything is connected so if you understand conceptually, it isn't that bad, lectures can be very fast (but you can watch recordings later), there was not a lot of teaching on how to write a visual analysis paper\r\nOther Notes: Know that the slides do not have a lot of information on them, you will need to listen to get information and context",
                "The lectures were very engaging and all the slide images provided a great visual accompaniment. I also really enjoyed the series of guest lectures.\r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, the final exam focused a lot on the reading and this felt a bit incongruent with what we had done over the semester which was less focused on the readings. I think this could easily be improved by either focusing more on the readings throughout the semester or focusing less on them in the final exam.",
                "lecture includes more about NFT",
                "Strength: amazing lecturer and very interesting course content. Discussion sections are engaging and a great addition to the lectures. Weaknesses: Provide better guidelines for essay assignments.",
                "Good lectures, interesting topics, cool guest speakers, fun trips to YUAG, not too much work. Just make sure to stay on top of the art you learn about each week (honestly just going to lecture + section is good enough for this), and this course is very enjoyable.",
                "Tests are just lots of memorizing which is hard and takes time if art history doesnt come easy to you.",
                "Strengths: great dedicated TAs\r\nWeakness: not enough structure",
                "The greatest strength of this course were the in-person visits to the Yale art gallery; works of art are very different when viewed in person, and the TAs were great guides to how to view and interpret art. \r\n\r\nA weakness of this course is the focus on memorization for the exams. The essays felt much more relevant and a better use of time, while the exams felt like memorization for memorization's sake, rather than truly interpreting the works of art and themes discussed.",
                "Professor Lee is a great lecturer and the lectures were really interesting, although they were somewhat sparsely attended since they were recorded. I think it's a strength of the course that lectures are accessible in that way, although it would have been nice to have a fuller lecture hall."

                "Yes, if they want a broad survey of art history! However, it might helpful to have taken at least one other art history class before taking this class - as this seems a little more advanced than other introductory classes at Yale.",

                "Yes I would highly recommend this course! Learned about a lot of super interesting topics and I looked forward to going to class each week. The assignments were very doable and didn't even feel like work. As a CS student, it was cool to learn about the intersection of art and tech, and the more CS-y related topics (like NFTs and AI) were particularly interesting, especially seeing how such topics are treated within a humanities/art lens.",

                "yes! I learned some cool stuff and it was a good art history credit for my major. Just be prepared for memorization-based exams.",
                "Definitely. Very accessible regardless of whether you're an art history major or a STEM major looking for a humanities credit, and the content of the course is fascinating and helped me broaden my knowledge of art significantly.",
