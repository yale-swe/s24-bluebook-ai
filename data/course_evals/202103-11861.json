                "Prof. P had excellent and entertaining lectures. Problem sets were well designed. There were plenty of office hours and extra help. All in all, it was potentially the best classes I've ever taken. \r\n\r\nOne small addition that I would appreciate is putting the exact chapter of what book corresponds to what we're learning in class on the syllabus or course page. I always like to have a written textbook reference to read over to supplement lectures.",
                "The wealth of materials available for study beyond the textbook - including recordings and notes on Canvas, additional readings, etc, were very helpful in preparing for exams.\r\n\r\nSome topics in this course (special relativity being a main one) could benefit from more time, while others (harmonic oscillators) seemed to go on for an excessive amount of time. \r\n\r\nThe first few weeks of the course there was only one TA, and one study hall, which put me behind as it was at a time I could not attend. The addition of a second TA who held both a study hall and an office hour made a big difference in my ability to engage with the weekly psets on a meaningful level. I appreciated that the instructor also held office hours by appointment, which allowed me to sometimes fill in gaps.",
                "The professor and the lectures are amazing, and the online components are helpful as well.",
                "There were a couple of times where I felt like I had to watch the video lectures and go to class to learn everything the class covered and while this isn't unreasonable, it felt like there was a lot of overlap between the two so that it was difficult to find exactly what differed between the two sources.",
                "It was a great course for really learning in depth the skills to successfully do classical mechanics problems. The workload was incredibly high though. My entire week would revolve around this class alone and the problem set sessions with classmates (nightly), office hours, and study halls with the TAs were basically constant. I felt as if I would fall behind if I didn't attend a single of these things. At some point it became less a matter of understanding and more a matter of completing my work so that I could have time for my other classes. Then it became a matter of how I was taking longer to understand than everyone else and was being left more and more behind. I lobe the topics, I really do, but this course was a lot.",
                "Nikhil and his recorded lectures are a strength. It was helpful to have those recordings to look back on. Kabish (our TA) was also a huge strength. Both Kabosh and Nikhil are very good at explaining things and incredibly helpful. One weakness was the sheer amount of work in the beginning. The first few psets were so intensive I felt I didn't have time to really understand the work because I was so focused on just getting it done on time. This got better throughout the class, though. Nikhil moves very quickly in lectures and skips over intermediary steps which can be frustrating. His lecture notes are also hard to parse, and I wish they were searchable in some way. Overall I felt the class was organized very well.",
                "The lectures are great, very informative. The problem sets are appropriately challenging but not too difficult, letting us apply what we've learned in lecture and take it a step further. I occasionally had scheduling problems trying to find an office hours time that worked for me, so maybe some expansion of the office hours might be nice in the future. But overall, a very well-organized course.",
                "Strengths: the office hours and availability of the professors, the course organization did an excellent job putting relevant course content near each other",
                "Great Professor and resources (past notes, review sessions, etc.)",
                "I really liked the encouragement of collaboration in this class. I always looked forward to coming to class and seeing what we would cover each week! I liked that most of the homework problems were similar to things we have covered in class and/or could be related to similar problems in the associated textbooks for the class. Nikhil is an enthusiastic professor and was willing to answer any questions that arose during class or in office hours. \r\nI will say that the homework assignments took me a very long time to complete. I think it would be nice to have some more conceptual problems included in class and/or on homeworks. Or potentially even just have some more basic problems on the homework (maybe include more easier problems as opposed to just a few very difficult problems). I liked that the exams both ended up being take-home, but they also took a very long time for me to complete. While I definitely could have gone faster if I had studied more/understood the material better throughout the semester, there were still a few problems that were pretty tricky for me. However, the tricky problems oftentimes end up being interesting/fun, especially if you think you got the answer in the end. With that being said, I know we can't always spend as much time as we'd like on these things since we of course have other classes, so this time-pressure might make the \"scary\" problems extra stressful. In the end though, I think grading was very generous and the TAs/Nikhil gave us partial credit when they could tell that we gave it a solid effort! Sometimes it took a while to get our homework grades/answer keys, but I understand that there are a lot of students and very few TAs.",
                "I think that the lectures were always very informative, and recordings of lectures from when the class was online are posted on the Canvas page, which was useful if you didn't pick up a topic during class. I would have liked a bit more practice with setting up a system to find Lagrangians, but other than that I think this was a very good course.",
                "We go through a lot of material in a short amount of time, but the psets are great for making sure that we actually understand what we're learning.",
                "bit more direction at the front of each lecture / unit so were not just copying working out without knowing why and where we want to end up. sometimes dont know what were solving for",
                "Very good instruction. Maybe more time could be spent on Hamiltonian mechanics.",
                "The strength was definitely Prof. Padmanabhan: most of the time, he taught difficult concepts very clearly and was super receptive and accommodating to students; it seemed he genuinely wanted everyone to do well. The weakness was definitely the difficulty of the exams, both of which were much more difficult than the professor intended; for example, it took students 10-20 hours to complete the final that was originally scheduled for 3 hours in-person.",
                "Strengths: Very knowledgeable professor with sharp teaching skills, classical mechanics is fun to study, problems sets are predictable (doesn't mean easy, but still), canvas is organized (tho Prof. P doesn't update stuff immediately sometimes), and MOST OF ALL, take home exams that resemble class examples/psets and very well test your understanding! Made the class not too stressful! Weakness: Would be best if lecture notes were posted in advance of class. That happened for Class 14 and 15, and it made the lectures astronomically much easier to follow. Really, this is the best strategy than posting the same stuff days after class. Plus, I don't think HS (the textbook) is really THAT appropriate for the class. Thornton or Morin are better suited as the official course textbook (John Taylor's CM is also an absolute gem!)."

I thought the Lagrangian and special relativity were such interesting topics that my poor suite mates are probably sick of me talking about physics by now. He also does a great job of encouraging collaboration amongst students, and I made some great friends through the class.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who is able to devote a lot of time to the psets, as they are time-consuming, and who is interested in advancing beyond introductory physics. For someone looking to dip their toe in, this is not the class.",
                "I would! If you are interested in a step up from the intro physics classes and studying mechanics in a different way, this class is awesome.",
                "Rather than recommending it, I would give them a warning and let them decide. The topics are incredibly compelling and this class truly teaches you them, but the workload is overwhelming.",
                "I would only recommend this class to someone who will definitely have time during the semester. I'd tell anyone taking a medium to heavy course load to do 410 and make their lives easy. 401 is a ton of work and very difficult, and in my opinion very worth it IF you have the time to really understand the work while/after doing it. In the weeds of the semester, it's really a ton of work. With all this said though, this is the first time I felt I've truly learned physics in a meaningful way in a class. If possible, take this class over 410! It's difficult but you really learn.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is required to take 400 level physics courses. Professor Padmanabhan is very engaged and works to make sure that students are understanding.",
                "Yes, absolutely! I would recommend it for physics majors instead of phys 410 despite the higher number of 410, because after having talked to peers who took 410 instead, I think you learn much more in 401 and get a much better foundation in classical mechanics.",
                "yes, for anyone that needs to learn classical mechanics Dr. Padmanabhan is a fantastic professor with a great course",
                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this course because it was really cool to learn a little bit about quite a few topics in physics. Although I don't think I truly mastered any of the topics we covered (as the pace of the course is pretty quick), I feel a lot more knowledgeable about what can be studied in this field and I am excited to try learning more in the future. The homework assignments take a while and can be pretty tricky sometimes, but thankfully there are similar problems in the online textbooks for this class to help you see how to approach some problems, and if your classmates are anything like mine, they will be more than willing to meet up and help you through everything, intellectually and morally. I think the grading was pretty generous and helped reduce some stress when trying to study some of these tough topics in physics--I felt excited to learn and didn't worry excessively about getting every single point on problems with longer calculations.",
                "I would recommend this course, but be mindful of the workload. The psets are very in depth, and while I definitely have a much deeper understanding of the topics, it can be a lot. It isn't listed as a requirement, but the first few weeks will be a lot easier for you if you have familiarity with differential equations.",
                "It's a great course to really understand this next level of physics. PHYS 410 is supposed to be harder than this class, but from what we heard, this course was actually harder -- because we really went in-depth and understood what we were learning.",
                "yes :)",
                "Yes",
                "If you're coming from 180, most certainly! You probably haven't seen Spec. Rel and/or Thermo, and 401 gives an excellent intro to that. From 200/260, you'll still find this class very very satisfying (defo more than 410 I daresay!) because Prof. P is hands down the coolest professor to learn physics from! You'd just miss Rigid Body Motion and Accelerated Reference Frames by not going into 410, but those are just stuff you can look up from the SAME textbook BOTH 410 and 401! (Even sometimes we have IDENTICAL problems with 410 folks). Plus, you'd get a fun intro (or a repeat of) Thermodynamics, in a bit of a new light!"
