   "comments": [
    "I developed a stronger understanding of so many challenging art historical texts and concepts.  I feel more confident in my understanding of the period as well as its relationship to the development of art history.  I also developed my formal analysis skills for abstract art.",
    "This course was an excellent overview of prominent Abstract Expressionist artists, and made sure to pay attention to the cultural and gender gaps of the movement.  We developed skills in formal and historical analysis.",
    "For someone who has not taken Methods yet, this class taught me so much when it comes to thinking about art in a comprehensive, critical fashion",
    "Deep familiarity with canonical literature of AbEx, some exposure to non- canonical AbEx, visual analysis of postwar art",
    "I developed my knowledge of art at the mid-century - which I had not previously studied.",
    "A greater understanding of the Abstract Expressionist movement from the American as well as international perspective, the ability to visually analyze abstract works and the critical assessment of primary sources such as essays written by contemporary critics of the AbEx era.",
    "I learned a new way to look at AbEx. I think it also expanded my ability to look at modern and contemporary art more generally, and really rooted my thinking in theory and art critique which I enjoyed."

   "comments": [
    "I learned so much in this course.  The structure of this course was nearly identical with other upper level art history seminars, but Professor Lee's approach made it feel entirely new.  Her syllabus was engaging, and extremely complementary, without being repetitive.  She led discussions in a way that engaged all students, but she wasn't afraid to correct students when they veered off track.  Rather than reading from a script, or regurgitating her seemingly endless knowledge, Professor Lee always responded to students directly and allowed the conversation to flow and develop organically. \r\n\r\nOne weakness might be that I wish we spent even more time in YUAG, but I know there is only so much you can do!",
    "The class material\/readings were well curated and took advantage of the YUAG's incredible collection.  The field trip to NYC was also incredible.",
    "I loved the way that this course was taught, the classroom environment and discussion were always engaging and fascinating. One thing that I think could be improved going forward, however, was that this class focused very heavily on Jackson Pollock, as opposed to he other Abstract Expressionist painters. I wish we had spent more time discussing artists other than Pollock--even the very famous ones like Rothko, Newman and De Kooning, who were very rarely the topic of discussion.",
    "Overall a great course. The workload was very manageable. It was nice to have multiple opportunities to present in class, and it was nice to have a final paper that allowed us to synthesize themes of the course with a subject that was of interest to us. Discussion was good and Prof Lee did a great job at making the material exciting and important.",
    "Well-taught, engaging, and thought-provoking.",
    "Pamela Lee is an absolute strength. The way she conducts class is really great in that she balances lecturing and discussion very well. \r\n\r\nSometimes the student presentations would go longer than I might have liked, but I was guilty of that as well."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely!!!!!! If you are interested in art, take it.  If you are interested in how art relates to the postwar period and the cold war, take it. If you want to understand what makes Pollock's drip paintings masterpieces, take it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course.  Professor Lee is intelligent, eloquent, and approachable.  The seminars are engaging and the discussions are lead clearly.  The course this semester included many trips to the YUAG and one to New York in which you are able to interact with the pieces on a personal level that is essential to their reading.",
    "A must take if you are at all interested in contemporary art. Professor Lee is AMAZING.",
    "Yes! I highly recommend any class with Professor Lee--she is brilliant, engaging, and very approachable. She made me look forward to seminar every week.",
    "Would 100% recommend. This is the ideal 400-level class: an in-depth, discussion-based study of a short era of great importance to art history. The readings were not always easy, but they were always enjoyable and rewarding. I thought I knew enough about AbEx going in, and am so glad to have found out how much there still was to learn.",
    "This class is not only one of my favorites I've taken at Yale, but also taught by one of the most intelligent and engaging professors in the Art History department! Professor Lee brings key insights and background knowledge into our discussions of art and artists at the mid-century as New York became the new cultural capital of the world!! TAKE IT!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in Abstract Expressionist art, it was a very engaging, multifaceted approach.",
    "Yes. I think Professor Lee is an absolute gem and everyone should take a course by her. Shes expanded my thinking and taught me so much. AbEx is also universally known but misunderstood, so I think many would benefit from it."
