            "comments": [
                "strengths: work deadlines were flexible, and Professor Jill was always willing to meet\r\nweaknesses: not a class for someone who has no background in ethnography, class discussions felt very fluffy and grounded more in vibes than academia. Some of the readings were particularly theory-heavy and weren't explained enough. Assignments are super open-ended, which is difficult if you don't have a relevant senior thesis or focused field of interest. Expectations for assignments are very loose, so it's hard to know if you're doing them right.",
                "Strengths: 1) Jill is an incredible professor! She is so knowledgeable about the field of ethnography and she explained different concepts very well, especially when they were initially difficult to understand from the readings. She is also such a kind and understanding teacher who was always receptive to student feedback and students capacities. It was a joy and highlight of my Yale career to be a student in her class this semester! 2) I enjoyed learning about ethnography and trying different creative ethnographic methods. 3) I loved the class community Jill and my peers cultivated together, and we had so many honest, open, and non-judgmental conversations that made me feel listened to and valued as a student.\r\n\r\nWays to improve: I would dedicate more time in the first two classes to explain what ethnography is and how it traditionally functions. This would have helped me, someone with no knowledge of the field beforehand, understand how the creative and experimental methods we were learning in class were so unique and different from traditional ethnographic practices.",
                "Strengths: Really creative and complex! Allowed me to really push my boundaries as a writer. \r\nWeakness: Just a super duper long class. It felt long. And we did not have as much time as I would have liked to get peer feedback on our submissions.",
                "Strengths: I think the class became a supportive community to express our unmarinated thoughts, workshop our ideas, and just be people. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course did not provide a stable foundation on what ethnography is and why we might do creative ethnography in the first place; more engagement with decolonial methods would have been helpful. While varying levels of prior exposure to ethnography were inevitable, I think the larger issue was varying levels of engagement. I think potentially listing this class under the ANTH department could weed out students and help focus the attention of course on ethnography.",
                "Strengths: the readings and assignments, Jill as the instructor, and the community that I found within the class\r\nAreas of improvement: class length and the amount of readings in the first few weeks made it a bit difficult to fully engage with the material"

I was able to explore topics I was interested in with more creative and imaginative approaches, and it helped develop some ideas for my senior project as well. Jill's assignments were fun and engaging, and Jill herself is a wonderful person in general."
