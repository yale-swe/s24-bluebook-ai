The subject matter is fascinating and I was always so engaged and invested in class discussions and readings. The writing assignments were also so much fun as our course materials were so interesting.",

                "This is a great course! I especially liked the trips to the YUAG and Beinecke, and I got a lot out of the regular seminar sessions.",
                "the main weakness of this course is a lack of ground-laying in terms of corrects terms for sensitive topics. For example, a certain reading used outdated and offensive terms for the LGBTQ+ community, especially in regards to sexual activity, and the issues were never acknowledged, but were encouraged by both the professor and students. This class would benefit from updated secondary sources that reflect the language of today, and the instructor would do good to establish what is and is not accurate or acceptable in the classroom setting.",
                "Strengths: amazing class discussions, readings, and materials were so interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes readings assignments were a bit too long (we had to read an entire book for one class), so I think the syllabus could be shortened so that we had more time to discuss important readings. Also, I would have appreciated more directions on the short essays! The directions given were a bit confusing",
                "Strength: the course subject! So interesting and so were many of the readings. I also enjoyed the slow build up to the final research paper; it was well paced and didnt feel overwhelming \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none I can think of"

                "I would definitely recommend this course! It was really fun, and you get to look at a good mix of primary and secondary resources. As a non-history major, I thought the class was accessible, and I know the questions and ideas raised in this class will stick with me for a very long time.",
                "Yes!!!!! This was one of the most fun, engaging courses I have ever taken. I learned so much and my writing improved tremendously. Dr T is an incredible professor - she is so great at facilitating meaningful discussion and gives great feedback on papers.",
