   "comments": [
    "The class never went into depth about any of the texts we read. Part of this is because translation makes close analysis difficult. The class also has no formal papers but open-ended reading responses and a final art project. The class therefore encourages interest in the readings rather than preoccupation with a good grade, but the lack of guidance on writing and analytical thinking means that I did not leave the class with a confident grasp over the material. Instead, I feel that I can recognize patterns (which is valuable in of itself, but limited). I think the class would benefit from at least one formal paper; it would be such a useful way to test understanding and encourage deeper analysis.",
    "Strengths: Professor Toorawa is a fun and lively professor. The actual course material is excellent as well.\r\nWeaknesses: the course is not organized at all and professor Toorawa does not have a plan for the actual information he wants to teach his students.",
    "I loved the creative final project. I do wish that Prof.Toorawa had given more space in seminar to discussion, but he also was very entertaining and brilliant just lecturing to us, so no complaints here. I also wish that we had received more feedback on our reading responses, since we went into our final projects without any indication of how we were doing in the class."

    "I recommend this course to anyone interested in islamic literature, which is fascinating. It is not a class that will improve writing or class discussion, but it does open your eyes to many aspects of literature that might never be mentioned in other courses.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class if you have an interest in the material. You will read some excellent stuff and Prof. Toorawa will really encourage you to explore the material.",
    "This course was a great introduction to Arabic-Islamic Literature. Everything we read was great, and some things were life-changing. This isn't the most organized class in the world, but it is incredibly fun and engaging. Dr. T is wonderful.",
    "Absolutely!"
