    "Lectures were AMAZING!! Professor Casetti it engaging, passionate, and knowledgeable, a unique combination that makes this class worth taking if you can take it with him. This class was very philosophical in nature, and a great way to introduce yourself to media and philosophy.",
    "Learned about Media Studies and what different areas can be occupied by media.",
    "I learned the basics of media theory and different scholars perspectives on the topic.",
    "I learned about the viewpoints of a variety of different media theorists.",
    "I learned about media.",
    "I learned a lot about media from a technical, philosophical, and political perspective",
    "Minimal things about media",
    "It was the first film class I have taken at all and loved it - it was so interesting to learn about important media theorists and their schools of thought",
    "I learned about the philosophy and methods behind past and modern mediums. I also learned about the why? of media and not just the how? For example, why certain mediums are effective at certain times and why some aren't.",
    "How to think critically about objects that I otherwise would have never given a second thought, and how these media affect my everyday life.",
    "I learned about different media theorists such as Debord, Ranciere, and Kittler. I also learned how to analyze various institutions as objects.",
    "I learned introductory theory to media and the different ways media takes place in society.",
    "Media theory",
    "About media",
    "I learned a great deal of philosophy on the mediums around us and human relations.",
    "N\/A",
    "Some new ways to think about what counts as \"media,\" and how media shape our everyday lives",
    "I learned about well-known philosophers and media theorists that I had not been exposed to before. I also became familiar with terms such as aura, media determinism, and others that have come up in other courses as well.",
    "I learned SO much about the nature of the relationship between media and ourselves. I honestly think very differently about my interactions with my phone, laptop, and specific applications. These days anyone would benefit from taking this class.",
    "Lots of theory on what mediums are and how we interact with our surroundings. Very interesting material.",
    "I never would have thought that learning about media theory would be helpful in any way other than getting this prereq out of the way, but it actually really offered my valuable ways to think about the world!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is not very structured, However, the material is interesting if you enjoy technology and media, plus Casetti is a very engaging lecturer.",
    "This course was very well-run. I really appreciated the guest speakers! Sometimes, the readings were long and could have been more engaging. However, I enjoyed the lectures and sections. I wish the lectures were not at 9:25am.",
    "Sometimes the class feels a bit weird and disorganized.",
    "The course definitely exposed me to a wide variety of media theorists, but the scheduling of the course was a bit confusing. It sometimes seemed like we were a week ahead in the readings and a week behind in our discussion sections.",
    "Honestly the lectures felt pretty disorganized, Casetti is engaging at times but doesn't really communicate well to his students.",
    "Some of the readings could be difficult at times -- including blurbs in the syllabus that offer more elaboration might be useful",
    "The lectures were hard to follow and irrelevant but section was fine",
    "I wish it wasn't so early in the morning, but other than that I have no complaints",
    "The lectures were a bit dry, but I'm not sure how that can be improved. The readings were incredibly slow some weeks also.",
    "Tended to become almost overly philosophical and hard to follow at times. There were certain sentences and arguments made by the scholars we studied that did not seem to make logical sense at all, but would be discussed as if scripture.",
    "The lectures were so compelling and Casetti always kept them interesting. The only thing I'd say is that over the course of the semester, people began not attending as much, especially because it's a 9:25. I think this course would work better if Casetti banned laptops and\/or moved the class to a later time.",
    "It is interesting to learn about the theory behind media but the readings can sometimes be very dense, and the lectures seemed to be more general around a topic rather than truly dissecting a reading page by page or idea by idea.",
    "Strength: sections were great, fluid, and thought-provoking\r\nWeakness: none posed",
    "More tangible readigns",
    "Understanding the sense reading materials",
    "N\/A",
    "Syllabus had a good mix of canonical media theory texts and new scholarship, but the organization of the curriculum felt a bit all over the place.",
    "A strength is that the guest speakers are interesting. The topics discussed in lecture are also interesting. A weakness is that many of the readings are very technical, making it hard to understand for people like me with no background in the media field.",
    "First of all, it shouldn't be at 9:25. They really struggled with attendance, especially because there is nothing about lecture attendance in the grade. The media philosophy is also quite dense at times and was tough to get through. However the section presentation and final paper were great. They were interesting to watch and fun to put together.",
    "The students are generally uninvolved and not a rich learning environment despite the interesting material."

   "comments": [
    "YES! If you can take with Professor Casetti, take this course!",
    "Yes, if you like reading and you are interested in technology and media.",
    "Yes!! This course is really interesting and a great class even for people just interested in the topic, but not interested in taking Film and Media Studies as a major. Its also not too much work, especially for a writing credit.",
    "It's a a prerequisite for film major, but the class does help you think about media in a different way.",
    "I took this because its for the major - really disappointed by the way it was set up and the TA didn't even seem interested in teaching the course.",
    "Yes.",
    "yes",
    "If you're interested in media theory and like great lectures from Casetti, then yes!",
    "Dont take it unless youre willing to do work for something not interesting or you have an interest in philosophy behind media",
    "Definitely take this if you have the chance! It was so fascinating and an amazing introduction to media studies",
    "Yes! Im personally very interested in the content and we learned a lot of useful information",
    "Yes, I would, but only if they were interested in the philosophy of media. I might also recommend it to someone that was interested in the technical side of media, but I would not to a student that had no interest in the subject at all.",
    "Yes, but more to deep philosophical thinkers than the average student. I can see why this class is a pre-rec for the film major, but if I were to construct the curriculum I would leave it out.",
    "Probably not.",
    "Yes! The medium is the message and we need to observe the different manners in which mediums impact our lives.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in media, this class is a good start. It is also a requirement to take greater level film classes.",
    "Yes! Chill class but quite worthwhile to take.",
    "Yes pretty interesting introduction to media studies",
    "Yes because it is a very good writing credit",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they were seriously committed to coming to the morning lectures.",
    "I would recommend it. It is a relatively easy writing credit. You have to write a 2 paragraph response every week and a final 10-page paper about a medium, nothing complicated.",
    "Yes, I know it's a requirement for film majors, but Professor Casetti is the one to take it with. When I could make it to class, it was great to listen to him. I'm not sure I got very much from the lectures though.",
    "I would. I think the readings and the profesor are amazing. So much to learn. But is definitely voluntary"
