                "I took this course after studying Korean at Ewha through the Light Fellowship, and it definitely helped me retain my skills and build on my knowledge of Korean language and Korean culture. This course was based around the Korean drama Misaeng, which follows a failed professional baduk player as he navigates work culture and the pains of corporate life. By watching this drama and discussing it with my peers, I was not only able to study grammar and vocabulary, but I also learned important Korean phrases, idioms, and customs that people use commonly in Korea.",
                "More advanced vocabulary necessary for critical conversations and academic debate beyond words needed for daily household communication. Korean proverbs, idioms, and their historical and cultural context. Learning with the K-Drama Misaeng especially meant I got to learn a lot of words and customs related to the Korean workplace.",
                "This course strengthened my reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills. We constantly had class discussions, group work, speaking exercises, and writing reports that have all helped me tremendously in improving my Korean.",
                "Ease in use of the language, especially speaking and listening, and cultural understanding of South Korea.",
                "I learned Korean language and culture. This semester we learned a lot of idioms and through the show Misaeng we learned workplace culture."

                "strength: Prof. Lee-Smith is the best! She's such a delightful teacher and just makes the class very fun, engaging, and worth it\r\nweakness: Watching the drama and doing the worksheets do take up some time",
                "I liked how open this class was in terms of work and projects. The homework we were given did not feel like busy work, and I felt like I was gaining something by doing it. I also enjoyed the fun activities that we did, including the mock trials and the debates. It was an exciting way to apply new vocabulary in a meaningful way.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lee-Smiths incredible ability to create a conducive classroom family, the friends I made through the class, flexible deadlines, learning Korean in a casual and project-based curriculum; Weaknesses: The clear discrepancy in skill level across students (wish there were a L4 class offered in the fall semester), wish we got to learn more about Korean history and engage in higher-level discussion that pushed our abilities further, the overall classroom attitude was one where many students seemed reluctant to participate",
                "This is a great class for native speakers to get more comfortable with Korean.",
                "The greatest strength-- Lee Ssn. She is INCREDIBLE. Definitely the most engaging, supportive, and genuinely caring professor I have had so far at Yale. She made me look forward to every single class especially because she created a class environment where everyone was close and comfortable. She really wants you to learn and improve whether in the class or also in office hours. The only weakness I could think of is that some of the assignments were tedious, but still extremely manageable.",
                "Very engaging, interesting exercises.",
                "The Professor is simply amazing."

                "Yes. This course was one of my best choices this semester. I am leaving this class with so many beautiful friendships and greater fluency in my mother tongue. I tell everyone whos interested in Yales Korean department that you need to wait it out to be able to take at least one course with Professor Lee-Smith. Especially as Professor Lee-Smith was so flexible with deadlines, I was able to engage in material not because of an extrinsic pressure to do so but rather an intrinsic interest and desire to learn the material. I loved Professor Lee-Smiths pedagogies (a lot of project-based and discussion-based learning) that made reconnecting with the Korean language (as most of us are heritage learners) very meaningful.",
                "I really recommend this class with Professor Lee-Smith.",
                "YES please take this course with Lee Ssn. I have never learned Korean in a classroom setting before this class but Lee Ssn was so supportive, helpful, and engaging that I took away so much more than just improved reading and writing skills. I met some of the most amazing people through this class that I will definitely continue to talk with after the class.",
                "Definitely. I learnt a lot and became more comfortable talking in Korean.",
                "Yes, this is a fun course and a great way to continue studying Korean at Yale. Taking Korean here is one of the best decisions I've made."
