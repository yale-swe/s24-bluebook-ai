I learned through this medium how to accept my own voice, my own opinions, and own confidence in my writing. I also learned the value of the audience and the sacred relationship between the writer and the readers. Mots importantly, I learned how to balance research and analysis with my own opinion and personality."

                "The strengths of this course are its ability to push you out of your comfort zone. I feel as thought the prompts of the assignments and our ability to choose our own artworks and write in whichever way we felt with a clear argument prompted various discussions on the role of the critique. We were challenged to find our own voices in the hopes of influencing a certain perspective or notions on certain artworks and artists. But this was also simultaneously balanced with having to maintain moral discussions on the actions of individuals and the controversial visuals of artists."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because of its ability to emphasize the importance of writing in the art world. I think if you have a thorough background in art historical analysis and writing, this course not only references art history but also aims to discuss the importance of cirques and wall text in the way such artworks have been perceived. It also poses a challenge to previous ways of writing about art, encouraging to dwell in one's opinion and try to understand simply why a work is not one's interest or a favorite."
