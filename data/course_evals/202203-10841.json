You know that feeling when you'd love to say something complex, but you can't find the right vocab / sentence structure to convey it in French? This course really helps you to conquer that type of learner's block. You learn how French people discuss literature and current events. Of course, it doesn't convert you into a fluent speaker - to do that, you gotta take this course and the ones beyond.",

The tests are sometimes challenging but never too bad, and you always know exactly what will be on them.",
                "strengths:\r\n-lots of class time that helps improve speaking ability\r\n-texts that are interesting and at an appropriate difficulty level\r\n-discussion based classes \r\n\r\nthings to improve:\r\n-I thought that use of a supplementary grammar textbook would have helped me in supplementing material in the course packet",
                "Strength: very interactive, since the class was 10 people we always had the space to speak when we wanted to. Madame Sherak is great about getting everyone involved in discussions!\r\n\r\nWeakness: if you miss a day of reading it can feel difficult to catch up. There are some crunch times for the class when you have a test and then an essay due 2 days later.",
                "Prof. Sherak is super kind and encouraging, and the course is very thorough in improving your knowledge and use of French! The main thing to keep in mind is that this course does require a lot of time to complete the work, but it's highly rewarding in improving your French."

                "Yep! I had taken years of French before college, but this was my first French class at Yale. Really good way to get back into the language, and it's gotten me interested in taking more French down the line. Also the instructors really have course structure down to a science! They made their own textbook with all the material you need for the class (le livret). Definitely make good use of le livret if you take the course.",
