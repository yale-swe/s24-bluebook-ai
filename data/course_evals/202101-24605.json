A lot of Jackson classes use a memo style or focus on practice, but Professor Rank's is the only one that I'm leaving feeling truly confident that I will use the specific skills he taught us.",

                "Learned how to write policy memos in concise, succinct sentences.",
                "I learned not just the history of Korea and great power relationships on the peninsula, but also how to be an effective diplomat.  I gained insight on how to write memos in the State Department style, as well as other diplomatic techniques used at the negotiating table and within the agency."

The small class size is also great for engagement and getting to know the Professor and classmates better.\r\n\r\nWeakness: None particularly to note, expect maybe more advice on the structures of memos.",
                "Prof Rank is by far the course's biggest strength! He is so knowledgeable, funny, and great at explaining very complex situations and issues in an easily digestible way. The readings are also interesting, and the group activities (such as the six-party talks simulation) were fun and let us apply what we learned in a hands-on, creative way.",
                "The lectures were divided half into historical review and diplomatic skills, with discussion and reading review in between, so every class had a healthy variety.  Guest lectures added real-world context to the reading material.  It was really well organized and a fairly holistic review of modern Korean geopolitics."

Additionally, misconceptions about the relationships between the two Koreas, China, and the United States are examined, giving an understanding of peninsular affairs more closely grounded in reality."
