                "Literature we read was interesting and enjoyable, Additionally Professor Holt made class very engaging and fun",
                "I loved the overall topic of metafiction. I really appreciated the diversity of texts we read, including the addition of a movie and tv show. (I personally didn't love Orlando, but I understand it's an important work of literature, so by no means am I suggesting to cut it.) In terms of the class itself, I thought for the most part the class discussions were good. Sometimes I wished we did more in-depth discussions in general: it often felt like we would look at maybe one passage, and talk about one thematic idea, and we would skip over a lot of stuff. I feel we could have covered more if each class moved at a slightly faster pace.",
                "Strengths: lots of discussion! Audrey encouraged group/partner work, and the small size of the class lent itself well to open dialogue and back/forth. Additionally, I really liked the way our assigned papers were structured we would have several benchmark deadlines that would allow us to give and receive feedback from our peers, and in the end we would receive a lot of constructive comments on how to improve our arguments.",
                "The course is great! The instructor was amazing and I really came away with a newfound interest in analytical writing which I didn't have before as someone who likes creative writing. I learned I wasn't as bad at analysis as I thought I was, and the feedback I got on my writing was extremely helpful. It's so nice how the instructors are so accessible about improving partial and rough drafts.",
                "I think there was a lot of reading and I could not keep up with it causing me to miss out on class discussions. Maybe summarizing the reading briefly for those that couldn't finish it so that we can be a part of the conversation still."

                "Absolutely! Audrey is a great professor, and the course material is very interesting. Metafiction is not something I'd ever had the opportunity to focus on, so this class was a great chance to delve into that new aspect of literature.",
                "Yes! I think if you are not sure about your analytical writing capabilities or have never really written English analysis papers, this is a good introductory course in a low-stakes setting, and I really love the discussions we have in class.",
                "Yes, as long as they take the reading time commitment very seriously and prepare adequately for that. Book selection was awesome."
