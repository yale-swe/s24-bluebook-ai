                "This class fundamentally changed how I conceive leadership and its role in my daily life. I have never before gone as far as to say that a course is \"life changing.\" This course was. LAB changed every relationship I have for the better.",
                "How to be a better person and a more effective leader.",
                "I learned about helpful psychological practices and theories of listening and relationships, gained confidence in making the first move and interviewing, greatly improved my listening skills and patience, and above all learned about myself.",
                "I learned how to actively listen, to ask deeper questions, to express gratitude more fully and more often, to engage in difficult conversations, and to give and receive feedback. I also learned how to write more clearly and to speak publicly with confidence.",
                "I learned a lot about myself as a leader and how to improve my modeling of leadership behavior!",
                "So much. I further developed core skills like empathic listening, asking powerful questions, giving and receiving feedback, expressing gratitude, and navigating tough conversations. I gained so much insight into who I am as a person, what drives me, and how I want to be remembered. Overall, I learned how to apply these skills to my life and become a better person as a result.",
                "I learned a lot about what it means to be a leader and how we can all practice leadership in our everyday lives at any capacity. The class helped me detach the ideas of positional authority from leadership and that has helped me learn more about how I can practice the leadership skills from class in different contexts. I have learned about the importance of gratitude and have benefitted a lot from the daily gratitude journal we had for the class. I have learned a lot about how to be a better listener. I have learned a lot from my peers' experiences that they shared in class and from Peter about how the topics from class can be applied to the different contexts of life. Honestly, this class has been one that has impacted my life and my relationships with those around me. I am a better individual, better partner, better communicator, better listener, etc. This is the best class I have ever taken. Literally no other class could even compare.",
                "Learned practical ways to be a better person and leader. Good insight into your own psyche and that of other people",
                "Emotional intelligence skills, as well as a wealth of resources for dealing with relationships and being a more effective team player.",
                "I learned so much about just being a better person in this class. I enhanced my listening skills, learned how to ask powerful questions, and was forced to step outside of my comfort zone and have tough conversations with people. These skills not only helped me as a person, but strengthened my relationships in my life.",
                "The biggest takeaway I took from this class was how showing care can go a long way. The most important pat of the class for me was the conversations we had with classmates and the listening skills we practiced during these conversations. After these conversations, we learned more about our classmates, and we were able to develop strong bonds among us near the end of the semester.",
                "I learned leadership skills, listening skills and how to connect with others.",
                "I learned so much about how to be an effective leader, contributor, and person in general. Specifically, I found the listening and conversation skills the most pertinent and impactful.",
                "I vastly improved my communication and leadership skills by taking this course. The class sessions and assignments force all students to interview other students, listen with empathy, and speak publicly. Overall, the class helps students develop skills to become better and more effective people (students, family members, team members, leaders, etc.).",
                "An awesome course to learn life skills, a great way to supplement some more of the rote learning classes, very applicable to everyday life, challenges students in a great way\r\n\r\nYou can learn leadership behaviors  from how to hold a microphone or stand correctly to how to ask good questions and be a good listener",
                "I learned more during this class more than any other class I have taken at Yale. Leadership and interpersonal skills that I now use everyday."

                "It was a holistically strong course.  I don't have any weaknesses.",

                "The class could have been a little more diverse.",
                "Strengths: Peter and the projects. Everything is great, but Peter really makes the class. Leading by example as an amazing and caring professor. I also think the projects are where the class shines. The interviews, small essays, and conversations you have to practice what you're learning are the most memorable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very few. There is a lot of reading, but Peter makes the responses straight forward. There also is just a lot to do in the class, it's a commitment.",
                "Strengths: Peter! Peter was by far the most attentive, caring professor I have had at Yale. He took time to get to know every student (in a 20-person seminar!) and to create a space where we all felt comfortable sharing our challenges with a group of strangers. I leave the class feeling like I really knew everyone -- more than any other seminar I have taken. Each week's lesson is well planned with discussions and activities. I learned so much about myself and about how to be a good team member. And Peter's feedback was superb! Even on weekly reading responses, Peter left detailed comments. He set the bar high for all future professors and supervisors. Weaknesses: Zero! I loved this class.",
                "Strengths -- the thorough structure of the course. You always knew what to expect from class, and all assignments were done to supplement the content of in-class time. \r\nWeaknesses -- the writing rules! They tended to be very strict and arbitrary.",
                "Strengths: Peter. He goes out of his way to get to know you, and I've never had a professor who cares so much about his students and his course. He provided so much insightful feedback to us and was always available to meet and chat. He is so invested in every single person, and it really made class a joy to show up to every week. The material is so relevant to everyone and the in-class activities were great ways to practice leadership skills in a safe environment. Peter also responded to our midterm feedback and cut some of the readings to make the workload more manageable. Some people were not happy with the writing rules, but I didn't mind them, as they made my writing more concise. Weaknesses: none.",
                "Strengths: you learn a lot of beneficial life skills, you get to meet and get to know Peter (huge strength), you read a lot of literature on the topics from class, you get to practice all of the things you learned in the creative assignments, you get to learn from your peers, you get direct feedback on your writing each week, you get three scheduled office hours throughout the semester to check in on how you're doing, you get to reflect on your own life and push yourself out of your comfort zone so that you can improve, just a remarkable class. I have never experienced such a rich and impactful class in my life!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it's capped so please try to get in early!!",
                "Peter really cares about students and their wellbeing and he is great. \r\nWeaknesses: Readings were kind of a waste, and the writing rules were inhibitors towards the end. I think they are a good thing to jhave at the start. They make you a better writer but then become too much and limit the overall quality.",
                "Biggest strength is the professor. Extremely engaging and committed to the class and what he is teaching.",
                "The strengths of this class could be written for ages and the weaknesses are slim. Most, if not all, of the strengths come back directly to the professor. Peter is a one of a kind person who cares deeply about this course and about every student that he teaches. As such, this course is designed so that each second you spend enrolled in it is meaningful and useful. We are always learning, even if we don't know it. Every reading, every assignment, every in-class exercise has either a clear or hidden meaning that will improve our lives in some way.",
                "I believe this professor is one of the most caring professors I have encountered. I cannot emphasize that enough. He cares, he cares, and he cares. Peter is a great listener, extremely wise, and someone who anyone is lucky to have in their corner. \r\n\r\nI think Peter fundamentally misunderstands the point of residential college seminars. These seminars are about practitioners teaching real world skills based on their career experiences. The people who teach these classes come to Yale because they can share experiences that career academics cannot. Therefore, residential college seminars are not classes to teach students skills that they can acquire in other Yale classes, where frankly, the Yale professors are far more qualified to teach them. Part of the issue with this class was the extreme amount of busy work (daily assignments, weekly assignments, 25 pages of papers, an oral presentation, etc). That would be an extreme amount of work for any Yale class, but for this kind of seminar, it didnt make sense. This felt especially true given that the assignments feltcompletely random. Each seemed interesting on its own, but none of them really seemed to have a point other than the fact that professor thought they were extremely profound.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest weaknesses of the class is that we were shackled with the rigid preferences of our professor. Specifically, a set of arbitrary writing rules were the most important part of the class.yet they were simply the professors preference. In fact, this wasnt an English class, or a writing credit, but the professor thought it was crucial to harp on his preferences for writing.  Its important to explain that some of these writing rules were not about style -  one of the key ones was about not having hangovers a made-up concept in which you should not have a line ending a paragraph without the words being more than 50% through the line on the page. Time and again I would have to edit the content I was trying to share so that the line would be aesthetically pleasing to the professor. It seemed rather silly.  \r\n\r\nHerein lies one of my larger criticisms of the course - it needs to figure out what it actually is. Is this a class on public speaking? Is it a class on psychology in the work place? Is it a class on gratitude and reflection? It could successfully be some of these things - but in its current form it suffers from the age-old issue of trying to do everything and ultimately doing nothing. To improve the class the random busy work assignments need to be ditched, the topics covered narrowed, and the focus of the class sharpened.",
                "The best course I have ever taken. Great hands on learning and practice.",
                "There are no weaknesses - every lesson, assignment, and lecture was incredibly strong and helpful.",
                "There are so many strengths of the course, it is difficult to list all of them. The ones that really stuck out to me were the writing rules, interview assignments, in-class speaking exercises, and Peter's detailed feedback on every class assignment.\r\n\r\nI struggle to think of any weaknesses. The readings were a bit long. Shortening them (or telling students which pages to focus on) might help students focus on the most important topics covered in a given reading.",
                "Strengths - awesome course to have at Yale and teach very intellectual individuals important leadership behaviors, as well as giving them ample opportunity to practice and implement what they learn\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - not a huge fan of writing rules, timing the class is effective at covering everything we need to but at times hinders good class discussion",

                "Yes. This course is one of a kind. Deeply transformative.",
                "100% period. It was an amazing class, arguably the best I've taken. The only thing is you have to be prepared to be vulnerable and stretch yourself in the process. This class was way more personal than I thought. I was nervous about my assignments, not because they were intellectually hard, but because they were emotionally challenging and exposing. This class is what you put into it, but it is absolutely not a gut. There is a LOT to do. Some you'll like better than others. But if you have the chance to take this class, jump on the opportunity, you won't regret it.",
                "Yes! You must take this class! Every student at Yale should take this class! A friend told me that I had to take it, and I was skeptical at first -- could one class really change my life? But believe the rave reviews! This class did change my life. If you can take even half the lessons from the seminar, I have no doubt you will become a far better friend, partner, and leader. It is such a gift to learn from a group of Yalies about their experiences, and Peter brings everything you could ever want from a professor (and more)!",
                "Yes 1000%. Everyone at Yale should take this class with Peter. I've never had a professor who cares so much about me on an academic and personal level. Peter went out of his way to make sure we felt welcome, and would meet with us outside of class to talk about whatever. He is so invested in the course and it made showing up to class every Thursday one of the highlights of my semester. You get to learn and practice so many important skills that are relevant in all facets of life, and I felt a noticeable change in my interactions and relationships with my friends and family. I enjoyed learning about the stories of my classmates too. This was the most emotional investment I've ever put into a class, and it was definitely worth it. I'm so thankful to have been able to take this class, and it has been my favorite class at Yale by far. If you get the chance to take LAB, take it!",
                "Most definitely, I promise you'll love it. If I had the chance, even I would do it again. I almost had to drop my major to take this class and if I went back I would literally drop my major to take this class. Please take this class. I highly, highly recommend it!!!!!",
                "Yes, great class but you get as much out of it as you put in.",
                "Yes. It is an excellent course that is completely different in subject and method to any other class I've taken at Yale. It is a workshop for a reason, active participation from students and putting into practice what is learned in class.",
                "This is the best class I have taken in 4+ years at Yale. It is not particularly close. I would recommend this course with every bone in my body. To spend a semester with Peter would be the most beneficial thing a student could do at Yale. You will learn so much about yourself and your peers, and will be a better person for it. You will be excited to go to class every week.",
                "I would recommend this course so long as people knew what they were getting themselves into. If you want to meet a caring professor and take a non-traditional class, this is a good option. However, there is a ton of work, and if having a rigid instructor bothers you, this class will be frustrating. This is not your typical residential college seminar. You will have DAILY and WEEKLY assignments.   \r\n\r\nSome of the reviews I read before I took the class declared this the greatest class at Yale...I did not come to the same conclusion. The truth is that I felt like I did a ton of work and learned very little.",
                "Yes!!! Best course I have taken at Yale. If you are lucky enough to get into the course you have to take it. Peter is amazing.",
                "Absolutely. Peter is the best professor and and one of the best people I have ever met.",
                "I could not recommend this course more. This class taught me communication and leadership skills (not just through reading, but through legitimate practice with other humans) that will make me a better team member and leader in any context. Most Yale classes teach students how to make calculations, solve problems, or write essays, but this course teaches students how to listen attentively, show empathy, express gratitude, engage in respectful debate, write concisely, and speak publicly. My only regret is not taking the time to fully engage with the readings. I plan to download the syllabus and re-read the readings this summer.",
