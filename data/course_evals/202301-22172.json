                "I think the workload for this class could be lowered somewhat. I also think there could be more connection between the work in class and the homework, because it often felt like the two were completely unrelated.",
                "Strengths: the material is fascinating. Because I am both a classics major and a linguistics major, a class which is essentially devoted to the linguistic study of Greek is perfect for me. Feedback is very clear on all the homework assignments as well, thanks to our great TF, Maria.\r\nWeaknesses: all this being said, I do not know how I could have approached this course without my linguistics background. This class implicitly has a lot of prerequisite knowledge: we are plunged into morphophonological analyses, so it is very helpful to have a background in linguistics, and, more crucially, we discuss the style and dialect variations of different authors, so it is really crucial to be quite well-read to get the most out of this class. This was my first L5 Greek class; in reality, it should be your last.\r\nWhether or not this class should be required for Greek majors is questionable: it is supposed to be analogous to LATN 390, but it also deals heavily with Indo-European linguistics rather than being focused solely on composition; in fact, composition is the LEAST fleshed-out of the course's three parts, since we only do composition as homework. Now, I still find this class absolutely enthralling, but this is because of my specialized interests. The information in the class is valuable to undergrad majors, but often it feels like it is on the graduate level."

I would also be alert of how linguistically-heavy this class will be; it is fascinating but can be jarring at first if you do not have any background in linguistics."
