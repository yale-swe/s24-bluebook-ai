                "Many great ideas about creating and evaluating effective public health interventions.  Particularly enjoyed learning about the concept of paternalism in healthcare.",
                "Great overview of the tenets of pop health / behavior change domains.",
                "Marney is a wonderful, compassionate professor that I believe knows her subject and is willing to work with her students. My understanding of epidemiology and public health has been elevated and I want to thank Marney for her efforts.",
                "I learned that public health interventionists cannot just educate and motivate individuals to change their behavior, but they need to consider other environmental, social, and behavioral factors, including accessibility, convenience, and environmental cues. I also learned more about the importance of emphasizing nutrition, mental health, and physical activity, as so many people do not meet the minimum requirements.",
                "More critical thinking skills",
                "I learned a lot about overall-health. I learned about how important it is to be cautious about our eating habits, do regular  physical activity and mental health. I became  more aware about these domains in maintaining over-all health.",
                "I learned the importance of self-care through improvements in nutrition, physical activity, and mental health.",
                "Marney is an amazing professor, who knows the material content and is great at teaching us!",
                "I loved this course. It helped lubricate the social dynamics that are required to be successful at Yale. My only suggestion would be to start on a similar timeline as biostats so students can form connections earlier that help in biostats.",
                "What an amazing class and Marney is GREAT! This was a well thought out class and great content at an appropriate pace. I am walking away with a better appreciation for Behavior Change and way to implement this course work in my everyday life (personal and professional).",
                "I gained knowledge of fundamental definitions of public health and an understanding of the challenges of behavior change. I also gained insights into the magnitude of obesity and depression.",
                "I really thought this course was incredibly worthwhile. The main skill I learned was methodology in how to change behavior. For the knowledge, I gained current knowledge on nutrition, physical activity, and behavioral health.",
                "I learned that it is hard to conduct research and account for all possible confounders",
                "I learned how to better approach wellness for professionals as well as populations. I learned and reinforced with actual data and science many things that I felt to be real and true...but now I can use this to inspire change. I took away valuable skills that have helped me communicate better with patients.",
                "- Overview of behavior change strategies\r\n- Theory behind behavior change\r\n- Had opportunities to get to know and work with classmates\r\n- Overview of important topics in public health (nutrition, physical activity, mental health)",
                "Learned helpful tools for behavior change relevant to public health but also skills that can be applied throughout my time in graduate school. I also gained further foundational knowledge in nutrition, mental health, and physical activity.",
                "I gained a better understanding of behavioral theory, methods and factors which impact behavioral change. I gained a better insight into my own mental and physical wellbeing and methods which can be used in a population level."

                "The videos were excellent and the slides.",
                "Went out of my way to connect to others in this course. The helpful environment helped me not only in this course but also in biostats in forming study groups.",
                "It was hard to juggle biostats and this class in a condensed semester, that was most difficult. I do with I was able to soak more of this class in vs having to spend so much time trying to catchup and keep up with biostats. I had to erase biostats from my brain for a few hours a few days a week to really focus on behavior change subjects.",
                "I actively participated in class, completed all videos in advance of class and most of the readings, and completed all assignments.",
                "I just kept on top of the schedule and went to class sections prepared. I also tried to provide leadership in the group break-out meeting by taking notes and arranging meetings.",
