                "I want to begin this course evaluation by saying that I DID learn a lot in MENG 363L, and at the end of the day if you take MENG 363L, you will learn a lot about the theory of fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. Also, the data analysis techniques you learn are really helpful if you want to pursue a career in academia or any field where analyzed experimental results would be necessary. Finally, this class did improve my skills as a technical writer tremendously (and this was put to the test when I had to write a 4000-word paper for a mechanical engineering elective and did it with some ease thanks to MENG 363L). Nevertheless, a lot of this was at the expense of my mental health, sleep, and happiness this semester.",

                "This class requires you to think critically about experimental data, process, and assumptions. It definitely improves your knowledge of fluid mechanics and thermo in a very sink or swim type of way. That said, it is very time and energy consuming, so if you don't build your semester to have a lot of free time to devote to this class, you will sink.",
                "Strengths - I do feel like I learned a lot in this class about fluids, thermodynamics, and data analysis. Also Gomez and Kevin are good about giving students mostly constructive feedback on their work in a timely manner to make improvements\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - this class is...a lot. It is the hardest MechE class at Yale, and it's really intense. I feel like the time commitment and weekly expectations is just too much to handle. You are expected to write one lab report per week, which for me worked out to be about 3000 words plus a ton of data analysis that alone took 10ish hours. Essentially, I could easily expect anywhere between 15-25 hours of work to be done for this class outside of the weekly lecture and lab session. The few labs that Gomez gave a week extension for were great - there was more time to do the work, and I feel like I learned/understood more of the theoretical background during the weeks this happened. I think the class could be improved by reducing the number of lab reports so that one is done every other week. If, say, only F3-F5 were taught (the labs after F3 were my personal favorites and I feel like I learned the most/was more interested in those) then students would have more time to spend on each lab report and could get a lot more out of it.",
                "This course is fairly well structured to evaluate knowledge of fluid mechanics and thermodynamics, which wouldn't be a problem if we had previously covered any of the material we did labs on. However, most of the topics covered in these labs were either not covered in detail during MENG 361 or 211 or not covered at all, which meant that to answer the questions posed in the lab handouts required either substantial independent study or guessing.",
                "This course would be great If I actually knew thermodynamics. This course works on the assumption that all students have a through understanding of fluids and thermodynamic concepts which I think is a flawed approach. MENG 286L is better structured in my opinion since it provides a thorough understanding of the content that will be addressed in the class labs. Other than that the 383L labs are interesting and applicable, I just wish there was closer guidance of the students and less of an assumption that students know how to write a good report, analyze data, and understand the concepts. If this class is a writing credit then it should be less focused on the analysis of the lab and content of the report and more focused on the ay the student presents their work. I thinks 286L was overall a more well guided lab class that actually successfully taught me how to write a good lab report.",
                "Strengths: Alessandro and Kevin are very knowledgeable and, by the structure of the course, I learned a lot about fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was far too much work, and since we were entirely virtual, we could not even do the hands-on labs that wouldve given us more insight into the experimental techniques that we used to collect data for the reports.",
                "This course tries to do too much in too little time. 10 labs in 10-11 weeks is simply not a feasible goal in a normal semester, let alone a virtual one marked by widespread student disengagement, burnout, trauma, etc.",
                "Strengths: This class pushes you in ways that previous MENG classes likely haven't. You may become a master at writing good lab reports, or you might barely tread water through the semester, but you sure as hell will learn how to write them fast for the sake of your sanity. So, it teaches you endurance. If we didn't have to get so technical and detailed, the labs would be more enjoyable because the concepts are cool. The professors did try at times to minimize the work we were doing with \"ultra-short report formats\", and the class has more resources available to students than in previous years.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Even with the adaptations made to some reports to be ultra-short bullet point format, the workload is killer. I have written more word content for this class than many people write on their thesis. Also, the depth of expectation and information you need to talk about is the worst part. I'm not worried about reaching the length, I'm worried if I'll have enough room to discuss everything I need to. Gomez is also hard to work with - you can't avoid it and you'll see for yourself. The best way to succeed in the class is to home in on what he's looking for in your reports by closely reading the rules and seeing what he focuses on in lecture.",
                "The workload is beyond absurd for the most part. Could be improved by reducing the number of labs to 7/8 and allowing more time and focus on individual reports. Also the lab handouts could be formatted in a more presentable and readable way",
                "This course requires a lot of work and a lot of proactiveness. I actually enjoy data analysis but there was just so much of it. I appreciate that this course was partially about application of concepts learned in MENG 361."

                "Having very dense labs week after week was very draining, cutting the workload in half would have made this class better suited for COVID learning. The professor's attempts at hosting office hours to help students were very beneficial in clearing up misunderstandings and providing guidance in how to address the labs.",
                "Virtual lab classes are always hard, but I actually think MENG 363L did a good job simulating the lab experiments by (a) discussing them in lecture and (b) having a live presentation and Q&A with the ULAs. In both of these sessions, we were able to run through the lab and ask questions. One of the most important parts of teaching during COVID-19, however, is accommodating students who are having difficult years adjusting to virtual learning. The sheer amount of time spent on this course (around 20-30 hours a week) is never healthy but is even worse during a semester where classes are entirely virtual.",

                "This class is required for the ABET degree, but if you have the option of taking it, seriously consider your commitments outside of this class and if this class aligns with what you want to do with your degree before you choose to take this class. In general, even scraping through this class is very time consuming. If you want to take anything from this class it requires more work. Lab reports take 10-25 hrs to do, excluding brushing up on the theory behind what you're doing. Gaining a sufficient-ish understanding of the theory and the experimental assumptions that go into the lab took me maybe 3-5 extra hours of absently thinking about this class while I was doing other stuff and reading through textbooks, wikipedia pages, and papers. For this reason alone, take caution enrolling in this course if you have the choice. That said, if you need to take this course and/or plan on needing this knowledge for whatever you want to do after graduation and want to take anything away from this course, make this a light semester. I only recommend this course if you are taking no more than 4 credits and leave time among your extra-curricular stuff to take time for yourself and decompress. Otherwise you will definitely get burned out and your mental health, performance in other classes, and understanding of what is going on in this class will all suffer. Professors Gomez and Gleason seem to be putting in effort to make the course more manageable. To address reviews from previous years, grading is consistently a week after submission and labs are shortened in the interest of saving time. Their efforts will hopefully continue in the years to come, because at least for me, I felt most confident in my understanding of the concepts when the labs were shortened or an extra week was given. When the work was less overwhelming (although still significant) I felt I was learning the most. Overall, I took a lot out of this class but also saw it take a lot out of myself and my classmates. Please be kind to yourself the semester you take this class, otherwise don't take it.",
                "No. You probably are only taking this class if you are ABET MechE, but with the way it is taught now it's way too much work. Nobody should be expected to basically write a full scientific paper in a week every week. The content is interesting at times but it is not worth it. Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to, and when you take it (unless the number of labs completed in the semester is dramatically reduced from 10 to 5-6) make sure the rest of your classes are easy.",

For the labs, get started on them as early as you can and email Prof. Gomez and Dr. Gleason as they give good feedback if you have specific questions.",
