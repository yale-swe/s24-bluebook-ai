The readings can be dense, especially if you've never taken an archeology course before, but professor Underhill is so accommodating and happy for any involvement. My favorite part was the last class where everyone shared what their final project/paper was about. It was great!",
                "This class represents the best of Yale. If you want a \"fun class that I want explore,\" this is it. While the class has archaeology majors and grad students, we who've had little to no experience never had to struggle. Learn about archaeology before graduating, it's VERY important! \r\nThe class is not without flaws... mainly, the discussions, which are run by students, aren't always as good... I know I was bad. Maybe in the future, the professor could lead more of the discussions, and students can submit questions in the end.",
                "Strengths: Professor Underhill is extremely nice and really tries to help people learn from all backgrounds of archaeology! Workload is not too much and feedback on essays are very helpful!\r\n\r\nWeakness: The readingS sometimes are a bit dense and sometimes gets repetitive.",
