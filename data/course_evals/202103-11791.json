                "This course was an excellent introduction to university-level English courses. I really feel like I was able to develop my writing skills and my ability to critically analyze works of fiction.",
                "Knowledge of what it means to be queer and developed understanding on the literary techniques used in modernist novels. Experience in writing and analysis of literature.",
                "I gained an understanding of the history and development of LGBTQ literature during the early 20th century, particularly the ways in which literary style reflected ongoing shifts in the public understanding of what constitutes a queer identity. Through this course, we focused on reading between the lines in texts for the gaps of what cannot be said or frankly expressed, which was a valuable experience.",
                "I learned close reading strategies and learned about some literary analysis.",
                "The intersection of queerness and literature turned out to be so much more vast and interesting than I had imagined before I took this class! We looked into the different spheres of life beyond gender and sexuality to which being queer extends - aesthetics, literary style, social worlds, friendship, bodies, fashion, secrets. The class also *really* helped with my close reading skills.",
                "I learned a lot about texts both commonly considered queer and not.",
                "I learned how to intensely analyze and close read literature; how to write a college-level literary analysis; about the background and history of famous modernist texts; about the influence of homoerotic writing on 20th-century literature.",
                "Close reading and strengthening thesis statements",
                "I learned how to read novels through a specific lens (in this case, a queer one). We covered a lot of queer history to put these novels into context, including the authors themselves. The books were all modernist I suppose but I think the main links between the novels was the continuous historical timeline (although in different locations) and the gayness",
                "This course gave a great overview of intersectional\r\nqueer history, as well as the analysis of literary techniques.",
                "I got much better at doing close readings of texts as opposed to broad analyses of plots and novels as a whole. The selection of texts, for the most part, was very enjoyable and Richards does an amazing job providing historical context and analyses during class. My textual analysis, reading comprehension, and knowledge of queer history has greatly expanded.",
                "I loved this course! As a mostly STEM person from a conservative state, I have never EVER had queerness acknowledged in ANY form in an academic setting, and even outside of content, this class was just amazing to be in. I also really appreciated this course as an overview of queer modernist literature with excellent context provided by the instructor. In addition, I do feel like my academic writing improved significantly.",
                "I found it so impactful how much queer history I was able to take in as a part of this course. It was also definitely a master class in contextualizing literature within history and the public attitudes of those time periods. The authors we read were not just faceless names behind the books, Professor Richards really made an effort for us to understand them as people. I was able to learn from this course in many different ways",
                "How to close read a passage, broad literary and historical knowledge of selected modern texts",
                "The close reading section of this class does help you with that skill, and I learned about more queer authors and texts.",
                "definitely an overview of queer modernist novels",
                "I learned how to delve deeper into readings and refined my ability to perform close analyses.",
                "Loved this class",
                "The theoretical framework that grounds the course of queerness not as a description of sexual preference but one describing a liminal space was very cool to track throughout the novels over the course of the semester.",
                "Good overview of queer history, ability to choose how much/how little I want to engage with each topic, critical thinking in essay writing/engaging discussion sessions",
                "I learned how to analyze passages and garner a strong understanding of the text's meaning through close reading exercises used in every assignment. I also learned more about authors I didn't know were queer & queer history of the 19th/20th centuries through the lectures."

            "comments": [
                "The weakness of this class was that \"Passage to India\" was one of the texts that we read.",
                "The material of the course was often centered on white queerness. I felt the course could have benefitted from more emphasis on intersectionality and removing the white gaze. Otherwise, the course was excellent, extremely informative and relevant, engaging, and overall enjoyable.",
                "I really enjoyed going to lectures with Jill. She's engaging and always shows us fun movie clips or songs. \r\nStrengths: Lolly Willowes, Giovanni's Room, Passing, Dorian Grey, Goodbye to Berlin \r\nWeaknesses: A Passage to India, Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas and Well of Loneliness",
                "Strengths were the assignments, which were super engaging and really fun to do. Content of the class could be slightly altered to incorporate more diverse perspectives from authors of the time (Latinx, African, Middle Eastern, Asian) and stray away from the Anglo-American complex (if you can). The xenophobia and anti-orientalism in certain works could become exhausting",
                "Professor Richards is an amazing lecturer, and the style of the class (a mix of lecture and discussion section) perfectly balances instruction with allowing students to develop independent analysis. My only complaint might be that the quantity of reading felt a bit much at times, and this unfortunately held me back from finishing every text and hindered my ability to fully engage with those I didn't quite have time for.",
                "Strengths:\r\nLarge selection of literature and great stories\r\nTAs and Prof are very good at explaining what is going on in the stories and in teaching what the key points of analysis should be. They are good at giving a starting point for developing your own ideas in your essays. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nsometimes difficult to keep up with the weekly readings if you're taking a lot of courses with high workloads. Approximately a 200-page novel per week.",
                "I thought that the lectures were fascinating, and I really enjoyed most of the texts from the syllabus. However, I wish there was slightly more effort to draw connections between texts  I also think that the syllabus could be slightly refined in order to create both more cohesion and more diversity (i.e. A Passage to India being removed).",
                "I liked the syllabus and liked the way the course was run.",
                "I loved this class overall - it could benefit from a reading or two from the non-Western world though! I enjoyed Passage to India because it was the only book not set in the West but since it wasn't a big favourite among the rest of class I think if it is to be replaced, a different book that explores queer lives somewhere in Asia would be best! We discuss racial and cultural impacts on queerness so much in this class - a non-Western perspective really is called for. That being said, I loved every reading we did do - especially Giovanni's Room and Lolly Willowes!",
                "The syllabus of texts was mostly engaging, save for \"Passage to India.\" I do wish that we could spend more time on each text, but I recognize that it would mean cutting something out.",
                "Strengths: constructive grading, awesome professor, interesting content, clearly outlined structure in the syllabus\r\nWeaknesses: a disastrous amount of reading each week",
                "Strengths: As someone who doesn't take may english classes, I loved that it felt accessible as a lecture (and got a lot out of lecture). I really enjoyed most of the books and section was really fun\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we could engage with the books more than we did, but only having a week per book makes that hard",
                "This course was always extremely interesting, but the lectures and readings felt disconnected from how we were assessed, which made it difficult to stay motivated to do so much reading.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Good selection of texts\r\n- Interesting and cohesive historical context and analyses during lecture\r\n- Discussion sections were fun\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Wish the powerpoints got posted on canvas",
                "Strengths: Dr. Richards is AMAZING. They were an incredible and engaging lecturer, and were really great at facilitating our own analysis of the readings. Also, they were quite funny. \r\nWeaknesses: Passage to India. Dr. Richards addressed their reasons for choosing this book, but ultimately I feel like there has to be a way to discuss colonization that's not from the perspective of the colonizers. I understand their struggle because it must be hard to find queer authors within the framework of modernism, which is inherently pretty western, but I do this this book could be replaced. I also think that having more BIPOC authors would be good, but I think Dr. Richards really thinks about the distribution of authors and backgrounds more than any other prof I've ever had. That being said, there were no books by authors who were POC but not Black.",
                "The strengths is absolutely the professor and the slate of TAs. Could not have asked for a more welcoming environment to learn. She also starts ever class by playing music from queer artists that the students send in throughout the semester. It feels very communal. And again, the way each novel is contextualized was incredibly well done, and made each story come to life even more.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness Id say is that there was a novel or two that didnt really speak out that much, and one which had problematic and upsetting elements, and although those were fully addressed and contextualized, it still was not super pleasant to read. This was a small drop in the overall bucket of the experience however.",
                "Strengths: syllabus is very well-structured and organized; Prof Richards is a wonderful professor and lectures were always engaging, assignments were challenging but manageable, Ciru (TA) is incredible\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a few texts could be swapped in the syllabus",
                "I think the class focused a lot on queer and I forgot about the modernist aspect of it by the end. Would be nice to continue to circle back to that.",
                "The class material was very interesting, but I think it suffered a bit because of the structure of the class. Section discussions felt a bit rushed to be talking about an entire book in 50 minutes and it felt like we didn't discuss as deeply as I would have liked. The lectures were helpful for background, but I think this class would really be better as a seminar instead of a lecture.",
                "The readings were amazing and lectures were low pressure. Overall, the students, TAs, and Professor Richards made the class enjoyable. Ultimately, learning was enjoyable which is rare at Yale sometimes.",
                "The longer books were hard to get through",
                "Personally, I think this course should be a normal seminar that meets two times a week. I say this for many reasons. Firstly, the lectures often felt disjointed from the text for me. That is, the lectures were more concerned with setting a socio-cultural backdrop for the texts rather than actually digging into the meat of the texts, which is something I didn't enjoy. I definitely gained more in section when actually close reading where in lecture I often wasn't even sure what sort of notes I was supposed to be taking. I would also say that the lecture format, when coupled with the speed of the course (one novel a week), disincentives actually doing the course reading. There was constantly this tension of knowing the books we were assigned would be rewarding while at the same time knowing I wouldn't actually be held responsible for the material (other than the three essays). Basically, the course is designed for a student to selectively engage in the material; moreover, when one does engage, the material being offered in lecture seemed more befitting of a WGSS or ER&M course rather than an English course. Section is this course's highest point, in my opinion.",
                "I liked how I could take as much or as little from it as I wanted with the lecture/discussion section format. A bit much to read so many books (approx. 1/week) but easy to follow along even if you fall behind every so often. Lectures are not attendance based but definitely amazing education for the sake of learning itself!",
                "A strength of this course is that the lectures were very engaging and easy to follow. I also enjoyed the variety of reading material which allowed students the ability to chose which books we wanted to write about for the assignments. A weakness of the course is that some of the texts were not very engaging and did not feel integral to learning the core concepts of this class."

                "Yes! Very important to understanding queer identities in the western imagination",
                "Yes! As a queer student, many of the texts we read quickly became near and dear to me. The teaching staff are incredibly helpful and insightful, and, though the quantity of reading is a bit much, the selected texts make it well worthwhile.",
                "Yes, you'll love this course no matter your background or experience with literature. It'll help you develop a new perspective or expand upon the one you already have.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it to a student who is particularly interested in the subject matter because I think that the lectures were a great mix of theory, historical context, and literary analysis. I'm glad that I got a chance to read these texts and hear the accompanying lectures, but I do wish there was more guidance in terms of the 2 large essays, and possibly a more defined format for how section discussions should proceed in order to make sure that there was enough time to discuss the nuances of the texts.",
                "I would recommend both to a student looking to get a writing credit and to a more serious English literary student. You can get out of the course as much as you put into the course. The assignments are fair and clear.",
                "Yes, especially if you're interested both in English literature/literary analysis and in gender and sexuality studies (if you're coming in for one, be prepared to do a lot of the other!). It's fun, light (plenty of reading but very low stress), and super interesting!",
                "Yes! A great class for both majors and non-majors.",

                "Yes! It was a fun, easy enough english class that people of all majors could enjoy",
                "Yes, this course is really interesting and well taught.",
                "Absolutely. If you are interested in queer history, experimental writing forms, or close textual analysis, thsi course does an an amaxing job at covering all of them. It taught my a broader swath of queer history, expanded my view of what writing could do and be, greatly improved my close reading and textual analysis skills. The lectures are always entertaining and interesting, and discussion section was always a joy. The assignments were few but thought provoking and fun to write.",
                "YES! I absolutely loved the course. I would recommend, with the caveat that it is reading 1 book a week, which isn't light.",
                "100% yes. I cannot emphasize enough how important this course was to me as a queer person. To be able to feel so seen in literary studies and so connected emotionally to the works at hand is an experience Ill never forget. Plus, even section felt very meaningful and communal. Couldnt recommend it more highly.",
                "Yes! Absolutely",
                "It's a good fifth credit! Or if you are an underclassperson then this is a good class with a lot of feedback for learning how to write english papers.",
                "For people who are excited to have discussions about queer modernist literature, I would not recommend taking this course. The lectures gave a lot of background, but I think I would have gotten more out of a more in depth discussion of the novels. Section felt way too short to discuss all that I wanted to, especially with the pacing of the class.",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed the readings and the manner in which the course was taught.",
                "YES!!!",
                "I personally wasn't wowed by this course, but I could see why someone would enjoy it. The texts we read are definitely interesting and a large majority of the people taking the course were queer in some respect, so it was definitely a comfortable and inviting atmosphere to discuss the liminality of queerness  that is, people were able to bring their lived experiences to the texts in a way that is not true for many other English courses. At the same time, I didn't like the lecture format. I think this would be a cool fifth class, but I wouldn't necessarily say this course exemplifies the greatness of the English major.",
                "Absolutely! Amazing lectures and discussion in section.",
