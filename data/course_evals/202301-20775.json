                "I think the course was taught very well and I came into the course dreading it and I actually very much enjoyed class and felt I learned extremely well from it. The professor is very good at explaining concepts and teaching the material. The homework was representative of the material covered in the class. \r\n\r\nI felt the tests were designed to be far too complicated compared to the material on the psets and lectures. The class is curved (first exam average 71%, second exam average 64% so it has to be) but the distribution we were given essentially had the average being the cutoff between a B and B-. I have done just below average on exams and very well on problem sets and feel strange since I feel I have a very good grasp of the concepts covered, but that my grade will be low due to overcomplicated tests. \r\nAdditionally the exams are 4 questions long and on the second exam there was material on 1-2 questions that was from chapters of the book and problem sets we were told the exam wouldn't cover and much of the class hadn't studied those parts. \r\n\r\nI would be giving this class flying colors in terms of instruction and the class overall if it was curved with the average having a higher letter grade cutoff or if the exams were designed to be more representative of the material on the problem sets. This was a class I enjoyed taking, it is just frustrating to be in a low grade range and feel I have done a great job with mastering material.",
                "Strengths some TAs and peer tutors were very helpful\r\nWeaknesses  lectures were unclear, hard to follow, and not helpful. The exams were not representative of class material and homework",
                "Lecture was not effectively done throughout the class, problem sets were not reflective of tested material, and exams were so distinct from material covered in class.",
                "this was not a great course. I feel like the lectures were structured in a manner entirely non conducive to learning. The only strength of this course was the peer tutoring.",
                "The lectures are very dense and so is the textbook. The content is simply not that interesting or applicable so it is hard to stay focused.",
                "This course simply tries to cover too much material. It moves too fast and every single week there are three new topics or strategies we cover. I feel like our understanding of the material would be greatly increased if we just focused on a little less material. I think the instruction was good, but it expected us to pull a lot of our own weight to learn that quantity of really complex material. Especially since this course is just a prerequisite and is taken in tandem with many other demanding courses in engineering majors, it is unreasonably difficult and time consuming. The problem sets made sense in terms of difficulty, but the exams would choose the hardest cases to test us on.",
                "maybe more practice during class",

                "Strengths: great textbook alongside good lectures facilitated a deep understanding of the concepts, homework assignments were engaging, professor and TA's were very willing to help. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the material in chapter 10 felt a little bit crammed, perhaps we could move a little bit faster earlier in the course or cover 1-2 fewer sections in the previous chapters. Also exam questions did not necessarily match style or difficulty of problem set questions.",
                "Strengths: well structured class, covered a lot of material in depth, professor was funny and engaging\r\nWeaknesses: none to be honest, class got the job done.",
                "Taught too fast and I think tests were unfairly hard.",
                "I think the pace could have been faster near the beginning and slower at the end, given the ramping difficulty over time of the course",
                "I really liked Sohrab. I think he was a great lecturer and tried his best to keep the content interesting. He talked about the real world applications pretty frequently. His handwriting was scribbly at times but all in all I really learned a lot from this class. It was hard, but based on previous reviews this is about as good as it could have gone. The exams were absolutely brutal though, the first midterm average was a 71, second midterm was a 64, and the final average was a 60. I learned a lot even though it was hard.",
                "Lots of problems to solve\r\nProblems arent similar to final exams which the professor told us in the beginning \r\nInteresting course materials",
                "Just the way it was set up was terrible. Learning nothing in lecture. Terrible teaching. Going to class was literally a waste of time. Super unclear and he would always make mistakes in the slides. Hes literally was copying slides from the textbook not even writing the math down on a board and still couldnt copy the slides correct. So many errors. Pretty bad experience do not reccomend. Note to all students the professor you take the class with really really matters in your overall experience.",
                "Strengths: The professor made things engaging and as fun as possible. \r\nWeaknesses: The content wasn't my favorite and I basically just took it as a requirement. The lectures weren't always clear and went through a lot of content in the last 2 weeks but this is partly my fault for not reading the textbook before class as recommended.",
                "It is very frustrating studying for exams with the resources you have (the textbook and lectures) just to go to an exam and discover that the professor has decided to put a modification of the types of problems you learned in class and on problem sets into the exam, so most of your studying was just a waste of time. The exams were just so demoralizing. You can study 20h for an exam and still do rubbish. It was just a horrible horrible class for one's mental health.",
                "Strengths: The course did a good job of covering all of the essential techniques for solving and understanding differential equations. Sohrab was a good instructor who taught clearly and kept the classes engaging and entertaining. He kept a good balance between theoretical understanding of the material and learning practical techniques for solving equations. The midterm formula sheet competitions were a lot of fun, and it was always entertaining to see the formula sheets. Most importantly, I truly learned a lot in this class about differential equations, and feel prepared for future classes where I might need to use this knowledge. Weaknesses: Sometimes Sohrab went through derivations and proofs rather quickly, while I think spending more time on them could have helped me understand the material better. Students should also be aware that although the problem sets start out relatively simple, they get relatively more challenging and time-consuming over the course of the class.",
                "A strength was the organization of the course as it followed a very logical progression from one topic to the next that facilitated learning and applying the content. The homework related directly to classwork so helped students master the content in a challenging but very fair way. More office hours hosted by the professor would improve students learning ability.",
                "Strengths: the material itself is very interesting and applications very relevant to engineering, especially towards the last half of the class. Weaknesses: lack of transparency in the grading philosophy, exams were very theoretical\/proof-based even though this is a class for engineers, lectures were too fast to the point where students often left lecture more confused than entering it.",
                "A lot of concepts, we covered by going through the proofs of the concept. Although this can oftentimes be interesting, this is not how I learned best, and rarely helped me understand how to apply concepts to answering questions. I would have preferred if we had spent more time going over questions and how to apply the concepts to a solution. I felt like I understood what was going on, but then when it came to Psets and exams, I didn't know where to start.",
                "Very fast paced, but I think this is inherent to the structure of the course being comprised of both ordinary and partial diff eqs.\r\nStrength: engaging and patient professor and TAs, active on ed-discussion, teaching staff open to suggestions from students. Lots of available help and support.",
                "I know there is a lot of material to get through, but I think if somehow the pace could be reduced just slightly and some formatting elements of the course remained consistent, it would be much improved. Towards the beginning, there are many slides that summarize how to do certain procedures that I would regularly reference when trying to do the homework or study the material. These slides got harder to find moving later into the course as I got lost and found myself unable to catch up, so it would be nice if slides like this were highlighted as summary slides, and if they were more consistently included especially for more difficult topics like series.",
                "Lecture slides for this course were organized very well. I do not have any weakness that I can think of for this course."

                "This course focuses on straightforward content; however, Professor Sohrab's Psets do not translate to the type of questions he presents on the exams. PSets are very mechanical and long and sometimes contain applications-based\/theoretical questions. Questions on exams can require an in-depth conceptual understanding of the content that is not presented in lecture or on PSets. I would only take if it is required for your major.",
                "Yes if you take it on a credit D fail basis. I enjoyed taking this class and learned a lot from it. The exams and grading curve is very difficult and thus if possible I'd say it is a fun way to learn about differential equations and is taught phenomenally, but the grading is incredibly difficult with exams and having a small error at the start of a problem getting all subsequent parts wrong so take on a credit D fail basis to enjoy it more.",
                "No. Do not take with this professor",
                "I would recommend other students to make sure the professor that is teaching this course is the right one for them. This class is fairly difficult, and becomes more difficult without the right professor. It's probably a major requirement, but don't make the same mistake I did and take it as soon as possible but rather wait for a better professor to come around.",
                "No. Not with this professor. You will just end up learning from the book, which makes actually taking the course a waste of time.",

                "Absolutely not. The only people that should take this course are engineering majors that absolutely have to. It was not a good math class as it was too fast and didn't walk us through all of the logic. Most math classes don't teach both partial and ordinary differential equations in the same semester. It also was't a good engineering class because most of the problems, with only a few exceptions, weren't applicable to anything real and is something I will probably never use as an engineer. Some of the problems were relevant, and they were the coolest part of the class. All of the proofs and random unbased equations I could've gone without.",

                "Yes if you want to learn this content, this class is for you.",

                "Probably not unless major requirement but I would recommend the professor",
                "Yes if it is required for their major.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in science or engineering, this is absolutely relevant to your field of study! It was really interesting for me to see equations I had seen in other classes and had blindly the solutions for, and actually learn how to solve them.",
                "yes to anyone who needs it. I'm not sure why you would take DiffEQ otherwise but if you do, I definitely recommend taking it with Sohrab!",
                "No but unfortunately it is a pre rec for the engineering major.",
                "Only if you need it. I think its incredibly useful though. Ive already seen applications of what Ive learned here in many of my other classes.",
                "If you have to take it take it. If you dont have to take it and youve never seen differential equations before and have a huge course load, just make sure you take it with a different professor.",
                "Absolutely not. If your here you probably have to take it. If so dont make the mistake I made. Try to find the best Professor you cant take it with definelty not with sohrab.  You will learn nothing in class be stressed and just have a really negative experience with a very beautiful and important topic.",
                "Only as a requirement - it's a lot of work.",
                "If you do not need to take this course for your major then please do yourself one of the biggest favors of your college career and do not take this class. Unless you have an innate passion for solving differential equations, this class will suck the joy out of your semester while also doing significant damage to your GPA. There's nothing too exciting about the course that I would think somebody should use one of their \"spare\" credits on this. It's just a lot of long and tedious algebra on the problem sets combined with the most horrific exams you will ever take in your life.",
                "Yes, if taught by Sohrab. It's an essential course for physics and engineering, and well-taught in my experience.",
                "Only take this course if you have to or if you know that you have a really strong interest in applied differential equations, it is a hard enough course that it shouldn't simply be shopped for a QR credit. If you have to take it though, it's hard but taught well and organized enough where it will be fine.",
                "You likely are taking it as a requirement for your major if youre engineering. The best advice I can give is to always follow up on lectures with the textbook so that you can keep on top of the material. And make sure to start the PSets as early as possible because some can get very long.",
                "I would not reccomend this course to another student. It demands an extemely high level of work in order to be adequately prepared for the exams which for some reason always tend to have questions that are much more difficult than the problem set questions. You are expected to know the material so thoroughly that you can adapt and basically learn new things during the exam period when presented with a question that you've never seen before. One could say that is ideally the goal of any course, however, the amount of material covered makes it nearly impossible to learn everything to this extent especially if you have other time committments which most of us do. Lectures are difficult to follow, your time is better spent going more slowly though the slides and reading the textbook. Extra help is hard to come by, there is only one study hall a week with one TF present, the peer tutors often cancel their hours, and other office hours are inconveniently timed. Unfortunately, this class is required for many like myself and they don't have the option not to take it.",
                "Its required for most people who take it, but also yes. It has the capacity to be interesting and is very important for further math courses. I just didn't have the best time myself.",
                "No, but this is still one of the better taught versions of the course out there. Sohrab is very smart and knows his way around the material, but his psets and exams are a genuine intellectual challenge and getting an A is not possible unless youve studied differential equations before. Be warned!",
                "Yes if you want a solid understanding of diff eqs broadly, and their applications. Appreciated the connections made to mechanical and electrical systems. Does not really go into theory\/very fast-paced so if interested in pure math, take the math one.\r\nIf you do not need diff-eqs for your major\/already a full semester, maybe rethink taking it, because it is high difficulty, high workload",
                "Do not take this course unless you have to, and based on what I've heard, you should try to take it with Prof. Bennett if you can. I really wish I listened to that advice when I got it.",
                "Yes I think this course is a really good course for learning an introduction to differential equations."
