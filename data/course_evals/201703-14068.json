    "this course gave me a much better understanding of the various tools and nuances involved in trying to form and guarantee international human rights. I now know more about the function and effectiveness of treaties, the roles that institutions play in changing norms, and how past progress in rights areas happened from a historical pov. the course also gave me knowledge of a survey of different human rights problems occurring from refugee rights to racialized zoning problems, as well as a historical overview of the development of human rights language and importance.",
    "evaluating normative change on an international level, different types of human rights violations, how to write a policy memo, what are the different methods in inciting human rights policy change.",
    "One thing I learned is that the universal idea of human rights does not necessarily serve justice. It taught me that just because intentions are benevolent, it does not mean that the practice is the same. For example, although governments may have innocuous or even benign intentions, in reality, they may not have the political will to properly implement their principles. In terms of skills, I learned to articulate nebulous ideas by looking into specific cases and explaining them before moving to my argument.",
    "I learned a lot about human rights on a global scale and what may or may not to improve human rights around the world.",
    "I learned about different strategies for human rights advancement and how to critique them."

   "comments": [
    "strengths: good foundation for engaging with human rights language\/research, really enjoyed the discussion facilitated by Prof. Sanchez, was very well-rounded in coverage of different human rights topics, we engaged with both the theoretical and practical applications of human rights law. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: the reading load was pretty disproportionately heavy in the beginning of the semester (although that worked out well with my late midterm\/final schedule); I would have appreciated more guidance on how to write something similar to the memo we had to submit for the final.",
    "Lots of freedom to explore the topics I'm most interested in!",
    "Strengths: Discussions were relevant to our assignments, and because of the clas s structure, it was easy to follow them. \r\nAssignments were challenging but reasonable. Students were assigned to do a presentation on a topic of their choice, and write two papers-- one for midterms and one for finals. The final paper required students to write a policy proposal based on the class material as well as ideas based on outside research. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing I can think of.",
    "I really enjoyed the structure of the class, where we focused on one aspect each week that could improve human rights around the world and talked about what may or may not work. I think there could have been more focus on law, though, since the class is called human rights law.",
    "Strength: discussion based\r\nWeakness: needed more variety in who spoke in class; more time for reflection and actively engaging quieter members of class"

    "I would definitely recommend this class if you have any interest in understanding what composes this nebulous concept we call human rights, and how we ensure that these rights even matter to countries in the status quo. The class gives you a broad survey of the history, tools, and progress made in different areas, and depending on who is in your seminar, pushes you to ask hard questions about what kinds of trade-offs are okay in the pursuit of rights or humanitarian causes, and truly think about how to make progress in each of these areas. The workload was okay - there were a lot of readings, but they were all incredibly interesting, 1 midterm paper, 1 final paper, 1 presentation on a human rights issue, and 2 reading responses. The final paper was written in a memo format about a human rights issue of your choice and included recommendations to improve the situation, which I found difficult, but a good exercise in practical thinking and the language of conveying information\/recommendations effectively.",
    "Definitely! Very important topics presented in clear and engaging ways.",
    "Yes. The course teaches us not what to think, but how to think. Because the course material was specific and dealt with specific cases such as refugee issues and gender rights, I thought we would focus on facts. However, the Professor did a great job using those facts to illuminate broader contexts and the overarching theme of all the issues we examined.",
    "Yes. It was very informative, and I feel like I can understand current events even better now.",
    "Yes, definitely"
