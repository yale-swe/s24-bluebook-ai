                "Strengths: pretty chill class, not much work outside of class (short weekly psets that you can work on during class and a final paper), prof explains science/reasoning behind lab techniques pretty in depth\r\nWeaknesses: somewhat disorganized, uncertain schedule, not the most efficient use of time, we fell kind of far behind which made it difficult to write the final manuscript",
                "Strengths: Professor Nelson! He is so kind and seems to really care about this class. Because our experiments would occasionally fail, Prof Nelson would repeat all of them for us to make sure we dont fall too behind. This class is relatively low workload, which really helps you be more engaged with the actual content.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class was a little disorganized at times, leaving a lot of us confused on what we were supposed to do. The final paper was also a bit too long (at least 8 pg single spaced) considering how some of our experiments failed and we had to cut our projects short.",
                "This class is excellent for learning new techniques and the science behind them. However, this class is incredibly messy and disorganized. Procedures are changed at the last minute and it seems like there's minimal structure to the class.",
                "I liked how the course was designed as a research project. However, this also means that if something goes wrong, like it often does in research, you are not always able to complete everything you would like.",
                "strengths: I greatly enjoyed the overall course and found it really interesting to learn the background biology and information about why experimental protocols actually work in achieving our x goal. \r\n\r\nweakness: The class was a little bit disorganized at times, although that is sometimes how research goes when experiments don't quite work out.",
                "The course changes every time that it is run based on what the lab we are partnered with wants! However, that also brings up the issue that at times the course could feel a bit disorganized, and it was hard to find certain things on Canvas. It was also hard to gauge how well I was doing in the course because a hefty portion of the grading was done last minute.",
                "You learn a lot about the processes of what you do in lab like PCR, gels, vectors, bacterial transformation.",

                "Yes, it is a great course to take and you do learn really useful experimental techniques and knowledge that would be concerned with genetics. The lab course does take a bit amount of class time, although not too much time outside of the scheduled lab time.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I will say that something which is difficult with lab classes is that they expect you to have pre-existing knowledge/research experience, which feels counterintuitive at the same time because this is a class that is supposed to teach you such lab techniques.",
                "Yes, especially if you are an MCDB major looking to fulfill your lab requirement. Professor Nelson is super knowledgeable and really helpful if you have any questions.",
                "No, the grade basically depends on how the TA is feeling, and you will not know how you are doing all semester. The class is also unorganised, and it is hard to expect what is going to happen."
