                "The homework doesn't match up with the lectures in class well, so it's kind of hard to do homework.",
                "Strengths: fairly interesting material, Professor Kenyon's lectures are clear and helpful, reasonable problem set length and difficulty \r\nWeaknesses: little support outside the classroom; I would recommend for the professor to actively post a reading schedule instead of having us guess what chapter we're doing, since most of the lectures are straight from the book anyways; more ULA\/TF office hours would be helpful as the material gets difficult",
                "I think that professor Kenyon was an engaging lecturer. However, I thought that the second half of the course material was pretty boring because it was just day after day of random theorems in graph theory. The class did not have a good flow and just felt like a hodge podge of material.",
                "strengths: covered a wide range of materials. I had already knew a lot of the combinatorics coming from competition math, but I still was able to learn a lot  from the game theory sections\r\n\r\nweaknesses: lectures seemed a bit unorganized at times, but were well structured overall",

                "Strengths: Professor Kenyon is a very engaging lecturer, and I enjoyed the problem-solving sessions on Thursdays. The problem sets were very challenging, and the exams were fair given that they were timed and closed-book. We cover a fair amount of material, especially combinatorics and graph theory. Weaknesses: We didn't get much feedback, since most of the homeworks weren't graded until late in the semester. The class had widely varying backgrounds, which made it difficult for Professor Kenyon to pace the class and know what prerequisite material to review.",

MATH 244 is kind of like \"Defense Against the Dark Arts\" from Harry Potter in that the syllabus changes every semester and the professor changes less frequently. This was Professor Kenyon's first semester teaching the class and while fun at times, I found the syllabus topics to be a little bit random. One day we would be learning combinatorics and then another day we would be pivoting to graph theory and then colorings. At the end of the semester, it was hard for me to wrap my head around what exactly discrete math is and its applications. It would also be very helpful if the lectures were recorded. And this class, like many others, had issues with the graders.",

                "I think the TAs could have been a little clearer in their explanations. And I think sometimes its not worth spending all of class time on proofs that are too complex for HWs or exams.\r\nI liked that the class was very didactic and very manageable. Overalll great class!",

The solutions to psets contain mistakes, and are generally not helpful. Most of the combinatorics in this class are like math competitions, i.e. useless. I don't know why the heck we learn these counting tricks when I will forget everything immediately after final. Would recommend to make things more intuitive and visual, like the graphs.",

They weren't on the final though or any of the problem sets so it didn't have any impact other than being a bit confusing. Every week, we worked on problems in groups for a portion of one of the classes, which was nice. \r\n\r\nIt was kenyon's first time teaching the class, so it was a bit disorganized at the beginning. Also problem sets took too long to get returned to us.",

                "Strengths: Very well-designed course around a good textbook, content is fun and workload isn't too bad\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Work felt repetitive at times and some problems required such outside thinking that I could only do them in office hours (but such is the reality of discrete math).",

                "This course provides an excellent basis for a number of topics in discrete math, especially those which have applications in CS. This is the course's main strength--it surveys a wide field, and provides a challenging introduction to these CS topics.\r\n\r\nIt's fundamentally a proof-based math class, and applications are not always so obvious or well-explained. This might be a strength or a weakness, depending on your interest in pure math, but overall I'd say it's more favorable to pure mathematics than applied math.",

However, he did a good job explaining concepts, and an even better job when he had more time to prepare for the class. Side note: I thought the textbook was excellent. Worth reading and processing.",

                "Pretty well taught all around. The nature of the course is hard to compare year to year since the topic is so broad. I enjoyed it as is. The graph theory section of the course got very involved with proofs that we never used in any application which could be cleaned up.",

While challenging, it is quite accessible, with the only prerequisites being basic calculus and linear algebra.",

Prof. Kenyon lectures very well and clearly, and was always willing to re-explain things and answer questions. As far as math classes go, this one is lighter than most others. We followed the textbook pretty closely. Problem sets were not too bad -- maybe 5-6 hours\/week, and exams were easier than the problem sets.",

For reason two, Kenyon is honestly great. His lectures go at a very reasonable pace that even a first year can understand and begin their Yale math career. If only I was more interesting in discrete math, this would've been a great math course.",

The first half of the class is a lot of combinatorial counting and the second half is mostly graph theory; I found the second half harder because I haven't done proof-based graph theory before. You are expected to do rigorous proof-writing but they don't provide any guidance so be wary of that. The grading also felt arbitrary at times, perhaps due to that fact - over the course of the semester, I got full credit for incomplete proofs but nitpicked on much more foolproof solutions (at least in my opinion). But Prof. Kenyon is great and it was a very worthwhile class to take. Would highly recommend to all CS and math majors regardless of experience.",
                "YES! This was only my second proof-based math class (after math 225), and the difficulty of the class felt perfect.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course primarily to math majors, especially those with an interest in computer science, and particularly motivated CS students. It is a proof-based math class, and the applications are secondary. This is variously a strength and a weakness, depending almost entirely on your interest in abstraction.\r\n\r\nIt was a lot of work, but it was rewarding work, and I feel like I learned a lot. It's not an easy class, but if you're interested in and decent at proof-based math, it won't kill you.",
                "I think the course was pretty good for those interested in the subject, but the textbook was not good and grading was not easy",
                "Sort of. I think the content was extremely interesting, and some of the proofs were downright beautiful. However, I think it could have been better organized and taught, and I feel like it would have been nice to get more detailed feedback on our work at more points in the semester so we could learn better. The problem sets tended to be interesting, but I feel like we didn't have many other opportunities to show what we knew. If you think the math is cool, you should consider taking the class, but don't expect a stand-out amazing class experience. The professor was a nice guy but I wish he was more available.",
                "Would definitely recommend to any math or cs major due Important topics and the different and interest type of math covered.",
                "Yes, the topics were interesting.",
                "Its a niche area of math, but helpful in building mathematical thinking as an intro course. Take it if you need it for future courses or to fulfill a requirement its a great option.",
                "This course is ideal if you are interested in higher level proof-based mathematics, or if you want to do computer science and wish to have a strong grasp of concepts related to algorithms and computational complexity.",
                "Yes. The PSETS were pretty interesting",
                "Yes! This is a very interesting course if you are interested in math, and it explores a lot of cool things outside the traditional introductory math sequence.",
                "good course, informative",
                "The course is interesting, but it is also challenging. With the way it is currently structured, with psets being graded late and the lack of practice exams for the midterm and final, there is little way for students to get feedback on how they're doing (though to be fair, the psets being graded late is out of the professor's control and is on the graders). However, as such, I would recommend this course only if the student has a strong math background already (ideally in competition math) or if they were extremely motivated and can dedicate a lot of time towards doing well in this class."
