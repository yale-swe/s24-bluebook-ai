   "comments": [
    "strengths: a first-person account of conflicts mentioned\r\n\r\nweaknesses: organization",
    "While the course brought in great speakers and guests, we didn't have much time to have an extensive discussion among one another and engage with the readings. I wish we would have more time to reflect and process on what we read and heard from speakers by allocating substantive time for discussion.",
    "The strengths of this course really come from the exposure it gives students to conflicts. We had the chance to talk to people who lived through all of these conflicts, as well as diplomats who were present during peace-building efforts and reporters who were on the ground at the time.\r\n\r\nI think a weakness was that we were often given reading that we did not end up discussing in class. I would have liked a bit more connection between assigned work and class discussion. The class also did not stick to the syllabus -- understandable because we had to adapt to the availability of speakers, but it was sometimes hard to know what readings were assigned for each class.",
    "Janine was really great about bringing people in whove had first hand experiences with these conflicts as well as talking about her own experience. However, sometimes that left little room for discussion.",
    "I think it was an incredibly valuable and engaging course. My main recommendation would be, if possible, to have a more concrete lineup in the speakers\/dates so that we don't jump around from conflict to conflict in our discussions. Given the nature of the speakers we have I know that it may be difficult so that's not a priority, but doing each conflict more in accordance with the syllabus order may be useful.",
    "The course readings could have been more specifically tailored to what we were discussing each week.",
    "The course design is very good. The topics selected for discussions are representative and assigned readings are very helpful for students to gain background knowledge. I think this course could have been better if the time allocated to each of the four topic could be more balanced. I felt we spent a lot of time talking about the first topic and rushed through the rest."

    "yes, learned a lot and important conflicts to learn",
    "Yes - it was really interesting to learn about conflicts from people who had lived through them or worked in their peace process. It definitely provides you with a unique understanding of humanitarian intervention and war reporting.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, to understand international intervention dynamics today, it is crucial to understand the history behind how those dynamics came about.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students who are interested in gaining general knowledge about the wars and journalism."
