One aspect that I think could be improved is if we dove more deeply into readings during class. Sometimes, we got onto tangents and drifted away from the readings.",

                "I thought this is a very well balanced course, and I have no major criticisms.",
                "Strengths: the class is organized well. I liked the \"case-study\" like aspects where we spent each week progressing through different eras/vaccines \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Though this is a seminar style course, sometimes I felt some visual timelines of the events we talked about would've helped make discussions more digestible",
