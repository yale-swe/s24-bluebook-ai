    "speaking, reading, writing and a lot of Swahili vocab",
    "This course taught me a lot of Swahili grammar and gave me what I needed to do well studying Swahili abroad this summer.",
    "I improved my grammatical constructions, expanded my vocabulary, gained confidence in complex sentences and reading the language.",
    "- I can speak swahili for more than 15 minutes. \r\n\r\nSwahili is probably one of the most beautiful languages one can learn at Yale. From the class, I got the introductory vocabulary, and a mastery of foundational grammar rules."

    "Great course, great professor, great TA",
    "The Professor knows how to break the language down in a manner students can digest and understand.",
    "Easy class if you put in some effort.",
    "The professor and TA are extremely helpful and engaging. A bit more focus on vocabulary would be helpful.",
    "The course is well structured for the skills I mentioned above. I think an improved level of listening \/ speaking might aid our learning. And a greater variety of techniques in learning grammar \/ vocabulary might have helped. Sometimes it was difficult to know what vocabulary was worth knowing for tests and what was just being told to us for slower integration.",
    "The course does immerse students in the language and culture.",

    "Highly recommend the class, you will learn a lot and the professor and TA are amazing.",
    "Swahili courses are my favorite courses I've taken at Yale. I really enjoy learning the language. Mwalimu Kiarie and Mwalimu Gertruda are amazing, and they make learning the language easy. They also make sure you have everything you need to excel in the course.",
    "I would recommend this beautiful language to many and I think the atmosphere of this classroom was very warm and conducive to learning. I felt like we were even a community after spending 5 days\/week learning together.",
    "Yes, it is great beginning course for those who want to learn about the Kiswahili language and African culture.",
    "Yes. If you have ever wanted to \"leave your comfort zone\" this is the chance of a lifetime. DO IT! You will learn something fun, and will get the most out a 9.25am."
