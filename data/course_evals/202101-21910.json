One thing that would have been nice is if there were more students in the class (there were three in my class including me), but I understand that is simply due to the number of enrollments.\r\n\r\nStrengths: the course was well structured, and did its best to accommodate the students' needs. The course also worked remarkably smoothly considering that it was a lab class taught online. All materials for the course were provided via mail and the teachers set reasonable expectations given the limitations of what we had. \r\nOn top of this, the class was itself very interesting, and I admit that I enjoyed messing about with the lab assignments.",
