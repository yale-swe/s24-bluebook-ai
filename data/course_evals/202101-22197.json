The syllabus was very interesting at first, but towards the end, it felt like my engagement with the texts was lacking. I truly enjoyed listening to the importance of Omeros and its sections on postcolonial reckonings, but I had a lot of difficulty actually reading the text.",

I really enjoyed how this structured our class time and allowed everyone to participate and share their insights, and also how it aided in studying for finals and generating essay topics!",

I feel like this course offers a lot not only in terms of the work on the syllabus, but in terms of analytical skills in general.  Prof. Hagens provided clear feedback on every reading response, essay, and on our participation in class."
