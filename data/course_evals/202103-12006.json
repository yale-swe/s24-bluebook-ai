If you take the assignments seriously, you will spend 4+ hours per assignment sometimes.\r\nWhile I think improving one's writing skills is important, I feel like there were sometimes too many questions and it was almost impossible to do the homework justice while staying within the word limit."

                "Yes, but know that it's a lot of work if you are not a totally fluent Hebrew writer. 250 words per class (twice a week), in addition to occasional projects and presentations. That being said, it's a challenging, rewarding class that can be genuinely fun if you make an effort from the beginning to get to know and appreciate the other students in the class and their personal relationships to the issues at hand (make a whatsapp group asap!) and if you bring the ideas that you're interested in into the class (Professor Roginsky is very encouraging of this). If you want to feel solid talking about Israeli politics and social issues in both Hebrew and English, this is a great class, but be prepared to think very critically and to dissect these issues with nuance.",
