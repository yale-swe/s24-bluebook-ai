                "Having smaller sections in which we gave out speeches was great and really helpful from a learning perspective! One got comfortable with the group and better learned how to give and take feedback. The lectures where we were not in our groups however were very long and a bit less engaging which makes it harder to concentrate for 2h. Would be great if we had pauses for those lectures and maybe a more interactive way of teaching tose topics.",
                "strength: concept of class\r\nweakness: smaller class size (just 12), more engagement with the prof, encourage greater commitment",
                "The strengths are the structure, the readings, and the professor. I loved learning from my peers in their Speeches to Teach and became well versed in public speaking techniques. The only weakness would be an occasional wasting of time  sometimes we wouldnt have much to do in section and would just chat. It was also dependent on section leaders  some section leaders would just let their students leave.",
                "The class was amazing! There were were so many strengths. The only weakness is that I wish we had more one on one time with our professor while giving speeches.",
                "I enjoyed the variety of the speeches and how they challenged me to persuade others in different ways. Prof. Morrison was a wonderful teacher, and the TA's were also extremely helpful in leading sections and making us feel comfortable.",
                "Weaknesses: Sometimes the TAs were absent\/didn't know what was going on\/didn't offer as high level of engagement as the Professor",
                "It's great that a public speaking course is offered, but there are definitely weaknesses. Prof Morrison goes on really long monologues where it's hard to stay engaged, and your whole experience is highly dependent on your section. It became a very skip-able class, which people did unless they had to give a speech that day. It was a lot of time in class every week, and didn't always feel useful.",
                "Fun and informative class but should be more intensive so you can learn more and so people put in more effort. Im not trying to be annoying saying that, I know others would agree. I would love if we could have more impromptu speeches. Thank you!",
                "Having speeches as assignments made the course really interesting and fun. It really helped me to step outside my comfort zone. It could be improved by spending more time on breaking down the readings that we did."

                "Absolutely yes!",
                "Yes, but it's not as \"life-changing\" as other people have called it. It helps with a very specific type of public speaking: speeches that are heavily outlined, prepared, and perfected beforehand. If you're looking to feel more comfortable with impromptu speaking, then this class is unfortunately not designed for that. It's also quite poorly organized, and class time (two hours twice a week) isn't used super effectively. You basically just get practice giving five speeches in front of a group of people (that became increasingly small as the semester passed, and was sometimes like three people). It's nice that you're guaranteed an A, but that also means how much you get out of the class depends entirely on how much you put in. However, it's definitely still one of the most useful classes you can take at Yale, so it's worth taking.",
                "This is a good class, very wonderful and supportive professor and TFs. Thank you! However, there is a very clear way this class could improve (based on conversations with classmates and my own experience.) The class is too chill. Im not joking. When a class is as chill as this, ppl show up and people dont care. I wish this class was a little more rigorous. You do a fun intro speech. Then three bigger speeches. Then a fun closing speech. All to your small group. I think everyone should have to give more short impromptu speeches throughout the semester in addition to the current speeches. Additionally it would be good to do those in front of the full class so students get practice with a bigger less familiar audience. That would really push students further I think.",
                "Yes, it was so fun to do multiple speeches and learn from other students during their speeches."
