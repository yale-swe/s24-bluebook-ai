I learned so much about my own strengths and weaknesses as a writer, my writing process, and the ingredients that make up a compelling personal essay.

                "Strengths: The sheer volume of writing one must do. There is simply no other way to improve than to... do. Anne urges us ever onwards in our writing by giving us ample opportunities to, well, write!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course is organized, it seemed to me, in a very despairing way. \"Loss,\" \"Pain,\" and \"Pandemic\" were some of the few topics we had to write about. I wish we had corresponding topics of \"Discovery,\" \"Joy,\" and \"Laughter\" or something like this. To be fair, we did have \"Love\" but in my mind, this is close but no cigar. My only point is that I wish the course gave equal space to write about happy and joyous things (which are an equal, if not bigger, part of one's life) as it did to write about sad things.",

                "Strengths: Annie puts so much thought and care into the syllabus and the class. I've never had a professor so personally invested in their students. The biweekly one-on-one conferences are especially helpful as you get to line edit your essays with Anne and talk through your stylistic choices with her. Anne also encourages a friendly and supportive environment in the class so there were never feelings of competitiveness reading and commenting (only positive things!) on classmates' essays on Canvas was one of my favorite parts of the class. With a couple of minor exceptions, all of the readings are fabulous, and most of the essays/books were works I would've liked to read in my free time anyway. The workload for this class is definitely no joke but for me, it was a valuable opportunity to focus on my writing intensively since my major is not creative-writing-related at all. The time and work investment was definitely worth the growth I experienced both personally and as a writer.\r\nWeaknesses: The essays, readings, critiques, author presentation, and Canvas posts can add up. The workload is high (but worth it!). The seminars are long and involve a lot of mini lectures from Anne. Sometimes the discussions felt a little forced/overly guided.",
                "I learned the most from the peers in my coursea group of such diverse writers from all differing backgrounds, identities, interests, and writing styles. That's the most important part of the course, I think: how much we all drew from each other and supported each other."

                "I recommend Writing About Oneself conditionally. The opportunity to write about personal events is a huge one. But it can sometimes be frustrating, if you are a hopeful and happy person, to be constantly surrounded with readings that deal with authors' pain, and loss, and death. To be fair, there were some humorous and witty and happy pieces, but really not very many. If this is unproblematic, then onwards! This course is for you. Frankly, the sadness that we had to read dogged me while I was reading, but when I was in class it faded behind what was a dynamic and fun weekly lesson.",
                "Yes! It is a lot of reading, and a lot of writing back to back, so definitely do take this course when you have the space in your schedule (and mental space) to really give it quite a bit of energy, but it's worth it.",
                "yes",
                "I would recommend this courseinteresting texts, useful tools for writing, and Anne Fadiman is very kind. One thing about the workload: It's not the kind of course in which you can do it all of the homework in a day or two if you go hard. There are a lot of little assignments that basically necessitate you working on the class a little everyday, or 5 out of 7 days of the week. You get used to it, and I found the work fulfilling, but just know that it's a different kind of high workload than your average class. \r\n\r\nBtw, it's not the end of the world if you don't get into this class. Don't build this up to be the end-all, be-all. There are many good teachers with inspiring classes.",
                "Absolutely! Every student should take this class, if possible!",
                "YES!!! If you have the opportunity to take WaO, do it! I entered the class with a lot of insecurities about my own writing, and the group of students in the class was so extremely talented that I was intimidated at first. But this class really taught me that each person has a distinct voice and writing style that it is impossible to compare! You'll learn so much from Anne, your classmates, and the readings. It's rare to find a class where you can engage directly with your peers' writing, and I felt like reading other WaOers' essays each week taught me just as much (if not more) than the seminars and syllabus readings. The essay prompts provoke a lot of reflection and introspection that is always valuable in the nonstop world of Yale. Where/when else can you write for fun, read amazing works by your talented classmates, and learn from a gracious and wise professor? I'm a senior and this was probably the best class I've taken at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone interested in growing exponentially as a writer. If so, this is the course for you: don't be afraid to take on the challenge, because it's all worth it in the end."
