Focusing on what makes a novel \"novel,\" this class taught me valuable skills in close reading and understanding nonstandard literature practices and how to read and compare more classic literature with graphic novels and other \"novel\" techniques.",
                "Definitely how to write about very abstract ideas and plan for longer papers. This is a course that focuses on analyzing interesting novels from a very metaphysical point of view. You learn to work with nebulous concepts.",

                "The seminar itself was very engaging, and I enjoyed the friendly and collaborative atmosphere of the discussions. I do think that sometimes the students got a bit too comfortable (talking over each other, or texting during class), and this could be a bit distracting from the material--maybe this behavior could have been lightly addressed when it got out of hand.",
                "To me, the biggest strength of this class was Prof Bher engagement in our discussions was helpful but never overbearing, and she let the students really take the lead in guiding our conversations. In such a small setting, only 9 students, I felt that my peers and I really got to know each other, and beginning each class with small group discussions helped us bond and allowed for us to share our reactions to the material in a lower-pressure environment before jumping into our full-class discussions. One weakness of the class was because the volume of reading for each night was so large (often 100 pages), we often were not able to talk about the entirety of the assignment in class, and anyone who got behind on the reading had to play major catch-up in order to stay on track. Conversely, because we read so much, over the course of the semester we got a comprehensive look into the subject matter; the 5 novels chosen painted a nice picture of the breadth of postmodern literature.",
                "The novels the professor chose were very interesting and integrated into the themes of the course very well. The in class discussions are a key component of the class and I liked listening to my peers thoughts on the novels. The professor is also a strength to the class. \r\n\r\nI felt that the grading criteria could have been better explained clearer and if the essays were switched out for projects or creative written assignments it could be more in line with the innovative nature of the course material.",
                "Professor B. lets her students control most class discussions. Most days, she presented the class with a few discussion prompts and let the class ask questions and say whatever we wanted to each other. This sort of unstructured teaching may be a weakness if the students are not thoroughly engaged in the class material, however, this past semester, everyone cared about the books we ended up reading, and class discussions benefitted as a result."

                "I would recommend it if you enjoy literary analysis and are prepared for a challenge. It is not an easy course, but I definitely learned a lot!",
                "Novel Novels was truly one of the highlight classes of my first semester at Yale. Partially because I made incredible friends in the course and partially because I was interested and invested in the subject matter, I found myself looking forward to each class, which definitely made the early mornings bearable. I would absolutely recommend this class to someone interested in the material, but not to someone just looking for a writing credit who is more hesitant to take on the nightly reading load. Prof B is an incredible ally to those who genuinely want to get the most out of the class, but she is by no means lenient with gradingif you do take this class, I recommend taking advantage of office hours or meeting with her outside of class, and not to be daunted by one-on-one meetings after essays.",
                "Yes, especially to a very literature-oriented person or English major. I learned a great deal from the class and feel that someone who loves modernism and postmodernism may enjoy the class thoroughly .",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as long as that student doesn't mind long rambling arguments about post-post-post modern confusing frame narratives! Hahaha. This class was really fun for me, someone who already enjoyed discussions about postmodern fiction, however, I imagine that the convoluted stories studied in class could be offputting to someone not already interested in literature. You really get what you come for with this class. It's taught well though, so I would recommend it."
