                "The main strength of this course its ability to cover a good deal of useful information and skills; I feel as though I gained more practical knowledge from this class than most other courses I've taken at Yale so far. The material is all made readily accessible and available on the course website, and Prof. Slade takes a lenient, learning-oriented approach to the class. The main weaknesses are that lectures can be somewhat difficult to follow at times and that direct questions to the professor do not always receive an answer which wholly addresses the question. However, I did not find these weaknesses to pose a considerable obstacle to my learning.",
                "Strengths: Abundant office hours, problem sets are generally doable, exams are very fair \r\nWeaknesses: some problem sets were frustrating and I can't imagine doing them without office hours, class lectures were sometimes a bit slow",
                "I really enjoyed this course! I had taken CS50 over the summer a couple of years ago and then YData last fall, and I wanted to learn more CS. This course was very practical, with helpful ULAs and comprehensive problem sets. It was definitely a lot of work, but if a student is willing to put the effort in, I found it quite worthwhile.",
                "weaknesses: I didn't see any reason to attend in-person lectures; a lot of the time, Slade would ramble off and discuss irrelevant content. Office hours were really inconsistent and sometimes had no-shows. why did we have hand-written exams... with not even a single note sheet? it was super unrealistic and inapplicable to the real-world.\r\n\r\nstrengths: the psets were well-designed to teach content (although, at times, overly difficult).",
                "Strengths - extensive overview of Python and you will finish the course with a lot of valuable knowledge of material; psets were time-consuming but overall helpful for exams; office hours and lecture notes provided a lot of help  \r\nWeaknesses - lectures were not always easy to follow, not a lot of feedback on assignments",
                "lectures are a bit slow, however psets are very engaging and well-written. grades could be released quicker",
                "This course was great for what I needed, which was skill building and practice coding in python. The lectures are not the most engaging or effective, but the homework assignments and notes definitely helped me with this task.",
                "I think the course was good. I wld love to have more support OH during reading period, or before the exam. The TA's were brilliant, the professor, I loved ( esp learning abt his experience as a programmer).  I liked the assignment, except SQL, although  easy, I didn't  feel the way the assignment was designed facilitated learning. The Cryptography part felt rushed, and didn't  really sync with everything  else taught in the course.",
                "I never went to lecture for this course because they were so slow and dry that I struggled to pay attention, so I learned everything online instead. This lecture needs to be more interactive or better structured with slides. The online office hours were really helpful, but there was often only one TA available at a time and there was no cap on how long someone could spend in an office hours session, so the wait times were really long even if you signed up as soon as office hours started. The assignments were well-structured and quite interesting.",
                "The homework was a great way of reinforcing the ideas that we learned in class. Lectures often had technical difficulties and weren't that engaging.",
                "It is a very broad course so there is a lot of coverage of different subjects.",
                "Reasonable problem sets, spend time on them independently and you will gain a good amount of knowledge and hands on practice",
                "Strengths: can learn/review everything you need to know through the lecture notes/recordings, Psets were helpful to understand material\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were sometimes very monotonous"

                "Pretty good intro to Python class. Slade is a nice guy but can be a pretty unengaging lecturer. Fortunately, he does good course notes and that combined with watching class recordings on 2x and helpful TAs should get you through the psets. I had a hard time picking up what to study for on the tests, but I found that giving myself enough time to go over previous material left me in good shape.",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in learning Python; the workload is not very intense, but you will learn quite a lot.",
                "If you want to learn some Python, I think this is a decent course. You will get out of it what you put into it. There is Python practice and there is material to learn, if you are motivated and genuinely want to learn it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking to improve their CS. I learned a lot from the lectures, exams, problem sets, and ULA office hours, so I think that anyone considering it should take it as long as they are willing to put the work in.",
                "Sure, you will learn Python quite well! It's not a weeder course unlike literally every other CS class, so you can actually appreciate what you're doing without overly stressing. Slade is also quite funny, although, he did stray off-topic quite often. ALSO, pay attention in lecture when Slade goes over PSets; he basically hints/tells you exactly what you need to do.",
                "If you are interested in getting the CS certificate, then yes. It gives an extensive overview of Python and is a good intro for other coding classes",
                "Better intro than 201, especially if you're a nonmajor!",
                "yes, if a student wants to say that they have a tangible skill in a programming language. Not very suitable as an introduction to coding",
                "You should absolutely take this course if you want to get some better practical programming skills, and especially if you are interested in python specifically. If you want in-depth programming theory, there are much better courses out there.",
                "Yes, nonprogrammers learning, but also aft finishing cs100, this is a better option, cz cs201 can be kinda confusing, learnt more from this course  than 201.",
                "This is a good course for anyone with programming experience looking to get a strong foundation in Python. I think it's much more practically useful than 201, because Python is so widely used, while nobody uses Racket. It has interesting components and applications, but a lot of the course is pretty dry. I would not take this course if you are new to programming.",
                "Yes, if you want a good introductory course to Python that isn't too intensive and covers a broad spectrum of topics.",
                "I probably would not recommend. I think there are better courses you can take to learn computer science fundamentals. The lack of grade transparency and office hours made the course frustrating at times.",
                "Yes - learned a lot of useful skills. In my opinion the better version of CS201 because this material is very applicable and hands on with coding vs theoretical. I was able to learn material that I didnt understand in class by reviewing the lecture notes",
                "Yes, its an essential for learning Python."
