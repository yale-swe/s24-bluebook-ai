    "I became confident in basic Italian grammar and learned how to communicate in Italian.",
    "I learned a great deal of vocabulary as well as grammatical constructs, including 4 verb tenses. In addition to developing my writing skills through weekly compositions, I developed my speaking and listening skills.",
    "I acquired a basic knowledge of Italian, which has been very useful for reading texts in that language.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: However they teach the language, it works. I learned more Italian in one semester than all the French I learned over the past few years of high school.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Vocabulary is not emphasized, so I have to frequently refer to a dictionary, but that's alright. It comes later. Also the tests were very easy. It might be better to have a little more of a challenge.",
    "Simona is an excellent professor who cares that students grasp each concept, always willing to further explain topics when students are having trouble. The course could possibly be improved by doing less nightly activities from the textbook, which are not always helpful to learning.",
    "The main weakness of the course is the textbook. It does not have good explanations on grammar, the content is not organized, and contains just a few exercises. \r\nThe main strength was the instructor, who was very professional and tried to compensate the deficiencies of the textbook with her explanations in class.",
    "The class meetings were well designed to engage everyone in the class to practice speaking. The one way I could see it improve would be if it incorporated more cultural aspects into the lessons."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a very good class in which you learn a lot while not being overwhelmed. I did DS this past semester and Italian paired well with DS in that the workload was not immense and in DS we read some facing-page Italian works like Dante and Petrarch, and it is neat to be able to sound out the poetry and understand it directly from the original language.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend this course because while the class is fast-paced, it is manageable. By the end of the course you will already know a sufficient amount of vocabulary and various verb tenses.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yes, it was favorite class this semester."
