It felt amazing to have time every week that I had to set aside and really focus on improving my art skills, and I definitely noticed improvement over the course of the semester. I would especially recommend this class with Danny. Their kindness and investment in their students shone through every single class period -- when they were chatting with us before and after class, giving thoughtful and specific feedback about our work, and designing class activities to be fun, engaging, and instructive. Even though there was a wide range of artistic backgrounds, they created a welcoming community within the class, and we all learned from each other during crits. They're also knowledgeable and insightful about art, which was most apparent when they were giving us guidance on our final projects. They could always think of other artists or art traditions that could give us inspiration or add another dimension to our work.",
