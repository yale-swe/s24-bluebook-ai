Definitely something that I havent ever encountered before in stem courses.",

Wasnt too much work, definitely manageable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses (only applies to me because of my learning style): professor teaches in a sort of improvisation style and sometimes jumps around to different topics, so you just need to ask to clarify or confirm some things",
                "I think the main strength was that the problem sets helped prepare for the tests really well. As for weaknesses, the course felt very disorganized at times, the problems were not always formulated clearly so that you actually had enough information to solve them, and the professor assumed a lot more prior knowledge than was listed in the prerequisites.",
                "Because of the limited time of the summer course, many components seemed rushed and didn't feel fully explained. While I feel like I gained a solid overview of general strategies and approaches, many of the more granular details I never quite understood because they were skipped over.",
                "Strengths:\r\n1. I think one strength is the availability of the recorded live lectures which give an overview to the content before class and help reinforce the ideas covered in lecture. \r\n\r\n2. Michael is a very engaging lecturer who presents the material in a way that's easy to understand while also stating the relevance of whatever we learn.\r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\n\r\n1. Perhaps it was because this was a summer course, imposing a time restriction,  but I would have liked some more overhead discussion about the concepts we were learning about.",

                "Yes, though it will be a difficult class. As a non-STEM major, I did feel like I had absolutely NO idea what was going on at some (most) points, but I do think it was a great showing to me about what chemical engineers do or at least base their foundations on. I still do recommend even non-STEM majors to take the class, but it will definitely not be an easy ride.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "I would recommend only if you plan to go into chemical engineering.",
                "Professor Loewenberg is great. Be prepared for much more math and quantitative reasoning than science. If you feel comfortable with this stuff, then I would recommend. If not, then probably not. Also, there are definitely easier ways to fulfill the science or quantitative reasoning requirements if that is what you are looking for.",
                "If there is a normal semester version of this course, I would recommend they take that. I feel like there was too much content to fully teach in a condensed summer session. But otherwise, the course is very good for anyone regardless of background/major to learn some introductory skills for chemical engineers and model analysis in general.",
                "I would recommend this class to any prospective STEM majors whether engineering or not. This class is very interesting and engaging. The lessons learned can be used beyond the CENG 150 classroom.",
                "I would recommend this course. It's a fair introduction to the ChemE major, and I think students willing to put in the time will gain useful skills. The teaching is somewhat autonomous and I spent a fair amount of time learning outside of lecture, but the overall course content and its teaching was good. Professor Loewenberg is amazing and supportive, and I think he really did do his best to always approach problems in several ways that would help all students learn the material. Overall a decent class which is not necessarily fun, but is also not painful or impossible."
