                "I think the content of lectures is not highly correlated with the assignments.\r\nAlso, I understand the policy that graduate students get more assignments and questions in exams. However, we do need more time for exam as we have more questions.",
                "Strengths: Not too much workload, straight forward assignments\r\nWeaknesses: Exams were mostly about memorizing small details, sometimes skills needed for assignments not taught in class and would have to be figured out by oneself",
                "It's a very informative course that teaches good practical skills.",
                "Strengths - the psets were really accessible and Sherry (the TA) was super helpful. All the assessments felt fair, and some of the readings were interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Lecture was not recorded so if you missed it, you completely missed the material.  D3 isn't really taught in class, and can be intimidating at first to figure out, but it's pretty accessible.",
                "The course was really great. Consistent, predictable, fair workload that was rigorous but not overwhelming. The problemsets were enjoyable and interesting, and left enough room for visual design to be quite creatively fun.",
                "I felt like the lectures werent really helpful since most things in the lecture was just a repetition of the readings, which covered everything quite comprehensively.",
                "strength: The instructor communicated clearly and was easy to understand. She encouraged student participation in class.  Some guests are invited to hold lectures for us, from which I learned a lot.",
                "Strengths\r\n- Comprehensive coverage of different data visualization techniques and tools\r\n- Clear and well-organized instructional material \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- Heavy workload",

The extra readings are interesting and complements the main book.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The exam questions are sometimes too detailed. It can be quite difficult to prepare for the exam. Also for first exam I did not quite have time to finish all four coding questions.",

The problem sets are good practice but the textbook and lectures are too abstract. You get to see a lot of (usually) pretty plots and visualization beyond your typical bar chart and scatterplots. Though...  you can just google them too.",

I did enjoy doing the psets after getting over the initial frustration of not knowing how to use D3. The exams were basically rote memorization from lecture slides and some parts of the readings, so when the midterms came up, you basically needed to memorize everything.",
                "Yes - not necessarily for coding in d3, but for understanding the principles of visualization and have more intent behind what you're creating.",
                "Yes, absolutely. It was a great class. The workload was not bad at all, and I got a huge amount out of it, far more than other CS classes with double or triple the workload. The assignments seemed carefully designed and the lectures were masterful, we had 9am lectures and even despite that it was the best and most rewarding class I took this semester (!).",
