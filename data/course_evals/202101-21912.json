                "Strengths: Professor Harris was very knowledgeable, and his lectures moved in a way that was internally consistent and made sense (sans the occasional typo). As for PSETs, they were much more manageable than last semester--but I think that was mostly a function of Griffiths being a really good textbook. \r\nWeaknesses: Grading and feedback came very slowly, and that was especially frustrating when trying to figure out where my understanding was incomplete and where I stood in the class. Also, when they happened, most of the TF office hours I went to were not the most helpful.",
                "Strengths - covers a good selection of topics from E+M and manages to have time to introduce some more advanced/interesting topics\r\nWeaknesses - some pset problems required knowledge from unassigned chapter sections (fortunately these never appeared on any exam but were very annoying, nonetheless",
                "Strengths: 1. the E&M content was chosen at the right level of difficulty for someone with AP Physics C background, and was not too challenging but not too boring either. 2. the grading was generous, which is a much-needed plus given the difficulty of the material. Weaknesses: 1. special relativity being taught in 261 and not 260 meant that our exploration into QM was shorter than one would've liked; it would have been better to cover special relativity in more detail in 260 instead. 2. Prof Harris's delivery of content in lectures can get dull occassionally, especially since his slides while helpful are extremely dense - although that might just be the Zoom fatigue speaking.",
                "I don't know. It's an intro physics class. You do the intro physics stuff. There's nothing to write home about, and I think that's just sort of the way it is with this kind of class.",
                "Strengths: professor Harris as a lecturer, class culture, rigor of homework assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: tests mostly consisted of problems with simple ideas but messy and brutal mathematics (e.g. find the magnetic field inside an n-gon of constant current). I would have liked to see problems focused on subtlety of physical intuition.",
                "This class provides a solid background in electromagnetism while introducing special relativity and quantum mechanics, two pillars in modern physics. Additionally, the material is presented with some sophistication and mathematical methods are developed as needed including vector calculus, differential equations, the Dirac delta, and complex vector spaces. The attention given by Professor Harris to motivate relativity and quantum mechanics was a particular strength. I found it to be a unique perspective that builds intuition. In terms of improvements, it would be helpful to have more time on tests (scanning was always rushed and stressful). Furthermore, the TAs were generally not very helpful and would not take time to explain concepts; working with other students was super beneficial.",
                "I found the lecture format slightly difficult for notetaking, and while lectures were interesting I wish there had been slightly more focus on problem solving. Reading the textbook was definitely what taught me how to do the homework and the exams.",
                "The material in this course was fascinating and compelling, and the focus on building intuition provided me with a stronger foundation for exploring more complicated physics in the future. However, the course required knowledge of advanced techniques in math that weren't addressed thoroughly in class. Since students had varied levels of preparation from high school calculus classes, lacking a multivariable background would greatly decrease the difficulty of this course. For this reason, more worked examples and resources might improve this course.",
                "Very nice course overall, extremely enjoyed the motivations for relativity.",
                "I really enjoyed this class, more than I enjoyed 260 last semester. Professor Harris introduced some topics in a truly beautiful way, especially deriving the Theory of Relativity from Maxwell's equations. The class was well structured and taught, and the exams and homework were pretty fair. Overall a great class.",
                "This course is well organized and covers the challenging content clearly. Lectures usually discuss and develop all content required for assigned problems, except a couple instances were problems were not relevant to the lecture content. The thorough treatment of the chain of discoveries and amendments to the laws of E&M and how from them special relativity can be deduced is particularly helpful and illuminating, as well as the thorough discussion of quantum states and the spaces that represent them.",
                "The strength of this course was, arguably, the textbook for Electromagnetism (Griffiths), and the lectures were better than last semester. I also want to make a shoutout to one Peer Tutor (Eliza), who was incredibly helpful and patient during office hours. The weaknesses of the course include poor feedback that usually came late, and perhaps lectures that were unengaging because of extensive mathematical manipulations. Perhaps this could be improved by giving students a handout with the mathematical dirty work and show the results and some key steps instead of the whole derivation. Another weakness was the organization of many office hours during the course. I wish the office hours of the instructor had been put in a day farther from the day in which PSets were posted since this meant that I was unable to ask questions about the material to the instructor.\r\n\r\nAnother issue that I would like to point out is that exams seem to be testing how well we can apply examples from class and the book as opposed to testing whether we actually understood the material. Throughout the academic year, both for 260 and 261, I felt that I was learning how to solve tests prepared by this instructor instead of learning physics.",
                "The lectures were clear and concise. The information conveyed by them was very helpful in improving my understanding of the subject.\r\n\r\nOne thing that could be improved is that the lecture slides occasionally double up the panels, and some of the things written become special characters when uploaded to Canvas. If the could be fixed, then the slides would be easier to use."

                "The lecture style was engaging and transisitioned well to the online format. The only issue was the format of the slides. The progressive animation made it difficult to review lecture notes after the fact, as each lecture consisted of upward of 100 slides. If this class were ever to be remote again, I would hope to see the format of the slides change to make them easier to review.",

I wish there had been more chances for us students to interact with each other, but that was not necessarily the instructor's fault.",
                "I felt that the online environment worked for this course. There were an ample number of zoom office hours with the professor and the TA's, and the course itself was very straightforward. The professor also always incorporated a bit of time into the lectures to accept questions, which was helpful since it allowed the lectures to flow more smoothly."

The discussions we had on relativity and quantum were very interesting, and our E&M work came together nicely. Midterms were not impossible this semester--especially compared to 260.  However, this class is not for everyone. If the description for this class and the reviews you're reading right now sound like a challenge you're excited to take on and a way to build on the calculus-based physics you already know, go for it and godspeed. If not, don't.",
                "Pretty much only if you have a strong physics background or a physics major. I really enjoyed learning about topics like special relativity and quantum mechanics, but I'm probably not going to be a physics major and had to put in a lot of time into this class - think I might have been better off taking 200/201.",
                "If you took PHYS 260, enjoyed its emphasis on derivations and equations, and want a more rigorous foundation of E&M than just AP Physics C, take this course. It'll definitely give you a better conceptual understanding of E&M and QM than any other course in the intro sequence, making it more than worth the extra effort.",
                "As a math major with non-extraordinary physics preparation, I didn't do great in the course but I enjoyed it a lot. In retrospect, one of the other intro sequences would have been a better fit for my prep and goals.",
                "I mean, it's an intro to physics. You get what you expect, and nothing more.",
                "Yes, if this student was a math major or a physics major primarily interested in theory.",
                "Definitely! If you are interested in physics and have a decent background, this is the sequence to take. Although you might see less electromagnetism than you would like, the introductions to special relativity and quantum mechanics are strong additions to this course. The level at which material is presented and the accompanied mathematical formalism will widely prepare you for further studies in physics. The other students in this class also will motivate your intellectual curiosity and lead to some cool discussions! I have made some amazing friends.",
                "Yes! This was my first college-level physics course. 261 investigated aspects of the physical world that were abstract and fascinating. Learning about the underlying behavior of the universe through a mathematical language will make anyone who takes this course love physics.",
                "Yes if you want to learn as much physics as possible, at the (temporary) cost of confidence and time",

                "I would recommend it to students seeking a more thorough and mathematically sophisticated treatment of the usual introductory physics topics.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student at Yale. There is no need to go for this much harder course when they can take 200/1 for any purposes, including for the requirements of the Physics major. Many students in this class are beyond brilliant, and that alone made me feel that I should have taken 200/1 to avoid losing my passion for the subject matter. \r\n\r\nIf the student does not intend to pursue the physics major, it is unreasonable to take 260/1 for fun. Maybe Professor Girvin will provide a different approach, but I would go for the safe option which is to take it easy on yourself.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to other students. With a decent math and physics background, this class is really straightforward. The principles taught in the class, although complicated at first, become simpler and seem more elegant with each use. In a weird way, I found that, although the material is at a higher level than Phys 260, the actual physics done is simpler and easier to follow and only looks intimidating at first. For students who want a challenge, and are eager to learn physics at a high level, I highly recommend this course."
