                "I gained a thorough understanding of how to have a basic conversation in French: how to introduce myself, navigate unfamiliar places, and talk about topics like education and culture. I feel well prepared to try out my skills on a trip to France!",
                "I went from knowing no French at all to having a moderately long conversation about French pastries! Professor Ngame is so kind and really roots for his students to succeed. Although there was certainly a lot of work, I looked forward to the class every day. It was truly a joy, and I'm so looking forward to next semester.",

                "The workload was nearly impossible to be fully completed, and that, I think, might have influenced the level of engagement in the course workload.",
                "The strength of this course is how much progress can be made in a fairly short amount of time. The Capretz method clearly is a good system to learn Parisian french quickly and bring students up to basic conversational level by the end of L1. However, due to the amount of material covered, it is incredibly difficult to keep up if you're not willing to devote a decent chunk of every day to reviewing the material, doing the homework, and practicing for the next day. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, being more open about the difficulty in the first couple days of the class could make the experience better and help students to decide if they're willing to go through with the class.",
                "I really enjoyed the amount of feedback we received in class and the shift to new technologies like the Lingco tests. I believe the greatest weakness was the reliance on the outdated French in Action material, whose teaching style was a little hard to grasp at times.",
                "The course covered a lot of ground, and I would say that some weeks we had to run over the work very quickly, and there wasn't a lot of advice as to which vocabulary or areas we needed to study in more depth. However, on the whole, the course was incredibly useful and really taught in an engaging way. I know it's controversial, but I loved the 'French in Action' teaching style.",
                "It was really nice and engaging however the course load was over the top and very extreme (sometimes unuseful in my eyes)."

                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking to explore the French culture or a francophone country, as it is a very inviting way to learn French.",
                "Definitely. French is not an easy language, but I really enjoyed learning it through this class.",
