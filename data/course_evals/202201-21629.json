                "Strengths: Proof writing skills are built up gradually, and coming from no experience I felt like I could keep up and understand easily\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were sometimes hard to follow and a slip of the tongue by the professor occasionally led us to learn something incorrectly. Luckily, the textbook is very good and fills in any gaps well.",
                "The weakness of this course is Ebru. It could be improved by letting someone other than Ebru teach it. The structure of the course is absolutely garbo, and the textbook it uses is rather weak as well. It could be improved by using Gilbert Strang's MIT course or Axler's textbook as the base.",
                "The strengths of this course lie in the material itself, which is imperative to any prospective math majors. The main weakness of the course was the poor design. The problem sets became worth progressively more and more as the semester went on, which doesn't make sense since the problem sets should probably be the same workload and value through the whole semester. The material on the tests was also rarely similar to what was on the problem sets or what we learned in class. As a result, the ultimate curve was odd as well. If this class was better designed with guided lecture notes for the lectures, problem sets which were equal over the whole semester, and midterms and finals where we knew what to expect, the students would have had a more enjoyable time in the class.",
                "Strength: Very useful and wide introduction to mathematical proofs and proof-writing. Professor Toprak explained the foundational ideas of the course clearly and completely, and also modeled the process of mathematical inquiry necessary to answer complex math questions. Her lectures were a good mix of explication of the basic ideas and applying those ideas to produce larger, important results, as well as to answer smaller questions. Professor Toprak responded clearly and concisely to all student questions during lecture. Homework was well-written to encourage deep engagement with the ideas of the course, useful feedback was given on both homework and tests, and tests did not contain any surprising material not covered in class or homework.\r\nWeakness: I'm not sure that we covered all the material we were supposed to have; the spectral theorem was listed in the course description but never mentioned in class, for example. This may have been Professor Toprak's response to some students struggling with earlier material, but it was frustrating.",
                "The course was difficult initially but it got easier through the term. There should have been more TAs to help us with learning.",
                "Strengths: The course was relatively easy to follow, and the it was very clear what was expected of us on tests and homework. The course content aligned nicely with the textbook which allowed for easy studying outside of class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some concept explanations in class were a bit confusing and I had to read the textbook occasionally to catch up, but in general the class wasn't too difficult to follow.",
                "The course material builds upon itself very nicely, providing its own foundation for future topics. However, it felt as if too much emphasis was placed on earlier topics and the later topics, such as diagonalizability felt quite rushed. I wish we could've gone more in depth about differential equation proofs using linear algebra.",
                "My main problem was the professor, Ebru Toprak. She often got lost in her explanations and was also really disorganized. It got to the point where she had to remove a whole (essential) chapter from the syllabus because she got a few classes behind and couldnt cover it. Ill have to study it over the summer to keep up with the courses I want to take next semester.\r\nNonetheless, the ULAs were great, the problem sets (although very hard) taught me a lot, and Ebrus enthusiasm for the subject sometimes overshadowed the problems I alluded to earlier.",
                "A strength is that we built a strong base before building up to the more sophisticated (and useful) concepts. Also, a great deal of work is proved in homeworks, thus teaching students to derive theorems for themselves. Sometimes, the lectures were not incredibly organized.",
                "Lecture style. The pset questions seemed carefully selected and were helpful in understanding course material. Students may want to look over the textbook before going to class, because it is easy to get lost during a proof and just sit there, copying notes without understanding what's going on.",
                "Extremely accommodating professor",
                "The problem sets were very challenging which made homework engaging.",
                "Ebru was not a great lecturer. She often confused us and\/or herself, was unaware when the class was lost, and wasnt able to answer questions in a helpful way. Clearer, more organized lectures would make the content SO much easier to understand.",
                "Strengths: Textbook to follow.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not recorded.",
                "More online resources needed for students who cant make it to class\r\nA more forgiving curve would be nice :)",
                "Strengths: great teacher, interesting subject, good introduction to proof writing, good pacing, great problem sets.\r\nWeaknesses: tests were fairly inconsistent (the first midterm was very hard, while the second midterm was easier and the final was very easy), and we didn't cover all of the course material on the syllabus, which I was bummed about because it seemed like interesting material.",
                "Please, please, please offer Math 225 AND 226 in the same year! I understand all courses at Yale have students coming from different backgrounds but I feel students who had proofs and\/or linear algebra background heavily divided the demographics of the course. I believe both concepts of proofs and linear algebra should be taught at a very slow level for 225 and then faster for 226. It is hard to satisfy a happy medium, which is what this course intended to do but I am not sure how well it succeeded. I believe having both courses offered the same semester would be extremely beneficial. Please give more practice problems with solutions. The recommended textbook had no solutions so I believe some students fell into the belief they were solving proofs correctly but were not. There were really only twenty or so pset questions per chapter and a couple example problems in the book to refer to for the three exams. For students who are having an extremely hard time with such new material, more problems would be appreciated given the nature of the course. It takes a long time to solve one question so even asking a TA and working on one problem for an hour is not as beneficial as being given worked solutions for instant feedback to improve our proofs and add to our understanding of the material. We also did not get feedback on our psets before our exams. However, the professor and TA's were very helpful, always responding to whatever questions we had. Sometimes students did not utilize their help. It is hard to assess in this course if you are totally lost or not so I wish there were more indicators of that early on. You had to rigorously seek help and feedback to pass, it wasn't just given to you."

Dont underestimate the difficulty of the class from the first weeks; it goes by fast.",

It's great to know why you can apply different theorems and where they come from. I also think 225 is a great introduction to proof-based math.",

This course is designed to be an intro to proof-based math, and proceeding to higher level math courses such as Analysis 1 without the experience may be challenging. Peers with previous linear algebra experience seem to prefer Intensive Linear Algebra over 225, since 225 doesn't cover material with depth.",

There are other classes that teach you proofs if that is what you are interested in, it will come up in your later classes if you need it. Just need to simply know the linear algebra for most majors. Also shop both math 222 and 225!"
