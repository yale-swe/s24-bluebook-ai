                "Well-organized and well-taught. I thought that the statistics unit in the class felt somewhat disjointed from everything else, and it might have been good to start with that unit rather than cramming it in at the end, but it was not that big of a problem either way.",
                "Strengths: recorded lectures, enough TF / Peer Tutor hours, accessible format (Jupyter notebook)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: inconsistent pacing of class, occasional very difficult homeworks, no accurate reflections of midterm / final exams.",
                "I really like the class exercises we did in class. I also appreciated how readily available the lecture recordings were. However, the biggest weakness was the pace of the course. It felt like we spent a lot of time on the basics, so much so that we didn't really get to explore in depth some of the more challenging parts of the course. In fact, it sometimes felt like an intro to Python course with a bit of data science, rather than a data science course with a bit of Python.",
                "I really appreciated the lecture recordings, as there were quite a few lectures that I could not make it to.",
                "There is no section for this class which means we did coding during lecture. Because of that sometimes it felt like the pace of the class was too slow and didn't learn a lot overall.",
                "The class was very code heavy and could use a little more actual data science concepts.",
                "Hand written exams when the entire year was devoted to online program was slightly bothersome. Otherwise, it was a great course.",
                "Great course! I did not see any weaknesses.",
                "cool class for sure, but the structure of it wasn't great. This semester we learned code different from previous years, and there weren't a lot of resources to help us improve/practice the code applicable to our class",
                "The strengths of this course are surprisingly the homeworks. I learned so much from each assignment, and got to put what we were learning in practice. The EdStem is also vibrant and helpful. However, the midterm exam was difficult for a lot of students, which was discouraging in our learning.",
                "This course does a pretty good job of teaching coding even for beginners like me. Classes and homework are both very hands-on, which is really helpful. It's easy to learn by doing, and the assignments often go step-by-step to help you out. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the course to me was exams. The course is ostensibly designed for people who want to learn how to code but aren't necessarily pursuing computer science jobs after graduation or anything. For those of us in this position, it doesn't really make any sense to have to take difficult, fast-paced exams where we are writing out code on paper. It just added a lot of stress without helping me actually learn anything. Assignments like the final project were much more helpful, allowing you to put the skills to use on something you are actually interested in. Also, I found that the statistics section of the course was relatively weak. It kind of erased what I thought I knew from intro stats, and I ended up more confused than ever because we didn't really spend much time covering it. I think it would be better to just remove this section and learn more python data analysis instead.",
                "This course is perfect to me. I enjoyed it!",
                "The course does a great job of facilitating student learning prioritizing time during class to practice using the code in live time. Assignments help foster a stronger understanding and do not necessary feel entirely like busy work.",

                "strengths: great way to learn data science. Weaknesses: none",
                "I like the transition to using real data sets and thought the final project was a strength and helped in learning and solidifying the python we use. I think a weakness is the inclusion of image manipulation as we didn't use that much besides in one homework and potentially in the projects if one decided to use it.",
                "Strengths: None \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very boring and not good for people who have never coded before. Some of the homework assignments were way too difficult for beginners. Also, because of how grading works, your final grade is essentially determined by the exams, which are hard. ALSO, exams are handwritten, which is extremely difficult! (And also doesn't make sense because it is a coding class)",
                "Strengths: class code,",
                "can be helpful in building foundation for my python",
                "strengths: \r\n- homework assignments were very well designed! this is probably going to be a very unpopular opinion but I actually thought the difficulty level of the first few homeworks on basic coding was quite fair and helped me develop the coding abilities that I needed to support me throughout the rest of the class. When the course concepts themselves got harder towards the second half of the course, I think it also made sense for the homework assignments to get \"easier\" in the sense that there wasn't much difficulty beyond application of the already difficult concepts themselves. \r\n- lectures were pretty well organized \r\n- in-class exercises were good\r\n- I feel like this class actually helped me learn how to code (unlike the S&DS 230 class I took in Spring 2021)\r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\n- sometimes, lectures weren't the most engaging and the pace was rather slow, or fixing spelling errors in code took away time from explaining the actual concepts being presented \r\n- there were often typos and grammatical mistakes in homeworks and even exams that made them difficult to understand",
                "Strengths: problem sets were incredibly good at teaching the material when I didn't totally understand it in class, the material was presented well and I felt like I learned a lot coming in with CS knowledge but little Data Science knowledge",
                "I think a weakness of this course was that everything was new this year and so sometimes things were more difficult than I felt they should have been. This improved throughout the year, but in the beginning of the course a lot of the homeworks were too challenging. Also, I felt like we crammed a lot of content in during the last few weeks of the semester on big topics like classifiers or hypothesis tests, but then we learned about small things like text manipulation early and then we were never even tested on it. Also, I feel like the final project was not super beneficial for my learning in the class. I simply used tools from class to manipulate my own data, but the tools I used I had already done in the homework and so I felt it was a bit repetitive. Finally, because the course was so new, I definitely feel like we did not have enough practice problems or practice exams available to practice for exams. When exam time came, I felt like I was guessing what kind of problems I could possibly be asked since I only really had the homeworks to go off of. All that being said, I think a strength of this course was that the professor and the TAs were always available for office hours and to help explain concepts. I did find it cool to learn about some visualizations!",
                "I learned how to code basic python, which is what I was interested in.  However, the midterm and final were much more difficult than anything that we had done in the class, so it came as a surprise.",
                "Strengths: We went over each topic pretty heavily, which made them easy to understand in the end. Homework was relevant to each week's content and wasn't too much or too little. Collaboration was encouraged. Slides and answers to the problems we did in class were provided for each lecture. Classes were also recorded. Lowest homework score was dropped. Ed Discussion was used and responses were prompt.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The midterm and final were both on paper, which I did not appreciate at all considering we did all of our work (and the final project) on the computer. The tests were also weighted as a combined 40% of our grade, which seems extremely high for a format that does not reflect how we learned. I think something more like a timed pset would have been more accurate to what we learned.",
                "There were a lot of office hours available throughout the week, which was very helpful and convenient. Having OH frequently helped a lot with this course. One weakness, if any is that some of the homework introduced new concepts not discussed in class.",
                "I think a strength was applying the skills we learned to real data and how to manipulate it. However, I think a weakness was that they we were not given enough time to really hone in on those skills and practice it. sometimes I felt we went way too fast which made it difficult to grasp certain concepts and then apply them in difficult ways. I think it could be improved by slowing down a bit in the beginning of the class and going through practice problems in class that are related to the PSet. In addition, I think assigning something that is the same difficulty of the exams would have been helpful or having practice exams.",
                "Strength: great teaching and straightforward syllabus\r\nWeakness: TAs cancelling last minute on day pset is due, no extensions",

                "class is quite well structured, the psets were really helpful in revising the material gone over in lectures, and the pace was just right for a complete beginner at coding.",
                "everything good",
                "Strengths: Professor adapts to feedback; the p-sets are purely based on what we have learned; doesn't presume any background in Python.\r\nWeaknesses: workload would vary a lot from week to week, so it was difficult to predict how much time one might spend on the class.",
                "This course said they don't assume prior knowledge but we were expected to learn how to code very quickly, felt less of a stats class and more of a CS course which I did not sign up for",
                "Weaknesses: new syllabus and class structure--so did not have any guide or previous examples for major assignments. Also, important topics like machine learning and data ethics were rushed (I think to improve this to speed up the introduction week of Python, and pandas--and maybe making data visualization a flipped classroom module).\r\nStrength: the class was paced extremely well with constant revision. The final project also gave us the opportunity to apply data analysis skills to other personal or academic interests.",
                "I think the pacing could've been improved: sometimes it felt like we spent multiple days reviewing a basic concept (e.g., Boolean masking) and then went through an advanced application (image processing) too quickly.",
                "Strengths: pretty organized, tons of content covered in a week of lecture. Weaknesses: too rushed, exams were difficult, and I disliked how the exams were handwritten rather on our laptops, should have introduced the different skills/topics in a certain order so the students could have understand the content better considering it's a beginning friendly python class.",
                "The course was disorganized.",
                "Very practical content and interesting applications",
                "Good Professor, sometimes slow in pace.",
                "Strengths: homework and in-class problem \"notebooks\" are very well designed and easy to learn from. Exams accurately reflected the course material. Weaknesses: lectures are not very engaging, often spending too much time on topics that aren't very applicable to the skills or testable topics the class focuses on.",
                "Prof. Meyers tries to keep things engaging with memes and p-sets with funny topics (e.g. squirrels in New York). Occasionally content on problem sets would have difficulty far surpassing what was learned in class which made it difficult, at least initially, to do well/understanding how well content is being learned in class.",
                "Great class; balanced homework",
                "The course was well taught for a large seminar, as I felt my personal questions were well-addressed despite the class size.",
                "Strengths: interesting for students interested in statistics\r\nWeaknesses: varied pacing of course, instructors not helpful for answering questions, unclear grading and significant change from previous years so that previous reviews were misleading",
                "Strengths: The homework is pretty straightforward and Ed Discussion is really helpful, take the class with friends and psets will be easier. The final project was also pretty fun\r\nWeaknesses: It was a restructuring of the class so the practice exams weren't representative of the real exams, and there were some bells and whistles still being worked out",
                "This course did not feel very beginner friendly because there were some foundational concepts we should've learned before moving to more complex practices",
                "I think the selection of topics for this class was very appropriate for an intro level course. But, it needed to be better organized. Firstly, I think that this class should have a EITHER a final exam OR a final project because there an insufficient amount of time for.both. With about two weeks total to do the final project and the final project draft. Deadlines seems to flow right into one another, and having both is an uncommon experience that I have had in the countless other stem/math/CS courses I have taken both here at Yale and elsewhere. There is also a possibility to rid of one problem set to accommodate for the project, but we were given the same amount of time for out final project draft and final draft as we were for one problem set, which I don't think was fair. It also was difficult because problem sets and the project were not released until the week in which they were due, so if you wanted to get ahead based off the craziness of your own personal schedule, there was no way to do so. Besides this, certain parts of the courses felt unnecessary or disjoint. I think we could've skipped over the text manipulation unit and spent more classes/time on machine learning mechanisms for validating data outcomes. Lastly, problem sets often were phrased very weirdly and/or filled with typos which caused a lot of unnecessary difficulty. There were several instance where peer tutors struggled to assist me because they themselves were confused by the language of the homework assignments. I know this semester, Ethan created a new syllabus. And with all novelties comes imperfections. But despite some policies needing revision or being unclear, Ethan remained unwavering to make accommodations towards the written or unwritten errors in the syllabus. Overall, this class is clearly a work in progress, but it has high potential!",
                "At points, lectures moved quite slowly, but towards the end, when dealing with statistics and machine learning, I felt that more time could've been devoted to these abstract topics. I don't think I had quite grasped these things thoroughly through lectures/homework/other resources used. I do think that the homework assignments and final projects were incredibly helpful in my learning. Without these assignments, I feel like I would've been very lost in the class. I also enjoyed how Professor Meyers structures his lectures, incorporating follow-along practice segments, review, and slides of overarching concepts. I loved how we were able to cater our final projects to our interests and that we got input from others before having to submit.",
                "strengths: teaches coding in an easy to follow manner, course felt organized for the most part\r\nweaknesses: not the most engaging course at times, lectures didn't feel consistently digestible",
                "While the readings were interesting, they were kind of annoying to complete. Learning actual Python as opposed to a teaching package was useful, but there was definitely a learning curve.",
                "The professor is highly engaging and the course moves at a reasonable pace. However, the problem sets were often too long.",
                "This class could use a better feedback structure, I rarely got feedback on my work and I never got my grades back on anything past the midterm exam. Also the last few lectures were jam-packed with too many topics that we could not possibly learn on our own and distill into something we can study for the final.",
                "the course was very new and this less structured than other courses Ive taken within this department.",
                "More homework for statistics. \r\n\r\nI felt the final was not representative of the course. I did not think it was a fair accumulative exam.",
                "The course was being restructured this year, so some problem sets were varying levels of difficulty at the start of the course. However, it quickly became more predictable and clear. The in-class practice problems were helpful and interesting. I do feel that a final project and a final exam are excessive, so I would have preferred to solely have a final project with more extensive requirements.",
                "I enjoyed the recorded lectures and office hours.",
                "strength: good combination of lecture notes and application\r\nweakness: people did not start with the same level of experience with coding",
                "The midterm was way too hard and did not reflect what we have been learning. The hw were good but the class itself was a little boring. Need take home tests or coding on computer",
                "Strengths: very consistent workload, never caught off guard, developed an interest in pursuing data science future (leaves you wanting more), professor adds humor to the lectures, and often a storyline to the p-sets which makes them more enjoyable to engage with. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the p-sets were unnecessarily long at the beginning, but by the end it got better and more manageable, also the p-sets are due on Sunday night, which is not really an ideal time",
                "I think the course material was very fun and helped me understand and process these concepts. However, I think that the course was too rushed at the end. The course needed to space out its sections better, so as to not rush important concepts such as hypothesis testing and machine learning.",
                "The choices of data sets were helpful, and I enjoyed the emphasis on Python programming. I think tying these topics in with Python/R and Excel would be useful, especially for students with interests in economics and finance.",
                "Really good for learning basic python and a little bit of statistics. More of a graphing statistics more. Really liked machine learning and wish we had spent some more time on that/learned it earlier",
                "One strength of this course is that homework grades were returned within the week, so it was easy to know what you were still not understanding. In lecture, we also learned how to implement coding methods in applications very relevant to todays society. \r\n\r\nOne weakness is that some topics, such as hypothesis testing, felt a bit rushed, and I wished we could have received a bit more explanation about why we were performing certain functions.",
                "The course was extremely well organized and there were no weaknesses that I could think of. The exams felt a little high-schoolish (given that we had to regurgitate code that we either had memorized or written out on a cheat-sheet). It was less a test of understanding and more about whether we were diligent enough to make good cheat sheets.",
                "The class is very well organized and you can take it virtually because all lectures are recorded. The last half of the semester felt a bit crammed, and we did not really learn a lot about statistics in the class. I would recommend taking this course after intro to stats or another stats heavy course.",
                "N/A",
                "Problem sets were not very challenging but enough to engage a student in the lectures. Wish there were more office hours throughout the week.",
                "strengths: \r\nvery organized professor \r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\nI do not like that the course can be taken completely asynchronously. it really affects the dynamic of the course and even of the class. If students have the option to not attend class then they will likely fall behind."

                "Yes. Good way to tell if you're interested in data science, and even if you end up not liking data science, you'll come out of the course with plenty of useful skills for whatever your field is.",
                "I think it offers a decent intro to coding in python, but it's a bit convoluted with trying to do both the Python and the stats. The stats at the end especially felt pretty rushed. I would recommend if you've already taken statistics / if you have a decent background",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who's looking to learn Python under a specific context. However, if you don't have a strong background in data science and statistics, there are probably other courses that better teach you these concepts.",
                "Yes, but only if they are very self-disciplined. A lot of the learning happens outside of the classroom, and students need to be willing to commit to that.",
                "I would only recommend to someone who has zero programming and stats experience. If you have some programming background and would only take this class to learn python (that was me), I wouldn't do it. It is not very interesting and you could probably learn python through online websites/courses quicker.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn python at a relatively easy pace but are scared of heavy CS courses this is the way to go.",

                "Yes.  I was worried about taking a coding class for the first time, even though the course says it was designed for beginners, because Yale courses rarely are. However, this course is actually true to that. It does a very good job of getting everyone up to speed, even if you've never coded before. I think it is a great opportunity to get more familiar with these skills in a relatively low-pressure environment, and with very interesting applications.",
                "Yes! The professor is excellent and I learned a lot of useful and interesting coding techniques from the course.",
                "I would recommend this course for what it is, an introduction to Python. The class prioritized practicing the code to ensure that all students had time to actually work through what was being taught in real time, not just on psets after class. The work load is not too stressful and the knowledge I have now is much more than I came in with.",
                "Yes, if you want a basic learning of pandas, seaborn, so on. But honestly the course was kind of wack in my opinion, especially because of the exams. The material that is on the exams, though covers the same topics as the psets, was just brought up in an entirely different way that made everything seem extremely overcomplicated.",

                "No. Do not take this class. The prof's voice is kind of annoying (not a deal breaker, but something to consider) and the class is difficult for people who have not coded before. The exams are handwritten, which is very difficult because you do not get to run your code and figure out if you have any errors.",

                "Yes, I would. This is a good course for someone who wants to take an advanced statistics class or someone who wants to get a base knowledge of coding without having to take CS50. This course was great for someone with absolutely no knowledge of coding like me.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in an interesting but manageable QR credit or in picking up coding for the first time.",
                "Bravo",
                "If you are a social science major looking for a QR or background in data science, yes. It's a great class to teach you skills you might need in final papers. I realized that Python could have made my final project for a Political Science class in the previous semester much easieryou can do things in 5 minutes on Python that would take 30 on Excel. There is a difference between Statistics and Data Science, so make sure to choose the one that you are looking for.",
                "Yes, with the caveat that I slacked off more than I should've. That's on me; if you pay attention and do the work you'll do fine.",
                "Yes and no. If you have background with coding then yes, this class is pretty fun to learn about the various ways you can use python. The professor explains things vaguely and sometimes it is difficult to understand the material.",
                "Yes, very insightful in terms of programming applications",
                "If wanting to get into cs and if required, yes.",
                "If you want to learn to use Python to visualize data then sure, although these skills could likely be picked up through self-study. The exams are somewhat hard and the project can be time-consuming, so don't think of it as an easy 5th. I wouldn't recommend this class unless you have a specific desire to gain this skillset. Also, the class moves really fast through background of coding in Python, so some prior coding experience would be helpful.",
                "I would recommend this class to a student if they are looking for a relatively straightforward QR credit, or if it is required for their major. At times the course can be difficult but generally, the grading is lenient and the TAs are great with students",

                "Yes! If you are looking for an intro to python that has a focus, this is it. This course felt like primarily an intro to python, as only a few lectures were actually about statistics and thus \"data science\" but there was always a sense that it was going to be used for a particular purpose, and then when it came time for the final project, the application of the code to data science was clearer. Therefore, this course will not give a very in-depth perspective on data science and statistics, but it will provide you with the skills to begin using python to organize and present data in an informative and productive manner.",

                "Yes",
                "Its a solid qr and its helpful to learn the basics of python. I ended up credit/ding the class and it became very chill and very helpful for learning a lot, but I think if I still took it for a grade I wouldve been way more stressed about the class. If you want a peek into how to code I would recommend the class, but give yourself the option to credit d it if you are brand new at coding.",
