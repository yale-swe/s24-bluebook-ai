                "I learned how to enjoy and listen to contemporary music in a way that I have never experienced before.",
                "Though I took ear training courses in the past, this course taught me to hear for timbral differences between excerpts, identify \"character-piece-like\" fragments, and hear different colors that older music never explored. It taught me to distinguish and become acquainted with twentieth-century harmonies (especially when harmony almost entirely disappears in Varese's Ionisation or in Messiaen's Serialist pieces), to distinguish between different instruments in the orchestra at whim, to fully read new quasi-spectroscopic or contemporary musical scores (Julius Eastman's Gay Guerilla and the score-copying exercise for Takemitsu's And Then I Knew 'Twas Wind), and listen for motivic development in ways I did not expect. Most importantly, it taught me to hear coherence within a piece, no matter how disjunct it appears at first listening. It provides a perfect gateway for anyone who wants to learn to hear differently, whether they are a classical musician or not!",
                "I learned about some of the important pieces and composers of the 20th and 21st centuries and how new musical techniques and ideas developed. I also learned new ways to analyze and discuss music.",
                "I have been able to appreciate more styles and forms of music from a new, unique perspective. I am able to piece together the art in its entirety, with the composer, the context, and the choices all coming into play.",
                "This courses broadened my love for music and introduced me to a side of classical music I hadn't touched before. I learned about music theory, music history, and broader history in general, and I gained valuable skills in close listening as well as understanding and writing about music.",
                "This is by far the best course I have ever taken, and perhaps the best course I ever will take. At the beginning of this course, I had little interest in Western classical music dated after Ravels death. Without the simplicity and luscious elements that came from the traditional methods of composition, pieces written after 1950 lacked the intrigue I had found in the music to which I had become accustomed. Yet through this class, more than anything, I learned how composers use these rules and their violations to tell a story. With that musical vocabulary, composers convey their inner impressions of the world, expressing to an audience how they perceive the environment to which they were forced to grow accustomed. In studying these pieces, I learned how art movements differ, and that though the specific qualities of pieces may change, the central conceptthat music is a form of artistic expressionremains. And that lesson was infinitely valuable to my personal development as a musician and a citizen of an ever changing world.",
                "There's a common discussion around how any course or college program will actually teach useful skills and knowledge that can be applied to the real world, and I think the worth of pure knowledge or hard skills like that is overrated. This course taught, no - brought me through that. The way to think about the knowledge you gain about music, art, history, linguistics, philosophy, and every other medium can be much, much deeper than I had realized.",
                "I was exposed to some interesting pieces of music. I got a greater familiarity with 20th century classical music overall, its history, some of its composers, its level of intense detail, and how to appreciate it."

                "The class could be a bit more conversational. Very interesting content, though.",
                "The course was strongly organized. I could see a clear progression between all of the pieces we listened to and how they all related to a larger question: how did the 20th century change Western classical music? The listening quizzes were manageable (even if the Copland and Takemitsu ones were quite difficult) and actually deepened our understanding by making us listen for \"clues\" in the pieces we were analyzing. It was intellectually stimulating and provided avenues for deep discussion -- I especially loved the art-related or linguistic tangents we went on that showcased how music is not a solitary art form. I think it hit upon everything that classical conservatories cover -- \"theory,\" \"ear training/aural skills,\" and \"the history of composers\" -- and then uniquely meshed them together in a way that was digestible both to those I know in the class who were classically trained or not.",
                "Professor Baa is extremely passionate about everything he teaches in this course and is really able to show how different influences shaped 20th century music and lay out a clear story for each composer and piece. I think the listening quizzes are a useful way to get to know each piece more thoroughly and are not hard if you take some time to prepare before.",
                "Strengths: Interesting Class discussions, Thought-Provoking, Unique pieces of music and connections drawn between them. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I would like to see more connections between how these classical pieces in music led to the growth of more different genres.",
                "This course was well-organized, extremely well-taught, and designed in a way that was most conducive to us falling in love with music, as Prof Baca intended. I thought that everything about the class was just about perfect. The only weakness was that I couldn't fulfill any distributional requirements (a humanities or writing credit) through this course, even though the amount of writing I did was greater than some of my friends who received credit for their classes.",
                "Trevor is understanding and compassionate, yet challenges his students intellectually such that his class is never boring. Truly remarkable.",

                "Absolutely. Especially for those interested in music.",
                "Definitely! Taking this class was the best decision I could have ever made.",
                "I had never used to appreciate contemporary atonal music -- I always saw it as something that never \"piqued the ear\" and never resonated with me as much as it should. Growing up as a mainly \"traditionalist\" classical musician, I never had many opportunities to actually expose myself to the pieces outside of the context of having something \"contemporary\" on my repertoire -- usually even then I would stick to more \"streamlined\" contemporary composers like Prokofiev or Barber.\r\n\r\nThis course really opened my eyes. The introduction from the beginnings of the Pathetique made all of the \"threads\" of musical development line up. Being able to relate these new \"exotic\" developments back to the 18th century Western music theory I knew allowed me to begin to appreciate the intricacies of the pieces. Learning about the composers' histories, their motivations (I especially enjoyed the zen buddhist story behind John Cage and our exploration of the gardens of Ryoan-ji), and its relationship to the post-war era gave the music coherence. I can now safely say that my acceptance of dissonance has skyrocketed.",
                "Yes, if you have any appreciation for music at all. Whether you are a classical musician or just an appreciator, it helps shape how you see any form of music and enjoy its differences.",
                "I would and have highly recommended this course to others. It was by far my favorite course of the semester and was a complete joy to attend every Monday and Wednesday.",
                "I could not recommend this course enough to another student. This course changed my life (for the better, of course), and I hope others can get the same satisfaction from it as I did.",
                "It's hard to put in words, but throughout the course, the way Trevor talks and explains things about music just seems so obvious that you can almost feel the exact thoughts of the artists and gain a deeper understanding of what music is to a human from the viewpoint of history, the artist and the listener. I cannot recommend this course enough. To anyone that possesses the ability to listen and to think - to you.",
                "Yes, absolutely!!! Trevor is super cool and learning about music (and sometimes other stuff) from him was always one of the highlights of my week. \r\n\r\nThis class is both super enjoyable and not that much of a time commitment. Most weeks, youll just have to listen to a piece of music a few times. If you are considering this as a 5th class, go for it, because this almost doesnt feel like a class and more of getting to listen to Trevor teach you about something cool twice a week, plus a few essays that arent too hard.\r\n\r\nYou do not have to know anything about classical music, although this is a great class for those that doit will expand your horizons and expose you to really interesting music written in the last 100 years. However, in order to get the most out of this class, you do need a willingness to listen to and think deeply about music. You will dive into music that is nothing like pre-20th century classical music, that is often especially off-putting to those that do have a strong background in classical music because its weird and dissonant. Its actually really cool though! \r\n\r\nReally though, the best part of the class is the community. Honestly, it feels more like a group of friends that like to learn about music than an academic class. Trevor spends a good amount of class time just getting to know each other and relieving stress. Trevor showed up on Cross Campus a couple evenings with free ice cream for us to get to know each other better, and even took us all out for Thai food (on Yales dime)these were some of the highlights of my first semester at Yale."
