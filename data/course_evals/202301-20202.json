Discussions were engaging and interesting, and oftentimes, the readings provided nuanced perspectives into topics in recent history that I hadn't previously considered.",

                "One of the best courses Ive taken, and the most relevant to what youll do after college. The assignments are relevant, useful, and rewarding. The readings are carefully curated and phenomenal. Class discussions could be a little dry at timesthere was never much disagreement or debate on contentious topics. Perhaps guiding questions of some kind each week would help. Smaller groups for the final project would also work better. There were a lot of different assignments: several short essays, a medium length final, a weekly research assignment, but there all were pretty easy and didnt feel like typical schoolwork. Honestly, probably could have used more of them.",
                "This course was really interesting in material, which was great, and it also had a lot of assignments that I haven't had to do before. The weekly research assignment was a little time consuming, but I appreciated that it got me familiar with some of the tools that Yale has for historical research. Class discussions were always engaging, which was probably partly because our weekly readings were manageable and interesting so everyone did them. I think the class was a little too big, but it makes sense that lots of people wanted to take it because it was great!",
                "Take this course! It is so fun and you learn so much. Prof. Meyerowitz is so great and insightful.",
                "Strengths - great topics, great professor who is knowledgeable and encourages discussion, great class discussions, and a challenging but not overbearing workload\r\nWeaknesses - only meet once a week, not enough time to cover a lot of important topics (some were missed out on)",
                "Strengths: research assignments are relatively easy but still get you engaged with the week's topics, Prof. Meyerowitz is really kind and always open to feedback, appreciate that we got a lot of in-class time to work on the group project\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Group project + individual research project so close together felt unnecessary (I'd would either do them at different points in the year or make them more extensive and only do one of the two); would've liked more focus on the historical trends that began in the 70s/80s/90s that led to the events",
                "The work is all front-loaded in the first half of the semester, and while manageable, I think it would be more engaging to continue readings/discussions throughout the entire semester instead of devoting so much time to our creative projects and papers.",
                "The readings were fantastic and so were class discussions. I would say that some weekly topics were more interesting/relevant to me than others, but in general, the topics each week were important and thought-provoking. I think it could have been valuable to spend some more time on a few topics (ie the election/presidency of Obama), but overall, I don't think there were many weaknesses.",
                "It'd be great to bring some topics from foreign policy/foreign affairs in the course, perhaps with less class time to work on group projects."

We touched on fresh, relevant events that occurred when we were too young to understand them. These topics  Bushs presidency, Abu Ghraib, Lawrence v. Texas, 2008 financial crisis, Obama, Katrina etc.  are incredibly important to understanding the world today and yet are rarely taught in other classes.",

                "YES! Absolutely take this class. The topics you will learn about are incredibly relevant in the present and valuable to have perspective on.",
