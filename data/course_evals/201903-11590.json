   "comments": [
    "I learned how to write for journalism and what topics are currently covered by the education beat.",
    "I learned about the major issues in current education policy, and how journalists in the field are covering those issues.",
    "I learned so much! I came into this course knowing very little about journalism, and now feel more confident in my ability to write articles. Prof Karr is wonderful. She is tough but cares deeply about your progress and invests so much time in your success.",
    "I learned a lot about journalism and about the ways tracking works in school. It's very journalism heavy, lighter on the politics of education, but I still did learn a good amount about different debates in the education sphere.",
    "I learned how to edit my writing and give constructive peer feedback. I also learned about the field of education journalism, and how to interview people as a journalist.",
    "I learned a lot about journalism and the American education system.",
    "- An understanding of journalism in general\r\n- A knowledge base about the realm of U.S. education",
    "I learned the basics of journalistic writing and what a career in education journalism might look like.  I also learned about current topics in education and where to find reputable sources for education news.",
    "In this course, the biggest thing I learned was how to engage with a different type of classroom. The visiting professor is very no-nonsense, but definitely in their own way. I felt that I really really had to push myself to actually learn how to write different types of journalistic pieces. But the professor did give us ample chances to learn from other journalists that reported on all types of education, which I found extremely helpful! If you want to be guided through how exactly to write different types of articles, though, this class will not give you that."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course readings were very interesting and fun to read. We had some amazing guest speakers who shared insights on their stories and the behind-the-scenes of journalism. It is hard to think of a weakness as the course was exactly what I wanted\/needed this semester.",
    "The course was really engaging, and I loved all the guest speakers. I think the grading was a little inconsistent and confusing",
    "I would have preferred more time discussing the mechanics of education policy, and less about the mechanics of writing journalistic stories, but that's only because I entered the class less fluent in policy than journalism. The class was split between students from both fields, and a different curriculum weight would have been ideal for each student. Clearly, this is not an easily fixable problem. The course's greatest strength was the presence of guest speakers. Each speaker, by virtue of their coverage, was able to provide a uniquely focused, professional perspective to each topic covered in the course.",
    "Strengths: Jane Karr has a lot of great experience in education journalism, and she also brought in a diverse set of guests with a variety of experiences and perspectives, who all had fascinating things to say. The workload is very manageable and the readings are interesting. Weaknesses: I think the course could have been structured differently, and perhaps strike a better balance between learning things about education and learning things about journalism. I came into the course more familiar with journalism and looking to learn more about education, so I felt like having to write an op-ed about an educational topic right off the bat was a very difficult assignment, because I wasnt familiar enough with the issues to have an opinion about them. It would have made more sense to me to begin with the profile (since all the background that assignment really required was straightforward instruction in how to write one) and work on the op-ed around midterm, after we had been exposed to a wider variety of topics and speakers.",
    "Strengths-- how invested Prof Karr is in your success! She also is very clear in her expectations. Our guest lectures, readings, and course discussions were all fabulous, too. I enjoyed our cohort of students because everyone was very invested in the course material. \r\n\r\nWeakness-- Instructions were not always very clear at the start. But, this improved overt time.",
    "Strengths: It's different, which is good! I liked the fact that I was exploring something that I never had the chance to before. \r\nWeaknesses: More time devoted to talking about the politics of education.",
    "The opportunity to revise and resubmit after receiving feedback improved my writing. The peer editing made students closer as a community. I also loved the field trip to the New York Times building and the chance to speak with reporters. \r\n\r\nOne weakness is that sometimes the readings would change halfway through the week when I had already read the original assignment so I would need to do twice the amount of reading.",
    "The class was engaging but it was not taught like a traditional seminar which it made it difficult to engage and gauge how well you were doing in the class. The professor has very high expectations for work and it is not always clear how to meet those expectations. I did like that we could write multiple drafts as it took some of the pressure off, but I still found there to be a lot of pressure and stress.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- The experience and knowledge of the professor\r\n- The interesting material\r\n- The guest speakers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The slight lack of grade feedback",
    "Strengths = guest speakers, visit to NYTimes, feedback on writing, interesting readings.",
    "The strengths of the course include the background and extreme knowledge of the professor, as well as the fact that it bridges two things that I personally find very interesting. Weaknesses are definitely in the organization of the actual classes and what is being taught; often times the student feels as if they are either pulling the class along themselves or are just along for the ride. Eventually, we reached an equilibrium, but it took a while."

   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this course if you are interested in education and want to become a better writer (specifically in finding ways to convey information to the public rather than academic-papers).",
    "Yes, but only if youre very interested in education and journalism. I think the class worked because everyone in there knew what they were getting into workload wise\/grading wise, and decided it was worth it.",
    "Yes! If you want to learn about a new field of policy, this course provides a unique opportunity to learn from a plethora of professional journalists. This is also a great course if you learn well via the process of reporting, or have an idea you wish to explore with the guidance of an experienced editor.",
    "I would recommend this to someone with a background in education whos interested in learning about journalism, and perhaps vice versa.",
    "Absolutely. Take this course if you are willing to work hard and struggle at first, but are looking to learn A TON in a constructive environment.",
    "Sure, if you're into journalism! If you want to explore education from a different perspective, than also yes. But, if you want to delve deeper into the actual politics of education, maybe not.",
    "I would recommend the course to any student interested in education studies and\/or journalism. It provides insight into the process of journalism that is interesting even for students who are not planning a career in journalism. It also greatly improved my writing.",
    "I would if you are very interested in journalism and want to go into the field and would like to be published. Otherwise, it can be a very stressful class for no reason.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because of the guest speakers, the professor, and the interesting material.",
    "Yes, I would recommend to any student who is interested in education or in journalism.",
    "I would recommend this course if you've already been involved with journalism, or if you're not afraid to take a beating once in a while. For me, it was more about learning how to work with someone of the caliber that the professor was than it was about learning to write as a journalist."
