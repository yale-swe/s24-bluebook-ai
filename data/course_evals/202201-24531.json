Learning about the racial history of mental health and the way that race and racism are incorporated into psychiatry really shifted my perspective on mental health. I learned a ton and all of it felt really applicable to real life. It definitely made me think a lot about how to change the currently accepted models of mental health, which are highly influenced by colonization and race. I had a pretty weak understanding about the racial history of mental health and the way psychiatry was weaponized as a tool of colonialism before this class, but now I feel like I can conceptualize the field in an entirely different light.",

                "learning more about the history of mental health not only in the US but also around the world! taking a cultural/racial lens was especially interesting in exploring mental health and i learned so much more than i expected. i never really get to engage with topics of mental health in other classes so this was especially interesting."

                "Professor Lopez-Carillo is an incredible person to learn from and work with. She is well versed on this subject material, a generous discussion leader, and a patient teacher. \r\nThe course could benefit from a little reworking of the syllabus and of class time to better scaffold our readings across time, geography and themes. Students come from a variety of backgrounds and familiarities with the discipline and history of psychology. What might it look like to give everyone a level playing field in terms of background knowledge, while simultaneously tapping into the knowledge that students already bring to the table?\r\nI love student facilitated discussion, but think they would benefit from more guidance from Professor Lopez-Carillo in terms of key takeaways and connecting to the week before.",
                "The professor is incredible--the kindest soul and is incredibly knowledgeable. She does a great job of having us explore mental health issues and movements across the globe, rather than just focusing on Europe or the US. \r\n\r\nThe reading can be a bit heavy, but the class is in the works so it might change!",
                "I can't think of any weaknesses, I thoroughly enjoyed this class. It was very well structured, with very clear themes each week and opportunities for students to engage in the discussion. The workload was very manageable - a final project and a few smaller assignments over the course of the semester. The midterm could be incorporated into the final project, which was great because it forced me to not procrastinate and actually have time to work on the project and think about it well in advance. The reading was not too heavy either, it felt like a good amount, and I was able to actually engage with each reading and not just forced to skim 150+ pages to get it done. The overall message of the course was present throughout the semester and everything we discussed felt like it served a purpose. Only strengths here.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lopez-Carillo is phenomenal - she is caring, insightful, and always drives the discussion forward in a meaningful way that makes classes interesting and engaging. The readings were also very good choices and having a diversity of opinions/approaches to history telling in these texts was wonderful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the instructions for assignments we a bit too vague that it was difficult to know what was expected/how grading would be done. However, it could always be clarified with the professor.",
                "strengths - Ximena is an incredibly kind instructor who genuinely cares about her students; weaknesses - I wish the course explored mental health OUTSIDE of the asylum and more readings by non-white authors",
                "The workload for this class was not overwhelming. We did not have weekly reading responses, but rather had two reading responses due anytime throughout the term, which made a huge difference. Professor Lopez Carrillo also did a great job of providing detailed feedback while at the same time being very reasonable when it came to grading.",
                "It was a great course.",
                "This course was really well organized",
                "some of the readings could be better but i loved the teaching+discussions and feedback",
                "strengths: great professor, helps facilitate class discussion but also empowers students to lead it on their own. also great course material and readings\r\n\r\nweaknesses: lots of reading, but class discussions help unpack them",
                "strengths: engaging material and discussions, relatively low workload, very collaborative environment, very timely and important topics\r\nweaknesses: sometimes, the readings were long and sometimes the class was a bit nebulous/disorganized but that's probably because it was professor's first time teaching the course. to her credit, she was always open to feedback and took our suggestions seriously which i deeply appreciated. i'm sure the next iteration of this class will be new and improved in the best ways!"

I would recommend it to anyone who's interested in mental health for sure, but it's a great class even if you know nothing about mental health or psychiatry.",
