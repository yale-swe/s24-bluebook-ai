Readings from the assigned DeafGain textbook were incredibly engaging, and even changed the way in which I conceptualize building designs as relating to signed language communication.",
                "Ability to communicate in ASL",
                "In this course, I feel I made significant progress in strengthening my skills in ASL. In addition to enhancing my ability to comprehend/expanding my vocabulary, I also learned a great deal about deaf culture and service.",
                "ASL 120 is the course in which you really begin to be able to communicate at a level that feels practical. The massive expansion of the vocabulary used in an every day manner was incredibly useful. I learned a lot more about deaf culture and deaf gain, and I began to feel confident in using many of the tools that the Deaf/HoH use to round out an experience targeted toward both hearing and hearing-impaired individuals.",
                "I learned how to increase my proficiency in signing including how to better incorporate role shifting, give directions using spatial relations I establish, and using classifiers to describe people, places, or things. Part of the course was continued exploration and study of the Deaf community, which included learning about Deaf Gains and some of the positive effects of learning a signed language that often go unrealized."

                "Strengths: Engaging, fun, Andrew is an amazing professor\r\nWeaknesses: The semester projects are somewhat unorganized, but I suspect this is due to them not running for a long time since ASL is new at Yale",
                "This class was very well organized and structured, with a lot of emphasis on parter/group work to develop practical communication skills. We were very frequently exposed to Deaf culture through ASL community events and our own service projects.",
                "This class has too many strengths to list them all; however, I must say that one of the primary strengths relates to the way my instructor, Andrew, consistently incorporated a nice balance between traditional learning methods, course-relevant games, and other forms of peer learning. Another strength relates to the Yale ASL Community as a whole. Everyone I have met in this Community is incredibly friendly and respectful. In addition, there are a plethora of community-related resources which are conducive to one's success in the course. One minor thing which I think could be improved include the Canvas sites. Sometimes receiving notifications from both the Umbrella site and section site could be a bit confusing, but this was only a slight inconvenience.",
                "Sometimes the homework felt lie busywork as opposed to actually helping me learn",
                "Strengths: my professor was very understanding in times I might have needed an extension, instruction is clear and helpful, the workload outside of class was very manageable, my professor was very engaging and kind. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there were times where my professor might have signed something very quickly in class and I missed it, and I sometimes wished we kept a running list of new vocabulary as it came up in class.",
                "One of the strengths of the course absolutely has to be the instructor. Andrew signs at a speed that is more natural when communicating with native signers and this challenges you to get better at comprehension. But he uses similar vernacular throughout the semester so you find yourself understanding signs faster and signing with less hesitation yourself.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course was class engagement after covid isolation of large chunks of the class. This is not an issue that I believe can be corrected. There is simply less engagement when large parts of the class are absent.",
                "I believe that something that needs to still be worked out a little is the field journals and service hours. Keeping track of which prompts went with which weeks became difficult and information was often inconsistent. Additionally keeping track of hours spent in service or on other community events was very unstructured. Maybe a log or google form could be implemented so a student could easily record events they attended or hours they completed, and instead of hours making the requirement for community engagement be a certain number of events they have to go to, which they can fulfill by choosing events they find themselves most interested in."

                "YES ASL is amazing and Andrew is amazing would 100% recommend",
                "Absolutely! All of the professors are incredibly friendly and understanding and the entire ASL departments feels like such a supportive community! I'm the kind of person who got very stressed out in other language classes, but I enjoyed coming to this class every day and practicing my ASL. The community events took place very frequently, and there were lots of opportunities to learn about Deaf culture. I loved my entire experience of taking ASL at Yale!",
                "I would enthusiastically recommend this class to any student (no classifiers). By this I mean, any student at Yale would benefit from the skills conferred by this course, even beyond the skill of being able to communicate with someone in another language. Learning signed languages has significant benefits outside of increased communication skills, including the refinement of spatial reasoning skills. It is my belief that ASL improved my intuitive faculties, as I often relied on intuition to understand expressive cues when communicating in ASL.",
                "Yes I would, understand the language without a lot of pressure to do well (no curve etc)",
                "Absolutely! This was one of my favorite courses I took this semester.",
                "Absolutely! ASL is such a wonderful language that will surprise you in numerous ways as most of deaf culture is truly foreign to those that can hear. Learning about the deaf community and how it has adapted to meet and exceed many societal norms has been absolutely fascinating.",
                "Yes! Take ASL II if you have the opportunity/room in your schedule. It is such a beautiful language.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course and language to other students. Learning sign language has been a great experience and interacting with the community at Yale is just as fulfilling. The course is not too difficult, and I believe it facilitates learning in the best of ways possible."
