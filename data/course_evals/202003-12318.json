                "Enjoyed how the course was in the form of a discussion and how we would use our time in class to discuss material we had worked on at home. Sometimes the amount of homework was a little too much.",
                "Strength: Professor Helverson was great! She was quite nice and responded to emails and gave us office hours when needed. The discussion based learning was great. \r\nWeakness: The curriculum might be revised so that there is more in-depth development of different skills for certain students. I feel that Fren150 is when students really start picking up skills in some areas of French (while other areas are still difficult), and it's different for each person. I think that some way to individually keep track and check in regularly with a professor would be great. The professor prepared us for the material on the exam, but the exams themselves were difficult.",
                "A strength of the course is the class size. The small class ensures that everyone participates, therefore we were all able to improve our speaking skills. Another strength was how intensive the class was: the homework & our projects really allowed us to engage with all the concepts we had learned."
