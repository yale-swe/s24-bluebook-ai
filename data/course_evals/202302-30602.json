                "This course teaches you nothing about Tuscany and is likely the course Ive taken away from the least from at Yale despite being a humanities student. Firstly, the materials are poorly selected, half of them are about British perspectives on Tuscany. Secondly, the trips and some of the materials were clearly not a matter of speciality of our instructors  neither of them seemed especially versed at mediaeval history so having them explain mediaeval art to us seemed rather pointless since they couldnt articulate whats special or interesting about the particular things they decided to see or do. The class lacked any structure and built up to nothing. There was absolutely no message to it. Although Penny is a really really nice person, the class felt like it was designed (if the word design can even be applied to it) to show us random things vaguely related to Tuscany that Penny liked. It wouldnt be this frustrating if it didnt require this much work and didnt have 6-10h of contact a week.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: most of the trips were fun and allowed the students a lot of time to explore on their own which was lovely. Weaknesses: lack of structure and message, terrible and useless feedback (usually zero or one comment per essay of the kind good work this week), lack of clear guidelines  nobody knew what to expect or how to do their assignments and it was a trial and error matter and the instructors pretty much actively avoided giving us any clear guidelines that we repeatedly asked for. Additionally, the workload was not only very high for one credit but also the work feels really meaningless.",
                "I liked the visits.",
                "One of the weaknesses of the course was its lack of instructions for assignments. It took a few assignments for me to understand what it was that the professor wanted from me, which I thought was unfair. I would have preferred to have set directions that I could use to guide my assignments.",
                "Strengths: the trips were a lot of fun. It was nice to see other parts of Italy since Siena is so small and a bit isolated. Sarah was a good professor. \r\nWeakness: I think the course could be more structured. It was hard to see the point of the course. The trips were rarely discussed in class or tied to the bigger picture of the course so they often felt random and irrelevant. Also the course content was all over the place. We spent more time learning about British tourists' view of Tuscany than Tuscany itself. The aggressive anti-technology stance of the course is strange and excessive.",
                "Individually, I enjoyed  each part of the course... The movies, the trips, even the assignments. The course exposes us to many different aspects of art and culture. However, there is no proper structure\/overall theme connecting all of them. The theme of Tuscan identity is far too broad and does not really help to put everything together. The course also needs to be planned WITH the language course in mind (for the summer study abroad program) and recognise that it should never exceed more than half the workload \/time commitment of the language class, especially during the finals.",
                "We visited many museums and duomos that allowed us to learn new content outside of the classroom. Very little feedback was provided on our weekly papers to know what was expected- initially, these weekly responses were explained to be self-reflections of the a piece of art art\/film clip\/experience from the week but they became very analytical as we could not include our personal connection. While the guidelines for assignments were given by the professor, the actual grading was done by the TA which did not seem to align. While being a \"film\" class, I did not learn how to do film analysis even though I was expected to analyze film clips in my weekly response. At the end, we created a film which seemed like an added assignment to keep us busy as most of them ended up being slideshows with music over them. It would have been helpful to get more guidelines as we could create more intentional films with engaging messages.",
                "Strengths: very interesting content\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: overly-drawn-out visits, lack of understanding about students' needs and schedules\r\n\r\nAlso this course is only 1 credit but is easily the workload (at least what the professors demanded) of 2 credits, which was unsustainable in an already demanding program"

While this course is terrible, it doesnt ruin the Siena experience and the program is definitely worth it despite of it. Just be prepared to waste a lot of time learning nothing and to be frustrated with poor structure and terrible feedback. Still, if you have the chance, you should definitely do this program.",

While visiting many museums and watching films, I felt that there was no background information or context provided beforehand. For someone who has never taken an art history or film analysis class, this course was difficult to follow along with as we did not get taught the elements of film analysis.",
