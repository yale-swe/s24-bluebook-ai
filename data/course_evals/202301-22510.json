                "I learned about different architectural model making techniques. I will say, I don't think I learned a lot from the class besides technical skills in terms of urban studies content that I might have expected to learn. The demand of the course to be in the studio working on projects was so high that there wasn't a lot of opportunities for us to engage with the readings, and the lectures were typically rapid fire 50 minute sources thoughts from the professor that included precedents to help us with assignments.",
                "This class covers a breadth of material. Students learn how to draw, develop architectural models and rationalize their work. Readings and lectures provide an introduction to architectural theory.",
                "I developed my creativity greatly. I used methods of creating that I would have not considered.",
                "Gained a new understanding and appreciation for the power of architectural spaces at different scales. Learned how to use many digital art programs, as well as concept generation and architecture modeling + drawing.",
                "This class exposed me to how sometimes instead of learning only through lectures and readings, learning can really happen with and from your peers.",
                "I learned several creative skills in this class. It really helped me get outside of my comfort zone and do more challenging investigative activities about art and architecture.",
                "Model making, rhino, architecture history",
                "I developed my skills in Adobe Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) and Rhino, as well as various workshops in the School of Architecture, like laser-cutting, using the photo room, and printing using the color plotter. I gained insights in understanding scale, creating models with a section cut, and presenting an argument via my work.",
                "This course allowed me to explore the field of architecture as a non-major, and get hands-on with studio-type assignments. It pushed my comfort with materials and tools and allowed me to think about design and fabrication in new ways. It gave me a window into architecture criticism at the undergrad level.",
                "Creative mindset, basic knowledge and skills required for architecture studio",
                "I learnt how to use the laser cutter, 3D printer, work with photoshop and a variety of other tools",
                "This was by far the selling point for the architecture major. Not only do you familiarize yourself with the school's facilities, explore interesting prompts using new mediums, the whole teaching team mentor you through it all. I learned that studying architecture at Yale is the furthest you can do from locking yourself into one career and our lessons on scale expanded my worldview. You learn little bits of machining, Rhino, and Adobe Suite, but most of that is just out of your own willingness to push yourself to the next level.",
                "This class was the perfect introduction to visual analysis, model making skills, and building strong thesis through various visual mediums.",
                "I learned how the visual world corresponds with the social, political, cultural, and economic world around us.",
                "I learned how to use Rhino, Adobe Illustrator, plus how to recreate the section of a building. The class taught me what it meant to design and how multifaceted the field is. One of my favorite courses at Yale!",
                "I learned so much in taking this course it gave me a totally different way to view the world both in terms of space, people, and history.",
                "I was able to strengthen my ability to communicate my ideas visually, I learned how to use a variety of softwares and machines like Illustrator and the Zund cutter, and I was able to interrogate my understanding of the environments around me.",
                "I strengthened design, research, building, crafting, reading, writing, and visual skills from this course.",
                "Great overview of architecture at different scales and how to view the city and urban planning. Also good place to learn model building.",
                "I learned how to regard the world through an Architectural lens. This course has been very important to my developing passion for Architecture."

                "This course was extremely demanding, but not extremely well organized. I think that it would benefit a great deal from more communication and coordination between the teaching team and the course. It was also very frequent that deadlines would be changed, and assignments and timelines were often not released until they opened. There was no set syllabus for the course, which was very confusing and made it hard to plan around. In addition, the teaching team was completely unhelpful in terms of providing help learning RINO, photoshop, or other softwares/techniques. It was very much a figure it our yourself class, which provided isolating and frustrating at times. I think if the course was more organized and expectations and timelines were more clear, it would be much more enjoyable. I did really appreciate the community formed in section and the ability to work in partners and small groups for assignments.",
                "This is a wonderful course that introduces students to so many new ideas and skills. The studio environment and collaboration among students and tfs makes the class a wonderful community. If anything, I wish there were greater emphasis placed on learning architectural design software.",
                "I enjoyed having great instructors that were all available, responsive, and helpful with their expertise.",
                "Strengths: discussion sections were very fruitful, and I really appreciated the two hours a week set aside to learn from other students and workshop ideas. It was incredible to see how engaged people were in this class, and it helped facilitate an environment to grow and thrive in. Weaknesses: lectures were relatively unstructured and it was sometimes hard to link what we were learning to the assignments; readings were forgotten about after the first week; and the constant shifting of assignment deadlines made it hard to plan things out. That all being said, the strengths of this class and especially the teaching staff hugely outweigh the weaknesses.",
                "The strengths are the sections and collaborative/discursive form that the sections take.",
                "The strengths were the freedom and creativity we had with our projects. This was also the weakness because with too many options and no strict constraint, it becomes overwhelming.",
                "Very conceptual. Wish big ideas/questions were more grounded.",
                "strengths: everything. so fun, engaging, fulfilling, satisfying.\r\nweaknesses: too many people in the class, to the point that they had to change some of the assignments so everyone would have time to present.",
                "I think a major strength of this course was how conducive it was to student creativity. Often times the prompts were just vague enough to allow for experimenting with materials and types of representations. The majority of learning in this course, as a result, was in a \"trial and error\" style which might be beneficial to some, and confusing to others. Another strength is the studio environment; you get to see the progress of all your classmates, and you definitely grow in being able to defend/explain your projects in the critiques/review sessions.\r\nA weakness can be the length of the lecture which, for this year, lasted the entire duration of dining hall lunch hours. This can be avoided by bringing a snack with you to the lecture, but I think this is more difficult for students who had class back to back on lecture days (which was quite a few of us).",
                "Very engaging (and demanding) course that creates a fun student culture of work. Faculty are attentive and knowledgeable and excited. It requires a high level of buy-in.",
                "Strength: Bimal is an engaging and caring professor. The lectures are well-structured, interesting and inspiring. All the assignments are very fun and give you a lot of freedom in trying out new ideas.",
                "Strengths: the TFs are wonderful and the school of architecture.  Also, the people in this class are wonderful and it is a great opportunity to meet several of the other architecture majors and see their projects. \r\nI think how much you gain from the courses is dependent on how much you are willing to put in.",
                "While I did enjoy our assignments and group reviews, I didn't feel like I learned much, architecturally. We had a one hour session on Rhino, which wasn't really helpful since we just watched one of our TF's go through it, and we weren't really taught how to make a good architectural model. I did like how flexible the assignments were, but I would have been helpful to have been taught a few more skills.",
                "I think this course would be strengthened if there was a greater focus on learning the software digital tools. This would be really helpful for future internships or real life experiences as well as going forward in the Yale major.",
                "Bimal was an amazing instructor. He made the course worthwhile. This is hyper specific, but I wish that the lights were turned on during lecture. It would've been a little easier to take notes that way. Other than that, 10/10.",
                "The strengths of the class is community. Unlike other courses at Yale, I truly felt as part of a greater whole and it was great to learn and work with anytime there. Also, I enjoyed the freedom that we had for each assignment, and it felt doable. Perhaps the only improvement was that at times, it felt that I was unsure of what was going on or what the exact deadlines are.",
                "This course was really incredible. While there are so many strengths in this course from how it was taught to section to the TFs to being able to learn from other students in the class, I think the only real weakness was sort of the structure of the third and fourth projects combined. I don't really want to be that critical of this, however, bc the circumstances for this semester were extreme and far from ideal about mid way through the course, and I really appreciated the flexibility of the timeline surrounding the third (and thus fourth) projects that allowed students to deal with grief and the situation in whatever way they needed to. So, I think in coming years the third project could benefit from more structure and maybe more of a focus on technical skills.",
                "This course was highly engaging, especially the studio format with the small-student groups and the access to a shared makers-space to encourage community and collaboration.",
                "Strengths: Course flexibility, course format, lectures, the readings, the class atmosphere, and Professor Mendis.",
                "Better organization and communication on assignments would be appreciated.",
                "I loved that the course is structured in a series of engaging assignments. I loved all of the opportunities for peer review and discussion about your work. I dont think this course has many weaknesses."

If you are an urban studies student, I would make sure that you really understand what you are signing up for before you take this course. And I would not recommend that ANYONE take this class with 5 or 6 classes in their schedule.",

                "Yes, this is a fun course that helped me express my ideas.",
                "100%, regardless if you are interested in architecture or not. It was so much more different than any other class I have taken at Yale  whether due to model building, the hands-on approach to all these assignments, or the collaborative approaches to each step of each project  and was a refreshing break from all of my other classes. The projects were super interesting and engaging, and it was very rewarding to see ideas go from concept to execution. Just make sure to dedicate the time it deserves.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this course to architecture, urban studies, art, or computing and the arts majors. It's a class where you get as much out of it as you put in, and it's great for people looking for a creative outlet.",
                "Yes I would even if they are not Architecture/CPAR majors because Bimal and the teaching team are really helpful it helping you develop creative ideas.",
                "Not unless you a very seriously considering the ARCH major.",
                "Yes! great way to plunge yourself into architecture! It's a lot of work though so cut out some serious time for it unless you want to pull some all nighters",
                "I highly recommend this to anyone considering Architecture, Environmental Studies, Urban Studies or in general has an interest in the art(s) with a message. I'd recommend future studies to give themselves enough time to create prototypes for each of their projects (so that they have something to show at interim reviews/sections), and that they choose something they can be passionate about at each \"scale\" of design (human-building-city-world). Overall, you'll learn as much as you put in time for this class.",
                "I recommend this course to anyone who has thought about the concept of Design in fields other than architecture, or obviously to anyone in the arch major.",
                "Yes! It's a very interesting Art/Architecture/Design course! I would recommend it to anyone as long as the person doesn't mind a heavy workload and time commitment.",
                "Yes!! One of my favourite courses at Yale so far. I think every single person should take it because design is a useful skill in any field. I think this course encompasses the best of YSoA.",
                "Yes, even if you are not an architecture major, I would recommend this course. I had a lot of fun in this class, and I really enjoyed the creativity, open-ended assignments, and exchange of ideas. I was initially worried about the workload of this class, but I didn't find it to be too much work. The critiques we had for each assignment could sometimes be long, but it was really nice to see all the other students' work.",
                "Yes, by far the best class I have taken at Yale so far. Bimal is not there to hold your hand but literally lift you up and take in the world in a new lens. The teaching fellows are there along every step and even if you do not feel like you are the most creative person, you will be surprised, with a nurturing environment, what you are capable of.",
                "Yes! Definitely would recommend. This course definitely pushed me to think deeper, and further strengthened my artistic abilities. It was the perfect combination of hard, but enjoyable and rewarding work.",
                "Yes, I would, but I would warn them about the workload.",
                "Absolutely. This course pushed me to push myself creatively and really changed how I view architecture and urban planning. Its so rewarding to see everyones work at the end of the semester.",
                "Yes! The class was amazing and it was fun to learn how to create models, use laser cutters, etc. It also gave me an avenue for creative expression through a more physical medium, which is rare in most classes.",
                "Think very carefully about taking this classdo not take it as an intro to architecture, only if you are already committed to the major.",
                "Absolutely, favorite course I've taken by a long shot.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, however due to the workload I may just advise people who have a related major to take it.",
                "Yes, absolutely! The class will expand your understanding of architecture and you will get the chance to explore a lot of interesting topics.",
                "Yes yes yes!!!! This course was my favorite course taken this semester!!!",
                "Absolutely. This course and all of the staff running it care deeply about student work and the ideas of their students. If someone is considering Architecture as their major, this is the perfect course to see if this is truly for them."
