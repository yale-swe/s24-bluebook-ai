                "The class takes an interesting course: we first learn about why democratic education manners, through examining the prevalence of democratic backsliding, and then we seek to define what constitutes a democratic education. We learned about several different conceptions of democratic citizens, how they have been achieved historically, and new modes of creating citizens through innovative schools like Sudbury Valley and New Haven Academy. Some interesting themes covered include those of patriotism/nationalism in the classroom and the role of controversy in the development of citizens.",
                "I learned about the ins and outs of civic education in America. We talked about the benefits of civics, who should teach it, different ways that civics is disseminated, and more!",

                "The strengths are the interests of the students, but they were not always able to be expressed because of the topics of each week. A weakness of the class was that Professor Fairdosi was a bit too kind (as funny as that sounds) and wouldn't push us to engage, leading to some slower discussions.",
                "The strengths of this course include how welcoming it was for students with varying experience to understand and engage with the material. Also, the readings were relevant to class discussions and also interesting. One weakness of this course though, is it does not really have a chronological progression of ideas. For example, the week-to-week topics were not building blocks on each other, so it sometimes felt discontinuous. I think this would be helpful if some of the class topics were combined to make room for another topic.",
                "Strengths: interesting, relatively light reading load; syllabus that covers a breadth of topics; Professor Fairdosi cares about student engagement\r\nWeaknesses: the seminar might have gotten slightly too large--sometimes ideas would ricochet rather than being discussed in more detail; some weeks had quite dry political science papers which were a bit difficult to discuss",
                "Strengths: Topic is timely and interesting! Prof. Fairdosi truly cares that every student feels heard and valued. Weakenesses: Sometimes conversation was a little repetitive!",
                "Strengths: Great material, classes were arranged well as each one covered its own self-contained topic, Prof Fairdosi is an incredible, engaged professor who did a great job facilitating discussion, and flexibility on the final paper to write about a topic of specific interest to you that still pulls from the class material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not really any, although for the weekly discussion questions, I would have preferred to have the option to write a ~100-word reflection on the material instead of posing two questions. Since the discussion leaders always posed the questions, we didn't end up using anyone else's, so it might have been nice to have that space to reflect to engage with the readings more deeply.",
                "Strengths include great classroom discussions and a welcoming atmosphere for intellectual curiosity. Weaknesses include an overabundance of readings during some weeks and a lack of focus on the readings at times."

                "If you are a politcal science major and/or education studies, I would recommend this class. The class gives you an opportunity to consider a niche aspect in education today. If anything, I would recommend taking this class after EDST 110 so that you can understand more broadly the issues and limitations of education since it is not explicitly discussed in this class. The criteria of the final paper also allows for freedom to explore a topic that you are interested in, which is always a plus.",
                "This course takes a deep and substantive dive into civic education. More than that, because the course is about learning democracy rather than civics, we were able to do some interesting theorizing into what we want citizens in a democracy (or our current republic) to look like. The course has a light workload, with a super manageable midterm, so I viewed it as a fun Thursday afternoon break.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Definitely! It's a great overview to civic education in the U.S. If you are interested in this very niche topic, I would definitely wholeheartedly recommend you take it!",
                "Absolutely. This course changed my entire perspective on civics and education, and of course on civic education. Please take it."
