                "Strengths - I loved the books we read and really enjoyed the topics discussed.\r\nWeaknesses - Professor Latham basically lectures the whole time. There is not much time for the students to discuss, but you know that going in if you read the reviews. It would be helpful to do a 3\/4 and 1\/4 split of lecture to discussion so people can be more engaged. It is easy to get distracted on a laptop.",

                "This course was fabulous. Professor Latham is so knowledgeable about anything you could imagine in the field. Hearing his and scholarly perspectives on issues reframed them in ways other courses have not.",

Also, your entire grade is the final paper which you submit during reading period so as I write the review, I have no idea how the grading is. I think Professor Latham said he is a kind grader, but it is a stressful situation to have your entire grade be one paper. I would recommend only taking this if you are confident in your paper.",
