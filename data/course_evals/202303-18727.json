                "How to write and explain visual movements in words.",
                "This course provided me with knowledge of the core functions of dance writing, the ability to put movement into words via original written creations, a space to grow as a writer through peer and instructor feedback, as well as a comprehensive overview of various styles of dance and dance writing from different physical and temporal contexts.",
                "I became a much stronger writer because of this course! My writing became clearer, more concise, and easier to understand after taking this course. I also got to deepen my observation skills, particularly my dance observation skills.",
                "I definitely feel that I came out of this class a better writer, more equipped to create elaborate and accurate descriptions of things. We also experimented a lot with different essay structures, and I definitely improved in creating effective structures to match the content of an essay. I also came out of the class knowing a lot of interesting facts about dancers and performances from the readings, but this class is a lot more about writing than about dance, and that's reflected in what I learned."

                "Love this class!",
                "I got a little tired of the exercises and might've liked an assignments that varied a little bit (i.e. different, more detailed requirements",
                "The trip that we took to NY to see dances were cool and the small class definitely helps to bond",
                "One of the major strengths of this course is that the readings are neither too long nor too short and take different forms (news articles, excerpts from books, dance videos, field trips). Moreover, there are plenty of opportunities for feedback from peers and instructors. In addition, the small class and configuration of the classroom as chairs placed in a circle make participants in this course very close with their peers. The course is incredibly engaging overall, especially with the field trips and live, in-class, peer editing. The main weakness was that we often did not have time to discuss every students piece or all the assigned readings. I also wish the weeks topics were arranged thematically or chronologically for better structure.",
                "Strengths: Brian is wonderful! He can be slightly intimidating at first, but his feedback is really helpful at making you become a better writer, and it is clear he cares about each of his students. The field trips are also easily the best part of the class. How often can you say you took a class where you got to go to New York and see professional dance for free? The class is also nicely set up so that we never spend too many weeks focusing on the same thing (one week we went to Beinecke, and the next we had a live dancer in class to write about). \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes each class felt slightly repetitive, and we mainly workshopped each others writing, but that was mostly because many of us requested workshopping more often.",
                "Brian is very good at picking apart your writing and giving specific feedback on how you can improve it, and the classroom discussions created really effective feedback as well. Grades ranged from around 86 to 94 on pretty much every assignment, but I always thought the grading was pretty vague, and it was never clear what differentiated the grades (but I'm sure Brian would have been willing to explain if someone had just asked). Watching videos in class was usually pretty fun, and even though the readings were a little bland sometimes, a lot of them sparked inspiration for the short essay assignments. We did two field trips to New York to watch live performances, which were fun in theory but turned out to be pretty draining and stressful because the trip would be on Saturday and the assignment about the trip would be due on Monday morning, so it would take up the whole weekend."

                "I would recommend the class because the professor is super receptive and gives great feedback. However, it takes a lot of time and thought, and I felt I often didn't have enough time to devote as much to the class as it asked of me/as I would've liked.",
                "Yes, I had never written about dance but enjoyed the class.",
                "I would recommend the course to anyone interested in writing, dance, and/or their intersection. The course dramatically improved my writing skills and knowledge of the subject. The workload is extremely heavy, however, if you want to end with a good grade.",
                "If you are interested in dance and want a fun writing class, then yes! I very much enjoyed this class and would definitely take it again. This class definitely adapts to the group of students currently taking it though, so know that the people who take it with you will make or break this class. We had a really fun and supportive group of students which made the class really fun, but regardless, Brian's knowledge about dance and journalism makes the class worth it. You also definitely don't need to be a dancer or have any dance experience to do well in this class.",
                "If you like dance, I think this course is a great way to improve your writing with something you're passionate about. The skills you learn apply to writing far beyond just dance writing, and your final paper doesn't even have to be about dance. The assignments are short (500-700 words), but are still pretty hard and really push you to improve your writing. However, be aware that the field trips are really tiring (and you still have to pay for food and the subways in NYC)."
