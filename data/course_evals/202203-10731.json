                "Both the breadth of the frameworks we learned and the depth of the specific examples the content was grounded in was amazing, in addition to the ways we engaged with it beyond the context of the book. What could be improved is the way discussions are guided. The guiding questions can sometimes be too narrow for undergrads who are largely unfamiliar with these useful frameworks. Chapter by chapter can feel too limiting, but it could be good to just start with sharing general thoughts and feelings in smaller groups for like 10 minutes just to get the ball rolling without the pressures of the entire group discussion. All in all Prof Pepi's classes are definitely one of the best I've ever taken at Yale.",

Learning through an ethnographic lens is such a refreshing and vital lens to understand the complexity of human experiences-- war, disparities, racial realities, citizenship, gendered experiences, and everything in between and beyond. There is so much to say about the depth and richness of what I was able to take away from this, but this is definitely a course I enjoyed thoroughly and would recommend.",
