                "I learned the way that law, code, and norms currently attempt to govern society online and the limitations of some of these methods compared to others. I learned the foundations of copyright law, fair use, privacy, Section 230, and how cultural considerations specific to the Internet complicate these existing laws.",
                "The readings taught me on topics like fair use, copyright laws, and expanded in the importance of norms in order to fairly govern online rules. Brad taught his students the importance of how many laws are outdated towards the modern age and one of the most importance steps towards progress is that these laws be updated to reflect modern.",

                "This class is a crash course into cyberlaw, emphasizing online copyright, privacy, and speech. I learned a ton about these areas: for instance, I now know that I previously had a poor understanding of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and net neutrality, and that copyright and defamation law have a lot of super interesting nuances. The class is also very practical: we didnt just learn about these principles in the abstract but were frequently applying them to real-world cases and disputes.",

It inspired me to do my own studying and research outside of the class (reading books, listening to podcasts, etc.), and it was incredibly engaging. It fostered an environment that allowed us to write and think freely, and to challenge the way we perceive the intersection between law, tech, & culture.",
                "This course provided a strong knowledge base of the American legal system as it pertains to technological and cultural change over time. We were presented with a wide range of types of readings and media material that somehow coalesced into a sharp understanding of important questions related to the law. An emphasis was placed on how norms, code, and law influence behavior and are all imperfect tools in shaping and regulating a well-functioning society. One particular skill I developed from this course was the ability to read a court decision or legal case and quickly find the important take-aways and questions it raised.",

                "Almost everything I learned about law, tech and culture I learned from the readings. Lecture was, simply put, a waste of time. I never felt like we meaningfully engaged with the readings in lecture and class time was mainly spent with Brad enabling the off-topic comments of a certain group of students."

            "comments": [
                "Brad was the biggest strength of the course. He really knows how to keep a class engaged and can keep a discussion/debate naturally flowing. I really looked forward to going to class because of that. Also, he brings cupcakes to every class which is an obvious strength. You also get a decent amount of opportunities to improve your grade through extra credit, like the extra credit reading response and extra credit project. I felt like one of the weaknesses of the course was the midterm. It was incredibly long, but I think it could've easily been made shorter since some of the questions were fairly repetitive. Another weakness is the inconsistency in grading based on the TA. It's also hard to determine what your grade will be in the class.",
                "The strengths are absolutely the interesting course content and the professor. This class is very interesting and my engagement was through the roof with the material. The weakness of this course is the ambiguity on grading. It's very hard to know how you are doing in the course and the grading scale is kinda hard to gauge. However, I believe this can be fixed by a conversation with the professor, and I believe typically if you engage with the course and complete the work you should be fine.",
                "Strengths: The professor is kind and passionate, you know that Brad really cares about teaching, what he teaches, and teaching us specifically. The readings are more often than not interesting and engaging, and you really do learn a lot in this class. I just feel that if someone interrogated me about what I learned in this class, gun to my head, I'd just be reciting snippets from the readings and not much from the actual classes. All that said I did enjoy this class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Many of the readings felt unnecessary or forced/didn't feel like they connected to the actual material much. You'd come to class and we'd barely talk about the actual readings or we'd only focus on one and completely forget the other 12 (because on average we got 10+ links to read through). There was no sort of introduction to how to read legal jargon/court cases at first and given the number of cases we were assigned I think that information would've been incredibly useful. It was also difficult for students to speak in class given they were often interrupted by Brad when trying to piece things together in their heads--it felt like playful banter was more encouraged in class than actually engaging with material; a discussion section might be helpful for this class, especially since we were assigned a group project in a lecture where the most you hear someone talk is a sarcastic \"professor Rosen\".\r\n\r\nThere was also a running theme of \"I'll trick you into learning\" which confused me given so many people in the class already wanted to learn..? It felt like we were running in circles at times.",
                "Brad is a true gem; Yale is immensely lucky to have him.  He is brilliant and intensely kinda role model for me personally.  And he is deeply invested in his students' learninga role model for me professionally.  Brad's care makes 183 a special course.  Learning from Brad is a highlight of my senior year and Yale education.",
                "Could use more structure.",
                "The readings were very insightful but we didn't always go over them in class and went off topic. I appreciate that we could do our reading responses on pretty much anything. The midterm was sooooo long.",
                "The strengths are the readings and the lectures. Brad gives amazing lectures and is super engaging. The readings are also very engaging, though sometimes a little long. Some of the assignments could be better with more guidance, but the feedback is good and gives students the opportunity to improve over time.",
                "I was a big fan of how Brad runs the lectures. I think it would be helpful if there was more \"on topic\" discussion as I found Brad's insights when he started to discuss particular cases very helpful. Sometimes it felt like we're watching too many videos and not discussing the readings enough.",
                "Strengths: One of the only courses at Yale that covers topics of internet law.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Brad Rosen warns you at the beginning -- don't take the class if you don't like his teaching style, which can feel very unfocused and unrigorous. Although he will vehemently disagree, I viewed this as the perfect course to Credit/D to learn about the subject without feeling like I had to buy into the course aspects that didn't vibe with me.",
                "This is one of the most engaging and fun classes I have taken at Yale.",
                "Strengths: Fun, learn a lot, free cupcakes\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Strengths: The course is a lot of fun and Brad is great! The readings were entertaining, and the way the reading responses are structured, you can really dive into specific topics of interest.",
                "Strengths: Readings were interesting, if nothing else Brad is engaging. Brad was understanding in giving the class breaks during points in the semester. Weaknesses: There were many classes which passed without us really learning anything, especially in the lectures after the midterm. Grading is odd simply because it is difficult to know how you are doing in the class at any given point. This could easily be improved by providing a grade distribution for the midterm. Midterm can be quite scary as there is nothing to really prepare you for it.",
                "Strengths - BRAD. BRAD. Brad is incredible and amazing and lecture is a joy (which is rare). He truly does trick you into learning. This is the only class where I've been able to sit back and relax during lecture and still learn the content.\r\nWeaknesses - feedback is a bit slow, but as long as you do reading responses earlier in the semester rather than later you'll be just fine.",
                "I think a lot of people are going to say that Brad is a strength of the class. I would say Brad is both strength and weakness -- if you don't like Brad's antics, you will know after day 1 or 2. He calms down a little bit after the first few lectures, so if you're on the fence, I'd stay, but his teaching style is 90% of the class. So besides that,\r\nStrengths: this class is very low-stress. Brad isn't wrong that he will trick you into learning, so you won't need to take notes. I did all the readings, but I imagine you can get away with doing many fewer of the readings than the list shows (though do the important ones or you will get bitten on the midterm). The final is very open-ended. You will probably get an A in this class if you do the readings and show up to the classes.\r\nWeaknesses: Don't expect to learn any skills in this class. You don't get feedback on improving your writing, and you don't really do anything in the class but write. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing -- you learn information and a different way of looking at the world, and that probably is enough for one class -- but you're taking this class because it's interesting, not because you expect it to help you in other classes.",
                "Strengths: Having Brad as a professor and person; well-organized and well thought out syllabus that combines legal writing and cultural/fun things (e.g., YouTube videos); engaging lectures \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Inconsistency and confusion in grading. First, participation makes up a part of your grade, but there are not many opportunities to participate in class unless Brad calls on you to briefly explain something or share a personal anecdote, or you say something so interesting to him that he takes it and runs with it for twenty-five minutes. The greater inconsistency in grading is with the 5-point grading system for the Reading Responses and the Midterm. Some TAs seemed much harsher than others when grading Reading Responses. Feedback only ever amounted to \"talk about your own opinion more\" when you just spent 2 single-spaced pages doing so. With the 5-point grading system, Brad suggests in the beginning of class that the point you receive is not a raw score (i.e., a 4/5 is not a hard 80%), because he explains that a 5/5 is pretty rare and he doesn't expect many. On the midterm, the same grading system applies but out of 50 points (i.e., a 40/50 was not a hard 80%). But, Brad is still very unclear on what an \"A\" is on the midterm or reading responses. Yes, he emphasizes from the beginning of the course that this is basically just something we have to accept as a part of the course  but that does not mean that it is not a weakness because it causes unnecessary confusion and stress for students.",
                "Strengths: brad --> please experience this man's class. Do yourself a favor. If not, take a cupcake and GTFO. He has been the light of my Yale career (and I've been here for three years already). His takes on the way we think about things not just in the course material is so helpful as an inquisitive human. He is gayly direct and will not BS you in the slightest which is invaluable. He can get you excited about anything\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: you don't really know how you are doing overall, but this isn't really something to worry about if you do your due diligence. Also it is probably worthy saying that this class is best served later on in your Yale career (aka not first year). You need expectations established about Yale so that brad can destroy them. Plus it's just more fun when you have some more of Yale under your belt",
                "This course teaches you how to become a better and more logical writer, and exposes you to material from an introductory law school class. However, the way the material is presented is engaging and fun, so much so that Brad \"tricks you into learning\" as he loves to say.",
                "The strengths are the engaging lectures and approachable professor, who is very willing to answer questions and engage with students. Some of the readings were a bit dense but Brad did his best to explain them and made sure each assignment had an important purpose.",
                "Really, really fun. Never a boring lecture.",
                "strengths - Prof Rosen is funny and a good storyteller. The class was generally very interesting and something I looked forward to. \r\nweaknesses - the directions and expectations for the midterm and additional assignments were at times, unclear or misguiding",
                "I wish there was a better frame for the readings. Often you just read through a bunch of different things and it takes Brad's lecture to string them all together. But if I had a sense of how I should think about the dialectic going into the readings, I think I could get more out of them and start to do more of that work going into class. I also wish some of the classes were more law and less culture. There needs to be a balance, and the balance is off if all of class is spent watching madonna vids.",
                "The course is strategically and effectively designed to encourage student participation. I think this is great and innovative, because student commentary and class discussions help students remember important/main topics more deeply/clearly. However, I think sometimes these conversations develop into tangents, and it can be hard for students to follow along and understand what the main point is. I also think the professor should give less attention to gunners and people who go on tangents/ask questions that don't help other students learn. When these 1-on-1 conversations go on for a while, students can feel lost and wonder what the main point is. I think the professor can tell students that he can continue that conversation with them after class or something (if the students' question/comment is taking a lot of class time and isn't adding a net-positive for the class). I also think it would be helpful to reiterate what the main point of something is after these 1-on-1/class discussions. Additionally, I think it would be helpful and fun to talk about the readings more! They are very thought-provoking, and I think it would be helpful if we centered more of our class discussions on the readings. This was the case in the earlier classes, but I believe that we talked less explicitly about the readings and spent less time on them as the semester progressed. There are also a ton of readings, and several of them are long, so I think it would be helpful to bold or * certain readings that are the most essential, so students can strategize their readings that way. This was done sometimes, but I think each week should have a marking that emphasizes the most important readings. Lastly, I think the readings should all be in PDF form, ready to be downloaded. Maybe the TFs can be in charge of organizing this and divide and conquer this task, since I imagine it is time consuming. I think a PDF version will help improve accessibility for students who download the readings on their iPad or laptop (or even print) so that they can annotate them.",
                "Strengths: Brad is an incredibly engaging lecturer, to the point where class was usually a highlight of my Mondays and Wednesdays; the content is super interesting, covering topics that are very important but that you probably havent thought about from a legal perspective much before; there are a lot of opportunities to get a ton out of this class if you put work into it (e.g., Brad goes out to dinner with students every class and anyone is welcome)\r\nWeaknesses: Very heavy reading load. I actually tried to do all of it and it would often take the better part of a full day to do the readings for a single class. I wish there were more indications on the syllabus of which readings were the most important for a given class.",
                "Strengths: Excellent format, teaching style, emphasis on learning rather than grades\r\nWeaknesses: Harder to track your progress in the class since grades are irregular",
                "This course is great in that it is exactly what you think it will be. If you love Brad on day 1, you love the class. If you don't, don't take it. Learning comes easy and it's one of the few classes where I genuinely learned and retained things. The biggest weakness of this course, and I know a lot of people feel this way, is that it can feel quite unstructured at times. Though we know Brad has a structure, it doesn't always seem that way.",
                "The courses are fun, but the readings are too bulky and boring. The mid-term exam is a bit overwhelming.",
                "Do not expect on-time grading as the TAs grade them (the professor only grades the final project), grading is much harsher than you would expect (the professor has to constantly address students' worries over grades, especially the midterm grade which most people got 70s on)\r\n\r\nStrengths: fantastic lecturing, professor is a very funny dude but is not for everyone, different experience from any other Yale course, learning about how law and tech intersect is enlightening",
                "The strength of this class was definitely the unique teaching style of the professor.",
                "Strengths  lecturing style\r\nWeaknesses  goals not clearly imparted at the beginning",
                "There are a lot of videos that are played during lecture. This can be engaging sometimes but other times it's hard to stay focused or see the meaning behind what's being shown. Other than that, it provides great insight into how these laws apply to and affect our lives.",
                "I appreciated the lecture style.",
                "The strength of the course the teaching. Brad did a fantastic job at making sure we retain the most important information of the course.",
                "I really don't see any big weaknesses with this class. It was a joy to take, and it taught me more than any of my other classes did, and inspired a new interest for me. Brad is practiced but engaging, and pushes students to really reconsider how we view our politics, our electronic habits, and our legal system.",
                "This selection of readings and style of lecture seemed very tangential and fragmented at the beginning of the course, but it soon became clear that everything was very purposeful and had a way of bringing together big ideas and fostering understanding of difficult legal and technical concepts. The course's strengths included the format of the course itself, the wide variety of material, and way it helped us develop skills in reading legal texts and comprehending difficult ideas in law. In terms of weaknesses, all I can think of is that some of the readings, references, and materials for the class could be updated given the rapid rate of change in technology and popular culture. Furthermore, the instructor invited interjections and discussion at all times during lecture and made the class very interactive---which was definitely a plus---but at times the comments made by students were too casual, unrelated to class, and hindered learning at the expense of other students.",
                "The lectures are the best I have ever attended.",
                "no weakness, all strengths",
                "j",
                "This course was designed in such a way that made engaging with the reading materials both interesting and fun. I really appreciated how Brad encouraged us to think critically about the legal cases he introduced.",
                "Strengths: Interesting readings. Interesting premise. Kind of a gut. Weaknesses: BRAD. At least for me. Some students clearly love Brad. But if you are a student who is the course to actually learn something (in contrast to just wanting a fun, weird, relatively easy course), his teaching style will most likely not be for you. You might shop the first few sessions of the course and think (misguidedly) that sure, he's quirky, but you can bear it. But NO. Heed my warning (and those of many others in previous iterations of the course!!!). If you want even a somewhat traditional class experience, he is MOST LIKELY not for you. He is aggressive in lecture (frequently cutting students off in the middle of their comments and shutting them down to the point that you don't want to speak up), fixates on extremely micro aspects of the topics we cover (so that it feels like the meat of the readings are never touched upon), permits completely off-topic comments from students in class (so that we constantly go on off-topic tangents and time is CONSISTENTLY wasted), and is so casual and cavalier with us students that sometimes it feels incredibly unprofessional and even downright mean. He regularly called out one student for taking notes in class because \"this is a class where you don't need to take notes.\" But the direct, often embarrassing callouts were so unnecessary. Shouldn't he want students to remember the lecture content? There is no reason to humiliate students in such a way.  To be clear, I don't think professors have to be extremely nice. But they should at least be professional. Also, the take-home midterm took me 24 HOURS - no joke - because the questions were so general; so general that I had to regurgitate weeks' worth of readings, which is why it took me so long. From my conversations with my classmates, this was the NORM. There is simply NO reason for a midterm to take so long. TAs' feedback on reading responses were cursory, their grades felt arbitrary, and I never really knew how to improve. But for me the real sticking point is Brad and his teaching style. Think long and hard about whether you can handle the way he teaches and uses classtime. I realized a month in that I really couldn't, but had to stick it out because I needed the credit."

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. This is one of those must-take classes at Yale. Brad (don't call him Professor Rosen) is the biggest reason to take this course. He teaches you so much beyond the content of this course, as in important life skills and how to make the best out of your time at Yale. It's especially interesting being taught by him since he was a Yale student himself, so he often tells us about his own experiences here. Overall, I really value that I was able to take this course and am glad that it was 1/36th of my Yale experience. I will say that even though the course does seem pretty gutty at first, the midterm is a huge wake-up call and is quite a beast, so if you want to do well on it, then I would highly suggest keeping up with the readings/taking notes on them.",
                "Entirely depends on who I am recommending to. Brad has a very distinct teaching style, and he \"tricks you into learning\" by incorporating seemingly irrelevant materials such as music videos, memes, parodies, etc. This class is much more valuable when you actively try to engage with him and interact. For those who are able to keep up with his super-quick-paced-to-the-point-of-hectic lectures, you will finish the course with a much better understanding of law in the digital age.\r\nWhile Brad vehemently opposes taking notes, I actually recommend at least writing some things down on paper. It can be easy to lose track of what is most important after listening to Brad tell eight anecdotes in a row. Brad won't kill you for taking notes, I promise.",
                "Yes. I would absolutely recommend for anyone who uses the internet to take this course. It gives insight to legal processes in our country and it gives you the opportunity to learn from someone who is truly an expert in their field. I have absolutely no reservations in recommending this class to another student and I, in fact, have recommended it to many of my friends. I greatly enjoyed this course and feel the knowledge you gain from it is very important. I never once dreaded attending this class.",
                "Brad is a true gem; Yale is immensely lucky to have him.  He is brilliant and intensely kinda role model for me personally.  And he is deeply invested in his students' learninga role model for me professionally.  Brad's care makes 183 a special course.  Learning from Brad is a highlight of my senior year and Yale education.",
                "Yes!!!!",
                "Yes! This was one of my favorite classes at Yale! I've never taken a tech related course before, but this made me really excited about learning more about technology and the law. I looked forward to going to lectures and it was a true highlight of my week.",
                "I would recommend it only if you know exactly what you are getting into with Brad's teaching style, the structure of assignments/grading, etc. It's a really entertaining class and introduced me to some new and interesting topics, but I wouldn't say that I came away with too much knowledge. I would only take this class as an upperclassman probably.",
                "Yes, it's fun and different enough from the other courses you'll be taking. I found out I really like reading about court cases because of this course. Brad is a chill guy and as long as you do readings you'll get a lot out of the class.",
                "If you are someone who likes classes with a cult of personality around a professor, and one where you have to be \"tricked into learning,\" take this course. If you really care about the subject and are having a difficult time finding other classes that touch it, take it as a Cr/D course.",
                "I would definitely recommend taking this course, just to have a semester with Brad.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Yes! You definitely need to make sure Brad's teaching style is for you (he's super energetic and entertaining but it doesn't work for everyone!).  As a CS major it was cool to see the application of law to the field, but this course is great for all majors.",
                "I would recommend this class if you want to take a low workload, interesting class, but not if you are seeking a good grade. Lectures are entertaining if at sometimes frustrating and Brad does care about his students.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in Law and like to have fun.",
                "Without a shadow of a doubt. Incredible. Fantastic. This class isn't for you if you want a prof who plays by the rules and is boring and is just like every other professor. This class is a breath of fresh air, though, and I absolutely loved it. One of my favorite classes I've taken. (the midterm is painful tho, but don't worry you'll do fine)",
                "If I were to go back, I would take it a semester when I was taking five classes and not as a first-year. Brad (he asks to be called by his first name) says a lot of the value in the class is as it being different from other Yale classes -- he's a very antic lecturer, in a way you might find amazing or want to leave immediately (which you should do during shopping period). It wasn't my favorite class this semester, but it may stick with me longer than anything else I take this year. So if you're on the fence, check it out. The only difference between shopping period and the rest of the year is that Brad is slightly more antic during shopping period, so if you like it during shopping period you'll like the rest of the year.",
                "Absolutely! If you enjoy his teaching style (which you understand within the first 10 minutes of the first class), you will have a great time and learning experience having Brad as a professor and getting to know him as a person. The course material and the way Brad teaches it is interesting, engaging, and important for anyone to learn seeing how present tech is in our everyday lives. Be warned about reviews that say this course is a gut. Yes, it can be if you Cr/D/F, but if you are aiming for a B+ or higher, you definitely have to put in work: The weekly readings are fairly long, you have to write at least four or up to six Reading Responses (which are two single-spaced pages each, which amounts to about 1,000 words), and complete a take-home midterm that Brad puts a lot of effort into. The take-home midterm makes for a very rewarding learning experience because Brad genuinely finds a way to incorporate all the course material learned thus far into the exam, but it turns out very, very long to write (most of my friends and I wrote 8-11 single-spaced pages). Regardless, you genuinely learn so much about the course content and life in general from Brad, and this course is absolutely worth 1/36th of your Yale career!",
                "Would I recommend this course to another student? Hmmmmmmm, Is Lady Gaga brad's favorite? YES. Obviously, take the damned class and stop looking at Coursetable you sweaty Yale student. you'll do fine and you will love your freaking life if you let go a little and take the class. You need to think more critically and brad will help you do that. Don't be a stranger to him though or you'll miss the best part of the course",
                "This course was one of the best I have taken at Yale. I highly recommend taking it if after the course selection period you find that you enjoy Brad's teaching style. If you do, then you are in for a wonderfully weird wild ride through copyright and privacy law complete with Lady Gaga videos and chickens galore. Buckle up and take a cupcake (or five).",
                "Yes! Stay on top of the reading responses and you'll get plenty from this course. Make sure to attend all lectures because you'll learn so much and have a great time!",
                "100% yes. But beware that Brad has a unique teaching style. I loved it and it worked for me, but it may not be for everyone. If you're interested, 100% shop and you'll know on day one if the course is right for you.",
                "Absolutely. I've recommended it to all of my friends too, but you need to have a specific sense of humor to enjoy the class.",
                "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale, not just a class I would recommend for someone considering law school...great learning experience for anyone",
                "YES - it was very interesting, especially if you don't know much about technology or law. You do not need a CS background to understand the material. The readings do a good job of supplementing any technical information, for the most part.",
                "It depends on what you hope to get out of it. I think you'll have a lot of fun, and if you choose to do the minimal amount of work, you could have a very high learning to work ratio (i.e. lots of learning for relatively little work). It also functions as a nice fifth class and takes some of the stress away from the rest of the semester. That said, you could probably learn more in other classes.",
                "Yes! This course is unforgettable and if you have a positive attitude and are not up-tight, you will enjoy it. It is refreshing---very different from any Yale class you can imagine. I think this class teaches you to let loose and gives you the opportunity to learn as much as you put in! If you don't try with this class and you have a negative attitude or are very controlling, you won't have fun. But if you want to challenge yourself to trust the instructor and you commit to putting effort into the class, you'll be surprised by how much you learn!",
                "Yes! This is a bucket list Yale course that everyone should at least shop, if only to see whether Brads teaching style is for you. Its been one of my favorite classes in all of college so far. The lectures meander but are great (and the digressions are always valuable in their own ways), the exchanges between students and Brad are super interesting, and overall this is just a very engaging class.",
                "Yes; Brad is an amazing lecturer and has many valuable insights about life and computer science.",
                "Yes. Go to the first day of shopping period and you'll know instantly.",
                "Yes if you credit d fail this course or just audit it.",
                "Yes, it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience lecture-wise. Being able to watch memes and parodies in class was something I never expected at an institution like this. Hilarious, isn't it?",
                "This course is different from the normative classes, definitely recommend to students who are interest in law of CS.",
                "Depends on how interested in law they are and if they fit Brads teaching style",
                "Yes, it is an 'easy' course with lots of reading which is sometimes dull, sometimes fascinating. It's worthwhile and refreshing to have someone like Brad teach.",
                "I enjoyed the unique teaching style and really was fascinated with the content.",
                "Yes. Brad is a one of a kind professor and will make your Yale experience infinitely better.",
                "I would highly recommend this class. It is easily my favorite course I have ever taken, and I think that anyone who is an unconventional learner or thinker should consider adding this to their schedule.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It was very unorthodox but was a great experience and had a way of tricking you into learning content without you even realizing it.",
                "YES! At least shop it once. This course is amazing. Brad's lectures are not only fun and hilarious, but actually engaging and necessary to understand the changing world we live in. No one at Yale should pass up the chance to take a class with Brad! PS: YOU GET CUPCAKES!",
                "yes bc its dope",
                "k",
                "I would highly recommend this course to nearly every Yale student. The skills That I learned from Brad are applicable to nearly every discipline and he truly raised my expectations for teaching.",
                "No. Because of Brad's teaching style, and because I learned very little.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. Brad is a phenomenal teacher and mentor, the teaching and material are highly engaging, and fun. A student taking this course should be prepared to do ALL of the reading if they want to get the most out of this class; the lectures (already great) are massively better when you've done all the readings and feel ready to contribute to the class."
