                "I learned a lot about how axioms build up set theory, cardinals, ordinals, Axiom of Choice and its applications, and improved my mathematical proof skills.",
                "I learned about set theory, which is basically a way of redefining all of math in terms of sets. The concepts were very abstract (things like defining addition on the natural numbers via recursion, etc), so the class was entirely proof-based, and I practiced a lot of proof-writing.",
                "This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the basics of set theory. It covers the axioms of ZFC, including how to apply them to construct sets and prove theorems. It also discusses cardinality, countability, and the basics of functions. The course ends with a discussion of cardinals, ordinals, and their applications to transfinite induction/recursion and different types of arithmetic. It essentially provides a foundation to construct the most important parts of math.",
                "I improved my mathematical reasoning skills (especially my symbolic reasoning skills). Especially as the course progressed, I learned more of the content (cardinals and ordinals, etc.). I got more careful with my proof-writing and more aware of some cool stuff related to the foundations of math. Overall, very interesting course."

                "The handouts are very clear and very helpful for psets, exam reviews, etc. The lectures pretty much do the same things as the handouts. Psets are not too stressful. Chill course overall.",
                "This course is quite well-organized. The lecture notes were very clear and helpful, and the psets were helpful in consolidating materials learned in class. One thing to improve is that the psets grading could be faster.",
                "The course was taught well, problem sets were extremely helpful in deepening my understanding of the material, and James gave clear and engaging lectures and was always available to and responsive to students. At times the exams felt a bit beyond what we had done in class/problem sets, which was sometimes frustrating since it was unclear how to prepare, but other than that, I cannot think of anything that needs to be improved.",
                "The strength: James is a fantastic teacher and professor, and he is extremely knowledgeable and approachable. Set theory itself is also pretty interesting, and James gave handouts for each class that helped organize learning.",
                "The course gives a great overview of set theory and develops many important theorems. The hangouts and lectures were organized well, and the psets helped me understanding the material. A few of the proofs in class were harder to follow, such as the proof for recursion theorem.",
                "Strengths: James is a great teacher, and is very tuned in to how his students are doing with the material. His office hours were super helpful because it almost always felt like I could ask any question, even if it was super dumb, which was a really healthy learning environment. Also, you practice a lot of very careful and meticulous proof-writing. Material-wise, I thought the end of the course -- with all the different sizes of infinities, etc -- was very interesting. \r\n\r\nA lot of class was spent on the harder, longer proofs, which was both a blessing and a curse -- I definitely wouldn't have been able to figure it out on my own, but it was still hard to follow in class. James was pretty much always aware of how much we were understanding, though, and would slow down or repeat material if we hadn't gotten it. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: For me personally, I sometimes felt like there was no motivation to do the things set theory is all about -- like defining the natural numbers in terms of sets -- because it seemed pointless. But that's just my opinion.\r\n\r\nOne way I think the course could be improved is if ordinal arithmetic came before cardinal arithmetic, and if more of the course was spent on ordinals and cardinals. I got them a bit mixed up sometimes and I think it was some of the most interesting material, so I would have liked to focus more time and energy on them.",
                "The handouts were AWESOME. I appreciated the lectures and the copious office hours. I feel like the course overall was very well structured to support my learning. I think James was very aware of when things worked well and didn't work well, so this class will improve when he teaches it as second time almost automatically."

                "Yes if its taught by James. Hes a great professor.",
                "Yes, Id definitely recommend this course, but with a few small caveats. James is by far the most devoted professor Ive had, and attending lectures and office hours was genuinely enjoyable. That being said, the material gets extremely abstract in the second half of the course, and while it was interesting and worthwhile, I had to devote many hours to trying to understand what was going on. Unless youve had prior experience with highly abstract math or have an intuition for this kind of thing, be prepared to put in the time.",
                "I would. The difficulty and workload ramps up significantly after the first midterm, so be aware of that, but the course is engaging and exceptionally well-organized.",
                "Yes! Please take this class if James is teaching.",
                "Yes! This course provides a great fundamental understanding of ZFC, cardinals, ordinals, and how we build the natural numbers, rationals, reals, etc.",
                "If you're really meticulous and interested in math and math philosophy, set theory would be a great class for you. Set theory was sort of invented as one way of explaining what numbers are, so if you are curious about the ontological status of numbers, or seeing that treating them as sets can be a consistent way of thinking about math, then you'll be very motivated in this class.",
                "Absolutely! The professor is super nice and engaging and the content varies from mildly interesting to mind-blowing. It can be tough to grasp the abstraction at times but eventually everything connects very nicely. It is a very interesting course that I strongly recommend.",
                "Yes! Beautiful math and a great instructor who really cares about his students. It was very difficult for me to wrap my head around a lot of the concepts, but very worthwhile. If you appreciate the beauty of math, you should take this course. It is harder than you think it might be, but very cool."
