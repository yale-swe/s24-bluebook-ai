I gained insight on certain specific receptor signals and the molecules that make up cellular membranes.",

One of the skills that i developed was my ability to read academic work due to the reading journals held in section where we would discuss scientific papers and understand their findings, research methods and the developments made from them.

                "Awful course, worst Ive taken at Yale. Its not that succeeding is hard in this class, its just that everything about the class is miserable, especially the lectures. Because theres so much emphasis on the experimental techniques that allowed scientists to learn things about cells, we spend a lot of time learning about archaic experimental techniques (like autoradiography). What good is this? It neither improves my understanding of biology nor helps me understand modern lab techniques I might need to use someday. The topics of discussion are also strangely limited. We spent three weeks talking about the properties of the phospholipid bilayer but never once mentioned ATP synthesis.",
                "This class moved very fast and there was a lot of content.",
                "Strengths of the course were the engaging lectures and professor involvement in discussion sections. Weaknesses of the course were nothing. I have no suggestions on how this course could be improved!",
                "Much more organized than BIOL 101. Professor Hartman's lecture slides were a little bit unorganized, and it made it difficult to follow along since it was like going in circles sometimes.",
                "pacing is bad",
                "A strength of the course was how the quizzes have been designed to test understanding of lecture material and it provides a chance to recall that information but a weakness would be the sheer amount of content put into such a short course, I personally felt like some topics were glossed over when more time spent on it would have allowed me to gain a better understanding.",
                "Overall it was pretty good with teaching content, it was annoying that often weekly unit content wouldn't be finish and bleed into the next week and then homework and quizzes would have to be adjusted and posted late only giving a few days to complete it.",
                "Strengths: The assignments are organized well, and the TFs are great. Gives a decent overview of cell biol.\r\nWeaknesses: Prof Hartman often has too many slides that she doesn't get to. This leads to sometimes rushed explanations and lectures that are not engaging and feel like prof is just trying to speed through as many slides as possible. This course also spends (in my opinion) too much time on experimental techniques and could spend more time explaining concepts in more depth.",
                "Lectures weren't great",
                "Strengths: Weekly quizzes were low-stress and a good way to consolidate the week's information.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures never finished all of the content that was supposed to be covered. Discussion section papers were not understood by anyone in my section because we had so little experience reading papers and the annotations were rarely helpful. The annotated papers would propose questions to us, despite the fact that we relied on the annotations for a basic understanding of the paper. The class is pitched as a biology class for anyone, regardless of their biology background, but those without a proper background are at a severe disadvantage. Many concepts that are typically covered in high school biology are swept over rapidly in lecture, such as all of mitosis. The content is a mix between fundamental cell biology concepts (what are organelles? how do signal pathways work?) and incredibly specific papers\/arbitrary details about fundamental concepts (You read a whole paper about Listeria bacteria, which uses actin filaments to propagate into other cells. The paper doesn't actually teach you anything about actin or the cytoskeleton, it's just that this bacteria happens to use actin filaments as a means of infection. You will also need to memorize concepts such as the number of microtubules in certain cellular structures, without any explanation of why this is important.)\r\n\r\nThis course felt at times like it was trying to be an upper-level biology course about experiments and research rather than an introductory course for students who have little to no experience learning in biology. I think it could be improved by spending less time on research methods and experimental techniques and more time on fundamental ideas and concepts of cell biology. As someone who has no intention of pursuing biological research, but needs to learn cell biology for my intended career\/major, I feel like I would have benefitted much more from a class with this change.",
                "I did not like this course. It was very easy to get lost during the lectures and the infographics on the slideshows did not make sense. I also wish there was more organization with the course organization and not haphazard changing of the lecture schedule. I felt thrown to the wolves on a lot of journal articles that we had to analyze for discussion section.",
                "Strengths: All the information you need to succeed is easily accessible in the slides or unit information sheets. Enrichment was beyond helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of lag time in getting back homework feedback\/keys back in time to review for the exams.",
                "Strengths: Recorded lectures. Ed Discussion. Combination of quizzes, problem sets, and exams. TA feedback on problem sets. Reviewing information from lecture in discussion section. The instructors' passion for the material and dedication to the students.\r\nWeaknesses: Unclear lectures. It often felt like an entire semester of material was being packed into six weeks. Certain sections of material were glossed over, yet students were still held accountable for very detailed information only contained on slides that were nearly skipped over during lecture. This resulted in a lot of self-motivated self-teaching by students. Also, the organization of the lectures make note-taking very difficult, as it was often impossible to discern what information would be necessary to remember for exams while it was being presented.",
                "This class sincerely felt like an info dump. There was so much being covered each class and it was sincerely very difficult to keep up during in-person lecture. This is what ultimately encouraged my choice to strictly watch the video recordings. I likely how this course encouraged my interaction with scientific papers by requiring me read them weekly for discussion sessions. The ability to ask question and promptly receive answers though the Ed Discussion was very useful.",
                "This course was very densely packed and I felt like I learned a lot. I feel as though this happened largely due to me teaching myself through revision of lecture slides and other third party material online. The content of the course is definitely a strength but I wish lecture was a bit more engaging. It moved very fast, though I understand this had to happen in some way to accommodate all the material.",
                "The strengths of this course was that Professor Hartman and Professor Loreng were both wonderful lecturers. Their passion for biology was evident and it was a privilege to be taught by both of them. The topics were all engaging and interesting and truly had real life applications to the lab and beyond. However, there were instances were the course material felt disorganized and some of the material did not feel like introductory biology material, but simple diving straight into laboratory molecular biology training.",
                "I guess there might be way too much factual info and also the experimental techniques studied are not all up to date",
                "Lectures could be organized better to help students understand how concepts connect to each other. There were moments in lecture when I did not understand how any of the things Dr. Hartman was talking about were related. I understood once I rewatched the lecture and did some outside research, but I think the slides could be rearranged to facilitate this.",
                "Requires application of basic knowledge taught in class to problem sets and exams which can be challenging but rewarding once you understand it.",
                "The lectures were often rushed through the content. Maybe reducing the number of slides and having the key points be focused on would be improved the amount the content not covered.",
                "Way to much information in a very short period of time",
                "I enjoyed the structure of the discussion sections and how we had access to the slides and summary of concepts we needed to know. I think the organization of the slides and content can be improved. Sometimes it would jump from one concept to the next and then come back to a concept.",
                "Very uninspiring coursemissed opportunity to make people on the fence of liking biology to be engaged.",
                "Hartman is not the most interesting lecturer, and there was so much information per lecture. I feel that this class would be better if it was a 3 day per week, 50 minute lecture rather than 2 day 75 minute lecture.",
                "Strengths are that there are so many resources for you to reach out and get help: recorded lectures, Ed discussion, unit structure guides, discussions, office hours. Weaknesses are mostly just that the content is not my cup of tea and lectures are very hard to understand",
                "I think a pretty good course. A lot covered in little time which was hard. Well taught.",
                "The course material was very interesting. One weakness would be the pace at which we went through material  lectures often felt rushed. Consequently, I felt like sometimes we didnt go into concepts in depth enough and instead breezed through things, which made it a bit more difficult to effectively understand each topic brought up and how they connect to each other in the broader scheme of things.",
                "I believe lecture slides could be formatted differently as they were difficult to decipher at times on account of the font.",
                "Strengths: low stakes quizzes and psets were fair\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: half a semester class so there is so much content to get through yet so little time to do it",
                "It wasnt taught super well because the lectures were kind of boring. Also the PSETS were tougher than the learned content.",
                "Strengths: Workload was pretty manageable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were not particularly engaging. Especially toward the beginning, they were not paced very well and the course content had to keep being reorganized, making it difficult to follow along. It felt like compared to BIOL 101 there were not many office hours or opportunities to get help.",
                "The syllabus was structured in an orderly way. The meme contest is a good way to get extra credit.  The content was a lot to understand sometimes and most of the times we could not finish everything on the slides. I feel like there is so much to cover for just a half semester and everything was so rushed.",
                "The recorded lectures were amazing, I learned so much and they were so easy to follow in 101. Professor Loreng was also a great professor; he taught my section really well and clarified so many concepts in an easy and accessible manner. The content of 101 was also digestible. However, there was way too much content in 102 to be manageable, and none of it was fun to learn. Please cut down on material or give us more time to learn.",
                "strengths are course was application heavy and taught how to apply experimental techniques to learn cell biology; weaknesses were questions on problem sets are sometimes vague in what they are looking for in answers, leading to unnecessary points lost",
                "There was way to much material covered over the course of a half of a semester, there was no textbook for the course so you could only learn the material during lectures which were too fast paced or by going back through the hundreds of lecture slides which were not very helpful, the midterm exam and the final were very difficult due to the unreasonable amount of material that was covered on both, and the problem sets were quite difficult and graded extremely harshly.",
                "The strength of this course was the depth of the topics it covered. We learned in detail about the lipid bilayer, protein transport, and the cytoskeleton. We also learned about a wide array of microscopy techniques and experimental procedures used to observe and work with cells. At the same time, Prof. Hartman placed a huge emphasis on the importance of historical context and learning not only who discovered these concepts but how they were discovered. I enjoyed the meme contest and loved the activities during the lecture; they were a great way to give students a break and encourage students to come to the lecture and participate. The weakness of this course was the fact that there was too much content and too little time to teach it. The one-hour lectures were dense and difficult to understand. The course even came with a 30-minute pre-lecture, a true indication of how much content students were expected to already know and be able to master! This was evident in the fact that the last six minutes of the course ended with the statement: \"...By the way: know all the steps of mitosis. See you at the final.\" I recommend cutting down on course content and aiming for a broad introduction to the field rather than an in-depth understanding of certain areas such as protein transport and the lipid bilayer. It was obvious that the course was tailored to the professor's preferred topics as two weeks were spent on protein transport and only one lecture was spent on cell signaling. The emphasis on these specific areas was confusing and frustrating. With regard to the exams, the midterm was way too long for the time given as it takes students considerable time to digest each experimental design and interpret data. Also, forcing students to write in pen and giving them such little space to write was frustrating.",
                "The course is very evidently the outcome of a lot of effort by the teaching faculty, and the level of involvement and dedication is a massive strength. The course would be improved by having a summary of every chapter for those who feel overwhelmed by the amount of content when attempting to study.",
                "The lectures are the only source of material which makes it difficult to address secondary sources for elaboration such as textbooks because many of the subjects we talk about or have difficulty with appear as research papers or dense and jargon-heavy explanations when you attempt to look up further explanation. Lectures are difficult to follow with notes oftentimes seemingly disorganized. Its also frustrating when we consistently dont get through material.",
                "This course covers a lot of material super quickly; I think it would be more fulfilling if it were a full semester course. There were many processes that I would have enjoyed to learned more in depth, but the timing of the course does not allow for that.",
                "Strengths: really interesting, liked the focus on experimental techniques, discussion sections were immensely helpful and really liked that I got experience reading scientific papers in a guided setting, fair amount of work \r\nWeaknesses: a LOT of material, a bit overwhelming even having seen AP Bio, would have been cool to get more review or slow down a bit, lectures could be a bit dry at times\/not a ton of interaction\r\nMay be better as a 3-day-a-week, 50-minute class to make it more manageable given there's a lot of material",
                "Teaching format was disorganized. It would be better to emphasize key objectives before going into subjects at hand.",
                "This course would benefit from a change in professor.",
                "Overall, I think that one strength of this course was that it covered a lot of material and provided a comprehensive overview of cell biology. I thought the psets and quizzes were reasonable -- challenging, yes, but helpful -- and I thought the exams were fair and allowed us to really show what we had learned (though I did feel that the final had some things we hadn't learned about). One weakness was that it moves really fast and topics often get skimmed over in lecture, so if you don't review content on your own you could easily get lost and overwhelmed. However, given that there is simply a lot of material to be covered and not a lot of time, I'm not sure this could be improved.",
                "The course covered a lot of material, which was both a strength and a weakness.  I loved learning all about the cell but I wish we had more time.  If the lectures lasted a whole semester, it would have seemed more manageable.  It was just a bit overwhelming.",
                "BIOL 102 did a strong job at presenting introductory cell biology concepts, especially given the breadth of student experience upon entering the course.",
                "Too much lecture slides and notes to cover for both the insteuctor and the students",
                "The class was poorly structured as the lectures were often disorganized and confusing. Strengths are that the problem sets helped with understanding.",
                "Weaknesses: the midterm was way too long",
                "Weakness: very disorganized and lack of concetration.",
                "Itd be more engaging if lecture formats were changed every once in awhile.",
                "Weaknesses -- quiz grades\/answers were not posted with enough time to study for the exam. Quiz grades were erased accidentally and then the quiz was reassigned to be due on the same day as another quiz. Some content tested on the quiz was not taught in lecture until after the quiz was due.",
                "strengths - the discussion sections and enrichment were helpful. \r\nweaknesses - the lecture sometimes required prior knowledge.",
                "Strengths: highly structured\/organized (same workload each week, made it easy to delegate time\/assignments diligently), plethora of resources (peer tutoring, instructor office hours, and Ed discussion forum to ask additional supplemental questions), offered unique insight into empirical techniques used in biology (class topics were not limited to cell concepts but rather how they are studied in laboratory settings as well), PowerPoint slides and lecture-recordings available to all students at all times. \r\nAreas for Improvement: at times, lectures felt fast-paced which lent for confusing explanation of certain topics for which I had less exposure. But usually, I could solve this problem by reviewing lecture resources\/asking on Ed for clarification.",
                "There is simply not enough time during the semester to cover all of the material. There were many times when the professor had to shorten or remove units from the topics. As for strengths, it does provide a basic understanding of cell biology.",
                "I think the exams, problem sets, and quizzes were all well-written and appropriately challenging. This is a large lecture course so it is understandably difficult to organize, but I still believe the organization could be improved. Giving students more notice about assignments and providing better, clearer communication would improve this course. It was especially unclear as to how the course would be graded (even a general idea would have been nice) until after we had taken the midterm exam, which caused many people to be stressed upon receiving midterm grades and then not knowing what these grades would mean for their final grade. I think outlining these policies in the syllabus and explaining them before the exam would have been much better for the students.",
                "Strengths: lots of materials covered, lowest quiz dropped, enrichment, discussion section very helpful \r\nWeakness: could be a bit disorganized at times",
                "slides are a bit disorganized",
                "Strength: the PowerPoint had everything I could ever need to know, and the recorded lectures were extremely helpful.\r\nWeakness: there is a lot of information that must be filtered through and after taking Bio 101, Bio 102 has a significant increase in content, which I was not prepared for at all. I had a lot of trouble reading through scientific papers to determine what unfamiliar concepts are necessary to know and entering a different field of cellular biology every week was a bit difficult to adjust to every week in terms of reading scientific papers.",
                "This class was very good at teaching much about the cell in a short period of time. However, time management was an issue during lectures.",
                "Strengths include the amount of resources available to students, opportunities to gain extra credit, and learning very valuable skills needed by researchers in wet labs. Weaknesses include trying to cram too much topics\/information into one class lecture. There is just too much information that some needs to be cut out completely from the course to ensure effective engagement and learning. Often time the last ten minutes of the lecture we would rush through more than 20 slides and it is very overwhelming and decreases our ability to learn and understand.",
                "I think the course content is interesting, well presented, and supported by TAs and professors well. The biggest weakness of the course to me was a lack of understanding as to the format and necessary prep for the exam, which related to the fast-paced nature of the course and large breadth of content with many specifics we were supposed to learn.",
                "More engaging lectures would be helpful. This could be achieved by going more in depth on important topics, moving around on stage instead of staying behind the podium, and adding hand written notes or comments to the the slides during lectures.",
                "Pros: interesting and relevant material; well-prepared for midterm and final; Discussion sections were useful \r\nCons: Professor Hartman is good at explaining but often not engaging. More confidence would fix this issue",
                "Strengths - you do learn about the principles of\r\ncell biology\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the information is a lot to retain and sometimes it is not clear what is most important",
                "There are a multitude of resources available; however, some of the lectures and slides are disorganized.",
                "The about of content that this half semester course covers is quite a bit which is good for an intro bio course. I am not the biggest fan of the structure of the lectures, but overall the class isn't terrible.",
                "I appreciated that the lectures were recorded and posted on Canvas because it was helpful for when I had to miss class or when I had to review the material while studying. However, I think a big weakness was the disjointedness of the lecture topics. Often we would pick up class on an entirely different topic or mid-lecture, there would be a shift that often threw off my train of thought. I would have appreciated a more clear and defined structure on what topics were being covered and how they related to one another.",
                "It was highly disorganized. Quizzes had to be re-taken multiple times. TFs did not seem to have good communication with instructors. Lectures and lecture notes were confusing to parse through because of the length and amount of adjustments being made to covered course material.",
                "Strengths: TAs were useful provided great support to students, interesting content and lectures, clear dates for all assignments \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lack of transparency before midterm; too much content in each lecture made taking notes difficult and made absorbing content difficult; conflict ED responses and typos on quizzes caused confusion; too much content overall in too short of time that was at times not well covered or explained",
                "I think I wish the lectures were more engaging.",
                "The course provides students with a decent understanding of what kind of processes biologists are interested in studying and how they do it. I thought the discussion sections were fairly helpful and interesting. Compared to other classes, Bio 102 does section the best. I think there was too much detailed information to try to learn at the start of the class which made the midterm incredibly difficult. It is crazy to believe that Professor Hartman had to cut out information.",
                "The course structure was scattered, although all the material was correct.",
                "Strengths: great canvas page, many resources, great communication, consistent structure, good grading, collaborative Weaknesses: lots of information, lectures are very slide based, PSET grading was very unclear",
                "Incredibly designed course that reinforces learning three-fold through lecture, discussion section and optional enrichment. I felt supported by Professor Hartman during lecture, my TFs (and other TFs during make-up discussion sections) and Professor Loreng during enrichment.",
                "Strengths: There are many resources to resort to for help (enrichment, peer tutoring, ed, etc.)\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures did not feel very organized. The professor would often run out of time and not go over all the slides, so sometimes it was confusing on what we needed to know for the exams. Also, since there were so many slides, some of the content in the lecture was rushed. So, knowing which concepts were more important than others was confusing since a lot got rushed through.",
                "Strengths include discussion sections that help students analyze papers. Weakness is that the professor was not engaging and did not teach many applications of biology.",
                "The course covered a tremendous amount of content, which was good but made it challenging to digest it all.",
                "Discussion section was a plus, problem sets were a weakness. Quite vague questioning with specific answers taken.",
                "na",
                "A strength of this course was that it focused heavily on the skill of reading scientific literature and introducing us to key papers in the field. It also focused on teaching us cell bio research techniques, which was interesting and helpful for those who are interested in pursuing research. A weakness of the course was that the lecture slides were often very wordy and full of information, which was hard to digest and process at times. However, repetition of the information in lecture was frequent, which helped with learning the material.",
                "One strength of the course was the sections as I feel like they very well explained the experiments and allowed me to draw connections with the lecture. One weakness of the course is the fast pace, but that is natural because of the amount of content.",
                "The discussion sections were truly a strength of this class, since if gave you an introduction into how to break down and analyze papers",
                "Generally interesting but very specific. You need to have background biology knowledge or else you wont get much out of the course",
                "Strengths -- structure was fine on Canvas\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- too many to name, there is too much variability in grading without substantiation, the material is very dry and seems to be more focused on professor's interests than \"intro cell biology.\" Exams were harder than they needed to be and there was little to no practice material for prearation for the course. Communication was bad between the professor, course coordinator, and students as due dates were changed without much prior knowledge",
                "Strengths are that the homework and quizzes translate pretty well to the tests. The biggest weakness in my eyes is that there was a lot of content packed into such a short amount of time which meant that things usually were not explained well. We would go over a topic and it felt sometimes that important information was referenced many times but the explanations were rarely detailed enough.",
                "bad professor. Seemed unprepared during lectures and slides were hard to follow",
                "I feel like the teachers and TA's know the material themselves but I feel that conveying that knowledge is somewhat difficult.",
                "strengths: in a lecture hall and also offered virtually, good feedback from TAs\r\nweaknesses: lectures were not engaging, unnecessary focus on experimental techniques instead of biology knowledge, learned about random stuff that didn't seem to connect with each other, lecture materials\/powerpoints and assignments were poorly planned, lecturer deleted our responses for a quiz then made us retake it and added more questions when we already had another quiz due that weekend and an upcoming midterm",
                "The strengths of the course are that it pushes the student to learn and has office hour options, yet the weaknesses are that the instructor is not clear and there are frequent mistakes."

                "No. Awful course. The lecturers are not good at teaching, and there's no way to learn the content aside from the lectures since there is no textbook. Lecture slides are poorly organized and formatted. A typical slide might contain an image from a cell bio paper with the caption cropped out and no further explanation aside from a few bullet points of vocabulary words. Not good for learning unless you copy every word the instructor says into your notes. Unbelievably boring: gives no big-picture view of the major patterns and processes that could make cell bio super interesting to learn about.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to tithed students who are interested in learning about the cells and molecules that carry out vital processes. It was deeply engaging and I found this course rigorous and challenging. I especially enjoyed discussion sections as it was a time for me to practice what I learned. Thank you!",
                "Yes i would recommend this course to another student as it was interesting and engaging. Lectures were clear and easy to follow, having the slides provided allows for content to be followed whilst Professor was talking about that topic and the workload wasnt anything too much greater than any other courses.",

I think this course would be extremely for helpful to STEM students, especially if they are going to be interning in labs over the summer and beyond. It definitely builds your knowledge from the very beginning, although it doesn't really associate or pick off from BIOL 101.",

I believe that Prof. Hartman's lecturing style will become more refined with time and am hopeful that future lectures will be more relaxed and well-organized. In its current stage, the course could be very stressful at times as you were asked to memorize an absurd amount of material, including all the steps of a dozen experimental techniques, distinguish and choose between experimental techniques as well as experiments that led to scientific breakthroughs in the field of cellular biology. Personally, I am not a fan of having two lectures, a quiz, and a problem set each week, especially since lectures required an enormous time and effort investment outside of class. I believe the quiz and problem set could be combined to better facilitate student learning and mastery of the material. In its current form, take this course if you are sincerely interested in cellular biology with a strong focus on the medical field, must take it for your major, or must take it for a postgraduate requirement. This is NOT a gut science class and will require lots of work and memorization.",

The good thing about this sequence is the encouragement of peer collaboration on PSets and even in enrichment. Its a great class to find others within STEM and simply have study buddies.",

I know many people have to take this as a major or program requirement so they would be taking it regardless, but I honestly really enjoyed BIOL 102. It was definitiely a lot of work because I didn't come in with background knowledge of cell bio (most of the lecture info went over my head the first time so I had to go back and review), but in the end I found the class to be useful and rewarding. For example, I am working in a lab at the med school this summer and I'm so glad that I took BIOL 102 because I am getting to see many of the concepts and experimental techniques we learned about in class as they play out in the \"real world\".",

It presents a unique exposure to not only cell biology concepts, but more importantly, experimental laboratory techniques (differential centrifugation, gel electrophoresis, Immunoblot, microscopy, immunolocalization with antibodies, pulse-chase, GFP fusion proteins, FRAP, freeze-fracture TEM, patch-cap with bivalent antibodies, etc.). This generates unique insight into empirical studies in biology, which I had not received in a high-school or Yale biology course thus far. With regards to the class structure, the workload is relatively manageable and also predictable (1 problem set and take-home quiz per week). The instructors\/TFs care about your success and make themselves available via several interactive resources to best support learning.",

While the course covered many important topics in biology, I think some topics were unnecessary while some topics I would consider vital to introductory biology were not covered. For example, we never learned about cellular respiration or photosynthesis, both of which seem important for a cell bio course. Additionally we learned many research techniques that were interesting, but perhaps we could have spent less time on those and more time on some subjects that were missed.",

                "I believe this course is important to understanding the foundations of biology.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, however, I would encourage them to seek out office hours or find a place to get extra help for the harder material in the class.",
                "No, I highly recommend testing out of the bio sequence so that you do not have to take this course. It is highly disorganized. There is no communication among the teaching team.",
                "As it provides a comprehensive insight into some aspects of cell bio, yes. in terms of its organization and other aspects of the course such as the clarity before the midterm, pace of lectures and clear responses given to student questions, no.",
                "I would only recommend this course to someone who has to take this class for their major.",
                "This course is necessary as part of the bio sequence. If you are coming in with little biology background the speed at which the course shoves information at you is hard to synthesize. Be prepared for the copious amounts of very detailed information you will be given. The information all feels a little bit random, but it is definitely possible to understand it all.",
                "Yes, but only if it is a prerequisite.",
                "Yes because its foundational knowledge.",
                "I strongly recommend this course to other students because not only is the material super interesting and way more engaging than high school biology but there is so much support from professors, peer tutors and peers that you have a great chance of succeeding.",
                "No, unless it is needed for your major or pre-med. You have to study a lot outside of class, which adds on to the workload already present in the class.",
                "Yes, especially if you need an intro to biology course.",
                "I would recommend this course because I left much more knowledgeable about cell biology, and it is foundational to later biological science courses.",
                "Not if they don't need to take it.",
                "na",
                "As a non-STEM major, I would recommend this course only if you are willing to put in the work and are genuinely interested in biology. This course goes into specific detail rather than an overview of cell biology, so it is not a gut class and requires a lot of time put into studying.",
                "Yes, because it offers a food foundation for cell biology, and I think the topics are interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student that is interested in biology and particularly in cell biology research.",
                "Yes, although I would warn them of the high workload and quick pace.",
                "Yes, a fundamental course for future biology classes",
                "Yes if needed",
                "No, unless you're forced to take it because you are premed. Then again, try to place out somehow.",
                "Yes because it teaches you the fundamentals of science and even the fundamentals of some experimental methods.",
                "no. bad professor, difficult learning environment",
                "Maybe, I feel that this class is good for someone on a specific STEM path but I would not recommend this for someone not focusing on a STEM major just because of the emphasis of certain knowledge in this class.",
                "no, I would not recommend because the class is very poorly organized by the professors and the biological concepts covered are not very interesting. also, the exams are way too long and difficult",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student because it is not organized to a level where the student can excel."
