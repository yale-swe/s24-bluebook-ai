                "The lectures in this course were very straightforward (course structure followed the textbook) and Professor Tang would walk-through plenty of examples. The exams, though proctored and timed, were usually fair. \r\n\r\nLab materials were shipped to us, which was very thoughtful. However, the first few labs were very hard to complete. I believe this was mostly a hardware problem since we were using some finnicky lab materials, but it did create a semester-long trend of the labs taking 2x longer because the kit wasn't cooperating.",
                "Strengths: Following the book closely was very helpful since I could reinforce things I didn't understand in class by reading the textbook. I also thought that a lot of the lab projects were very interesting, and especially with the later ones, I felt really excited about what I had built.\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures are very dry, and I feel like it could have been more interactive without cold calling on people.  There were also no scheduled office hours, and although the TFs were responsive and willing to meet, I think having regularly scheduled office hours is important for a STEM class.",
                "Strength - the lectures were well organized and systematic, with weekly psets. \r\n\r\nWeakness - unfortunately the labs are still hard, and debugging *hardware* via Zoom is frightening... could get quite stressful doing the lab within the three hours.",

                "I thought the pace of the course was pretty good. I think it would be great if the course had peer tutors like the other EE classes. There were some moments in the course when the material was a little daunting and it would have been nice to have a little more support when doing those sections.",
                "Lectures and exams were very fair. The textbook problems get a bit ridiculous bc questions aren't too well written sometimes, and lab through Zoom was pretty hard because the equipment quality was poor and it was hard for TAs to help. Otherwise a nice and well taught course."

                "Independent lab-kits were a double-edged sword. On one hand, I had all the time in the world to figure out the lab manual and really work through the assignment and questions, but it was extremely difficult for the TA's to help us troubleshoot a failing circuit or weird graph results. We would only be able to share our circuits with the Zoom camera and this severely limited the TA's ability to help.",
                "I liked having the live lecture as well as having it recorded because I could rewatch anything I needed to clarify.  I also thought that the labs worked fairly well despite the virtual format. Because of the pandemic, this is the first EE course I've had where the labs involved hands on components, and I think the labs really strengthened my circuit building skills.  One change I would make is to split the labs up instead of being 3 hours long because I always felt extremely drained and exhausted after sitting at my desk on Zoom for 3 hours.",
                "The idea of mailing the comprehensive kit out was great, and really beneficial to preserving the meat of a full engineering course despite the challenges of remote learning. \r\n\r\nThe only minor regret is I did not get to solder parts to the circuit board. I admit this is an entirely reasonable change to the lab, due to safety and fire concerns. (We received presoldered parts to work the labs on.)",

                "It was a very good online course. I thought the labs were excellent for a remote setting and very enjoyable. The first three labs were extremely time consuming however. I would say the first lab took about 7 hours to figure out."
