                "This class pushed me to read critically, think analytically, and present my ideas in a concise, thoughtful, and well-articulated manner. I gained a great appreciate for deep reading and careful reflection. I also furthered my passion for contemplation.",
                "I learned a lot about Henry Thoreau and read many of his well-known and lesser-known texts. We spent the most time discussing Walden, The Maine Woods, \"Civil Disobedience,\" and \"Walking\" but read a lot of his essays and various journal entries using political, environmental, scientific, and queer perspectives to discuss his works. The class had trips to the Beinecke as well as to Concord, Massachusetts to visit Walden Pond and the site of Thoreau's cabin.",
                "Understood not only Thoreau's life but the state of environmentalism and some American political thought around that time.",
                "I learned a lot about Thoreau obviously, but we also delved into the topics of environmental philosophy and justice, civil unrest, and a wide variety of other topics. Thoreau wrote about almost everything imaginable, and thus our class was a broad one.",
                "this class taught me a lot about how to perform a close reading as well as teaching me the value of reading many texts from the same author",
                "This course really improved my critical reading skills. I learned how to look a text with a sharper eye, and extract information and themes more readily. It also helped me grow as a writer, especially in writing literary critiques and commentaries.",
                "This course was a thorough education through Thoreau.",
                "I developed skills in close reading and interpreting complex literature.",
                "I learned very deeply about Henry Thoreaus life, writings, and ideologies. This course pushed me to become a better reader  a skill that I will definitely take with me for future classes. I also learned how to become a better writer through our three writing assignments and Professor Warners detailed feedback."

                "The strengths of this class are the discussions. A weakness of this class is that the essays don't seem to reflect the themes of the discussion. These essays appear to be the professor looking to judge your syntax and structure rather than consider the merits of your analytical position.",
                "Strengths: This course teaches a lot about Henry Thoreau and Transcendentalism, and has engaging discussions and field trips. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It could sometimes feel like a lot of reading. It could also be hard to criticize Thoreau or make original points during discussions.",
                "Maybe slightly less reading so we could talk about the reading more in depth -- but I also think it makes sense to read as much Thoreau as possible. Also, feedback on papers was the best i've ever gotten. He reads them extremely carefully and no bs eludes him.",
                "I really enjoyed this class",
                "there is A LOT of reading - sometimes too much to reasonably do",
                "This course is awesome. Thoreau is an incredibly interesting character, and if youre gonna spend a semester studying any single figure, hes a great choice. You will leave this course very well acquainted with Thoreau and his works, and also with an introduction to environmental literature and queer studies.",
                "Strengths: Teaching, thoroughness, seminar style\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some texts were much less interesting than others",
                "This is a strongly organized and engaging class. I have no complaints. The feed back from professor Warner on each paper, and his guidance of class discussions lends well to my growth as reader and the development of my writing.",
                "Strengths: The topical themes of this course (environmentalism, queerness, civil disobedience) were all incredibly relevant to our lives today. Studying Thoreau could help us better understand the current world.\r\nWeaknesses/improvements: The class environment was at times tough. Demographics skewed highly white, male, and private schooled, which sometimes made speaking up in a seminar intimidating or prohibitive for others. Also, I wish we had engaged in more practical discussion of the topics covered in Thoreau. Often, we spent time determining what Thoreau was saying without discussing relevant personal experiences or parallels to the present day."

                "Yes. This has been one of my favorite classes at Yale. Everyone should take this class if the opportunity presents itself. Terrific class for those who wish to examine their lives, purpose, and passions.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who was interested in Henry Thoreau, Emerson, Transcendentalism, or Environmental Studies. This course immediately dispels the \"man who lived alone in the woods\" stereotype and shows many different ways to read and understand Thoreau. However, this is also a course purely about Thoreau so not everyone may enjoy reading his work, as Thoreau often uses a lot of sarcasm and long analogies that can be hard to follow. This course is not easy in terms of essay grading, so a lot of editing and careful thought should go into writing.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Didn't have the usual first-year-seminar vibe of \"this class is just for fun.\" Prof is passionate about the material and a well-known Thoreau scholar.",
                "I would recommend it. While there was certainly a lot of reading, I thought most of it was interesting and productive. The class discussions were very enjoyable and I received clear feedback on my essays.",
                "yes, but i would make sure to read some thoreau prior to the course to make sure you enjoy his writing because its not for everyone",
                "Yes! Professor Warner is amazing. Hes smart and cares about his students. He also is about as knowledgeable about Thoreau as anyone in the world. Hearing his love for Thoreaus work and the emotion it evoked in him gave me a newfound appreciation for the power of literature. And I also emerged from this course struck by the beauty of Thoreaus language and philosophy.",
                "Yes, wonderful exploration of all things Thoreau and surrounding",
                "I would recommend this class to students interested in environmentalism, early American literature/transcendentalism, queer theory, or the history of political protest. This course provides a literary lens with which to view these topics, and the class can serve as a new challenge to examine them differently."
