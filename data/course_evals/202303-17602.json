                "This class helped me explore historical themes across a variety of times and places, while previous history classes I've taken have mostly focused on one geographical area. The global approach made me connect seemingly distant historical events with each other and think about them in new ways. The mapping and urban studies aspect was also new to me, so this class taught me how to think about social and historical developments in terms of physical space.",
                "Ability to read various historical analyses and discuss them coherently, writing about said historical papers and analyzing visual sources such as maps and photographs to deepen understanding of historical events. Utilize ArchGIS Maps to create a visually appealing and informative historical analysis paper with added visual sources.",
                "This class was a very interesting overview of different frameworks for understanding colonial urbanism, and a wide array of fascinating case studies."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The readings were well-selected and very interesting to read. professor Shepherd is great at facilitating discussion and bringing ideas together.\r\nWeaknesses: While I appreciated being able to sketch common themes around colonial cities around the world, because of its global focus and broad time range, the course felt very scattered and all over the place at times.",
                "The weekly readings and discussion posts gave the class a good pace, and they felt engaging and substantial without being an undoable amount of work. The readings tended to build off of each other, which was often a good thing, but it would have been interesting to read theories\/ways of writing history (not just primary sources) that disagreed with each other. I think that might give people more to question and discuss in class.",
                "The syllabus is very strong and each class has a similar expectation and rigor for discussion. There are clear connections between the readings, which allow for great class engagement. For the ArchGIS Mapping assignment, a faculty member who specialized in the software came to introduce the software, which was very helpful.\r\n\r\nCannot really think of weaknesses.",
                "Overall I really enjoyed the course, and Professor Shepherd is an excellent discussion facilitator and the syllabus is very interesting. In particular I appreciate that she divides up each class into discussion and some kind of other primary source\/research activity, which makes engagement with the class a lot more interesting. I'd say the main weakness was that because the class is organized thematically and throughout space and time rather than focusing on a specific history, it sometimes was more difficult to link discussion from one week to the next. This naturally came more easily as the class went on, but it might have been helpful if we were able to trace a couple of key case studies throughout the class for greater continuity, because otherwise we did jump around a lot."

                "I would recommend this course to students interested in colonialism, imperialism, and Orientalism in a global sense!",
                "Yes, I enjoyed the class a lot and I think Professor Shepherd is awesome. The course also gave me a lot of knowledge on theorists and intellectuals like Said and Foucault, which is helpful for pretty much any humanities course or political discussion.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in colonialism's impact on the world and are looking for some great readings. Prof Shepherd is a really organized professor and comes to class super engaged. I typically do not enjoy seminars (and prefer lectures) but our class had great discussions and was always prepared with the readings.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this or any other course with Professor Shepherd, who is a great teacher and really cultivates an engaged seminar environment. Also if you're interested in either urbanism or colonialism, taking this class will definitely expand your view on either subject."
