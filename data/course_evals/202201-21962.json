                "I learned how to critically analyze economic research papers relating to immigration. By considering different aspects of immigration, such as assimilation, intergenerational mobility, and labor market effects, I developed a better understanding of how current economic research and policy discussions build on the economic history of immigration.",
                "I learned about trends in economic history in four waves of immigration to the United States. I also reviewed econometric concepts and improved by ability to read and write about academic papers.",
                "Learned about the economics of immigration.",
                "Learned how to critically analyze economic papers, discuss papers for improvement in seminar/conference environment",
                "This course provided an economic and historical perspective on U.S. immigration. We explored immigrants in the context of politics (Know-Nothing Party, the right to vote, quotas/bans), society (assimilation, crime), and economics (impact on native wages/jobs, generational mobility, entrepreneurship). In addition to learning about the subject matter, we also learned the art/science of reading and critiquing empirical research papers.",
                "I learned so much in this course!! The main takeaway was just how to read and interpret economic research papers, and how to be able to decide for yourself what conclusions to draw from them. We went into depth into different aspects of economic immigration questions are of most interest in the literature, what the methods used are and how the conclusions in one paper lead to others. It was also cool to be able to then apply the questions we would ask about papers in class to our own prolonged research papers on a question of interest.",

                "Strengths: The weekly readings facilitated seminar discussion well, and Professor Lamoreaux did a great job of guiding students through the main empirical methods and takeaways. Deciding on a topic for the final paper at the beginning of the semester and working on the various steps for the literature review also allowed me to develop a better understanding of a current issue pertaining to immigration.\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "We had a very evenly distributed workload, and discussions about the papers were very interesting. I would like future classes to include more opportunities for the authors to come in to the classroom and present their work, as that was a very cool way to engage with the final paper we read!",
                "Nice professor, more human way of thinking about econ, course load not too bad, but a bit repetitive and not super engaging.",
                "Strengths: the structure. Engaging with a guiding/motivating question for the whole semester felt like a useful preview of writing a senior thesis. Participating in Sun Kyoung Lee's presentation of her working paper was also a very meaningful experience. \r\nWeaknesses: the class discussion. Generally good, but sometimes felt more like a lecture than a seminar.",
                "A strength is definitely that the papers are very interesting and it's a class where you can learn tons whether this is your first econ seminar or your last. It was conversational and the reading was manageable, since the class is just once a week. I think it could be improved by having more opportunities throughout the semester for students in the class to talk to each other about how their research is going, so that you can get some other thoughts on what you're finding earlier on.",
                "- It would be helpful to have one class going over statistical/econometric methods early in the semester.\r\n- It would be great to include papers covering more recent waves of immigration i.e post World War II.",
                "Great format, prof came ready to ask us questions, all working towards a goal in the end. Really enjoyed."
