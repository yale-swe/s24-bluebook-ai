I think I would have benefited from slightly more traditional teaching: I.e. prioritising a bit more the grammar, vocab etc.\r\n\r\nI think I was one of the only one who did not speak Spanish before taking the class, so it was really difficult when \"explanations\" of exercises, grammar etc. were in Portuguese rather than English - though talking to other students it seems that at least for the ones speaking Spanish this was less of a problem.",
