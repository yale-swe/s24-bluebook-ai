            "comments": [
                "This course was strong in that some TAs were good.\r\nThis course was weak in that lecture was uninteresting and unclear. It also did not cover anything near the scope of the problem sets; often, knowledge would be required on a problem set that wasn't included in any lecture. In addition, it wasn't clear from the problem set that this was the case, so you can't even go do a textbook reading to get caught up (because you wouldn't know what to read). Furthermore, the problem sets were way too challenging and required knowledge of analysis, which is not a prerequisite for this course. There were also many concepts assumed to be taught in S&DS 241, even though those topics were not included in the course.\r\nOne reason for this problem is that a TA wrote the problem sets, not the professor.",
                "Strengths: Interesting content and very good material.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes PSETs had select problems that were so difficult that hints were needed in order to feasible solve the problems alone (without ULA guidance).",
                "I thought that the PSETs really varied in difficulty. Some of the problems were super trivial and others were way too hard for an undergraduate. The lectures were often just straight from the textbook and it felt like there wasn't a clear plan for the course.",
                "Pace was on the slow side for a second course in probability.",
                "Worst class I've taken. There was absolutely zero direction for the course.",
                "Strengths: the material is important, and interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the difficulty of the Psets were wildly inconsistent. E.g., the 2nd problem set was so hard they needed to send out 2 sets of hint sheets that basically held our hand through solving the problems. Versus Problem set 3, which was a joke. I think this happened because the first 2 (especially the second) were so hard that people complained --> later ones became easier (especially 3). \r\n\r\nI heard that the first psets were extra hard b\/c the Prof wanted people to drop the course... if so, that is really disappointing in my view. You shouldn't make the work harder than what the course *should* be in the beginning to get people to drop. You should have a constant expectation of the level of difficulty of the problems, and let those who can handle that level take the course. Again, this is an unconfirmed rumor, but if true it is disappointing.\r\n\r\nImprovement: I think more practice problems for the exams would be warranted. Pset problems are often harder than those that appear on exams (since there is much more time to solve them) so it would be useful to have more examples to practice for tests.",
                "I do not know if I can name a strength. Weaknesses: The professor was unapproachable and occasionally unkind to students. He explicitly told us not to come to office hours to ask him for help on the homework, and he purposefully made homeworks insanely difficult to try to force students out of the class. Lectures were not engaging whatsoever. Course required a much, much higher level of prerequisite math knowledge than the syllabus implied. Homeworks were some of the most difficult assignments I have had at Yale-- unnecessarily so (honestly half the time the difficult part wasn't even the course content but just other insane math that we were expected to be able to do). Course staff tried to be helpful but I think it was hard for them too.",
                "goes over main stochastic processes, not very engaging and kind of slow",
                "Strengths: interesting material, good textbook.\r\nWeaknesses: one of the worst-taught stats\/math classes I've taken at Yale. Lectures were an exercise in handwriting squared: students copying lecturer copying the textbook, which he had open in front of him and literally transcribed onto the blackboard, somehow conveying even less intuition than one would get from just reading the textbook on its own. Instructor showed little ownership to the material, copying from the textbook made him seem unprepared, and he incentivized students to engage with him as little as possible outside of class, e.g. docked points if one requested a regrade of the midterm. Overall a letdown of a class, since material is super interesting and worth learning about. Bearable due to quality of textbook and TAs.",
                "Interesting content, potentially applicable for finance. Hand-written notes can be a little hard to decipher but lecture video is available too.",
                "Strengths: While the first couple homework assignments were unreasonably difficult, the teaching team eventually reached a more comfortable equilibrium for both homework and exams. The exam grading policy has been very generous, and topics are very clearly explained in lecture at a digestible pace. The TA's are very helpful in office hours. Weaknesses: The only weakness I found with this class was that the material was not that interesting to me, but that is an issue with me rather than with the class.",
                "there were proofs to results that we never applied in problem sets, so I don't think that was a very effective use of class time. Also having experience in proof-based math is almost necessary to fully engage in this course but the pre-req was not listed clearly.",
                "This course was very difficult this semester. The students in this course can from a variety of backgrounds ranging from sophomore prospective S&DS majors to graduate students. It seems that the course was catered to the highest level of students in the class, which seems to be a misalignment of priorities.",
                "Great material and instructor",
                "I felt that the pacing for this course was fantastic. The problem sets felt puzzle-y and fun. However, for many problems, you needed to know some trick to figure out the solution in a timely manner.",
                "The content in this class is really fun. Markov chains are sort of miraculous. Biggest weakness of the class were its psets. Half of them were fun and reasonably challenging, and the other half required ridiculous tricks and techniques from other classes that no one was able to figure out without just getting the answers from TAs. The TAs ended up publishing detailed \"homework hints\" for some of the psets, that ranged from \"try googling Catalan numbers\" to \"use this technique for solving recurrence relations\" to \"here's a detailed solution for doing this problem.\" So working on these homeworks probably took a few years off my life.",
                "Strengths: good subject material. Follows textbook closely \r\nWeaknesses: prof can come across as pretty mean sometimes. First two psets were ridiculously hard. Wouldve been a better learning experience with more practice problems rather than just a few psets and no other way to prep for exams \r\nLecturing style is def not the worst and is at times intuitive but at times suddenly becomes extremely confusing",
                "The lectures were not very engaging and the lack of resources to study for midterms and finals made it hard to know how to apply knowledge in class to problems on the exams.",
                "Strengths are Prof Karbasi, who is a clear professor who is good at explaining relatively complex topics.\r\nI do wish assignments were a larger component of the grade, or that we used data analysis directly as well (e.g. in R)",
                "Strengths: TAs and ULAs were super clutch\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Psets were inconsistent, professor didn't let us ask about them in his office hours, and just overall he was a jerk during the first half of the class.",
                "Strengths: The topics are really interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the problem sets test us on things we didn't fully cover in class. Lectures can also be a bit hard to follow.",
                "Always having an example for each concept is great. i hope more examples are included to help us understand the concepts",
                "It is very good",
                "The course covered a large variety of quite interesting topics and kept intellectually pushing me. I wish it covered even more topics.",
                "Strengths: Karbasi's lectures, flexibility in giving hints on really difficult assignment problems; Weaknesses: the class felt a bit disorganized - some problem sets were especially difficult and enough students had to come to office hours to complain before the teaching staff could later put out hints, so there was a bit of a disconnect in expectations. Regardless, I really appreciated the flexibility and their willingness to adjust expectations and assignment difficulty.",
                "The difficulty of the homework is really the biggest point to improve!!! Difficulty is okay, but it should be in the range of what teacher has covered and in our range of ability. Current homework is just waste of our times sometime.",
                "Strengths: very very interesting content that can be applied in all realms of S&DS, and is not really taught elsewhere, exams are structured to have 120 points but only the first 100 are counted toward the final score (e.g., if you get a 96\/120, it's actually a 96\/100, just as a 110\/120 is a 100\/100).\r\nWeaknesses: Amin Karbasi is a rather slow lecturer, the first two homework assignments were overbearingly difficult and could not be completed without TA help\/pedantic reading of book material not covered in class",
                "Better resources provided to students to succeed.",
                "Strengths - the class provides a great overview of the important concepts in stochastic processes. The lectures are well connected and the grading was quite lenient. I feel like a high percentage of the class received A's, but this is definitely because of Professor Karbasi.\r\n\r\nCons - the problem set difficulty was extremely high for the first few psets. They were so hard that the grad student TAs were struggling with them and everyone had to go to office hours for solutions. There also were not any practice tests prior to the exams.",
                "The course is relatively well taught and professor Karbasi seems passionate about the subject, but I wish the lecture recordings and recommended readings were posted earlier since they are usually posted a few days after the lecture. The G.S. book is also hard to follow for undergraduates since it assumes a lot of pure math knowledge and a lot of the proofs rely on earlier homework problems.",
                "I enjoyed this course. I would have liked if we could have moved a little faster. It would have been interesting if we could have covered continuous time processes. The class was also larger than I expected which perhaps slowed things down.",
                "I really enjoy the subject material covered in this class.\r\nHowever, I think the level of difficulty of the homeworks was not consistent with the lectures, which seemed to give more of a surface level overview of the topics. I would appreciate a course that goes more in depth into the theory side and better equips us with the tools to approach the homework problems.",
                "I think it should have had more topics. Some days I felt we were going slow and should speed up.",
                "The lecture materials are very closely related to the textbook so one can always check textbooks if there is anything they don't understand in class. But I feel that many theorems covered in class are too hard and not likely to be used or tested in the exam. I think it would be an improvement if more examples can be covered in class.",
                "The level of psets was very arbitrary and wouldve loved more consistency with difficulty and expectations. Lectures were good, and I felt like I learned something every time.",
                "Strengths: content (such as MCMC and random variable convergence)\r\nWeaknesses: I think it would be a huge plus if there were more examples of applications in class and if the problem sets were more consistent in difficulty",
                "The class drastically improved over the course of the semester, but that was partly because it started so terribly. Exam curves were generous."

We covered random walks, Poisson processes, branching processes, Markov chains, generating functions, Convergence of Random Variables, Martingales, and Renewal Processes. The difficulty of the problem sets however was too variable. Some of the problems were obscenely difficult (think contest math questions) and essentially required the answers office hours or working with a smart friend. The work was not too high but some questions\/concepts can be conceptually difficult. The exams can be challenging due to length and trickiness, but there is some slack since they had 120 points and 100 was the max score. Prof Karbasi essentially lectures off the textbooks so the textbook is the holy grail in this class.",
                "No. I think its a reasonable class to take for a stats major but Id encourage my friends in the major to take other courses first. I took it because I thought the material was important to statistics (which it is) but the disconnect between lecture and psets was simply too extreme sometimes. I survived it just fine but I did not enjoy it. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind the reviews youre seeing do not include those of the many who withdrew from the course, which was a substantial number. I also nearly quit the course when I went to the professors office hours at the beginning of the year and he refused to answer my question about the pset because according to him, if I couldnt do it myself I wasnt prepared for the course. I am pretty tough skinned but I found him shockingly unsympathetic and frankly hurtful.",

Professor Karbasi was a JERK not fit to teach any lecture class - he angrily shot down questions, refused to discuss psets during his office hours (that he made too hard! even the TAs agreed!), had a condescending lecture style, and worst of all publicly accused people too sick to take the midterm exam of faking. However, against all odds the second half of the course was completely drama-free and he sent us a nice note after the class was over thanking us for all our hard work. So I'm really not sure who the real Amin Karbasi is, and despite his being a really good lecturer, no class taught by first-half Amin Karbasi is worth taking. But 351 taught by second-half Amin Karbasi was just fine: the final exam was hard but graded leniently (120 points total but your raw score was graded out of 100) and the ridiculously hard but \"review and if you don't find it easy you should drop\" psets became a thing of the past. If you're a stats major, you should definitely take this class. But if it's with Karbasi, the variance of course quality is astronomical. Be warned of that.",
                "The course is pretty interesting, but be prepared to put the work in. This means reading the textbook over and over again until you understand the concepts. Unless you have really strong mathematical intuition, the course will be pretty difficult. I'd only recommend if you enjoyed probability theory and want to learn more about probability and random processes.",
                "Yes. Its a intellectually challenging course but it is very useful in many applications",
                "Yes! I took this class mainly because it sounded fun, and it was!",
                "Yes, as long as you have a strong command of probability theory - it's one of the more difficult stats classes based on our exam and p-set difficulty, but it may have been specific to this professor. The topics themselves, especially on Markov chains and random walks, were fascinating, and it is so worthwhile for anyone interested in probability to study. Otherwise, if you barely scraped by in 241 and are looking for an easy stats credit to BS, don't bother taking this class.",
                "Yes. The content is super interesting -- especially if you do research yourself on how all of these things are relevant (cf. galton processes and nuclear bombs) -- but be prepared to dislike how slow the class moves, and how stupidly difficult some of the assignments can be",
                "I took this course because I thought stochastic processes were interesting and they were, but they were also conceptually challenging. Professor Karbasi primarily goes through the textbook to teach the subject. \r\n\r\nWhile this is an interesting subject, Professor Karbasi is not a very accommodating professor: he enforces a no late policy for homeworks, didn't offer partial credit on the midterm (though he was more lenient with the grading for the final, offering partial credit), told us that this was a challenging course and we should just work harder when one student asked about advice to tackle the problem sets that seems to require \"sparks of intuition,\" (one of the first two psets had olympiad level questions on them and required 2 PDFs of additional hints to help us), I also had friends who dropped the class after the midterm after receiving an email about their lower performance (I see that this has good intentions to allow students to make educated decisions about their course schedules, but I believe that professors should connect students to the right resources prior to telling them to drop the course). \r\n\r\nIf you do plan on taking this course, I would advise reading the textbook (which gives more thorough explanations) and going to office hours (Zehao is an awesome TA who tries to help students to the best of their abilities).",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. While the concepts are challenging, the grading is lenient where you can focus more on the learning than the grade. The concepts are not super applicable to anything in the real world - it is more of an intellectual exercise.",
                "If you are interested in probability theory or machine learning, this class could be very useful and interesting, but be prepared for a challenge if you don't have a lot of experience with proof-based probability theory.",
                "Yes",
                "Not really, I think it is to brief to be a must take. I also think the course is set up in an adversarial way which I didn't enjoy.",
                "For math majors, I think this class could be a good choice for a not-so-difficult math credit. And this class would be helpful and interesting for people who have taken the basics of probability theory and knows a little bit about real analysis. There are many results in class that are very complex and involve very difficult proof, but I don't think they are likely to be tested so you don't need to be too stressed about it. And I think it is already interesting to study the basics of the Markov chain and martingale and see some of their applications. But I don't think you must take this class to learn stochastic processes, as there are a lot of textbooks that contain the materials taught in this class, so anyone interested can also read textbooks.",
                "Only if theyre committed to learning the material, as the course was quite challenging from week 1. The midterm was 1 to forget, and the 5 psets were highly varying in difficulty, but the class ended on a good note.",
                "I would not recommend it in its current state. I think it has the potential to be a great class if the problem sets were more consistently constructed to reflect and practice the material from class. As of now, the problems vary drastically in difficulty across the five problem sets we had, and it didn't feel like they really effectively reinforced our learning. I think it would also be cool to see more applications of the content in the lectures, rather than only proofs\/definitions. This semester, it feels like you need to spend a lot of time outside of class to get the most out of the content.",
                "I'd recommend it to someone only if the subject is really important to their research or career goals. Otherwise, you will be able to find more engaging and well-taught classes. Lectures are mostly reading from a textbook and don't do enough to establish the intuition for any of the concepts and the problem sets were occasionally absurd with topics that were never covered in class and could only be learned in office hours."
