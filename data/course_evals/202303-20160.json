The novels and films that we watched taught me a lot about France and francophone countries during certain time periods, such as Un Sac de Billes which took place during in France during the second world war. I was also exposed to literary French for the first time through our reading of La Symphonie Pastorale.",

                "This course taught me complex French grammar and gave me a better comprehension of diverse French culture. The short stories in La Diversit provided good snapshots of different aspects of francophone life around the globe. Grammar exercises for homework were also helpful in forming a base of grammatical knowledge.  I was also able to greatly improve my reading skills as we worked through a large amount of reading. I further enjoyed the opportunities to work on listening comprehension through diction exercises in class. Finally, the frequency of assessments also led to better retention of various vocabulary terms and phrases"

                "Strengths: I enjoyed the selection of texts and movies.\r\n\r\nWeakness: it was quite disorienting that the pages stated in the syllabus do not match the pages in the course pack. The instructor kindly gave us emails every now and then for what the correct page numbers are, but it would have been so much easier for me to follow this class if the department just updates the syllabus to match the current course pack. \r\n\r\nAlso, the recordings are not divided according to chapter divides of the novels. I understand that the department wants to equally distribute the amount of workload per class, but it is very disorienting for me. I would rather have one audio file for one chapter. I don't mind working more for one day and less for another day.",
                "I think this course like all of the French courses at Yale are very strong in terms of teaching proper French grammar. There are plenty of assignments and papers that help you to improve your French writing. While I enjoyed reading and discussing all of the different novels and films, I wish some of the texts were a little more recent.",
                "This class really helped improve my French skills over the course of a semester! I wish there were more speaking opportunities. The workload is of course very high, but this is understandable.",
                "I enjoy class time being used to go over the questions we have pertaining to grammar and vocabulary. I also liked the discussions we had about the books and films we studied. One weakness is that some of the books and films were quite old and some vocab and grammar lessons were also outdated.",
                "One strength of this course was the frequency of assignments spanning grammar skills and reading comprehension. The frequency of these assessments pushed me to better understand the concepts and readings introduced in class. I also think that the small size of the class was vital to facilitating learning. I was able to both contribute to class and learn from my peers. I also was able to receive detailed feedback on the grammar exercises that we had been completing. Professor Boumlik's individualized attention was a huge strength of the course. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course was that I felt there wasn't a huge emphasis on improving oral communication. While we conducted discussion exclusively in French, there weren't many specific activities that aided in improving pronunciation and increasing the complexity of sentences. Assignments related to oral production were limited to short responses on the four tests and the final presentation, which meant there wasn't much opportunity for explicit feedback on oral production throughout the term."

                "Yes, this course is very useful in order to develop your writing, reading, and speaking skills in French.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student with the understanding that it is an intense workload. Due to the daily meeting schedule and level of work, I do think that French 140 is a large time commitment but there is a great payoff if students engage with the material. If students are seeking better fluency in French, I think 140 does a good job preparing students for future classes at higher levels, particularly classes that have a high reading load."
