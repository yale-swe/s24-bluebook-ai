    "I further developed my Chinese grammar and speaking skills. I learned about issues facing China, ranging from language to democracy to environmental pollution.",
    "The focus of this course is formal Chinese. As such, the focus for us was on how to use formal words in place of informal words, and how to make our sentences more detailed (Ex.  instead of , and  instead of just ). I can truly say that I walked away from this course with greater knowledge of formal Chinese than I had before. I can also say that I walked away from this course with improved tones.",
    "Improvement in speaking skills and really interesting insight into some aspects of Chinese academic thought about topics like democracy and Chinese culture.",
    "I have strengthened my Chinese writing and reading skills.",
    "i think a big part of what makes this course ultimately rewarding is the realization that you have the knowledge and foundation necessary to start reading and digging deeper into relevant, real-world topics like economics, politics, and culture and that you have the skills to talk about and debate them, as well! zhang is a really great facilitator who helps to bring out (and sometimes drag out) opinions and arguments from students, and i think that no matter who you are, you'll find something in this course to be challenged by (and ultimately improve on)!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great emphasis on grammar and speaking. Could be more written-based.",
    "The strengths of this course include that Professor Zhang has successfully curated a set of incredibly interesting  texts for us to work with, that the vocabulary is all incredibly useful, and that there is free-form discussion. On the point about the vocabulary, I am currently in another course where Chinese and English are working languages. In that course, we had to review general Sinological source material, such as the  and the , or formal materials related to our field of study. This was made much easier thanks to the vocabulary that I learned in this course (CHNS 172). As such, while I had trepidation about choosing this course over some of the others at first, I would choose this one again in a heartbeat. This leads me to this course's greatest weakness. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness for this course is that it is poorly advertised. When I heard that the course is \"Chinese for Scholarly Conversation\", my mind wrongly associated the course with only literary Chinese. As such, I was at first hesitant to choose this course. Now, I know that the course helps with general academic level work regardless of if the person is in economics or literature. However, I fear that many potential students will be lost due to this misunderstanding. \r\n\r\nOn the debate point, the debates that we had in class were by far some of the most fun that I have ever had in a Chinese class. It required me to prepare very well before class, and it also forced me to make sure that I knew all of my vocabulary down-pat. An example of this is the model UN class which required massive preparation, but had an incredible payoff because it showed me that I can discuss an incredibly complex topic, in Chinese, for an hour and a half. I applaud professor Zhang for coming up with this assignment.",
    "Discussion in class is very guided, which I enjoyed, but I could see how it would be useful to to have more student-student dialogue as well. The textbook has a good selection of essays that discuss important and currently relevant topics at a challenging level. There is a big speaking focus which is apparent through assignments - mostly midterm presentations, debates, and weekly presentations, with just two essays. That said, I think it would have been helpful to have had a few more debate-like activities for more practice with impromptu speaking.",
    "This course is great for advanced Chinese learners!",
    "you definitely get to talk a lot about interesting topics that you might not have thought much about, and the readings are all real articles written in chinese, which makes it really rewarding..! i think one unavoidable part of classes like this which might turn people off from it is the nature of the student makeup you'll never really know how many people will take it, nor will you be sure whether they'll all be around the same level as you, so depending on the year it might swing heavily towards heritage\/non-heritage speakers, and you'll probably have a very different experience depending on your fellow peers."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Great workload, and really helps you get a sense of Chinese in the real world.",
    "Yes, I would inform them that regardless of their field, this course is useful to take. Moreover, as I am in a field that requires knowledge of Chinese, I will recommend this course to all non-Chinese (i.e. graduated with their bachelor's degree in China) as it will greatly help in all tangential coursework.",
    "Yes! You have a lot of really interesting discussions about democracy, international politics, and culture from a different perspective. I ended up learning a lot both through the texts we read and the research I did for projects like presentations and debates. The workload is pretty chill and tests are fair.",
    "Yes! Take this class if you want to further improve your Chinese skills.",
    "i'd recommend any student of chinese to take a higher-level course with  at some point! he's a wonderful lecturer and definitely knows how to have fun while teaching his life stories and personal hot takes on the sociopolitical readings are also always endlessly enjoyable... add the low workload to the mix, and you have a very chill 5th credit where you can practice your chinese in a laidback and casual environment."
