Their course content and even MCQ questions on the exams are biased towards showing that all forms of psychopathy can be treated or are worthy of being shown mercy in the criminal justice system. She did not focus on the link between mental illness and increased recidivism etc, and kept talking about her research which is aligned to a particular narrative.

The range of topics covered allowed me to learn about the issues that are at the core of the disparities in the criminal justice system. Learning about the various ways in which people with ASPD and psychopathy can be treated also inspired me to continue asking questions about how we can improve their deficits and judge them in a fair and more appropriate manner.",

Beyond the clinical aspects of psychopathy, I learned that science and the law do not complement each other because the law does not follow what psychological science tells us. There are certain interventions and treatment that work better than others, each for adults and children, and there are policies that could benefit from change to help these individuals instead of hurt them.",

In the context of criminal behavior this understanding was especially interesting. The main mental illnesses this class focused on were exteranalizing disorders (Conduct Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder) and Psychopathy, as well as some other related disorders. There was a good blend of both molecular neuroscience information as well as more psychological behavior-related information that was taught in regards to these disordered behaviors. By the end of the class, I feel like I was able to explain certain types of criminal behavior using scientific reasoning very well. This class also provided a strong connection of the science to the legal world as well at the end.

This course was less about serial killers and psychopaths but more about the conditions in the environment/law/brain that contribute to criminal activity. This is not to say I enjoyed it less because of this, but it was different to what I was expecting!",
                "I learned about various personality disorders and their diagnosis, characteristic neurobiology, and behaviors, as well as how a person's environment and the legal system interacted with these disorders. I learned about neuropsychology research.",

                "I learned a lot about psychology but also about our legal system and how people with mental disorders are treated within our criminal justice system. I think the format of the class was great where we had readings, weekly quizzes, essays, and exams to learn and to show what we know.",

                "I learned more about psychology in this single semester than I have ever learned in the course of my 20 years of existing. I learned how the brain works, why the brain works, and numerous other concepts regarding the mind.",
                "I learned about psychological disorders and how they are tied to crime.",
                "I learned a lot about criminal psychology and how it applies to current events."

            "comments": [
                "Very well organized and very interesting subject matter",
                "Maybe make major grades worth less of the class: make it more participation based or something by adding mandatory section and graded participation, like a STEM class.",
                "strengths: This course was very well organized with slides constantly updated, knowing exactly what to expect in quizzes and exams, and very fair grading. I was never confused or caught off guard by anything. I appreciate Professor Baskin-Sommers' style of teaching and the constant and immediate support on edstem. I think this class had the most reliable and swift responses to edstem questions, which made edstem a tool that I wanted to use and felt was incredibly helpful. I think that is a testament to how organized this class was.",
                "The timing of assignments seemed overwhelming and fast-paced at times. Three essays felt excessive.",
                "Strength: very clear lectures and instructions on how to do well in the class\r\n\r\nWeakness: three essays and two midterms can be a lot.",
                "Strengths: Very well organized, clear communication, easy to access materials online. I appreciated that slides were posted beforehand and recordings were available. Assignments were fair. Online help through Ed discussion and email was awesome and helped a lot with reviewing and editing work for exams and written assignments. Prof is really really good at answering conceptual questions, both when initially presenting information in lecture and responding to questions on Ed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: In general I don't like when professors assign their own work as readings, but in this case Prof pioneered this entire field of study and so her own writing and explanations of the content were superb.",
                "The professor. Her lectures were so engaging and fun. The weakness - too many essays? and the feedback to the essay was quite variable depending on which TA grades your essay.",
                "Strengths: clearly organized syllabus and lectures; opportunities for feedback; engaging lecture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: many assignments (some of which felt extraneous); lectures geared toward people who already had a fundamental understanding of neuroscience",
                "Strengths: there are a lot of resources provided for students, the material is really interesting, the course is set up for students to do well, the assignments are really interesting and make you think, the guest lecturers were really interesting to hear from\r\nWeaknesses: I think the exams could be improved, I like that they were quick and relatively low stress but I think having more free response or short answer questions would be nice and would help us apply our knowledge a little more, there is very little flexibility in an exam that is all multiple choice and is only 25 questions",
                "Strengths: I think the course is extremely well organize, Professor is accessible and there are multiple avenues to ask for help / get feedback. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, I struggled a lot with the wording on some quiz / exam questions.",
                "Answered above - course needs to be more neutral and show a diverse perspectives from clinical and criminal psychology literature instead of Professor Baskin-Sommers and her favorite counterparts. However, exams and assignments are well designed to test knowledge and understanding of what was taught.",
                "Lectures were engaging and class content really interesting",
                "Strengths: amazing readings, engaging lectures, very transparent grading and assignment process (so much TA support, many review sessions and office hours, Ed thread, opportunities for extra credit and points back, etc.)\r\nWeaknesses: none!! This class was fantastically organised.",
                "No weaknesses\r\n\r\nStrengths: Arielle is a FANTASTIC professor who will constantly keep you engaged, there was never a moment where I felt like I was not grasping the material. If you listen and go to lecture, youll be fine!",
                "i thought it was an extremely interesting course and learned so much from every lecture. i wish it was a bit less neurological and focused more on the psychological factors, but was interesting nonetheless",
                "Strength: the material was clearly organized and easy to follow; Dr. Baskin-Sommers' delivery is clear and concise; the slides are really informative and helpful for revision; the assignments were appropriate in enhancing my learning; Dr. Baskin-Sommers provides really patient and detailed feedback on ed discussion and other communication channels \r\n\r\nWeakness: While I liked the content of the assignments, the grading rubrics might be modified a little especially for the last essay so that students can focus more on the content they want to write about, instead of trying to pigeonhole their material into the various criteria.",
                "The course explains vital information about race and crime and how problematic the system is currently that are very important which is a strength. Also, this course brings depth to the psychology courses and major. There is also a great structure to the class and everything is easy to connect to each other. The exams were very well designed for better understanding.",
                "I really enjoyed the way she formatted the class!",
                "Very well organized and engaging. Very easy to learn and interesting topics!",
                "It was a PHENOMENAL CLASS.",
                "The topic was very interesting and Prof. Baskin-Sommers is super approachable and nice! Answers ed discussion and any questions very quickly\r\n\r\nI enjoyed lecture but sometimes it would get very into the science which I did not expect. It was often hard to stay engaged. I also did not realize that this case would more so be an overview on different disorders that lead to the criminal mind (this was the focus), it would have been good to learn about a few case studies or tie in the material we learn to an actual event/crime.",
                "Lecture slides are not great, nothing done to reinforce the concepts, teachers own political beliefs sprinkled in.",
                "Strengths of the course include very clear lectures, very engaging lectures, interesting material and readings, and fair grading. I don't think the course has any weaknesses.",
                "good",
                "Everything was wonderful and I learned so much! My only feedback would be to have more accessible office hours. I felt like some TAs at times gave me information that harmed rather than helped on the assignments.",
                "Such a well-organized and thoughtful course. By far the greatest strength, though, is prof Baskin-Sommers. I dont think there are any glaring weaknesses.",
                "taught soooo well. so organized and such a fair exam",
                "Good survey of everything, maybe some more interactive things in lectures when it comes to learning about the brain structures in particular, because that can be hard to visualize.",
                "I think there is honestly room for just more content. Lectures usually went for an hour instead of an hour 15 minutes, and the pace was very slow in my opinion. I wish there was more discussion about the frameworks of criminality itself and questioning this framework in the broadest societal sense. In other words, questioning the ways in which society expects us to conform, and the implications on the labelling of certain actions or personality types as \"criminal\" or designating psychopathology upon them.\r\n\r\nI also wish she'd included more of her own personal experience! It was very literature-heavy which is typical of a psychology course, but I have the sense she has a lot of more affective/subjective experience we could learn from.",
                "It is very easy to succeed in this course if you complete all of the work. Assignment expectations are clearly explained ahead of time and then the work is graded very fairly. Lecture is engaging, never runs overtime, and covers a lot of interesting content. The professors and TFs closely monitor the Ed Discussion so it is easy to get timely answers to any questions.",
                "Maybe, lectures at times could be a bit more engaging. Other than that, I have no feedback to offer! Great Class!",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe class was extremely organized, the professor worked incredibly hard to make sure students succeeded in the class, the content was extremely interesting, the workload was reasonable and relevant to the class.",
                "The professor is incredible.",
                "Strengths: The workload is not too high, and some of the topics are interesting. The professor is very active on Ed discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I really did not like the multiple choice quizzes or exams since they seem very nitpicky on wording and try to trick you.",
                "Lecturer is probably one of the best here at Yale. Professor Baskin-Sommers is very direct and honest, and presents facts, not opinions. She also is very engaging. \r\nWeaknesses - lots of assignments. 2 exams and 3 essays, which can feel like busy work but is important. Exams or essays are not too difficult.",
                "This class was honestly very fun. Lectures were engaging and the assignments supported learning of the information. It isnt the best course Ive taken, but I would certainly take it again.",
                "No weaknesses!! The class is great. I learned well in lecture and the weekly quizzes allow you to retain more info before the exams!",
                "The professor is such a strength. Professor Baskin-Sommers is such an incredible professor. She is interesting to listen to, engages with students, and truly is an expert in her field.",
                "Very interesting - I loved it!!",
                "I loved how fast grades and exam feedback was returned to the students. The professor did an amazing job listening to the student feedback and IMPLEMENTING it.",
                "the essays in this class made sure you understood the topic well. Test corrections were allowed so that you could make sure to understand any questions you missed on the exam.",
                "The exams were harder for me because the questions did not just ask about definitions but situations as well.  The essays were my strong suite.",
                "Strengths are that Professor Baskin-Sommers is awesome!! She was so engaging and taught so well. I felt like she wants us to do well and learn. We also got test corrections to learn from our mistakes. Not many weaknesses. This class was great. So interesting.",
                "Prof. Baskin-Sommers is the strength!",
                "This course was excellent. I especially found the lectures engaging, and overall course organization was superb.",
                "Loved lecture. The organization and material presented were great. I loved that she ended class early when we finished fast. Super clear teaching. Didnt love watching the graphic videos for so longwe got the point after 30 sec dont need 10 min",
                "Arielle is amazing! The course was very engaging and the guest lecturers were great!",
                "All strengths. Great class.",
                "It was very well developed to facilitate learning. Lectures were so engaging, we learned about fascinating and applicable topic with real world people coming in, we were tested in a way that helped us learn and was never punitive.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness was that the essay assignments felt like I wasnt learning as much since I was so concerned about following the rubric and instructions which were complicated.",
                "The course was very well organized, had many opportunities to get points back and interesting.",
                "I think this is a fantastic class and is super enlightening. Not only is it interesting learn about, but it is super fascinating especially going to school in New Haven.",
                "Course was extremely well thought out and administered. No need for improvement!",
                "The content was very interesting and engaging. However, I think the lecture size was too big for there to be high levels of engagement from everyone and it felt awkward answering or asking questions.",
                "strengths: lectures were easy to follow and were extremely engaging, workload was manageable, \r\nweaknesses: information didn't feel cohesive at times",
                "Dr. Baskin-Sommers was an extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic lecturer. She made each lecture very engaging. I can't really think of an obvious weaknesses.",
                "None. I absolutely ADORED this course",
                "very good",
                "Its very good that we are allowed to do corrections to get points back.",
                "Strengths were the weekly quizzes and clear content presented by the instructor.",
                "Amazing Professor!",
                "I loved this course. The coursework was very engaging and clear, and I really loved the way in which we were tested, in terms of the essays. I honestly would've loved to have some free response questions on the exams.",
                "strengths: covered both the science and the policy, engaging , relevant\r\nweaknesses: essay grading/feedback somewhat inconsistent based on TF so difficult to learn how to improve",
                "Strengths - fascinating content, excellent professor, good structure\r\nWeaknesses - felt like the content in the first part of the class was covered for a little too long before moving on",
                "I thought the professor was very helpful. She lectured clearly. Only weakness was it was too big of a class. It was hard to focus in such a big space with so many people",
                "Course is very well run with expectations from the professor begin very clear.",
                "The strength of the course is Dr. Baskin-Sommers. She is an incredibly bright individual with an incredible view on the world when it comes to psychopathic and antisocial behavior. The weakness is the size. I wish I could've got more personalized learning through this semester.",
                "Really quick feedback and the TFs and professor were always willing to help.",
                "This course was great! It was really engaging and one of my favorite classes I have ever taken. The grading was a little harsh, but you get 1/2 credit back on exams. As long as you go to lecture and put in effort, you should succeed.",
                "Strengths: super chill class, quizzes are easy, really really interesting, professor is great\r\nWeaknesses: the class being very relaxed can also be considered a weakness if youre looking for something challenging",
                "Very organized but lecture can be redundant",
                "All strength. No weakness.",
                "Strengths - After the first few weeks of class and once you get used to the neuroscience aspects of it the class topics get really interesting. Weaknesses - Grading is done very strictly, assignments and essays must be worded carefully or youll be docked off points",
                "Very structured class and clear feedback on writing. No weaknesses.",
                "Some of the more entertaining lectures I have been to and there is a healthy learning and testing environment",
                "Strengths: richness and depth to the research; Prof. Baskin-Sommers made sure to use replicated and reliable sources. AMAZING guest speakers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: too much emphasis on research and one specific type of \"criminality,\" aka antisocial/conduct disorder/psychopathy",
                "Professor BS has a very engaging lecture style, and it is easy to follow along with her words. I found the weekly quizzes effective in engaging my interest. \r\n\r\nThe essays were difficult because it was hard to understand the degree of detail the teachers were looking for. I wish that there were more sample essays posted online beforehand.",
                "Professor Baskin-Sommers is a treasure - one of the most responsive and kind individuals I have ever encountered, especially for a professor.",
                "I think that the content is very interesting, but I wish the lectures were more engaging. I also think the assignment grading did not make sense and was not clear in instructions.",
                "Well structured, interesting and engaging",
                "Professor Baskin-Sommers has her shit. She's super organized, kind with grading, and overall just cares about your learning. I think you'll learn a TON in this class without even trying too much, just because Prof is GOAT.",
                "Hands down the most organized and well-taught class I've taken at Yale! I LOVE this class and Prof. Baskin-Sommers! I'm such a fan of her!\r\n\r\nEverything is so organized. Prof and the TFs are always on top of everything (grade quickly, respond quickly, always available). The content is very interesting.",
                "This class had a lot of strengths like access to class recordings towards the time that big assignments were so. I wish there were more ways for us to engage and discuss the material in the way thats required of us in our essays before theyre actually due. Additionally, I really appreciated the chance to do test corrections because I did learn more while doing those.",
                "This course is very information packed but is taught is taught in a very organized way. I loved this course and the professor. Truly highly recommend to everyone.",
                "Very well organized and great professor who knows her stuff. Slides are easy to follow but often dont have all the information you need to understand the lecture - you need to hear the professor speak as well.",
                "Strengths: professor was a good lecturer, the class was VERY organized (this was so amazing I can't stress this enough- you always knew what you had to do and what to do to get a good grade), lectures were engaging, topics were interesting, Ed questions were answered speedily and had very good answers\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "I loved lectures.",
                "Lectures are amazing.",
                "The course has plenty of strengths: all course materials are highly structured, the contents are fascinating, all assignments have a high degree of clarity, PowerPoints are posted before class so you can take notes on them, and the teaching team always provides timely responses to questions posted in Ed discussion.",
                "I think this was one of the best courses Ive ever taken!",
                "n/a",
                "well structure to facilitate learning.",
                "Great classloved the set up no recommendations!",
                "I think this class has a helpful blend of poli sci and neuro  but I wish I had known how much policy would be included in the course. I went into it thinking that it would be more heavily neuro, and then felt confused with the syllabus. \r\nI wish there was more opportunity for creativity in essays 1 or 2 (theyre basically filling out a template)  but they did help me know the course material better!",
                "I thought the lectures were interesting, but could have been more engaging.",
                "I think a strength of the course was the clear layout of the powerpoint slides. I think a weakness of the course was the lack of recordings until the midterm. This made it difficult to review concepts that I struggled with in class.",
                "I thought everything was great. I think Professor Baskin-Sommers does a great job explaining in lecture as well as making the homework engaging but not overly stressful. It definitely helped me feel excited about the course throughout the semester.",
                "strengths: very well taught and organized by professor, timely feedback and very consistent deadlines and review sessions",
                "I really enjoyed the opportunity to improve on the exams! I learned a lot through this method, and all the assignments were helpful to strengthen my knowledge of the course material.",
                "This class was taught extremely well, I have no complaints. The professor was engaging, knowledgeable, and funny.",
                "Strengths: Professor Basker-Sommers is a great lecturer, passionate about what she teaches.\r\nWeaknesses: Low engagement in the class.",
                "i think perhaps this was my favorite/what i feel like was the best run lecture course i've taken yet in my time here!",
                "This course was one of the most engaging courses that I have been in! I always looked forward to attending lecture! I think there was a lot of disparity in the grading of assignments, where some students were very successful and some students were severely penalized. They didn't always seem evenly graded by TAs.",
                "Organization was impeccable. Downside was lectures could lack engagement",
                "The course moved very quickly and covered a lot of material. I think it would have helped to have a discussion section once a week with a TA and a session or two dedicated to learning strategies on how to answer exam questions.",
                "Lectures were sometimes confusing",
                "Amazinggggg class",
                "I think it was really well run. The only thing is the essay grading from some of the TAs seemed extremely harsh.",
                "Strengths: the content is fairly stimulating and professor baskin sommers is fantastic. She answers emails quickly and thoughtfully which is remarkable in a 500 person lecture. \r\nWeaknesses: its one of those classes that I wish was a seminar.",
                "interesting lectures, helpful professor",
                "I think the information in this course was very well organized and really interesting as a result of its connections with real-life incidents we see. I also enjoyed the special sections that discussed class topics in the context of current events. I think this course could be improved by incorporating some more molecular neuroscience information as it relates to the disorders that were discussed. Although this class is cross-listed as an NSCI course, there were only some molecular neuroscience concepts discussed and they were not explained in as much detail as was outlined in the research studies we read. I also think this class had too many assignments to keep track of and it ended up being a much higher workload than an elective-type class should be. It seems that there is no need for weekly quizzes, two exams, AND three essays. The last exam and final essay were due within a very short timeframe of each other. If just one essay was cut the workload would become much more manageable.",
                "Strengths: Extremely clearly outlined, Professor Baskin-Sommers is unbelievably responsive on EdDiscussion to hundreds of students oftentimes within minutes. She is also very knowledgeable. There is little ambiguity in grading and expectations; extremely crystal clear so you KNOW how to excel in this course. I still don't know how Prof BS manages to do everything she does. It baffles me, and I need to have a look at her GCal or do one of those Vogue 73 questions interviews with her. Many teaching staff in this course are excellent and pack a punch with their teaching. The evidence in the course material is also very good and interesting. There are some studies that are cited in the lectures that are really old and borderline unethical, but overall I really enjoyed learning about how the bridge between mind and behavior was linked through research methods in the course.\r\n(Big) Weaknesses: The course only briefly touches upon the name of the course itself. I believe it glares over individuals who commit crimes just to get by (steal to survive), and it is never emphasized save for two slides out of the hundreds of slides covered in the course total. This likely reflects a problem within the field of Psychology itself, where it places the onus, purposefully or not, on the individual in terms of the outcomes that arise from socially constructed problems, yet labels people as criminals. Maybe a better course name would be \"The Psychology of Criminal Behavior,\" but that wouldn't pack much of a punch, now would it? I am deeply dissatisfied with this lack of presentation of nuance about criminal behavior within the course, despite there being ample space for it. Professor BS said in a tiny way that there was \"no such thing as one criminal mind\" at the final lecture, and I think that should occupy more of the course. Overall, more nuance about research methods and the relationship between mind and behavior, particularly as it relates to there being NO single 'criminal mind'.",
                "Strengths: quizzes keep you on top of paying attention in class",
                "Strengths: Professor Baskin-Sommers!! She is easily the best professor I've had at Yale. She's a wonderful lecturer who explains concepts with complete clarity, and she's also very entertaining. The course was incredibly organized and interesting, especially in the second half of the semester. Lectures were amazingly structured, well-paced, and easy to follow. Assignments, exams, and essays were straight-forward and very fair. Very light and manageable workload. Overall an incredible course!\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we hadn't had both a final paper and final exam but it really wasn't too bad",
                "Strengths include the quizzes and poll everywhere. Both kept me engaged throughout the term. A weakness is the exams. I think they would be better with some long answer questions instead of just multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank.",
                "Strength: Very informative. Organized. \r\nWeakness: Very U.S. centric.",
                "The class is on pretty interesting content, so I really enjoyed learning more about the subject. Great class.",
                "Professor Baskin-Sommers is a fantastic lecturer and a very fair professor. I thought all of the assignments were really helpful in terms of cementing the concepts discussed and their implications in my mind.",
                "I really love the structure of grading and assignments and the course material, but I think it could be improved by making the lectures slightly more engaging.",
                "Very interesting content and amazing professor",
                "The professor was a huge strength of the course because she was amazing and involved with every single student if they wanted her to be. A weakness on my end was not utilizing office hours as much with the TFs.",
                "Course was centered around memorization more than actual understanding of the content covered. This was reflected through the multiple choice exams without any written content. I wish we did more things like the final essay which I felt was the only instance in which we were actually asked to apply what we had learned to the real world",
                "Weaknesses: can get a bit draggy\r\nStrengths: the course is very interesting",
                "The course is excellently taught. Prof Baskin Sommers is clear and direct with her instructions for every assignment. A critique I had is the exam format and lack of reliable internet in the exam room making it difficult to complete the exams. Additionally, I think the second essay didn't need as much of a guide as it had.",
                "This class is designed for you to succeed in every possible way. The syllabus is clear and tells you which readings will be on the exam or can be used in essays. The lectures are clear and the slides are posted beforehand, so you can focus on listening to the professor rather than copying everything down, and the lectures are recorded. There are review sessions for each exam, the questions are fair, and the grading is laid out clearly. There is a platform where students can submit questions that the professor and TAs monitor regularly. The weaknesses had to do with the other students. It's a huge class, so you can't engage as much, and it feels like many students don't pay much attention. It was sad sometimes to see that a large majority of the class didn't take the course seriously and missed out on a really amazing learning opportunity, especially since so many people wanted to take the class and couldn't.",
                "It was very interesting and facilitated learning, but grading was way too harsh for essays. I thoroughly enjoyed the course, but it proved to be a constant stress throughout the year because of the harsh grading, on things I felt were my best work. Sometimes it felt that points were taken away for no apparent reason.",
                "I think the strengths of the class are the format of the class, the professor and TAs were all awesome, and I think there was a lot of interesting information in the lectures while also keeping a large class engaged by adding videos and visuals.",
                "I thought it was a very good course. No suggestions for making it better.",
                "Strengths: great instructor \r\nWeaknesses: repetitive content",
                "This course is so great. Maybe more small group meetings would have been helpful!",
                "It was literally a perfect class! No improvements",
                "It was an awesome course! It was engaging and provided plenty of feedback to learn from.",
                "I liked the content of the course overall but I think it would be better if it centered Black and PoC voices more."

                "Yes!! It was one of my favorite classes i have ever taken. The prof was amazing and the class was so interesting. Really helped me understand more about the criminal brain",
                "Yup. Very interesting class, looked forward to it every Tuesday/Thursday.",
                "Yes, if they want to learn about criminal psychopathy.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Great as a special interest course for Neuro and psychology students.\r\nThe science content is accessible to STEM majors and easy enough to understand for those who are coming from more humanities majors.\r\n\r\nWould recommend going to lectures live, since verbal explanations of the content were much more thorough than online slides. in this case just reviewing online is not really enough to grasp content for the first time.",
                "Yes, it was great!",
                "This is a course that you must engage with on some level in order to learn/succeed, so if you are willing to do the readings, study for exams, and show up to lectures, you will gain a lot from it,",
                "I would recommend it, I think if you're a psychology major or have taken a lot of psychology classes in the past/worked in a lab some of the material may be a little repetitive but I think the content is extremely important and the class is super interesting and is designed in a way that helps you do well if you do the work so I would recommend",
                "Its not a gut! Super interesting class and definitely worth it but dont take it if you want a gut.",
                "No, because of the biased content and haphazard selection of papers to read",
                "Yes, super interesting class. Not too stressful. The way assignment and exams are done feels like it really does prioritise learning, not just testing. Guest lectures were super interesting too",
                "Yes!! It is fascinating and organised and a great class to take no matter your background.",
                "I definitely would. This is such a great course to gain exposure to law and psychobiology. Even if youre not a psychology or neuro major, I highly recommend. The workload is manageable and Prof Baskin-Sommers does an amazing job at being reasonable and fair in regards to grading.",
                "Yes--the course is definitely structured around student learning, but be prepared for a low bullshit tolerance compared to other yale classes. Take this class seriously. It's worth it.",
                "yes it was an extremely interesting topic to study",
                "Yes, for a non-psychology/cog sci major, this is a wonderful overview of the American legal system and what \"crime\" really suggests about a person, a community and a society; for a psych/cog sci major, Dr. Baskin-Sommers is an expert in the field and she will help you understand a lot of the technical nuances in the field, and her explanations are always clear and concise.",
                "Absolutely, I learned so much from this course and I loved how many aspects of so many different fields (psychology, neuroscience, law) were incorporated into the lectures.",
                "Absolutely I would recommend this course. The conversations and knowledge that this course encourages and introduces are very important for students at Yale to be aware of and to understand. In general, learning more about what is behind crime and not generalizing people as bad because of something they do is vital, and this class helps understand what goes behind an individual that may commit a crime. The workload is also bearable and facilitates student learning very well.",
                "Yes, it was super interesting and probably one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale!!",
                "Yes! Great class that is set up for student success",
                "YES as a psychology major myself, this class gave me academic motivation to pursue this study which can actually help change people's lives. Psychology and law is SO interesting. The professor is so inspirational.",
                "yes, if you want a more science based humanities/social science class",
                "No",
                "Yes absolutely. If you are interested in law or the criminal-legal system, this class will give you the scientific background to know what factors actually lead to crime and how they can be addressed.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, this class is very interesting and I found it fun to learn about Psychopaths and their brain functioning.",
                "YES!",
                "Absolutely yes! It was not only interesting and engaging (I actually loved doing the readings and going to lecture), but prof Baskin-Sommers did a great job centering the content on real-world issues.",
                "YES!!! Actually my FAVORITE class. Professor is so wonderful and SO engaging! Even though there are 400+ students she still would put a note on my essays when I improved.",
                "Yes! Its a great course, anyone can take it and confidently learn the material I think. Its not too inaccesible even if youre not a psych major, but it still covers a lot.",
                "YES! It is super important information that is also very interesting. But it's our civil duty to understand this content. Our society is only as strong as the weakest links, in this case being the prison system.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in psychology. It is relatively easy to do well, but as a non-psychology major, I became a little less interested in the course by the end of the semester.",
                "Yes!!!! AWESOME Professor, great TFs, and the content is super cool! Pretty chill class as well, so if you need a fifth credit or something, look no further!",
                "Absolutely. One of my favorite classes at yale.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to anyone, regardless of their major or current interests, as I think there are important humanitarian skills that are to be derived from this course.",
                "As a NSCI major, I thought there would be a bit more emphasis on the neuroscience aspect of the criminal mind, but there were a lot of lectures on the social issues of incarcerating these individuals, policing, and environment that I didn't necessarily expect. I think that the class is interesting, but it also seems to focus a lot on the professor's own research rather than concepts that can be applied more broadly.",
                "Absolutely. Whether you are interested in psychology or not, you will learn lots.",
                "Yes! You learn so much and it opens your understanding to criminology. Although I personally didnt agree with the conclusions that were applied to Rea life situations, it was fascinating",
                "Absolutely. To the student who is just interested in the topicdefinitely. To the humanities student (AFAM, political science, etc.)it will relate to a lot of policy initiative and laws that are currently ineffective. Its great to think about the research and evidence behind the efficacy.",
                "Yes!! Lectures are very engaging.",
                "YES!! Best class at Yale so so interesting and professor Sommers is amazing!",

                "Yes! Its really interesting and accessible to all students.",
                "YES, this was an amazing course that every Yale student should take.",

                "YES.",
                "Yes! Absolutely must take",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes!! Really interesting, especially if you like neuroscience. If you dont like neuro, maybe reconsider.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Arielle makes her content very digestible. The real life case studies are fascinating.",
                "Yes, must take course with Baskin-Sommers.",
                "yes!!",
                "YesProfessor Baskin-Sommers is such an inspiring and engaging teacher. Also you learn about how to apply pysch and neuroscience to the real world in an important and impactful way.",
                "Yea, the course is very approachable for all students and very interesting.",
                "Yes I would. I think it is a fantastic way of making you think about the causes of crime and environmental factors which contribute.",
                "Absolutely! The material is fascinating, and you really get out of it what you put in.",
                "yes. It offers insight into important topics and Prof Baskin-sommers is amazing.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in psychology",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because the lectures were very interesting and you learn a considerable amount.",
                "Yes, but make sure to go to lectures.",
                "Yes ABSOLUTELY. PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE. You will learn so much.",
                "Prof is sooo nice",
                "Yes absolutely",
                "Yes, if you are interested in learning more about the criminal mind.",
                "Yes!",
                "100%, the professor is amazing and you can tell that she cares about having her students actually understand the content. She is fair and very understanding.",
                "Yes, I think it's a great course to learn about law-related and psychopathology concepts.",
                "yes, especially if they are interested in pursuing law or psychology this course is an important intersection of the two fields",
                "Yes, but not if you have already taken a few psych/neuro courses.",
                "Yes! Walked away from this class seeing the world differently!",
                "Yes! It was fascinating, both academically and good to know practically. Well organized and great professor.",
                "Yes, this was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It was one of the first psychology courses I've taken at Yale and Professor Baskin-Sommers provided a lot of support for students.",
                "Yes. Definitely material everyone should learn to gain some perspective",
                "Absolutely!",
                "I would recommend this course. It is an insightful course that make you question what you think you know about crime.",
                "Yes, this is not a gut so you should expect to put in the work but you will learn a lot!",
                "Yes",
                "YES!! If you can take this course, take it! I took it credit/d/fail because I already had a full schedule, but the assignments are fun to complete and were a super nice break from my regular stem-filled classes.",
                "yes! super interesting and workload is very manageable. awesome professor who cares about her students success and is very knowledgeable",
                "YES!! If you need a chill class, are interested in antisocial personality disorders, and/or want to learn a little bit about crime in the US, this class is a really fun and light addition. The quizzes are super easy and take like less than five minutes and the essays are from a template. The exams are not bad either as Professor Baskin-Sommers gives out study guides that are really helpful to study with a week or so before the exams",
                "Yes! Professor Baskin-Sommers is an excellent lecturer and very accessible. She put a ton of work into her class and it really shows in the content and lecture quality.",
                "Yes because I do believe it was really interesting and fun but again, this is not necessarily an easy class assignments are graded very tediously and sometimes that can be very discouraging and make engagement with the learning difficult.",
                "Absolutely recommend this class for psyc or non-psyc majors. Prof Baskin-Sommers is a fantastic lecturer and designed the course very well to cover a wide range of topics. Grading is clear and upfront, the rubric is easy to follow for each assignment, and workload is very manageable.",
                "I would recommend this to someone who likes psychology and is interested in seeing where it can be applied",
                "If your main interest is neuroscientific research on the workings of antisocial/psychopathic individuals' executive function, reward systems, and fear processing... go for it! This class is all about the minutia when it comes to understanding the research. But if you're interested in studying criminality more broadly, mass incarceration, juvenile advocacy, and social factors related to crime, this class is NOT for you. I recommend courses in the sociology, ER&M, or public health majors. We had some wonderful guest speakers come in to lecture that touched on these topics, but it was almost strange and awkward to then pivot to understanding one economic/attention task for the next four lectures. The research side of the class tended to be incredibly repetitive and hard to apply to real-world issues. I get that the essay assignments tried to make a research-to-real-world-connection, but they were hardly discussed in class. I think more time could have been dedicated to understanding current events around mass shootings or criminology (aka applying the research in-class), rather than creating optional discussion groups, which is what happened throughout the semester. Though the class title seems to cast a wide net (\"The Criminal Mind\" sounds like it would encompass of many types of crime), Prof. Baskin-Sommers is very clear about what she does/doesn't cover in the course. A better title would be \"Neuroscience of Psychopathy and Antisociality\"",
                "Yes, I think it is manageable, interesting, and unconventional. You will likely not find this kind of information in other places, and Prof. BS often presents her own research, which is really exciting to hear from the person who did the studies.",
                "Yes - fantastic course.",
                "Yes, I would, it was very interesting!",
                "Highly recommend, great course and professor",
                "Yes, do take this class if you're interested in legal justice system and factors that specifically cause crime. The content in general is super eye-opening and interesting. It's a bit more sciency than you might expect, which is a nice!",
                "ABSOLUTELY! If you're reading this right now, this is your sign to take this class! Best class ever with the most sincere, kind, and brilliant professor!",
                "Absolutely",
                "I recommend this course to everyone who is interested in psychology and law.",
                "Yes, if you need a social science gut and are interested in psychology.",
                "Yes!!! You learn so much without feeling immense amount of stress the entire semester. Professor Baskin-Sommers is amazing: she is organized and a good lecturer. The topics we covered were very interesting and I was always engaged in lecture. Every rubric was structured so you knew exactly what you needed to do to get a good grade. This is an amazing class.",
                "Yes, this was an eye-opening course.",
                "Yes. It's interesting and if you put in the work you'll do well.",
                "Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone interested in criminal psychology or curious about why some people would commit crimes chronically. It debunks some common misconceptions about \"psychopaths\" and helps you understand the motivation and neuropsychological mechanisms underlying antisocial behavior.",
                "Yes! Very well structured, very clear course!",
                "Yes, if they're interested in psychology",
                "yeah it was a very interesting course and I learned a lot",
                "Yes! A great psychology/neuroscience class to take!",
                "Yes!",
                "I think this course gives an interesting overview of the criminal justice system/policy/certain parts of the brain that are relevant to the content. I wasnt as blown away as I thought I would be -- but I enjoyed it, and would recommend.",
                "Yes. It's an interesting psychology class on an important subject.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course as it is well taught and has a lot of fascinating information that was great to learn about.",
                "I would highly recommend this course, especially for anyone interested in law or human rights of any kind. I found the semester very enjoyable.",
                "yes, but only if you really enjoy psychology and neuroscience, especially in regards to criminal justice system. i personally tried to take this as a gut, which in a way, it was through just less frequent work, but i found it more difficult to study for because there was so much content i was personally unfamiliar with prior to taking this course",
                "Yes! The professor is the best!",
                "Yes absolutely! It has been my favorite class at Yale so far. Such a great class that teaches fascinating material.",
                "Yes, but not if you are looking for a very in-depth psychology course.",
                "absolutely, everyone at yale has something to learn from and some way to grow from taking this course",
                "Yes! Such an interesting class, and it will automatically grab someone's interest. I think almost everyone would enjoy the class because of the subject and the way that it is taught.",
                "Yes absolutely if you are interested in psychology",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. However, I would warn them that if they think it is a gut, they should reconsider because it is not.",
                "Yes it was cool but not what I was anticipating",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes I think it was very interesting and information I would have never known.",
                "I would definitely recommend it! Make sure to follow the rubrics on the essays though or else it can end up being a stressful class.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in neuroscience, psychology, or criminal law. If you are not a STEM major, this class may be a little more difficult since it is very science heavy and the essays require a very different way of thinking from what would be used for essays in other humanities or social science classes. Otherwise the content is very interesting and the difficulty is relatively mangeable if you stay on top of your work. There are also a lot of opportunities for extra credit or points back on exams.",
                "Yes, absolutely. The course is exciting and thought stimulating.",
                "yes",
                "100% yes!!! This was one of the best (if not the #1 best) course I've taken at Yale. The lectures were interesting, the content and the way it was presented was incredibly clear and engaging, and the workload was very low and manageable. TFs were insanely quick to hand out grades after the essays and exams (our final was graded within hours of taking it!) The studies from the readings were covered in detail during lecture, and if you just showed up to class and paid attention, it was easy to do well. And also, most importantly, the course is super fascinating! I feel like I learned way more in this course than almost any other Yale course, and it never felt like too much content to digest. It's a course I've very excitedly talked about with friends and family, and it's information I'm going to remember years from now. This course is honestly worth taking solely to have the opportunity to hear Professor Baskin-Sommers give lectures. She is an amazing, engaging, organized, cool, and funny lecturer and professor who cares A TON about the work she does inside and outside the classroom. The course is extraordinarily well-taught and fun, with an extraordinary professor to top it off!",
                "Yes. This class has very interesting content, and the guest lectures every so often were very fun to learn from.",
                "Yes! Especially if you are interested in criminal justice and psychopathy/psychological disorders related to criminal behavior.",
                "Yes, definitely. The course material was very interesting.",
                "Sure! Make sure you have a friend to motivate you to actually go, since it is easy to get by without attending lecture. Listening to Professor Baskin-Sommers talk about the key concepts of the class is a unique chance to hear from an expert in the field explaining content that is rarely looked at elsewhere, so I think it is more than worth it.",
                "Yes I would Professor Baskin was super engaging in lecture and you learn so much in one semester. She provided so many extra reading materials to go to if you wanted more.",
                "Absolutely. The subject by itself is incredibly fascinating and having Professor Baskin-Sommers as the lecturer only makes the course more enjoyable. The optional discussion sections accompanying the lectures also offered a great way to see how the topics we were discussing in class were used by psychologists in real-world scenarios.",
                "Yes! It was an amazing class. I really loved Professor Baskin-Sommers, and as a neuroscience major, the material brought a lot of what I study to real world applications and connected to social issues I am very interested in.",
                "100%",
                "Absolutely. This was one of my favorite classes at Yale with one of my favorite professors. It's the type of class where you are learning without even realizing you are learning. And the topics that we discuss are so important and actually have an impact on people in the world. 10/10 recommend.",
                "No. Topic sounds interesting but didnt feel like we really went that in depth, just a surface level dive into various different potential factors that seem intuitive anyway.",
                "I would, the content is interesting and the professor is very good at giving interesting lectures.",
                "Yes, it was very interesting.",
                "Absolutely. Prof Baskin Sommers is an eloquent, knowledgeable professor with an ability to engage with her students. I learned so much during this course and find myself better to explain some of the fundamental aspects of crime, mental health, and their neurological and environmental underpinnings.",
                "Yes, if you are going to engage with the content. This class changed how I perceive personality disorders and the fairness of the criminal legal system, and led me to be more attentive to how systems interact with each other and with the individual. If you engage with the material fully, it will make you think critically and consider your opinions on the state of psychology as a discipline, the criminal legal system, and what justice really means.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to other students. I think it is taught really well and there is a lot of information that makes you think about people with mental disorders differently than you would if you did not take the class.",
                "Yes, I loved this class and thought it was the most interesting course I have taken at Yale.",
                "Yes, it is very interesting and unique",
                "YES YES YES. I would definitely recommend this course. It has something for everyone no matter the major.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student!",
                "Yes absolutely the content is so interesting and the prof really makes you feel engaged.",
                "Yes - this is a great course for anyone interested in psychology or criminal justice.  The workload is very low."
