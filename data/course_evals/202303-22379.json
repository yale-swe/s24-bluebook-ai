                "Skills: knowledge of waka/saibara poetry, Japanese canonical literature, the novel's development; writing literary analysis in a more stylistically free form",
                "I read the Tale of Genji in depth and wrote several papers about the book. I learned core ideas in Japanese literature and how they are portrayed in the Tale of Genji.",
                "Read through The Tale of Genji, Japanese literary practices",
                "The most impactful thing I learned from this course is the nuances of the Japanese language and the effects that isolation can have on the complexities of the words and script. This course was filled with teaching the double, triple, and even quadruple meanings that even a single sentence can have, and analyzing the various tropes present in poems taught me how court life was almost like an entirely separate language than that of peasants, which contributed to their inability to rise in status. I also found the unique combination of both buddhist and shinto beliefs to be a fascinating mixture of religions where neither dominated the other. Finally I found that the gender dynamic between men and women was very extreme during the time period and its honestly baffling when comparing it to equality today.",
                "I learned a lot about japanese literature even though I haven't studied spanish. I think the themes in the Tale of Genji are super universal and it's a book that is open to interpretation. I think this class helped me appreciate poetry more as the book contains a large number of them.",
                "I gained a better understanding of how to write an effective essay. I had trouble staying on topic when writing essays, but this course and James's feedback helped me come up with strategies. I also improved my reading comprehension because I had to read a lot for this course, and because I read all the time, I was able to read much faster than I used to (I was a slow reader)."

            "comments": [
                "STRENGTHS: The professor is excellent. I would take any course taught by Scanlon-Canegata. This course is great if you want to do what the syllabus lays out, which is to really thoroughly read one super-long text and learn about Heian Japan and its literature. WEAKNESSES: It's hard to buy the edition of the text in the syllabus. The syllabus and assignments could have been organized more clearly.",
                "This course had a heavy writing component, and offered a chance to explore the book in depth.",
                "Professor Scanlon-Canegata is great. The class is organized and the discussion follows the class material closely.",
                "I believe that this course did a great job going over the story as well as how real world events and culture influenced its creation. I enjoyed the historical background in Japanese text, language, waka, plays, modern day interpretations, and Chinese influence. One thing I believe could have improved this course is having the opportunity to view an ancient Japanese text or piece of art from one of Yale's museums or libraries.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting material, knowledgeable prof, improving literature analysis skills\r\nWeaknesses: Not a weakness of the course itself but the book is veryyyy long as a fair warning",
                "The strength of this course is the fact that we are able to read one book for the entire semester. Another strength is the fact that the discussions are engaging because the class is mixed with grads, freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors.  The weakness of this course is how difficult it was to find a copy of the book."

                "YES! As long as you're interested in the book and willing to commit to reading the whole thing (and some secondary sources as well). The course isn't doable if you don't do at least ~70% of the readings. Soon-to-be-Dr Canegata is a gem. Very enjoyable topic, great in-class discussions, lots of freedom (but also support if you need it) for papers and discussion posts.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in Japanese literature.",
                "Definitely. The class is fun and you can learn a lot if you are willing to put in the effort. Professor Scanlon-Canegata is very knowledgeable in east asian literature.",
                "Yes. I had little experience and insight into east asian culture, and this class gave me a fascinating historical overview of Japan. The religious concepts and gender dynamics from the Heian period can be seen today, and it has helped put into context why these social dynamics and norms can often be jarringly different from the US. I really enjoyed our class discussions as well as reading the discussions posts of other students, and enjoyed the freedom of being able to choose my own personal essay topics.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in old Japanese literature, as it is a quintessential text and the course is formatted to be very engaging. That said, I didnt love the book, so, theres that.",
                "Yes!!!! It's very interesting even for people who aren't into Japanese literature/know Japanese. You can still relate to love, life, loss, guilt, regret, desire, etc... the book has everything.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it's a well-rounded class, it's medium-paced, the professor is really passionate about the work, the conversations are engaging, and the workload isn't bad once you're able to get into a flow."
