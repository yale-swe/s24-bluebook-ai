                "I liked that the reading responses were videos or articles and made what we were learning relevant",
                "A strength of this course was the lecture style. It was very engaging and the professor was very passionate and interesting. Her slides were also quite detailed but could be a little more thorough sometimes when most of the content of the slide was pictures and not any bullet point takeaways. A main takeaway slide at the end would also be beneficial. The course was also well designed and assignments were interesting and manageable.",
                "This class was fantastic!! I was really engaged with every lecture, every reading, and the textbook assignments outside of class. If you're at all interested in clinical psychology and/or mental health, you'll love the content of this course!",
                "Very fun",
                "Strengths: The short readings and ted talks for the reading responses were very engaging and interesting and completely doable. Good to have guest lectures. I appreciated the videos shown in class that demonstrated the effects of the disorders because they were very informative. Engaging final essay and it was helpful we were given a structure to follow. \r\nWeaknesses: The lectures would be split between a couple days and in some days we would start a new lecture and topic 10 minutes from the end of class. This was pretty disorienting.",
                "It is well-organized and exams were fair. I additionally liked the homework in this class which included engaging with outside literature to better develop lecture concepts. The course felt very boring at times. Lectures felt repetitive, and studying the content felt more so like cramming information than understanding concepts.",
                "I like the weekly essays for this course, as well as how we learn about the different mental illnesses. However, I think this course is extremely removed from the actual problems of people with mental illness; that is to say, the textbook and the class seem to me to contribute to the stigma of people with mental illnesses by creating a wall between \"us\" and \"them\" and insisting that the two categories are mutually exclusive.",
                "I appreciated that it was recorded, I watched the recorded lecture every Wednesday. This meant that actual lecture attendance was not great. \r\nThe readings and reading responses were fair and built well on lecture topics. I appreciated that they were only due once per week.\r\n\r\nExams were fair and TAs were helpful in review sessions but the format for asking questions was not good. Maybe Ed discussion would help for students to get answers to their questions more quickly.",
                "Strengths: It was an awesome class- the lectures were very interesting and Professor Joormann was great. I also liked how the reading responses and paper contributed to our understanding about psychology and weren't just busy work. The exams were fair and focused on what was taught in class.\r\nWeaknesses: I wasn't sure what we were expected to know from the guest lecturers because some of them went very in depth on things, so I didn't know what to study for the exams. I also would have the paper due before Thanksgiving break instead of after because there was really no way to complete it without doing it during the break.",
                "A strength of the class was how comprehensive each lecture was.",
                "Strengths: lectures are very clear and direct. Not a lot of work is needed to understand a lot of content. Exams are fair although not perfect. \r\nWeaknesses: not the most exciting but that's not always a bad thing.",
                "The two halves of this course were very uneven, as the second half focused on many more disorders than the first half. That being said, it was definitely better to make the second half of the course more intense than the first, but the two halves should be more even.",
                "I really enjoyed the content of this course. The professor is a strength to the course as she is evidently passionate, and the TFs were very kind and helpful. As far as weaknesses, it is an entry-level course so very accessible, and at times, the content can feel a bit elementary. But, there is a broad overview they must cover, so as long as you know what to expect, you can invest more passion in intrinsically motivated learning.",
                "I enjoyed how the lectures were organized. I think more practice tests/guides on how to prepare for tests could be helpful.",
                "lectures could be a little more engaging but overall great topics covered",
                "This course is taught horribly. There should be more assignments to facilitate learning and retention of the material. A large focus should not be placed on the exams. Additionally have more TAs and ones who are more willing to help",
                "Strengths: very comprehensive \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-Assignments are not very engaging \r\n-You only get taught what is already in the DSM-5",
                "Strengths: easy to follow lectures, low-stress environment. Weakness: perhaps clearer expectations on midterm exam; I was not sure at all what to expect ahead of time.",
                "Strengths: very interesting material and very clear lectures, the TFs and Professor Joorman are really great, the lectures are interesting as are the readings, the writing assignments were helpful in applying the knowledge learned in lecture and the professor was generally pretty responsive to feedback on the course\r\nWeaknesses: the class can be a little stressful given that the vast majority of your grade is based on two exams, however, they're graded very fairly and are a good representation of what is discussed in lecture",
                "More student engagements, some lectures felt long and dry.",
                "The lectures are incredibly informative, and the textbook as the only additional homework is very helpful to supplement learning. The midterm and final as 40% respectively of the grade is challenging given the multiple smaller writing assignments only amount to about 20% of the total, but grading for the exams was relatively generous.",
                "Strengths- very organized. Weaknesses- it would be better to have more feedback on reading responses.",
                "It was great. No improvements.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Loved the organization of the lectures and slides, I appreciate slides with the content laid out consistently\r\n- Assessments and grade breakdown were very fair\r\n- Prof Joormann was obviously very knowledgeable on the topic, and you can tell she cared especially when she allowed a live Q&A during class\r\n- I loved the PollEv questions during lecture, I wish those continued past the first few weeks\r\n- The TF's comments on weekly essays\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Narrow view of some disorders by way of the photos used to present them. For example, using a photo of a single pea on a dinner plate as the title slide for eating disorders is not actually that accurate and instead perpetuates harmful stereotypes surrounding eating disorders and spreads false ideas about EDs. I would be really careful when using photos to portray mental disorders, as Prof Joormann explained in class mental disorders are very complex and don't fit neatly into a box. Using a photo, no matter how well-meaning or surface-level (just looking for graphic design, I'm sure), is like skating on thin ice since these disorders can be really personal to students in the class. \r\n- Almost every single class we ran out of time for the content and things got super rushed toward the end. \r\n- Midterm exam wasn't distributed with the feedback unless you requested a meeting to view yours. Research shows how important feedback is to real learning.\r\n- While I understand that it can be bad to group people as \"normal\" and \"abnormal,\" I think our class discussion went too far by explaining that because mental disorders are so widespread, they're actually \"normal.\" Yes, it is true that mental disorders are widespread, but I don't think we should ever accept this as a good thing or something that should become our new \"normal.\" Instead, we should recognize the problem and try to figure out the root so we can get rid of itnot normalize it. That does a disservice to the many people who suffer from mental disorders.",
                "The class was great! The workload is very fair and pretty light on a weekly basis- just a lot of studying for midterm and final but if you put in the effort you will do well.",
                "The course gave a great overview of many different disorders, but could have expanded more on the pros and cons of the DSM-5",
                "It was great",
                "very interesting course",
                "Good weekly assignments, good prep for exams.",
                "Strengths: Professor stops and answers questions, interactive polls, video clips and film are played during lecture, recorded lecture. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the midterm & final combined being worth 80% of the final grade. i think that the final paper should be worth more.",
                "Weakness is that there is really no way to get around having to memorize many things but you do gain a lot of knowledge",
                "Strengths: the content is super interesting! Plus there is no section, so students can be fully engaged in biweekly class without getting sick of the material. Great feedback from the TFs on assignments. TFs very available to meet and provide help on assignments. \r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of.",
                "I thought it was a good and organized course.",
                "Strengths: teacher, interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of material and terms (which is the nature of the course)",
                "Strengths: low workload, review sessions for exam were helpful\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were sometimes not as engaging",
                "Weekly reading responses kept me in check and motivated me to keep up with the material, but the class still felt pretty fast-paced.",
                "This class was overall well organized and well taught. The workload was manageable, and the content was interesting and engaging.",
                "Weakness was the extent of the memorization as it became tedious, but the data and the things we learned about were very interesting.",
                "I enjoyed the lectures and found them easy to follow/understand! I think the class could have benefitted from a slightly more intersectional approach to mental health, but I appreciated the efforts that the professors and the TAs made to incorporate diverse perspectives and ideas into the supplemental materials (like the weekly reading responses).",
                "Cool course with easy exams and relatively low workload. The TA may screw you on the final paper though depending on who you have, but Prof. Joorman will grade it fairly if you bring it up.",
                "No weaknesses!  There is a lot of information packed into this course but it's super helpful for someone who wants to genuinely engage with the topic.",
                "This course was engaging and well-organized which helped facilitate student learning. I liked how the lecture topics began with background and historical information before delving into psychological disorders. The consistent structure of each psychological disorder lecture, covering symptoms, DSM criteria, etiology, and treatment, was particularly helpful. This approach helped us better understand the disorders, compare different conditions, and ensured a consistent grasp of essential information throughout the course",
                "The mid-term exam was much harder than the final despite carrying the same weight. The exams i think should have less weight on the grade. lectures were a bit long. Content was interesting and recorded lectures helped with my revision.",
                "Class isn't very engaging, but workload was pretty light. I like that questions with low pass rates are not included when calculating test grades. Lectures are broadcasted as they happen, so you can tune into lecture from home (or watch them at a later time).",
                "The strength of this course is that you learn about a lot of disorders with a pretty decent degree of detail. The weakness is the exams. They were often poorly written, and points were taken off for not justifiable reason, and when pushed on it, there was not flexibility. Thus, this course could be strongly improved if more time was spent ensuring the exams were well written with less avoidable ambiguity.",
                "I think there should be more clarification on the types of questions that will be included in the exam. Some questions were clearly meant to trick you which made it harder to answer the questions correctly.",
                "Lectures were quite long and content-heavy and was not always clear what we should focus on. Interesting and important content."

                "Depends. I took it to fulfill a social science distributional. It is not a heavy workload, but I did not enjoy the course much. If you are looking for a more engaging course, look elsewhere. If you are looking to take an easier course that throws a lot of facts regarding mental disorders at you, I would take it.",
                "Yes, mostly for Psychology majors or those interested in medicine etc. Might be sort of a weird course if you are far removed from the subject though it is relatively low workload and straightforward assessments.",
                "Yes, I would because it gives you a great understanding and perspective on psychological disorders which is useful no matter what you're majoring in. Also, you don't need any background in psychology to do well because the lectures explain lots of psychological concepts clearly and well.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The content was interesting and relevant, and Professor Joormann is an extremely engaging lecturer.",
                "Yes, I think understanding mental illness is key to understanding mental health, which is applicable to everybody. The material was very interesting and taught clearly. A great class for those who want to take psychology but find Intro Psych too boring. It's also somewhat useful if you're studying for the MCAT although taking Intro Psych is probably more efficient.",
                "Yes! I loved this course. It is engaging but also manageable",
                "I would! It's a great course to take as 5th course load. It feels important in this day and age to be understanding of mental disorders and decrease the stigma. I really do feel like I'm walking away with applicable content that is important to know.",
                "Yes, it is extremely interesting.",
                "the topics are very interesting",
                "No. The material was interesting however it is not structured well.",
                "Yes, I would greatly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about the pathology of mental disorders, especially for pre-meds that do not want to take intro psyc. Prof. Joormann is very kind and she is very passionate about this topic. Additionally, I found the lectures interesting and the class to be enjoyable rather than stressful.",
                "I would definitely recommend, it's a good intro to psychology subjects if you're not a psych major and a really good elective to take if you are a psych major . The workload in general is pretty low from week to week and the content is very interesting.",
                "Yea, very good introduction to clinical psychology",
                "Absolutely. For anyone interested in clinical psychology or psychology more broadly, this class employs you with the major diagnostic criteria for many DSM disorders. Professor Joormann also provided great context for the development of these diagnoses, as well as the dimensionality within each type and models of etiology.",
                "Yes- if they want to learn more about mental illnesses.",
                "Really interesting",
                "Yes! Great, straightforward class. What you see on the syllabus is exactly what you're going to get. Learned a ton! Really helpful knowledge no matter what field you're going into, since these disorders are unfortunately very widespread.",
                "Yes! It is fascinating, does not cause too much stress, and the prof is awesome!",
                "Yes, it was an interesting overview and very accessible for any level of psychology knowledge.",
                "Yes I would",
                "Yes - great class",
                "Yes!!!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend",
                "Yes. Interesting and challenging.",
                "Yes, but only if you're willing to thoroughly study the content for the midterm and final exam (given that it is worth 80% of the final grade). It was an engaging course with short clip examples, a movie, and available slides to encourage active learning. The workload is relatively light with reading responses to interesting Ted Talks or NYT articles and a paper based on a movie. Lectures are recorded for convenience, but if you know yourself well enough and know you won't watch them - I wouldn't recommend this course since I do not think you can grasp the depth of the content with only what is presented on the lecture slides (her explanations are very good & useful).",
                "I would as long as you are willing to put in the work and learn about the disorders. The exams are kind of long but what I found mattered the most in this course in terms of personal progress was understanding those different disorders",
                "Yes! If you have any interest in clinical psychology then definitely take this course. I had no experience with psychology at all prior to this class and I'm so glad I took it. It wasn't too difficult, only a midterm, a paper, and a final (not cumulative). It's extremely manageable and also really engaging.",
                "I would recommend, I hadn't taken any kind of intro psych course before but I still found this interesting, engaging, and approachable.",
                "Yes. Fascinating course, with very little work outside reviewing for exams.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning more about clinical disorders.",
                "It is not a low workload class if that's the reason you want to take this class. There is a lot of information thrown at you, and you are expected to remember everything that is mentioned in lecture (even stuff that wasn't discussed in detail).",
                "Yes I would recommend this class to students of any major. If you are a STEM major looking for a relatively easy AND interesting social science credit, definitely take this! The content is fascinating and there is great supplemental material like readings and videos that aid your understanding of the lectures. There were also multiple guest lectures that were interesting to hear from.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning about how mental health is currently categorized and treated.",
                "Yes!! Absolutely interesting and relevant material.",
                "I would recommend this course to any person with a genuine interest in learning about clinical psychology. This class definitely isn't for a person who's looking for a gut. I loved this course as a psych student with an interest in clinical psychology.",
                "Yes, this course provides an excellent introduction to clinical psychology, effectively explaining the symptoms, etiology, and treatment of different psychological disorders.",
                "Yes, the content was interesting and the workload was manageable.",
                "Yes, wonderful class!",
                "This is a good class to fulfill your social science distribution requirement if you are good at taking tests. If you are not good at taking tests, this class might not be for you since grades make up 80% of your total grade.",
                "If you are interested in psychological disorders, yes. If not, maybe. You learn a lot and it is certainly interesting, but the most interesting things are learned when you go deeper than the required readings and lectures. Thus, if you are into psychology and disorders, and are willing to find yourself digging deeper or applying what you learn in the world, then yes, take this course.",
                "Yes if theyre interested in pursuing clinical psychology or just interested in the topic."
