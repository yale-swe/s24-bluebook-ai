I also greatly appreciated how Mme Cadieu encouraged us to bring in our own expertise from our majors to better analyze this subject throughout this semester."

Strengths include a great selection of texts, a manageable workload, an encouraging classroom environment, and the professor's expertise on the subject. The only weakness I can think of is that occasionally the connections between specific parts of the text and their meaning felt like a bit of a stretch, which made it harder to participate during those discussions.",

                "This course has a variety of texts, many of which were created quite recently. This provided the class with very diverse examples of social mobility which we got to compare throughout the course. The assignments of the course were also very engaging, as the first essay was more creative and the second more traditional. I also appreciated the opportunity to present an expos on one of the texts, as I feel that this pushed me to improve my speaking in French."

                "Yes! This is the best class I've taken at Yale. If you speak French well, are looking for a literature class, and are interested in social mobility journeys, you will very much enjoy this class. It was the only class I've ever taken where I actively wanted to do all the readings. Prof Cadieu is amazing; she's an expert on this subject matter and the perfect discussion leader in class. I cannot recommend this class enough. I was so sad when it ended. Please take it!",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who enjoys more modern francophone literature and film. This course has a lot of auto-fiction in it, so it often concerns real-life struggles associated with social mobility. I think this course is especially interesting for students studying social sciences, as it is then possible to discuss social mobility and migration from a variety of viewpoints. It is a great course that I definitely recommend!"
