                "This course covered classic texts from Homer through Dante. I had never been exposed to these forms of writing (i.e. epic poetry) before, so it was a little uncomfortable reading them at first. After taking this course I feel I am much more capable of approaching texts of all styles and from all eras. We also discussed the major themes that span these texts. Now we know the starting place for some of the fundamental themes in literature write large.",
                "I learned how to navigate dense literary texts and balance big-picture thematic thinking with close reading.",
                "I developed a far better understanding of the trends and themes present in the early part of the Western canon. Professor Purdy Moudarres was excellent at weaving together threads of common humanity throughout the texts that we read, making them all seem relevant and linked to each other, thus helping the class understand the developement of literature from the Iliad to the Divine Comedy. I also learnt how to do close literary analysis and deploy this concisely and well in support of a thesis in my essays.",
                "I learned how to analyze texts, write essays, and collaborate with a focused class!",
                "By taking this course, I developed my close reading skills as well as my ability to recognize overarching themes and connections between authors carefully embedded in each text. Tracking how classical authors built upon each other's work was one of the highlights of this course.",
                "I learned how to write a college paper while exploring brilliant works of literature from Homer to Dante. I not only feel that I've grown as a writer and thinker, but I've an even deeper love for the humanities as bearers of the human spirit.",
                "Understanding of some of the most formative literature of the western canon, as well as a better knowledge of humanity's opinions of itself.",

            "comments": [
                "This course has a fantastic reading list and that makes it a great course. I was fortunate to have a great instructor and great section mates so my experience was especially challenging and enjoyable. My only suggestion would be alotting more time to Sappho. Giving Homer four weeks and Sappho one day is borderline insulting, and I love Homer.",
                "Strengths: my section was very free-wheeling and engaged. Class was lively and challenging. Lectures added insights to the text rather than just reiterating them. Weaknesses: Some authors--Sappho, Dante, Ovid--did not get a fair share of class time.",
                "The readings are fantastic and interesting, while not being as difficult to keep up with as the other DS classes. The only real weakness is the pace - I would really want more than just one day to go over things like Sappho's poetry or Paul's Letter to the Romans.",
                "Strengths: So many! From the teaching style to the discussions to the classmates to the reading material, everything was wonderful!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing with the specific class itself but with perhaps the syllabus in general. The Dante weeks felt a little ridiculous as I felt like it was the most ambitious reading weeks and as a result, the weeks I felt like I understood the least. I am wondering how that can change to be perhaps less jam packed (but alas, the DS gods are above anyone's power).",
                "The breadth of this course is its greatest strength as well as its greatest weakness. I could not have asked for a better introduction to the classic works of Western literature, and Christiana's insights made a challenging curriculum easier to approach and more meaningful to digest. While at times DS can feel  rushed (especially with Ovid and Dante!), I look forward to continuing my engagement with these texts in the future.",
                "The best course I have ever taken at Yale thus far.",
                "This course certainly offered a wonderful in-depth look at some foundational pieces of literature and the seminar format was highly conducive to learning about the texts on a more nuanced level. The lectures were equally illuminating and highly engaging. I think one weakness of the course was simply the number of texts we coveredsome, like Sappho, or Dante, could have merited more discussion time than was given as a consequence of the pacing of the course.",
                "Strength: breadth\r\nWeakness: depth\r\nNo real way to fix it.",
                "This course felt very fast, and it would have been nice to have more days to spend on each text. At the same time, the lectures, readings, and class discussions were all very interesting. Seeing the progression of different themes over the span of so many texts that stretched across so many centuries was very rewarding."

I feel as though I have not only read many fantastic literary achievements but have a better understanding of who I am and what it means to be human. The scope of this class is infinite, yet it manages to take you deep into every issue you discuss, even if some of the texts are shortchanged time",
                "I recommend DS Literature to anyone interested in getting a survey of the most important western works of literature. This class may not be for you if you are interested in diving really deep into language and minutia because we move really fast and mostly focus on overarching themes.",
                "Yes! Great professors, fascinating lectures, and a fantastically interesting introduction to western literature that shines a light on the development of the West for the past 3,000 years.",
                "Absolutely! I have never been in such a collaborative and kind environment to learn! This was the perfect introduction to a college-level seminar class. I feel like I have learned a lot!",
                "This course is among the first I would recommend to another student; philosophy, theology, historical context, political context/theory, psychology, and (of course) literature were all wrapped into one in this course in a free-flowing, comprehensible way.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The material is fascinating, and it's designed in such a compact way so as to bright to light the connections between the works. Christiana teaches the course so well (Dante at the end is such a joy).",
                "Dr. Purdy-Moudarres is the most kind, brilliant pedagogue I have ever met. This class is a must.",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely!! This was by far my favorite course this semester. By reading these texts in the course I was able to see how the texts built on and reacted to each other in a way that I wouldn't have understood if I'd just read the books on my own."
