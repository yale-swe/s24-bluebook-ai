    "A good intoduction to University-level academic writing",
    "This course expanded my skills in three key domains: writing, critical thinking, and examining societal implications. On the writing front, this course truly developed my writing skills - unlike many other courses I took in middle and high school, which taught me simple rhetorical or organizational strategies or (at worst) basic spelling and grammar, this class truly taught me how to write an argumentative paper that could take a nuanced view of a topic that's rather superficial at the surface (video games), synthesizing evidence from both scholars and popular sources. This course taught me how to analyze everything from narrative structures within video games, to video games' role in society, to even my own life (in the form of a memoir). On the critical thinking front, this course taught me how to consider other perspectives when developing my own viewpoints, and how perspectives can influence the views of everyone whose works I read - from scholars to authors to journalists. Even something as simple as the date a source was published can have a huge impact on what the source's author's perspective is. Finally, I learned a great deal about the societal implications of, well, everything. Before this course, I never would've imagined the impact video games can have on the people and societies they portray and interact with (other than the obvious example of the violent video games controversy), but now, seeing how important something as...well...fictional as a video game can be so important in real life, I am implored to look for the societal implications in more than just the typical domains (i.e. politics, economics). I can't recommend this course enough if you want to become a better thinker, and the video game theme makes it quite an enjoyable class.",
    "I learned how to write a research paper and to read scholarly articles.",
    "Academic papers on video games. Super cool.",
    "Improved my writing skills which will be very helpful for me in future courses, learned how to write a proper research paper include proper citations and using relevant sources, and learned how to analyze texts in a more elaborate manner and extract more information from them and use this information to build strong arguments that raise questions not previously considered in the article etc",
    "I learned a lot about video games from a variety of different facets including the technical, cultural, and social scope of video games. It was super interesting and I enjoyed it a lot!",
    "My writing and critical skills improved a lot.",
    "I learned how to craft academic papers. I learned to brainstorm and the writing process as a whole. I feel more comfortable on what is expected in this academic environment. I learned how to do effective research and how to find a lot of enjoyment in writing. This class sparked a lot of joy for my writing.",
    "I was able to develop my writing skills in this class through writing 3 papers throughout the semester. In addition, I developed my critical thinking and active reading skills through the class's reading materials, and in the seminar I developed my ability to hold good and productive discussions.",
    "By taking this course, I developed the ability to see the effects of videogames on our community and also to look at games and see how our culture is reflected in them. I also improved on my college-essay writing skill level, learning more about academic research papers."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class discussions were always enjoyable, the assignments were interesting, and the readings were generally thought-provoking, although there were a few that I didn't enjoy whatsoever.",
    "This course is outstanding for developing critical thinking and writing skills, and the discussions in class truly developed my synthesis and analysis skills. This course allows you to learn all about societal implications while becoming a better, more organized writer who can make better arguments in the process. The only weaknesses\/improvements I can think of are the following: One, the readings can sometimes get a bit lengthy, which makes it difficult to discuss everything you read the next day in class - often the first person to speak sets the stage for the entire class because that student decides what part of the reading the class should focus on. Perhaps slightly shorter readings would foster more comprehensive conversations. Two, I think the class would be better, if possible, as a MWF class. I know TTh makes more sense for our prof because of his commute - and believe me, the reason this class is so good is because of the prof so that takes priority here - but I felt like some students had zoned out by the end of class because some people just can't focus for an hour and 15 minutes. For a seminar that relies on discussion, it'd be nice to have every student engaged for the entirety of the class. Aside from that, great class!",
    "I think it would have been more engaging to read and write about a little fiction, but this class has you read a lot of scholarly writing\/etc nonfiction, which I didnt really like. The seminar style is a good way to have good conversations, though, if you keep up with readings!",
    "Strengths: learned how to write different types of papers like analysis, research, and memoir.",
    "I think Dr. McGregor is an amazing instructor so one of the main strengths was the depth of discussion. I think it could be improved however by introducing more debate into the picture.",
    "The readings and discussions were very interesting.",
    "The strengths of this course is the subject matter which was extremely interesting. The discussion was very powerful because of it and kept the class very engaged. We found insight in subject matter that is not usually critiqued in that manner, and it allowed a lot of connections to be made outside of the material into real world problems. The other strengths of this course was the professor and the papers that were assigned that were a lot of fun. The weaknesses of this course was the readings that were assigned because the topics we were talking about became repetitive. This limited discussion on occasion.",
    "The strengths of this class are that the professor is very involved with each and every student, and he dedicates a lot of time and effort in making sure that all the students are understanding the readings and involved in the discussion. On the other hand, sometimes discussions in the seminar feel like they are lackluster or stagnant.",
    "Strengths: A wide arrange of articles are brought to the table that introduces the many different ways videogames can be analyzed and understood. This class is a definite choice for people who want to be exposed to the importance of video games. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  Because the range of topics was extremely broad and video games, in general, are so multifaceted, the direction in the class sometimes felt all over the place, which made it even harder to write the final research paper at the end of the class. For example, we would talk about the difficulty in video games in one class and then talk about dystopian blackness in another, and then about disability in another, and then tackle more philosophical questions like \"are video games a form of art?\""

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this topic of 114 in particular was engaging and fun to delve into.",
    "Absolutely, without a doubt, 100%. If you want to learn how to think, write, and be a better global (and digital) citizen who knows his\/her society and can recognize all the different perspectives and backgrounds people come from within it, then you should take this course.",
    "If you feel like you have a decent grasp on writing, I think you genuinely dont need to take this class. It felt very high school writing-esque. It was an easy writing credit, though, if youre looking for that!",
    "Yes. Very fun discussions about video games. Learned a lot about video game culture and why it is relevant.",
    "Definitely.  It was a fun course but also intensive and engaging.",
    "Yes! It's rare that you get to examine these types of \"fun\" subjects at such debt. This is a great opportunity to do exactly that.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes I would if they liked video games or wanted to learn more about video games. The discussions that we have are very broad on occasion and allow people who are not comfortable with video games to join in. The class allows people to view video games as literature and film and shows that the form of media is rising in the industry. IT was extremely interesting and was my favorite class of the semester.",
    "I would, but only if that student is adamant about taking an ENGL 114 class. In that case, I would suggest this class to that student, because I know that the professor is good and the class is (usually) engaging. However, I wouldn't recommend this class to a student who isn't interested in ENGL 114.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in learning more about video games. This class did more to spark interest in that than allow me tom improve my writing skill, however."
