                "Very online, given that it's essentially an individual data analysis project. While this meant that it was not the most engaging class, it also made it very easy to complete on my own time and was not that much work per week.",
                "Strengths are def exposing students to a new subject. I've never done code or coding in a biological context so it was something new. Weaknesses are i wish our zoom lectures had been recorded to look back on.",
                "This course required a lot of independent learning (most of the course was done through an online datacamp program) and then data analysis for the final was almost entirely based on that, a vignette we had to read on our own, and possibly work with partners. To be fair, I think this is a good way to learn coding since 'in the real world' this is how we will have to learn, and it allowed us to be semi-independent thinkers. It was annoying that we had to do two separate write-ups of a similar topic (one in the first half term class and one for this one), but it went alright.",
                "I learned a lot that will be useful for my lab research outside of this class! I also liked how I learned how to code for research purposes! It is a much needed skill. However, I felt like I didn't really understand anything in the lectures that well until it came to working on the final report! That is likely the weakness of the course. All the work was backloaded to finals season for the final report since there was minimal work before then. However, it takes a long time to code and then write up the report, which is in total 70% of the grade.",
                "This course was a wonderful opportunity to learn new skills that can be applied in my future research endeavors and contribute to an ongoing project.  The topic was incredibly fascinating and the course was extremely well-organized!",
                "Even though the course offered a unique opportunity to students to get exposed to the field of RNA sequencing and transcriptomics, it lacked organization, directionality, and clarity. The entire course came down to the final project which was much more complicated and hard to complete than expected based on the weeks leading up to it. The material that was taught in lecture and through DataCamp helped to an extent in working towards the final project, but in many ways was unclear in relating concepts from the course to its application in the analysis the project required. Talking with other students in the class, a consensus seemed to be that a lot of us felt underprepared and lost when it came to working on the final project, as the directionality and contextualization of the work we had to do was lacking. We learned a lot of different concepts throughout the semester, but it was hard to see how the gaps we filled with words in DataCamp or the unrelated exercises we completed on the cluster could have prepared us for the extent of  analysis that the final project required. With the assignment for the final project and details on it being posted close to the last week of class, it took me more than 70 hours to work on the analysis on the writing of the proposal. If this work would have been spread out over the course of the semester, and if we could have gotten guidance on understanding what each part of the analysis we had to do was for, the project could have been so much more enjoyable. As I was performing the analysis, it was clear to me that if there was less of a time crunch and if I had a deeper understanding of what I was doing I would have loved every moment of it. This class offers a unique opportunity to teach something so so useful and needed in biological science, but does so in a way that will push students away from this type of work. Moreover, I truly would have hoped that the TAs were more present in the course, as their help would have been valuable."

                "Yes!  Any student who is intimidated by learning how to program and process sequencing data should take this course.  The concepts were conveyed in a clear and concise manner, which made them so much easier to grasp.  I learned a lot!",
                "I would say that this course offers a very cool opportunity to get exposed to RNA sequencing analysis, a skill that not many courses teach at Yale, but that is very useful within science. The course requires you to not fall behind and to stay on top of things, and so if you are ready to be consistent, and to do a lot of learning for yourself then take the course, as the skills you will be exposed to are super useful. The course was not well organized when I took, but I really hope that changes, as the professors that teach seem genuinely  passionate about both teaching students and teaching the material itself."
