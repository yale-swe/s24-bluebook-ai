                "PROF IS GREAT! Learned so much!",
                "Prof is really intentional about making the seminar a productive and welcoming discussion space. Really interesting ethnographies though sometimes the theory readings were a little opaque to me. I think in general the quality of the readings varied week to week.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gross-Wyrtzen is absolutely a strength of this course. Her energy, intelligence, and sense of humor had me excited to come to class every week. I also think a strength is that the assignments are really flexible, so you can tailor your reading responses and your final project to topics that you really care about and that interest you.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would say the biggest weakness of this course was how the readings were structured. Most weeks had multiple readings that were often quite dense and fulled with complicated theoretical concepts, but we read them together because each week was dedicated to a specific infrastructure (roads, electricity, etc.). I don't think this strategy worked too well, as I often found myself overwhelmed by the different approaches we were juggling each week. In other anthro classes I've taken, I've found that ones that focus on just one single, longer ethnographic work each week usually work really well. There's definitely a time and a place for comparative analysis, but I think that in this class I found the range of readings we had to handle and talk about each week a bit overwhelming.",
                "Genuinely couldn't be improved. Strengths: Great professor, great readings, great classmates (might be dependent on who takes it, but in general I think this class attracts an interesting bunch)",
                "Strengths: The course was very manageable work-wise and gave great opportunity to learn from our peers and think critically without feeling the pressure of articulating everything perfectly. Having the peer-taught class structure was really nice and allowed us to get closer as a class and put everyone on an even playing field. It was also really nice to have a partner and get closet with the as we prepared for leading the class. I learned a lot and the vibes were just great. Weaknesses: 750-1000 word discussion posts were a bit long but it honestly wasn't a huge deal. Would've loved a whole class session to work through our final project ideas and made us start thinking about them a bit earlier in the semester or maybe between the proposal and the presentations.",
                "I really enjoyed the focus of the course, and really enjoyed discussing how we see the politics of infrastructure play out in various contexts.",
                "Really strong set of readings that created interesting discussions. 750 word minimum for a reading response felt like a lot at first, but I ultimately enjoyed spending more time thinking about the material. No weaknesses that I can think of.",
                "strengths are that the class introduced us to a new way of thinking about a broad range of infrastructures. A weakness is that the readings were sometimes too disparate and we didn't get to cover all of them during discussion."

The readings are engaging and chosen well, and the professor has a really good handle on running a classroom and facilitating discussion that brings out the best in any student.",
