    "Lagrangians, Hamiltonians, a little bit about tensors, moment of inertia, orbital mechanics, etc. Like a continuation of first year mechanics but more in depth.",
    "Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods. Review of orbital dynamics, collision mechanics, and special relativity.",
    "I developed an understanding of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, and a much deeper understanding of classical mechanics as compared to an introductory physics class.",
    "Anything I hadn't learned in prior mechanics courses, which was surprisingly quite a lot.",
    "Lagrangians, Hamiltonians, Tensors, etc.",
    "I learned a lot in this course. I learned Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics, canonical coordinate systems, Poisson brackets, phase space, rotating coordinate systems and fictitious forces, tensors of inertia, and special relativity. Having taken this class, I am capable of tackling physics problems of a greater depth and variety than before. It's amazing how generalizable Hamiltonian mechanics is, and Noether's theorem ties in beautifully by relating symmetries in nature to conserved quantities. We don't dive deeply into any given concept, but this class is an excellent survey of classical mechanics at a level more sophisticated than freshman physics.",
    "I learned about how to think about physics from a energy-focused stance rather than a force-based stance. I learned how to look for and solve the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian to ultimately describe particle motion, as well as quantify orbits.",
    "Deeper knowledge of classical mechanics, background for quantum",
    "Basic mechanics, including special relativity.",
    "hamiltonian and lagrangian mechanics, central forcce motion, rigid body motion, among other things.",
    "I learned how to apply Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics to physical situations, as well as how to apply Euler's equation to problems of calculus of variations. I also learned how to treat moment of inertia correctly, and also a more derivational view of special relativity.",
    "Lagrangian\/hamiltonian physics, central body motion, momentum, non-inertial reference frame, special relativity, lots of cool stuff",
    "I learned new methods and applications in classical mechanics, including Lagrangian and Hamiltonian and expanding on planetary orbits.",
    "I learned hamiltonians and lagrangians, and further developed my understanding of central force motion and special relativity.",
    "I gained an understanding of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics as well as a broadened appreciation of rigid body rotation and special relativity.",
    "Everything that was on the syllabus: Lagrangians, Hamiltonians, special relativity, etc.",
    "A more sophisticated understanding of classical mechanics and some additional topics in special relativity that I think have prepared me well for quantum\/particle physics courses.",
    "Not to take this course",
    "We learned a more rigorous version of classical mechanics involving Lagrangians and Hamiltonians, among other topics.",
    "I learned about solving problems using Hamilton's principle and the Lagrangian. I also learned advanced concepts in rotational dynamics and central force motion.",
    "The knowledge covered in this course is largely a rehash of PHYS 260\/261. In addition, the very useful techniques of Lagrange and Hamilton are introduced, though I wish that they would have been used for more advanced applications.",
    "I learned some physics, particularly new ways of thinking about the same physics we learned before."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It's a great course - Baltay is a clear and engaging lecturer, the psets are of an appropriate difficulty and length and if you do them, understand them, and pay attention in lecture you should be fine for the exams.",
    "One improvement for the course would be to provide specific review material for the midterm and final tests. There is so much material to know for these exams, I believe it would be helpful to have some sort of review material outlining the most important ideas and examples to know. Overall though, the course was great and I really enjoyed it.",
    "Pretty strong course. Would be cool to delve into relativity a bit more at the end, though. I do acknowledge the time crunch, however.",
    "Lectures are tough to follow, but Baltay's humor makes it bearable",
    "Baltay's lectures were structured very clearly, and he made difficult concepts easy to understand. His jokes during class helped make the material memorable (I'll never forget the ensemble of bees). However, the textbook for this class is very dense and often difficult to parse, so I didn't learn much from it. Lastly, the support for this class was minimal. The graduate TFs were helpful, but their sessions were scheduled at inopportune times, so very few students went. I think this class would benefit greatly from having undergraduate peer tutors.",
    "I think that the material was alright and kind of interesting, but I didn't enjoy going to class. And because of how much emphasis is learned in class (all of it because notes are not posted online and problem sets ), I didn't feel like I learned a lot in class. Problem sets were often uninteresting and required lots of math that would not be explained in class. There was no information on what would be on the midterm and final until the day before the exam, and even then the information wouldn't be particularly helpful.",
    "Professor Baltay was pretty organized and his notes were fairly easy to follow. But we spent way too much time just deriving equations in class, which could get dry. Also, psets often lagged a lot behind what we were doing in class.",
    "Moves very slowly, and the material can often feel bland.",
    "It would have been great if prof baltay provided lecture notes and further review material for the exams, as the textbook itself is not always enough. simply put, it felt like the only resource we had was the textbook.\r\n\r\nAlso, in regards to the exams, prof baltay neglected to provide an equation sheet, so we were forced to memorize a slew of equations and expressions which, if you have ever taken a physics exam, would recognize this to be incredibly unnecessary and impractical.",
    "The way assignments are posted and submitted is poorly organized. Canvas is a great platform and should be utilized for this, its express purpose.",
    "Strength: interesting content\r\n\r\nWeakness: No practice exam, not much use of canvas",
    "The course was well structured and the homeworks were generally helpful in learning the material. There were a couple lectures where it felt like we weren't really learning anything that had to do with the topics of the course, and I think if these had been trimmed down we could have spent more time on special relativity in the end.",
    "Strengths.\r\nBaltay had very clear and concise course notes. \r\nThe textbook aligned really well with what was taught in lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses.\r\nBaltay often was unequipped to answer student questions.",
    "The lecturing sometimes got caught up inn the weeds of un-rigorous derivations which decreased engagement.",
    "This class was great in that Professor Baltay gave insightful and rigorous derivations, and then he also went over enough practice problems in class to get a hang of problem-solving. Like most other students, I would say Professor Baltay should certainly allow students to bring a one or two page study sheet\/formula sheet for the final. Although the final was fair and doable, a study sheet would've reduced the stress.",
    "Weaknesses: this class would do better with a TF who is more aware of the topics we're covering in class. Also, Dr. Baltay presumed that everyone in the class had taken PHYS 200\/1, but there were (at least) 6 students in our class who took PHYS 180\/1 last year (as 170\/1 and 180\/1 are listed as allowed prereqs. on the syllabus!) and thus had never been exposed to special relativity. Students in this position are not exactly inclined to point this fact out, and no one really did, but if you're going to allow students from 170\/1 or 180\/1 to take this class, special relativity needs to be taught from the ground up. A strength was Dr. Baltay's teaching and willingness to share the wisdom he's accumulated over his career.",
    "Professor baltay gives not nearly enough help for struggling students",
    "Lecture was often not very interesting, and it was difficult to ask questions in class. I don't know if lecture was not very interesting because of the material itself, or because of the classroom environment.",
    "Strengths: Professor Baltay is an excellent and very knowledgeable lecturer. The methods of Lagrange and Hamilton are taught clearly and their virtues are shown explicitly in well-picked examples.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not much new material is covered. Besides Hamilton and Lagrange, the only new material covered was the generalization of the moment of inertia to a rank-2 tensor (the difference between which and a fancy matrix is never really explained to the uneducated such as myself), which the motivated student could probably teach him\/herself in a couple of hours. I would suggest taking PHYS 500 instead. \r\n\r\nAlso, usually, when Professor Baltay makes a small error on the board, attempting to correct him is more trouble than it is worth, not because he is unwilling to admit errors, but rather that it oftentimes confuses him and takes more time out of lecture than necessary.",
    "Baltay spends too much time on really mundane things like telling us what a matrix determinant is and doing matrix multiplication. Also once in a while the derivations he writes on the board have errors in them that magically work out in the end. I think if he gave us a photocopy of the notes he uses in class, then it would be far easier for everyone to follow along. A strength is that the midterm and final questions are very similar to the homework questions, and the homework isn't too long or too difficult. I think the midterm was too easy and the final was too difficult. It would also be nicer to not have questions on the tests needing numerical calculations, since those are easy to mess up."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, so much so. Taking a class with Baltay is an incredible opportunity in and of itself, but its an interesting and engaging course as well. I particularly enjoyed learning about Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics - it gives you an opportunity to visualize the same physics from new perspectives.",
    "I would recommend this course to physics intensive majors as well as math majors looking for a science credit. Baltay is a good lecturer and a lenient grader and the class covers almost identically what is in the textbook, so if you don't understand something from class you can review it in the textbook and there are numerous examples and problems to work through to aid in understanding. I was a bit put off by the tests however. The midterm was made to be quite easy (The class average was a 92, which is kinda nuts for a physics class), however I think he realized he made the test too easy, thus he made the final quite difficult. The final was one of the hardest tests I've taken in my 3 semesters at Yale, but hopefully it gets curved well. We'll see. Also if you are a first year who knows multivariable calculus and has taken high school physics, you can absolutely skip the introductory sequence and take this course if you want to. I took 180\/181 as preparation and that class was actually much more work, and at times felt equally intellectually challenging.",
    "Very similar material to physics 260-261, maybe not worth taking if you're looking to learn a lot of new things instead of maintaining old skills.",
    "Yes, take it over 401. Less work and more interesting. Baltay's tests are pretty fair, so don't worry about your grade too much.",
    "Well it's required for Physics majors so there's no choice. I would not recommend it to non-physics majors; lectures and subject matter isn't the most interesting, but knowledge of classical mechanics is necessary for a physics curriculum.",
    "Yes! I learned a lot of new concepts in this class, and Baltay is a skilled and entertaining lecturer. The homework can sometimes be challenging, but it is doable with a good group of friends. The class isn't very demanding, and it gives an excellent survey of classical mechanics.",
    "No, I wouldn't recommend this course unless you are required to take it. The reason being is how the course is currently structured: the problem sets are not great, the lectures are bland and hard to follow, the midterm and final are very hectic, and as a result, I don't think I learned a lot in this class. I took it so that I could complete the physics major, but I didn't really enjoy being in the class.",
    "Yes, if you are a physics major. Just know you might need to teach yourself and that Baltay is not super accessible",
    "Not especially -- the course moves slow enough that most students would be better served by teaching themselves the material.",
    "Yes! amazing way to hone skills in classical physics.",
    "It's a necessary course to take if you are ever to move further into physics and understand what is going on, so yes, I recommend it.",
    "Only if you're a physics major",
    "I don't really know what PHYS 401 is like, but this was definitely a good mechanics course. We learned new material that we hadn't done in the intro physics sequence and I assume it will be a good foundation to branch out into the other main physics courses.",
    "Yes. This class is nothing two challenging or abstract for students familiar with intro level physics. The psets are pretty fun and the exams are very straightforward.",
    "If you're deciding between 410 and 401, take 410.",
    "Yes! I think this a great foundational course which will help with all future physics learning.",
    "Oh yes, definitely take this if you want an extra A. This course can be taken straight away in your first year if you took AP Physics C in high school, the introductory sequences can be skipped. \r\n\r\nAlso, the exam problems were modeled almost exactly like the homework problems or the textbook examples, so if you just go over those, you will get a high grade! Professor Baltay's midterm and final were very fair and predictable, nothing unexpectedly difficult or unknown. \r\n\r\nAlso, the homeworks were from the textbook and were graded very lightly, so there was basically no stress in this course at all. I think it was designed deliberately so that students can learn Lagrangians, Hamiltonians, rigid bodies, and special relativity for the knowledge rather than stressing out about exams. \r\n\r\n100% take this course if Professor Baltay is teaching it, it won't be as fun or fair with anyone else!",
    "Yes, if they've taken PHYS 200\/201. I think it needs to be made more clear to students choosing between the intro physics classes that if they have any intention of taking this or other physics classes, they need to take 200\/201 and not 180\/181 because it made this class a lot more difficult.",
    "Absolutely not professor baltay structures the class poorly",
    "If you're a physics major, you'll probably have to take it I think it may be less work than 401, but I'm not sure if it's more interesting, at least this year.",
    "If one has taken PHYS 260\/261, I would highly suggest shopping PHYS 500 as an alternative to this class. While there is nothing wrong with this class and I am very glad to have had Professor Baltay as a lecturer, almost all of the material in this class the student will have already learned. PHYS 260\/261 is far harder than this class.",
    "I recommend it to a student who is a possible physics major, and since it isn't too much work, for someone who is deciding between physics and another major, such as math or cs. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't need it."
