Topics that stand out to me are more classical social theory on education and race, which we put in conversation with each other. We also read books from contemporary social theorists who conducted different ethnographies of schools.",

Unfortunately, we did not discuss the readings much, but the course is nice for someone who wants to read material on education.",

Grace Kao is not very flexible as a professor, which makes it stressful if you have to miss class for any reason (pretty much if you have lots of other things going on in your life that are not academic-related, which describes most Yale students).",
