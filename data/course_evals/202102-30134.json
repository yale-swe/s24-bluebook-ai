                "I was able to gain more insight on not only sociological content and theory, but was also able to develop hard academic skills such as how to read efficiently and how to carry out particular methodologies, such as interviews, ethnographic observations, content analysis, surveys, and how to analyze the data gathered from such methodologies. I was given the opportunity to access various studies that I otherwise would not be able to and was able to engage in discussion with others learning at a similar level with me in terms of sociology.",
                "In general, I gained a much deeper understanding of the concepts of \"sex\" and \"gender\" and how they have been influencing individuals on both a macro and a micro level. I also learnt theories like the nesting doll and the idea of intersectionality, which are very helpful for me to make sense of the world around me and further my academic interests in the future. Reading more literature of sociology definitely helps me improve my critical reading and thinking skills. Also, I learnt the most common research methods of sociology and gained the ability to conduct an independent research with one of these methods under the guidance of the instructors. It was a very valuable and exciting experience for me.",

At the same, the large amount of reading material has improved my reading and summarizing skills to some extent.\r\nThis course gave me new ideas about the LGBTQ community, racial and other minority groups. In the future, I wanna make some research about these topics to explore the cause-and-effect relationship if I have some opportunities.",

                "Because it is a summer course the 3 hrs 15 minutes is pretty brutal and packed. Also the reading can feel a lot at times but I was also very busy.",
                "strengths: it is quite good that the professor can guide us to share our thoughts; and both of the professor and TAs are caring about our progresses, which gave my a lot of help",
                "The class readings were fascinating and led to incredibly interesting class discussions. One way to improve the course may be to change the format of the classes and incorporate various forms of media to increase student engagement.",
                "I think, as the course was online, it took more of an effort to truly be engaged and there was more room for me to doubt myself, as I was all alone, in terms of answering questions or being active in discussions, especially being one of the youngest in the course. However, due to COVID-19 of course, the issue of online class is unavoidable. I felt that a strength of this course was the instructor's openness to one-on-one help and her understanding of our individual levels/paces in learning sociology.",
                "strengths would include the opportunities to discuss in class, \r\n\r\na weakness might be that the readings often focus on white people with only a few mentions of non-white people, more diverse readings and content would improve the course",
                "The course really did a great job at improving students' reading, thinking, and research skills, engaging the students, and introducing basic concepts of the field. I just feel like there could be more discussions and connections made out of the readings and more creative ways to achieve that. It will be really interesting if  more connections could be made between the research part and the reading/lecture part of the course.",
                "I like the activities arranged and especially the class discussion part",
                "I think this course is interesting and attractive for me.",
                "From my perspective, it can offer more videos and movies about 'gender and sex'.",
                "Strength: I really like group discussion, both in main room or in small groups. It helps me learn from others' opinions and inspires my own thoughy. Also, the Professors's analysis is always insightful and encourages me to think deeply.\r\nWeakness: Probably no. The only pity is that we did not read 'The second sex'. And I prefer a complete logic system that directs to today's social problem or unfair treatment between males and females."

It was a wonderful experience for me, and I have gained a lot from it. The topics of the course are very important and the skills that it is helping me to improve are crucial as well.",
                "Yes. I like the content and the teacher.",

                "Of course. I will recommend this course especially for my friends who wanna engage in gender and sexuality studies. It is so significant for us to understand the basic information. Apart from this, it can decrease many bias and discriminations in gender and sexuality for a few people who own paranoid thoughts.",
