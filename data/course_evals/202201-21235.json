It is a small seminar class where you will look at each other's work so you end up becoming really close with others in the class which I find as really rewarding. The assignments are all really interesting and rigorous in a way that exposes you to the principles of design while allowing room for your own experimentation. Weakness: The 8:30 am schedule was a quite hard not going to lie, but I will say if there is any class at Yale worth waking up for on a Friday, it is Typography!",
