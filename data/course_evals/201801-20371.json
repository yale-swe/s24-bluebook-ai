   "comments": [
    "I gained skills in pencil, pen, and charcoal techniques, as well as drawing figures, still lifes, interior and exterior spaces.",
    "Through this course, I was able to get a formal training in the technical elements of drawing - from learning value and perspective, to how to control and work in different mediums such as charcoal, pencil, pen, and ink.",
    "I learned how to draw with different media like graphite, charcoal, pen and ink.",
    "I learned technical drawing skills with several mediums like charcoal, ink, pencil, and pen. I gained influence and knowledge of other artists and projects that could inspire my art further",
    "I practiced and learned art techniques and visual thinking skills.",
    "I learned how to draw with perspective and shadows using multiple media. I also learned how to express ideas creatively in visual work.",
    "I had never taken an art class before this course, and I learned a lot about the mentality of art and about technical processes. This class has great exposure to a wide range of techniques, and the homework forces you to practice and develop skills. We started with still lifes, then moved on to figure drawing, interior spaces, exterior spaces, and imagination.",
    "This course developed my artistic eye, my technical abilities, and my confidence in myself as an artist.",
    "I learned some stuff about perspective, drawing shapes, composition, and basic art theory. \r\n\r\nBut i gained much greater insights into what it takes to create arthard work. I learned that art isnt about talent as much as it is about time, commitment, and trying new things. I learned that sharing your art with people can give you a lot of new ideas and inspiration. I also learned that everyone has a unique and beautiful stile when it comes to drawing. I learned the importance of layering and constant addition to make work beautiful. I also learned that it makes drawing easier to not treat your work to preciously, to take risks, be bold, and remember that its just a piece of paper.",
    "I honed my drawing skills and technique of graphite, ink and charcoal.  I learned more about composition, perspective and lighting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This is a fantastic course that covers a broad range of introductory drawing topics and techniques.",
    "The exam period could end earlier. Other than that I love This course and she should definitely teach again.",
    "The course was relevant and structured with lots of opportunity for reflection and feedback.",
    "Great structure, sometimes a little disjointed but you learn a lot.",
    "I think the format of the class worked really well, at least for me. Since I had no exposure to art previously, anything and everything we did in class was new, interesting, and information. The demos were very helpful to see the process of drawing certain scenes and how to look at something. Homework review was extremely beneficial because although it took time, I think it was helpful to see other students' works and discuss them.",
    "This course is amazing for personal artistic development and development of creativity. It is an opportunity to converse with other artists and learn from their techniques and imaginations. My professor mentioned our having a sketchbook in future iterations of this course and I completely agree with her on that!",
    "Strengths: it really gets you to practice a lot and put in time. Also sharing your art with a class and getting feedback is invaluable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: critiques end up at kings long time, making it hard to fit an hour long drawing into a class period. It might be better to do a 1 hour class on Monday for critiques and going over homework, and a 3 our class on Wednesday for doing some longer drawings.",
    "Strengths: encouraging space for students of all skill levels, good feedback from teachers, engaging lessons, amazing to work from a live model.\r\nWeaknesses: lack of attention to using time efficiently (the teacher spent 10 minutes critiquing each piece of homework and was surprised when we didn't have enough time to do the exercises), most  thought the lessons were not particularly creative and we could have had some assignments that pushed us to innovate, while still learning the fundamental skills, also I thought the critique could have been a been harsher to help me grow more. Having a big final project to work on during reading week was also very overwhelming for me."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who has a passion for art and\/or is interested in devoting time to learning basic drawing skills. It is a fast-paced course that expects a lot of its students (eg. weekly homework assignments), but you will definitely notice an improvement in your drawing skills throughout the semester, and emerge with a large portfolio that you are proud of. I had a wonderful time in this class and often found myself doing drawing homework as a nice escape from the rigors of other classes.",
    "Yes - Leigh is incredibly supportive, engages everyone, and  teaches the material really well.",
    "Yes, for sure! Such a gentle introduction to art and everyone who took it improved so much in their drawing abilities.",
    "Yes, for sure! Such a gentle introduction to art and everyone who took it improved so much in their drawing abilities.",
    "Yes; everyone can learn from taking an art class. No matter the major, taking a class like this evolves the level of creativity one has and allows them to transfer their knowledge and passions to a different platform.",
    "Yes! It is a great way to practice and meet new people.",
    "Yes, definitely take this course if you want to learn how to draw or improve your skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Positive atmosphere, relaxing most of the time, definitely a time commitment but high reward at the end. Definitely feel out the teacher during shopping period. That makes all the difference as they all teach it differently.",
    "This is an amazing course designed to allow you to develop personally as an artist over the course of the class. There is focus on becoming personally better, and even as you see your work among others, you can learn from their techniques, insights, and input to develop your techniques and artistic voice. I loved the course as a break from rigorous STEM courses and a way to challenge myself in a unique intellectual way.",
    "Yes! If you are a casual doodler or a avid drawer their class is Greta me cause it makes you draw often, on big sheets of paper, and it makes you share your drawings with people. All go these things helped me improve a lot.",
    "Yes. It is great, especially for a new artist who wants to learn skills. It will be fun for more advanced students, but not particularly stimulating."
