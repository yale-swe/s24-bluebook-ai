                "An amazing opportunity to learn how to use microscopes, dissect animals, and observe anatomy as a supplement to the Invertebrates class. We also did a really interesting genomics project in which we sequenced the entire genome of a sponge. Unfortunately, our two field trips were rained out and were not rescheduled, which was a huge loss - I was really hoping to have some experience doing field collecting.",
                "How to identify organisms, learn about the different morphology and anatomy of organisms we learned about in lecture. Learned how to look through and adjust microscopes",
                "I learned laboratory methods, as well as a better understanding of the anatomy and diversity of invertebrates. The lab was a fantastic compliment to the lecture and really helped me understand the topics.",
                "I learned dissection techniques, basic biology laboratory techniques, identification skills, and general invertebrate zoology material.",
                "i looked at lots of invertebrates and got to dissect some cool ones! (starfish, worms, squid, etc).",
                "I LEARNED SO MUCH IN THIS COURSE. Rarely do you get hands-on learning in college. This course changes everything! Plus, the Peabody Museum's new facilities were cool to see and use.  I gained knowledge on invertebrate species and their distinct characteristics as well as the similarities and differences of those characteristics to human characteristics. I learned how to disect and improved my scientific illustration abilities. I gained insight into genomic sequencing -- how it's done, what software is used, and the potential publications that can come out of it.",
                "I gained vital hands-on experience with live animals from all branches of the invertebrates on the tree of life. Being in a lab setting where we could freely examine and study live and preserved specimens was such a special experience that I felt I would have missed if I only took a lecture course. I also learned about computational genomics -- it really is a fascinating field of study, and I was surprised to learn about how far technology has developed to aid in research in the field.",
                "I learned how to examine organisms under a microscope, compare and identify specimens, and pinpoint important anatomical features and functions. This course helped me understand unifying features of certain clades and appreciate animal diversity."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: brand new facility and equipment in the Peabody, there was always a high level of preparation of both live specimens and preserved museum specimens, access to highly knowledgable museum staff was extremely helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wished we had more time and engagement with the genome project, and that the Horse Island field trips had been rescheduled at least once. I also believe that the quizzes seemed to test on random knowledge rather than connecting themes, and they were difficult to study for.",
                "strengths: Perfect workload, labs were so informative and fun\r\nweakness: quizzes were a bit too difficult.",
                "Strengths were an incredible specimen selection for each lab, a detailed lab manual, and very helpful staff/professors/TFs. Weaknesses were that it was never possible to examine every organism or write up detailed observations during the class time.",
                "Strengths - the live animals and tremendous Peabody collections were always fascinating to observe. Professor Dunn and Eric Lazo-Wasem (the Peabody Invertebrate Zoology Senior Collections Manager) were both fantastic instructors. The genomics material was also neat to play around with given how vital the skill is to the field. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - despite hours of studying, the practical quizzes were difficult. There is so much material that it can get overwhelming at times. It is hard to see with clarity what content is important and what is less so.",
                "strengths: the specimens were always so cool!\r\n\r\nweaknesses: oh boy those lab quizzes. like damn. they kept asking us ultra-specific questions (identifying specimens, naming parts, etc) that were extremely difficult. it was especially demoralizing to feel like I couldn't improve my grade on the quizzes by studying because they were asking us stuff that they didn't teach us during lab. luckily casey is nice and he curves the grades, so I got a 50% on my quiz and still got an A, but it really sucks to fail a quiz.",
                "Strengths: The clear strength of this course is the fact that it is so independently led and hands-on. Additionally, every student gets their own microscopes and lab stations. This was especially important because it granted students a sense of autonomy and the ability to feel like a real scientist. Each class followed no structure aside from an overview that the lab manual contained. Open note final was also a strength because students got to learn and be less stressed about the numbers. Also, the fact that we had to draw what we saw was a strength of the course because it helped students use a different part of their brain than typical classes require.\r\nWeaknesses: TFs did not engage with students. They silently sat in class while students followed the lab manual. This made students (or at least made myself) feel like the TFs did not care about the students at all nor did it seem that they cared about the content. Also, the course promised two field trips to Horse Island, and neither of these occurred due to weather. Rescheduling at least one of these trips would have showed the students that the professor cared about them. Additionally, students were not informed of the difficulty of tests. Releasing sample questions would be extremely helpful. Then, students would know to what degree to study. I felt blindsided by the tests. We were given so much content that there was no way for us to fully understand all of it but we were given no direction in what themes or phylum we were supposed to deeply know. Then, when we did poorly on the first test, neither the TFs nor the professor gave us guidance on how to do better on the next test and this next test was even harder than the first.",
                "Strengths: Professor Dunn, Dalila, Lizzie, Eric, and the rest of the team provided amazing support throughout the semester. Having hands-on experience with invertebrates in the lab fully enhanced what I learned from lecture (sometimes some specimens would be passed around during lecture, but this paled in comparison to being able to witness live specimens and closely examine Peabody specimens in the lab). Eric is a gem whose help and guidance was particularly special -- I loved touring the Peabody collection with the TA's and my fellow peers -- his experience, wisdom, and kindness are truly invaluable.\r\nNo weaknesses from my perspective!",
                "Several strengths of the course were the hands-on learning approach and being able to handle and examine a variety of specimens alive or preserved. \r\nThe course could have been better organized and structured. For example, many dissections were difficult to complete by just following written instructions and diagrams and it would have helped if the dissections were more guided. Additionally, material on the quizzes was highly specific and variable and it was difficult to study for."

                "I would 100% recommend this course to other students, even those who are not in the E&EB major. You get to look at the coolest animals once a week in a beautiful brand new teaching classroom in the Peabody Museum. The lab time is mostly dissecting, observing the animals, and drawing what you see in a lab notebook (which they provide for you). The animals are fascinating enough to learn about in the lecture, but actually being able to engage with them in a hands-on way adds a completely new facet to your learning. The workload outside of lab time is almost zero, and you also get an opportunity to brush up on your drawing skills.",
                "Yes, take the class esp if you're taking the lecture! It helps you solidify the information in the lecture and dual encode it.",
                "Yes! It's a wonderful compliment to the lecture, very little work, very easy final requirements, and super interesting!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The small nature of the lab coupled with the diversity of specimens to examine made learning invertebrate zoology fun and highly engaging.",
                "highly recommend if you want to take a chill science lab where you look at really cool specimens and make drawings of them in your lab notebook. Seriously, that's basically all you do. They give you live animals & preserved specimens and you draw pictures of them for a couple hours each thursday afternoon.",
                "YES!!! This class gives you access to all the materials and expertise that any aspiring scientist could ever want. It's especially cool to handle so many live specimens and have the opportunity to view them under top-grade microscopes. AND the Peabody's new facilities are awesome to see and use in-person!! Definitely take this class if you want to feel like you're a scientist. The class also had a large art/drawing component which served as a great break from typical class tasks.",
                "I absolutely would, though E&EB majors will definitely get the most from this experience.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in invertebrate biology and working with specimens and gaining a better understanding of animal diversity. It is an excellent lab course to supplement the lecture."
