    "- Basic overview of linear algebra concepts ranging from matrix arithmetic to orthogonality\r\n- Basic overview of multivariable calculus concepts ranging from partial derivatives to optimization\r\n- How the above subjects relate to applied data analysis and econometric problems",

   "comments": [
    "strengths: covered a wide range of concepts with many examples provided\r\nweaknesses: final unit was a bit rushed",
    "Strengths: covers a lot of material in a short time. Prof. Jia is generous with her time and caring. Grading and assignments are fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: covering a lot of material in a short time, compounded with this being an accelerated summer course, made it very, very difficult. The speed of the course was breakneck. Although I have a feeling this was just because this was taught in the summer.",
    "The course was very fast-paced, and sometimes it was a bit hard to process all the information. Perhaps it would have been helpful to do three two-hour sessions a week instead of two three-hour sessions. I also wish Prof Jia had provided us with an answer key after each assignment\/quiz was graded.",
    "It is very condensed - perhaps the material from the last and penultimate class can be switched so the hardest stuff is covered well before the final.",
    "Weaknesses: the quizzes being done every class was an inefficient way, in my view of assessing the students. I feel like the midterm, final exam format would be much better. It's hard to be assessed on material that we've only learned a couple days ago. \r\n\r\nStrengths: I definitely feel that this class shouldn't be a class taught in the summer, given just the how extensive the material is. But I believe Prof. Jia did a great job holding office hours and taking breaks, really catering students' needs when it came to understanding the material being taught in class and overall academic performance.",
    "I enjoy the class very much. Dr. Ning Jia is a very good professor.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- Professor was helpful and good at communicating information\r\n- Office hours were useful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Homework assignments were often quite lengthy\r\n- Material on the quizzes was sometimes not what was on the homework, even though that was what we were told to expect."

    "I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to pursue economics or data analysis",

    "I would if they are pursuing a career in this field and need a fundamental understanding of linear algebra and multivariable calculus.",
    "Only if you want to learn more linear algebra. I've taken all of the economics prerequisites, the only thing from this class that came up there were the Lagrange equations, although those can be tricky.",
    "Yes. The course taught in a quick pace and covered a lot of useful materials. The professor is patient and understanding. The office hours are readily available.",
    "Yes, but only if the student has the time to dedicate to it since it was very intensive."
