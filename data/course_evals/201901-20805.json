    "Yes! I took the course mostly to fulfill a medieval credit, but ended up really enjoying it.",
    "Good class for the medieval requirement !! Great profs; fun discussions.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I took it for the requirement, and I wasn't sure what to expect because I'm not specifically interested in the coursework. HOWEVER, the professors were amazing and it quickly become one of my favorite classes."
