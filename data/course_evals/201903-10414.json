   "comments": [
    "Excellent teacher, course well-paced for people at all levels of experience",
    "I loved the class, and thought the projects, homework assignments, class powerpoints, and class activities were all very helpful.",
    "I really liked the critiques that we did on the homework. It helped me see what works and what doesn't as it relates to my art. The live feedback gave me new ideas and helped me see my improvement over the semester. The engagement of this course is obviously phenomenal because we were able to work on our art during every class. My favorite class was when we got to go out on cross campus and draw. Speaking of, I think a weakness of this course is that almost all the classes are in the same room, and all the still-life subjects and room drawings were of the same things, which got a little bland. Additionally, there was no grading feedback throughout the semester, so especially as a non-art major, you constantly wonder how you are doing in the class. Overall, however, the course was well organized with in-class assignments and homework assignments.",
    "The course is very good as an introduction to drawing. It tries to teach technique,  but ultimately, I think success in the course isn't build from learning these techniques in the classroom setting, but drawing and drawing. Most of my advancement was probably just having a formal setting which forced me to draw. One thing I would like to see is the use of critiques as means to encourage development. I would love to see more criticism directed and suggesting new styles, mediums, or framing for each artwork. There are a lot of great artists and talent, but I think people were afraid of being too harsh.",
    "I loved everything about this course, however I wish that we could have focused more on the human form.",
    "Troy Michie was a fantastic instructor.",
    "There were no weaknesses to this class. The class was very well structured by our professor, with weekly assignments that applied techniques we attempted in class and gave us the freedom to develop our own style. We received important and helpful feedback on our in-class work as well as our homework assignments. There was never any pressure to be traditional or perfect. Instead, there was the encouragement we needed to push our boundaries. As a non-art major, this was an amazing class that gave me the confidence to see myself as an artist, even thought that is not my main academic pursuit at Yale.",
    "Interesting and productive weekly assignments, but critiques often drew on too long and weren't very productive.",
    "longer studios!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This class was really relaxing, and as a non-art major it was a great break from my usual class work. While this class is by no means a gut, it was definitely a great 5th class and I would take it again",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have at least some background in drawing as most of the students do. Troy's class especially requires someone who has time to put in the work, but overall, the results are really satisfying. I enjoyed this class a lot! We got to work with a lot of different media and styles.",
    "Yes! If you're at all interesting in getting better to draw. Just being around art majors and other artists is great exposure and really gives you the ability to try out new ways of seeing and representing.",
    "Yes. I loved this course!",
    "This is not a gut. I spent about 3 hrs per week on homework. And 4 hrs of class per week. But dont let that dissuade you if youd like to learn to draw. I loved it! Because its drawing, it doesnt feel like work. Definitely take it if Troy Michie is the instructor.",
    "Yes! Very different style of course from other Yale College classes (studio-based) and lots of interesting assignments.",
    "Yes!! Best class",
    "yes! especially w troy!",
    "Yes. The great thing about art courses is that you can push yourself as much as you want. Even if you are someone with an extensive art background, the instructor will still challenge you simply by adjusting their expectations in accordance to your demonstrated skills. The class size is relatively small so there is an advantage that most all people in the class will be quite invested in art, thus creating a strong supportive and creative environment. If your on the heels of Da Vinci you might be wasting your time in this class, but for anyone else who is looking to improve their fundamentals, if you have the tiem give their course a shot."
