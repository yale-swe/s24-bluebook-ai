                "The strength of this class is the small class size. It truly allows for smaller questions that may not be asked in lecture to be answered and discussed in detail. The main weakness is the ability for one or two people to break the curve significantly more because of the smaller distribution.",
                "Amazing professor. Great textbook. There could be more problem sets to practice for the exam. Sometimes the professor rushes way too much with numerical examples and computations.",
                "The weakness of the course, to me, was that the material seemed a little too simplistic and impractical - for instance, the formulas we learned would never actually work in real life. But I felt Tolga did as good a job as he possibly could have.",
                "The seminar style of this course encourages more engagement, and because of this, it is much easier to absorb the material. The limited number of assessments means that you are responsible for staying on top of your work, and this means the exams and problem sets carry a lot of weight.",
                "This is a very rich and providing lecture class, in which students are constantly encouraged to understand the daily applications of economic theories. At the same time, the content comes primarily through these (often extremely fast-paced) lectures. A stronger use of the textbook and additional resources would stand to make the course more functional.",
                "As somebody who works better with practice problems, I felt as though I did not receive enough practice problems to fully learn the content. We were merely told to go to class and read the book, but that didn't help me fully grasp my learning.",
                "It was a great class and I love how the professor made the class more interesting through comedic engagement. However, the class moved very fast at times. During class wed move very fast and take intermittent breaks. If we room fewer breaks maybe we could have moved through the material slower while covering the same amount of material.",
                "Strengths: The lectures in this course were very well organized. Weaknesses: the material sometimes felt rushed and difficult to understand, and there weren't enough practice problems."
