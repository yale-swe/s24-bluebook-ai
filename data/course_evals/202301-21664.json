                "This course has no real deadlines. This can be a strength or weakness depending on the person. I enjoyed the fact that there were no deadlines because I received no penalties for late work. However, this can make it easy for students to drastically fall behind.",
                "Good",
                "Ronald Adrezin is fantastic.\r\nWe should do more required Solidworks tutorials in this class (more assignments that are just doing Solidworks tutorials). \r\nThe projects were generally interesting. \r\nProject expectations were flexible, which made the class low-stress but also allowed us to spend a lot of time on certain projects if we wanted.",
                "The class allows you to focus on what u want to learn. You can decide how in depth you want to learn each thing. All of the projects teach useful skills in CAD and build on each other but allow you to direct each skill how you want.",
                "Strengths: Really interesting content and a great professor, very lenient grading/deadlines, fun projects, etc. Weaknesses: At times, the class didn't feel very organized and it wasn't very clear what was going on during lecture, but definitely a fun class. The loose deadlines were also very nice throughout the semester, but did make it hard to stay on top of my work.",
                "Strengths: I am a huge fan of the mastery-based learning system applied in this course. On any assignment, as long as you can demonstrate mastery of the skill that the assignment is about, you will get full credit, regardless of when you submit it. SolidWorks is also a fantastic skill to have for a mechanical engineer applying for internships or jobs. \r\nWeaknesses: I would have loved to get into SolidWorks's simulation capabilities a little bit more.",
                "Sometimes having free work days in class made it so many people didnt show up very often. But final presentations were a strength, as well as the soft deadlines.",
                "I think the structure of this class was very well-designed. I liked that the assignments were all due at the end of the semester because that meant I never felt rushed to just submit a subpar assignment and could wait until I had a less busy week to take my time and make my design more complex.",
                "The biggest strength is Prof A. He is supper funny and overall, an amazing professor, always willing to help and support his students. He makes sure the content is engaging for mechE and non-mechE majors alike",
                "Good assignments, fair grading, still learned a lot",
                "The structure of the course was good, the content was taught in lecture and then time was given for the assignment that put the new knowledge into practice. The professor was available and knowledgeable of the CAD package and really cared about the student's learning.",
                "The assignments are really helpful in learning how to use the different tools that Solidworks has to offer",
                "It was great. Low workload and learned a lot.",
                "I liked this class a lot. I did it mostly asynchronous, and learned a lot. Professor Adrezin gives good feedback and helps you learn a lot. Assignments were reasonable and fun.",
                "Strengths: flexible deadlines for assignments, great professor and helpful TFs\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "I think just a greater volume of projects would help me to further refine my skills, and more help choosing/creating a plan for a final project.",
                "Dr. A was great, and overall the class was very effective at teaching CAD skills. My only criticism of the course is that the way that assignments and due dates overlapped was sometimes confusing.",
                "Amazing course! Would 10/10 recommend.",
                "The Mastery Based Learning (MBL) is an amazing model that should be adopted by every class at Yale. The professor is amazing. I didn't have to stress so much abut my grade and getting it completely right on the first try because I knew Professor Adrezin would tell me what I could do to make it better/give me insight into aspects I hadn't thought about. Could actually learn and stick with a piece instead of just moving on immediately from thing to thing. He was also clearly passionate about the topic and its real life applications, specifically in relation to accommodations for people with disabilities. He never wants access to be a barrier for anyone. Also tells fun stories.",
                "Mastery Based Learning was a really good aspect of the class that made me want to learn the material and do it well.",
                "Not a lot of direct teaching a lot of the learning is done on your own. I would have liked some more specific solidworks teaching there are some concepts in solidworks that we just never covered.",
                "The course was well-balanced between covering new material and discussing assignments and project ideas with the instructors. After the mid-semester feedback, the lecture/tutorial content was more student driven in that one volunteer would share their screen alongside the professor as everyone else followed along. I found this format really helpful and think that it should continue. I would also suggest that the computers in the classroom should have cameras for Zoom instruction, but this is more of a technical or administrative issue.",
                "I enjoyed the mastery-based approach given that engineering design should be focused on continuous improvement rather than getting it right the first time. One of the weaknesses of the class was that there was no engineering design book that one could look for to construct advanced mechanisms.",
                "Doc A is great. He makes the class enjoyable and is a very patient and understanding instructor."

It never feels like too much work, because if you have a busy week you can always submit the assignment later without any penalty to your grade. This was a great way to learn more about the best practices in CAD and to get more experience in it.",

                "Yes! Great course for anyone interested in learning SolidWorks.",
                "Yes. CAD is a skill that I think most people should acquire.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in learning how to use Solidworks. If you already know Solidworks or some other CAD package, as I did going into the course, there is still definitely a lot to learn about how to use certain tools and industry best practices.",
                "Amazing course! Would 10/10 recommend.",
                "Yes. One of the best classes at Yale. The professor really cares about his students and you learning. He is also extremely passionate about the topic and gives insight into real life applications. Mastery Based Learning (MBL) is an amazing model that all classes should adopt.",
                "Highly! I think every Mechanical engineer or engineer in general should take this course.",
                "This is a good engineering course to take, even if you are not specifically in mechanical engineering. The material is useful for articulating design ideas, and the instructors were very helpful and understanding.",
                "Yes! This course is amazing for understanding engineering design from the ground up. Moreover, as an elective, this course was extremely refreshing as the workload is manageable and allows students to design to their heart's content.",
                "Yes! All engineering courses should be taught like this course. So much focus on learning skills as opposed to cramming information for tests and performance in assessments. You will learn SolidWorks well and enjoy doing it because the course is taught in such a relaxed manner.",
                "Yes if you want to learn more about CAD. It's a great intro course.",
