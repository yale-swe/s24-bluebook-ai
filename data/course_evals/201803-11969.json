   "comments": [
    "I learned conversational Spanish, improved my reading and writing, and learned how to communicate among peers my own age.",
    "This class mainly helped to reinforce concepts learned in L2 I feel much more confident using relatively complicated grammatical structures, and I feel that I can read and write and speak much better than before.",
    "The most important thing I learned in Spanish this semester was to take chances. I can communicate in Spanish, and of course I'll make mistakes, but I can say almost anything I want. Also, reading the novel really boosted my confidence.",
    "Improvement in listening and vosotros commands.",
    "I greatly improved my verbal and written Spanish skills. I learned how to use the grammatical foundations I gained in conversation and composition.",
    "I developed a further understanding of the Spanish language and some literature.",
    "better grammar, reading, speaking",
    "After completion of Spanish 130, I have developed written, reading comprehension and oral skills. I feel more proficient in my ability to effectively write and communicate in a foreign language. Additionally, I gained insight and knowledge though reading literature, short stories and a novel written in Spanish and holding discussions about them.",
    "My listening comprehension of Spanish has improved dramatically.",
    "I improved my Spanish speaking and grammar skills. I gained more confidence in public speaking and presenting in Spanish and also learned how to improve my Spanish writing through the timed essays and assignments."

   "comments": [
    "The course is extremely well taught, allowing my Spanish to improve immensely. The readings are interesting and engaging. The only downfall is the amount of busywork.",
    "Great teacher, he made sure everyone understood what we were learning. Supersite felt like busy work most of the time though.",
    "I think the structure of the class could be improved  namely, there is a lot of busy work that doesn't do much in terms of ability, and I wish there was more opportunities to practice speaking (although my instructor did a good job of doing group activities so that we talked a lot during class). Sometimes the homework was excessive and just generally pointless.",
    "My prof was so awesome. I really felt comfortable speaking Spanish in the classroom. The homework really did just feel like busy work, though.",
    "The class does a great job at teaching you the material but not about how you are going to need to apply it towards quizzes and tests",
    "teacher was great\r\nstories in CC\r\n\r\ntext book was useless\r\nquizzes were same difficulty as tests which was ridiculous",
    "The strengths of this course include organization of the lectures, variation of learning activities (discussions, movies, readings, online homework, written homework, etc) and the enthusiasm of my professor. The weaknesses of this course include the design of exams to take longer than the allocated class time. This course could be improved by possibly offering more projects such as presentations or posters.",
    "The Spanish course can be overwhelming sometimes because of the amount of work that needs to be completed on a daily basis. Maybe decreasing the work load.",
    "The strengths are how much Spanish practice you do through daily conversations in class. The weaknesses are that sometimes the online homework is confusing or seems like busy work and there is a disparity between the quality of the texts we read in class. Some were very interesting and helpful and others were not so much."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. It improved my Spanish immensely and I made great friends within the course. The teacher was friendly and approachable.",
    "Yes. It's a challenging course but makes you feel accomplished and the professor always wants you to succeed.",
    "I would recommend the course if you want to take Spanish I think the class is much better organized and conducive to learning that L2 (or L4, although that's just what I've heard). It's not amazing, but you will get better at Spanish.",
    "Yes! It's so fun and there are enough grades that you don't need to stress about one test or quiz. Also, there's no final which is really nice. Take this class with Prof Lestayo!",
    "Yes, if they have an interest in studying Spanish then it is a great class to develop that skill",
    "yes",
    "Yes, I would recommend Spanish 130 to another student as this course does an excellent job of bridging the gap between mastering grammar rules and vocabulary with the ability to apply these rules in real life through conversation and reading.",
    "If they were interested in learning Spanish and willing to put in a considerable amount needed work, then of course.",
    "Yes my Spanish improved from practicing daily and it was a good experience to take it with Jose and get to know a smaller group of students from seeing them every day."
