    "I learned basic lab techniques that are very beneficial for an elementary approach to chemistry, but it often felt like the techniques were so basic that we might never use them again after this class. I will say that when the topics in the lab lined up with the topics in the lecture, which was a very rare occurrence, it was extremely beneficial and gave me a better understanding of the material than I could have otherwise gained.",
    "One of the most useful parts of this course was getting a sense of my own career interests, and deciding if a research-based career seemed interesting to me.  However, this lab was very similar to the experiments I did in my high school AP Chemistry class.  One of the most critical things I took away from this course was skills in time management- the lab reports constantly pushed me to better make use of my time.  Another practical skill that I found useful was gaining practice in making Excel graphs.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses: There is no clear way to prepare for quizzes and they are usually hit or miss, either really bad or really good. Lab projects are often too large for the time allotted and it is difficult to finish before lab ends. Instead of teaching us how to do the pre-lab questions or giving hints on them, we are left to fend for ourselves and figure them out on our own, which is extremely difficult for those with a weak chemistry background. The lab reports were extremely tedious and we were expected to do complex graphing tasks in programs like excel, which most students had no experience with.\r\n   Strengths: The TA's are usually very nice and understanding and are very willing to support the student's learning. Though he has a bad reputation, Dr. G seemed very nice and was always willing to answer questions or explain topics in office hours, though he could sometimes be a little condescending or presumptuous about what the student \"should know.\"",
    "This course does require a lot of work for only a half credit.  Sometimes I felt that I could not clearly see the purpose in doing some of the experiments we did.  However, the strengths of this course lie mostly in exposing students to new career environments that they may wish to pursue, providing a broad review of general chemistry content, and giving students the opportunity to practice troubleshooting.",
    "I don't understand why this course is graded on a curve. Students are encouraged to collaborate on reports, but are hesitant to do because that may bring the average up and make it more difficult to receive an A in the course. Science is and should be collaborative, but this course makes it difficult for that to happen. The cpurse should be more collaborative in the future. I also think an optional section would be beneficial (maybe even to replace the lecture portion of the lab), to help students understand the objectives of a lab before starting it, and to better prepare for quizzes and reports.",
    "The course features very nitpicky grading, and the curve that comes at the end of the semester can either make you or break you. Nonetheless, the TAs were very friendly and helpful during lab, and the professor was very engaging with the class. I felt like I was learning something every week, and the professor especially built upon my appreciation for chemistry as a science.",
    "The class was very engaging, but I wish grading was more transparent. It would be better if grades every week for quizzes and lab sheets were all posted on canvas. I also wish students knew about their lab conduct grade, which is not revealed until the end of the semester. There is also a lack of concensus in grading between the instructor and the TAs, and sometimes between the TAs themselves. Dr. G will mark a quiz reponse wrong even if the TAs disputed him. Some TAs grade much harshly than others, and things like significant figures are sometimes graded incorrectly.",
    "This course should be worth more credits, as with many lab courses. Was extremely time consuming.",
    "The material was very closely connected to CHEM 161 which was very helpful for both courses. While the labs were interesting and Dr. G. was always very helpful, I do believe that this course should be a full credit because I did have to do more work for this course than most of my other full credit courses. In addition, most students, including myself, greatly struggled with the lab quizzes.",
    "This course is good at teaching students a wide variety of lab techniques over a short period of time, but the material does not correspond very well to the material of Chem 163, so the subjects often required a bit of brushing up before each lab versus the Chem 161 students, whose work coincided with the lab layout.",
    "The course, for only being a half credit, had just as much, if not significantly more, than the other classes I took this semester, all of which were supposed to be relatively high in workload. The grading was also very difficult, and at times I felt that I understood the concepts of the class\/lab perfectly, but lost points for technicalities, which seemed understandable, but I felt at times that it was an unfair amount of points off.\r\n\r\nI also felt that the class at times was more catered towards 161 than 163, with the labs lining up with what was taught in 161 at the time. As someone in 163, the lab quizzes often covered concepts I hadn't seen since my junior year.",
    "Strengths: course teaches lab skills, Dr. G has helpful lab lecture before every lab, weaknesses: poorly designed course structure (with a lot of work for 0.5 credits), difficult lab quizzes, some experiments are rushed and hard to finish by the end of the lab period",
    "Strengths of this course are the basic introduction to lab techniques and the guidance that TFs bring to the lab.  Weaknesses are that sometimes I felt like instructions weren't specific enough on certain questions on quizzes or lab reports, which led to points being taken off.",
    "A serious issue I found with this course was that I was not retaining much of the material covered during the actual lab day. Labs are on only one day of the week, but they require a disproportionate amount of preparation and work before and after. After I finished a lab, I would pretty much forget everything and move on to the next one. Instructors also need to provide more feedback on lab reports. Most of the feedback on my lab reports was just one or two words, and they usually said \"incorrect\" or \"wrong sig fig\": this feedback did not help me improve.\r\n\r\n I did appreciate Dr. G's willingness to help with lab reports and the generous \"drop\" policies. \r\n\r\nMy TA, Benjamin Groff, was extremely helpful and understanding.",
    "It is absolutely not a \"1\/2 credit\" - I worked harder on homework for lab than gen chem itself.",
    "It's a challenge to find strengths. Once every few lectures or labs you may learn a single fun fact. Beyond that, this was one of the most disappointing classes I've taken at Yale and it's hilarious that so many people have to take it. It's full of tedious tasks that don't really prepare anyone to work in a chemistry lab. The class isn't about learning how to be a scientist or ask questions, it's learning how to figure out exactly what Dr. G wants and then to do that. He wants such a degree of specificity that he might as well give us fill in the blanks for lab reports. This class actively degraded the interest I had developed in chemistry from the 163 lectures. It does no one any good.",
    "The material is for the most part interesting, but I think that at times the grading was too harsh.",
    "",
    "I liked how there were ample resources to complete the lab reports and the lab manual was very detailed, outlining how to perform the week's experiments.\r\n\r\nI didn't like how the course was barely engaging. I didn't think about lab except for when I had to complete the lab reports and the day before lab when I had to study for the quiz. I think it'd be better to perform labs in tandem with the course material of CHEM161 aka Gen Chem.\r\n\r\nAlso, the way the reports are grades definitely vary depending on the TA. There were many times I got points off for certain errors in lab report and not in another, but the points seem too inconsequential to warrant an email or setting up an appointment with Dr.G. I would reply on Gradescope to the comments on where points are taken off, but receive no response. I feel that having the TA respond aptly would benefit both the student and TA, by letting the student know what he\/she did wrong better or explain his\/her reasoning.\r\n\r\nI also wish there were TAs specifically for lab, so that we can go to him\/her before the experiments to better understand what we're doing instead of carrying out steps listed in the lab manual.\r\n\r\nThe prelab lecture could definitely be shorter or cut out altogether (they basically regurgitate the same info as the manual) and there are already videos on Canvas.",
    "The course helps students with limited lab experience learn to gain essential knowledge for further scientific study. However, the class is very time consuming and the environment is fairly stressful.",
    "no quizzes every week because they were unfair and too hard. also the lab should be decreased by an hour",
    "The course requires a lot of time outside of lab in order to finish assignments, but the lab work itself is very straightforward. The pre-lab lectures are a little long, but they do help to understand the content within the lab.",
    "Learn a lot, but way too much work. Grading is too picky, and grading amongst various TAs was not consistent.",
    "I don't like how rushed some of the experiments are. A lot of the times I didn't feel as engaged as I was just rushing through to get things done. I also think the way the lab reports are graded is unreasonable. The lab reports aren't really graded based on content but based on how well they fit the rubric. A lot of the feedback didn't even make sense to me at times. Usually, they'll just take off points with the reason but with no explanation.",
    "The class was generally pretty good and well set up to explore many introductory chemistry concepts. The only main complaint I have is that some of the lessons were a little longI kind of would have preferred to use that time to do the lab work instead. But it was nice to get to experience the lab work and learn about experimental techniques. I only kind of wish we had chance to talk more about error, experimental methods, and the implications of them.",
    "strengths- short quizzes, thorough lab manuals, Dr. G is available for any assistance\r\nweakness- TF seemed just as confused as us sometimes, grading at the end of the course is kind of confusing",
    "I found this course to be a lot of work outside and class and also to be unnecessarily stressful. The lab reports took hours at least and I did not really feel that I was learning anything of import from doing them.",
    "Lab manual made it easy to follow along, TAs were very helpful",
    "Weaknesses- there should be more information available about how to study for the quizzes and what to expect on them\r\nIt would also be helpful for the rubric to be provided for all of the lab reports, and not just the first few",
    "A strength of this course is that there are a lot of resources for help  Dr. G, TAs, and other students as well. A weakness is that I think the workload of this course is not the workload of a 0.5 credit as I found myself spending a similar amount of time on work in lab compared to my other 1 credit classes.",
    "It always seemed intimidating going into lab because I was always afraid I would be caught doing something wrong even if I spent hours the day before lab preparing. Besides that, I believe the course was a great overall review of AP Chemistry. I wonder if there are more labs pertaining to topics in Chemistry 163.",
    "I dont think there were any weaknesses; the lectures provided a good amount of information as well as allowing at some points for students to collaborate in discussion; the labs also reinforced what I learned. I also appreciated having lab leaders, as my assistant helped me a great deal.",
    "Way too much time and energy for a half credit course. Especially since regardless of how hard you work, many points are taken off for very small errors. In a way it's like they're looking to penalize you for mistakes rather than reward you for what's right.",
    "The grading is pretty brutal. I would get lab reports back after weeks, meaning I would not be aware of the mistakes I made on Lab Report 5 or 6 and I'd make the same mistakes on Report 7 (not knowing that they were mistakes because the feedback came late!). Dr. G does not mess around with grading either. It's not like you'll do really really poorly but the amount of tiny things you get dinged for is frustrating beyond belief.",
    "I felt that this course succeeded in teaching what it was designed to teach. With that said, I thought the lab reports were ridiculous - they took a minimum of six hours every week, and seemed to prioritize the correct number of sigfigs over insights as to what we had accomplished in the lab and actually conducting the experiments correctly.",
    "This course has many weaknesses. The lab reports do not help students learn in the way that feedback is given and grading is done. Information on how to prepare for the quizzes and how to do well on lab reports is limited. The class is very stressful and difficult in a way that does not promote learning at al.",
    "I felt that the lecture portion of the class was a bit too long and unnecessary given that students read the lab manual and provided materials beforehand. The lab itself was very fun and I liked how the teaching fellows were very helpful.",
    "Strengths are that it teaches basic lab skills and how to write lab reports.",
    "The course excels in conditioning students to be extremely rigorous but, especially for Chem163 students, it feels completely disconnected from what we learn in class. It could very easily be a physics or geology lab and I feel like I would have learned the same (or even more) about chemistry than if I took this course. Also, the grading can sometimes be a little unfair - not only because some expectations in the lab report are not made clear, but also because the quiz graders are expecting responses from Chem161 students, who learn the topics in a completely different manner. Furthermore, the quizzes assumed general knowledge on topics that were not covered in 163, and no indication of what we should revise was ever given. This would be fine when dealing with general concepts, but demanding that students remember a formula that was maybe studied in high school freshman physics is unfair, especially when considering that chem161 students usually cover the topics in the same order as the lab.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Dr. G. is definitely one of the strengths of the course. He clearly likes what he teaches and is accessible to every student to work on the methodological approach that is demanded by the class. He is the type of professor that would meet with every single student if he could.",
    "Strength: teaches you the importance of the chemistry you learn in class\r\nWeakness: took much work and little help to prepare for the quizzes other than trying to understand the concepts",
    "The lab quizzes were very difficult and often hard to succeed on. I felt the lab write ups were graded very subjectively as some were graded far more critical than others dependent upon the grader.",
    "This course allowed for a lot of growth and independence in the lab.",
    "It would help a lot if the pre-lab lectures took less time. It is unreasonable to take that long when they kick students out by 5pm if they haven't finished. It would also help if there weren't such pressures to do so much in such little time because students can learn how to do more precise and accurate readings\/measurements e.t.c-- Didn't really see the course making us better scientists, just made us better at finessing and taking shortcuts.",
    "The labs are well-designed and there is lots of instruction and help available to students. The course, at times, is too detail-oriented. Incidents such as taking points off for forgetting to put the year in the date demonstrate this. Also, at times, it felt as if the expectations for the lab report were unclear. I would often get points off for things I did not know we had to include.",
    "One weakness is that the grading can vary so while one grader may accept one certain thing in a lab report, another may penalize it so often times I felt that the guidelines were a bit unclear. The good thing is if you feel like you should have earned points, Dr. G is very understanding and will go over your potential mistakes and correct any errors in grading if you meet with him. A strength would be that while some experiments can be very tedious, other experiments are genuinely fun and interactive to perform.",
    "The strength of this course is the variety of experiments completed to allow for an understand of how to carry out lab procedures. Additionally, the skills learned in writing lab reports was very useful. The course could be improved by making the grading of quizzes and lab reports based more on content and not very minuscule details or memorization. I felt as though when answering quiz questions, many times I understood the lab procedure and processes, but because I had not memorized a very specific detail, I was unable to answer the question completely. Within the lab write-ups, a similar thing was true. I felt as though we were being evaluated for how well we could do significant figures and make graphs versus writing about our conclusions from the lab.",
    "The grading rubrics were incredibly harsh and the outlines were ridiculously specific.",
    "I thought the many of the weekly quizzes were challenging. I didn't know what to study because sometimes the questions were very specific to the lab and sometimes it was all conceptual.",
    "Although I learned some new concepts in lab, it was really similar to the lab class I took in high school for AP chemistry, so it felt a bit redundant, and didn't relate to the concepts I was learning in Chem 163 very much. I think it was more relevant to the Chem 161 course material. The course was fine, just tedious, as is the nature of gen chem lab courses.",
    "Quizzes were hard and class was too much work for 0.5 credits",
    "This course does a good job of teaching students the general principles of chemistry and how to apply those principles themselves, but I feel that lab is a rushed setting in which students are trying to finish and get out of lab rather than understand why they are doing what they are doing. Also, the quizzes are hard to prepare for as the content is \"the lab from last week\" rather than a set learning topic or chapter.",
    "It required a lot more than .5 credit work with all of the quizzes and lab reports. The grading for the lab reports were not very clear and I didn't know what I did wrong for some of them.",
    "Strengths: clearly set out expectations, wide range of topics covered, interesting experiments\r\nWeaknesses: Dr. G. is sometimes very harsh when you need help, it takes a while to receive feedback on lab reports, so you make the same mistakes a lot of the time, it doesn't pace well with chem 163, quizzes are really frustrating and seem unnecessary given the understanding required to complete the lab reports",
    "The labs were easy to follow and fun!",
    "Dr. G is strict, but in the way that promotes learning. I think that prelab lectures are very useful and they really help prepare students for entering the lab on lab days.",
    "The lab reports can be bulky and overwhelming sometimes, but they provide a pretty good structure to each of the lessons and concepts associated with them.",
    "Honestly, it was a fine class overall. The pre-lab lectures were helpful and I never was pressed for time to finish an experiment. My only complaint is the excel skills Dr. G expected of us for lab reports. I, for one, am superbly technologically challenged, so that was never fun, no matter how many YouTube tutorials I watched. Even my dad, who is an IT guy who does spreadsheets basically for a living, had so much trouble when I asked him for help with these. It got frustrating.",
    "- lab reports could be a little more structured in terms of expectations and grading requirements",
    "It is very well organized with the lab manuals.",
    "Very difficult course. Grading was very harsh and it was hard to learn from previous quizzes, since we moved so fast.",
    "The grading on lab reports was very inconsistent. Some grading even contradicted what was instructed.",
    "The strengths are the structure allow for a good introduction. The weaknesses would be the occasional monotony of the experiments as well as the sometimes over complicated instructions.",
    "The professor was not good he was not helpful with questions or the material, the course however was engaging and the labs were enjoyable.",
    "I felt like it was sometimes difficult when it didnt have to be. Depending on who graded my reports I could have gotten penalized for very insignificant things (ex: sentence structure in my intro, including a non required graph key).",
    "The strengths are that the people struggle together, creating a camaraderie with your peers, and that you could go to office hours. However, these strengths are heavily outweighed by the weaknesses of the course. First of all, the grading down of the class creates a competitive atmosphere that leads students to view their peers as competitors rather than friends. This led to the first few weeks being very isolating and unfriendly. The grading is also very anal in its approach, especially with the lab reports. Dr. G also is not skilled as a lecturer, covering up the facts with needless jesting.",
    "While the class provided students with a good introduction to basic laboratory procedure and clear expectations when it came to lab reports and quizzes, the expectations for lab notebook sheets were lacking.",
    "The questions on the quizzes and in The lab reports were confusing and not clear clearly stated.",
    "The courses strengths are that there are ample instructions on how to proceed with each lab all of which are very clear.",
    "The lab reports itself take such a long time to complete, which doesn't make sense for a course that is worth .5 credit",
    "Very well taught, reasonable workload, very dedicated and excellent prof and TFs. However, the grading for lab reports seemed to be a little bit inconsistent from grader to grader.",
    "One strength of this course is the slideshows used during pre-lab lecture. I found these slideshows to be essential when understanding the basic steps to be followed within the lab. (The lab manuals were sometimes hard to visualize, so slideshow summaries and the demonstrations that either Dr. G. or my teaching fellow did were very helpful.) However, I struggled to prepare for lab quizzes. It would have been helpful to complete practice problems with Dr. G. during pre-lab lectures. One major weakness of this course is that it is biased toward Chem 161 students. As a Chem 163 student, I found that the concepts covered in lab never corresponded to any topics that we were discussing in Chem 163. When speaking with Chem 161 students, however, I was told that the labs corresponded perfectly with what was being reviewed in Chem 161 lecture. This meant that for many of the topics reviewed in lab quizzes and lab reports, I had to refer back to my knowledge of AP Chemistry from my junior year of high school. As a result, I struggled with the quizzes, and I took longer than average on the lab reports. \"Enrichment\" sessions should be offered for Chem 163 students who need a bit of a review on concepts covered in Chem 161.",
    "The course has a lot of work",
    "Strengths: Most of the labs themselves weren't too bad \/ difficult, and I was able to complete them with minimal error in the lab. The lab manuals and TAs were extremely helpful in the lab, so as to help me and others understand how to complete certain steps of the procedure.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lab reports were too nitty gritty, the grading was tight on the reports, and the quizzes were difficult.",
    "Extremely picky grading.",
    "Strengths are that you learn a lot from doing experiments by yourself. Weaknesses are that the class and its subsequent outside work take an incredible amount of time to complete.",
    "This course is structured very well. A strength of this course is that it fully forces you to learn the material and understand exactly how the laboratory related to chemistry, as there was always a weekly quiz after the lab. A weakness of this course is that there is not a lot of material to prepare you for the quizzes, and the lab reports are graded extremely harshly.",
    "The material isnt taught very well and the labs are sometimes confusing. TAs were very helpful though",
    "Labs were well paced and topics learned matched with what was taught in class.",
    "Dr. G is the best. He's super passionate about the course and all the material he teaches. It was wonderful being taught by him.",
    "dr G is very annoying",
    "The course could be organized better to fit the Chem 161 curriculum. The quizzes were also largely based on memorization, which I found to be pointless.",
    "Strengths- Well organized and engaging \r\nWeakness- a bit much at time and overly strict for no reason",
    "The labs were not very well organized and required a lot of planning beforehand. The quizzes were effective in ensuring that students retained the info gained from doing the lab.",
    "The main strength of this course is that the TAs are very helpful during lab time and always make sure you understand what's going on rather than just rushing you through the lab. The weakness would probably have to be the difficulty of the lab reports in the sense that we didn't really know exactly all the information we needed to put down to get a perfect grade (besides the first 2 lab reports when we were given a rubric).",
    "This course is dramatically weakened by its grading system. The lab reports, sheets, and quizzes are graded very harshly, which in itself is fine. However, the use of a B\/B+ average curve severely undercuts the learning environment by making the class extremely cutthroat and enticing students to work against each other.",
    "Strength: Learn safety procedures thoroughly\r\nWeakness: Difficult to know what information to add and what not to add on lab reports. Large point deductions",
    "The labs were sometimes tedious and the quizzes were difficult. There was no real guidance to the quizzes and Dr. G just told us to study everything. The lab reports were tedious and the rubrics used to grade the reports were so specific that most of the time point were taken off due to formatting or wording error as opposed to actual content error.",
    "The amount of work is unnecessary",
    "This course had very thorough lab manuals and the instructions for the labs were pretty clear.",
    "Some quizzes and lab reports were graded very specifically which I think was a bit unnecessary.",
    "This course, from what I have heard from other students, has improved tremendously. I think they way the course is formatted is pretty good as is.",
    "This course taught me various lab skills. It also aided in making me get a full picture of the chemistry concepts through hands-on experiments.",
    "The class does an excellent job of making sure you know how to run an experiment in the lab however, learning how to write a lab could be strengthened.",
    "This course is more demanding than the chemistry course. Students spend more time on lab reports and studying for lab quizzes than they do in actual chemistry class.",
    "This course was very organized and my TA was very nice and helpful. Weaknesses include how arbitrarily precisely certain lab reports or quizzes were graded  in some cases we never knew when very specific detail would be required or what that very specific detail was.",
    "The strength of this course is that you learn a lot about basic chemistry concepts. The weakness of this course is that it is unnecessarily stressful, as there are many areas to get points off like the meticulous lab reports and the weekly quizzes.",
    "Weaknesses: Grading was very confusing. Lab time felt focused on getting the right results instead of learning.",
    "-great TA!\r\n-very challenging so would have appreciated more tutoring, help outside of class, etc",
    "Some of the labs were very long, so I had to rush through them to finish.",
    "The strengths of this course would be the lab help. Having the TAs to guide us during lab is a great tool that helped me throughout the semester. Also, having the detailed manuals with background and practice questions regarding the topic was extremely useful rather than a plain procedure like most chem labs.  A weakness would be the lab quizzes. Occasionally, the lab quizzes didn't necessarily seem just in terms of grading.",
    "The length of the lab was extremely tedious. I often felt as if I did not know why I was making a certain solution, rather, I was just following the steps on the lab manual.",
    "The class is very specific about grading and will not budge even if there are misunderstandings.",
    "I was truly passionate about listening to the chemistry pre-lab lectures online before coming to class.",
    "The class is not too focused on building new chemistry knowledge as it is with testing the knowledge that you currently have. Additionally, the grading of the lab reports and format of the quizzes quiz you more on your ability to memorize certain detail about a lab rather than testing you about the topics which surround said lab. These are some major weakness in the course.",
    "Strengths: \r\n-In the first few classes, the grading rubrics for lab reports\/lab notebook sheets Dr. G posted were immensely helpful to give a sense of how we are supposed to be producing them;\r\n-The pre-lab lectures were always very helpful in elucidating some procedures that were outlined in the lab manual. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Sometimes expectations for the lab reports were not sufficiently explained, yet points were discounted;\r\n-Workload is very heavy for a class that is only worth half a credit;\r\n-Too many points are discounted for significant figures, and not enough time goes towards emphasizing how to calculate how many are appropriate (in proportion to how much weight is given to them).",
    "Extremely nit picky grading.",
    "Strengths: 1) good introduction to general chemistry topics 2) good structure of lab and lecture\r\nWeaknesses: 1) not good complement to students taken CHEM 163 2) seems to be too detail-oriented in grading\r\n\r\nOverall, I believe this course can be improved if the grading wasn't so strict on labs. Rather, the course should place larger emphasis on general concepts and teaching techniques.",
    "There are many strengths to this course including how interesting the experiments can be, how it complements the material learned in chem lecture, and how we learn to carry out experiments. The faults of this course, however, lie in the workload for a half semester course which, I can argue, is greater than all of my other classes. The amount of time I spent doing the work for this class could have been better spent actually learning about chemistry instead of worry about which little point I would be docked off due to one sigfig out of a hundred correct values. And that is another one of my complaints, everything is graded way to harshly, leaving no room for error in something that, at times, wasn't explained all that clearly.",
    "It is graded extremely tediously",
    "Too tedious, felt like busy work. Resources were given to accomplish all tasks.",
    "Overall, I loved this course. I acknowledge that other students struggled but I feel that it was a fair amount of work and a fair difficulty. I also acknowledge that many people are afraid fo Dr. G, however I think that is highly unreasonable. The grading is done in a very fair way and so are the quizzes. I had to move my lab  date multiple times and Dr. G was very  understanding and helpful.",
    "Dr. G successfully used the Media Library on Canvas and I liked that. Also, he was really helpful and available to discuss anything with the students. However, the different TA's, in my opinion, created a grade imbalance due to their grading and this depended on how picky they were.",
    "Strengths: The instructor explained the subject material and experiments very well. Feedback for experiments was clear. Instructor was always available to meet for any questions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lab manuals are in prose and rather unclear. It would be helpful (and would prevent student errors) if the lab manuals were written in step procedures.",
    "One strength of the course is that it is very possible to be successful if you put effort into completing assignments and reading ahead. Another strength of the course is that the teaching assistants and Dr. G are very helpful in all parts of lab.\r\n\r\nIt could be improved by being a little less harsh on lab report grading as sometimes the point deduction seemed really trivial and for no purpose other than for finding an opportunity to lower someone's score.",
    "Although the meticulous nature of the class was a boon in some cases, overall, the harsh grading made the work seem more focused on the particulars rather than the actual science behind it all. When several points are removed for smaller errors, it makes it difficult to focus on the subject instead of the minutiae. Still the course was strong in that it was a smooth introduction into lab work that may lead many students into other laboratory classes or activities.",
    "There was a lack of help in resources. There was not really any feedback besides logistics. Sometimes I did not really understand why the experiments were happening or what was making the reactions. Maybe if there were office hours with the TA's that would have been helpful because I did like my TA, but I was only able to get help a couple times. A strength was the help from the professor. When I did meet with him, he was very helpful in the course.",
    "a lot of tedious work for a half credit, learned a lot",
    "The course had a lot of assessment which helped in having the students up to date with the material but the coursework was spread between many different topics.",
    "I found that I often felt underprepared for the quizzes despite having studied and practiced extensively. I don't believe that the quizzes were a good reflection of my engagement in the course. I also would prefer it if the grading for labs was more standardized. I also don't believe that the course should be worth half a credit with the current workload.",
    "The strengths of the course was that if you want to do well in the course, you must study and put in the time which is good. The weakness is that the class is graded on a curve which can hurt students.",
    "Because I took Chemistry 163, I had to quickly relearn the material being used in the lab environment because it was based on Chemistry 161 material. I had already learned it in AP Chem, though, so it was not very difficult.",
    "It's very difficult to understand what exactly is expected from notebook pages and lab reports because they stop giving the rubric after a couple of weeks.",
    "Very organized class, large workload, sometimes unclear directions.",
    "Strengths: our TA was really helpful and always tried to keep us engaged. This course helps reinforce what is learned in lecture.\r\nWeaknesses: it was a really stressful course, specially if one has no previous lab experience. The grading rubric is too picky, the lab reports assume previous knowledge and making them results extremely tedious, and the time commitment is huge; given that labs take like 4 hours per week and writing the lab reports take like 2 to 3 hours, plus the time needed to study for pre-lab quizzes (some of which are very hard), I believe this course is too much for just 0.5 credits. Making labs shorter and less harsh and obscure on grading would make this course more manageable and students would be much more motivated (most of the people I talked to despised the course).",
    "This course was very organized and all aid was provided and offered.",
    "Strengths: I was provided with a refresher on basic laboratory techniques and instructed on how to write a successful lab report using the model followed by most scientific publications. The course material also dovetailed nicely with the material taught in chemistry 161, so studying for weekly quizzes was useful for the lab course and my lecture course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course is only worth half a credit but I always spent double (sometimes even triple) the amount of time on reports for this class than I did on assignments for any other course I was taking. This course should be worth a full credit as it meets for more hours a week than a standard course and also requires more of the students with weekly quizzes and lab reports than most other STEM classes at Yale.",
    "This course was very clearly designed to try and adjust students to laboratory procedures but I felt it did so in an unnecessarily convoluted manner. This course could be improved by being more clear about what the expectations are for quizzes and for every aspect of the course. The amount of feedback received was especially frustrating, especially towards the end of the semester, where I had no option but to turn in assignments assuming I was still doing things correctly even though I had not gotten any feedback for weeks.",
    "I felt like there weren't enough support for students who haven't had much chemistry exposure before. There were office hours and emailing Dr. G was very helpful, but it would be nice to have something similar to enrichment or peer tutoring so students can understand exactly what they did in the lab and so they could get explanations from different people because sometimes different explanations click with different students.",
    "A weakness in this course would be in abrupt intensity. A high pressure environment at times made it difficult to be engaged and learn, however once this factor was overcame, lab conduct became relatively standard.",
    "A clearer  explanation of what is expected in the lab reports",
    "The labs are not difficult just terribly tedious and the lab reports take an insane amount of time and detail. You do more work than you learn and you dont learn because you get too lost in the details of getting lab points.",
    "I'd say that the largest strength of this course is that it covers quite a bit of material and techniques in a short amount of time. The biggest weakness for me had to do with the fact that I was taking Chem 163 concurrently, not Chem 161 as most students are, so the material covered in the lab did not at all align with what I was learning in my lecture course. This wasn't a huge dealbreaker, but was sort of annoying in terms of the weekly quizzes, given that they were on material that I hadn't covered since high school or even had never learned before.",
    "The selectiveness of the professor for certain answers without clarifying beforehand that there were specific answers he was looking for.",
    "The course offers multiple avenues to demonstrate proficiency in different areas (in the lab, lab reports and lab quizzes). I appreciated the lack of final exam, however it would be nice to have some kind of review of concepts at the end of the semester through a final lab report, or the chance to gain back points lost on lab reports to prove understanding. There are no methods of gaining back points or performing extra credit, which is frustrating, as the course claims to value understanding over grades, yet there is no way to develop this understanding if there are still questions after grades have been posted. There is no consistency in the grading scale for lab reports which make it difficult to identify where are what components will result in however many points awarded. There is also an obvious difference in the proficiency of the different lab TAs, as some of them are better equipped to answer questions and move students efficiently through a lab, whereas other groups are left to more or less to fend for themselves or ask Drs G or Mioy for assistance. It would be a huge help for the TAs to be better informed about the course structure, and to have more open lines of communication with the students such as office hours.",
    "This class gave me so much stress and anxiety. Everytime  I entered the lab, I would get really anxious and just wanted to leave. A strength I guess is that it was overall well organized. Although I thought it would have been better if it had aligned with general chemistry. A weakness is how useless the labs were honestly. Completing the labs were just very laborious and unnecessarily time consuming. I took on average 6-8 hours to complete each lab which is honestly kind of ridiculous since I didnt learn much from them.  It was difficult to assess what the quizzes were on because many times they were nothing like e practice problems we were given or what we did in the lab.",
    "It helped reinforce concepts learned in chemistry lecture.",
    "Strength: Improves radar for catching mistakes and you could improve precision when completing work\r\n\r\nWeakness: Rubrics for lab reports are not standardized. Students can not see the rubrics for the majority of the semester.",
    "Dr. G's flexibility in office hours was a strength of the course as it provided a much needed resource for me. Some of the content on the weekly quizzes, however, was unreasonable. Particularly, the content on the first quiz because it was not prevalent to chemistry and we were not notified that it would be included on the quiz.",
    "I think the lab reports could be a little less demanding, I would find myself working on it longer than many of my other course that count as a full credit or a 1.5 credit.",
    "The weakness of this course was the whole course. It was horrible. Every aspect of it. Dr.G is terrible, and treats his students horribly. I do not think he views his students as human beings. He gives ten page long lab reports, filled with minute and unclear details. There are so many grammatical errors in his twenty page lab instructions that I could not understand what was going on, ever. There were pages of run on sentences. There should be no reason that my half credit class requires 25 hours of work a week. I have worked in labs before, and I got an A in Chemistry 163. I am not stupid. His course is designed to make students feel extremely stressed out, and pressured. It is a terrible environment in which to learn. When Dr. G ever came near me in lab, my heart would quicken and I would start sweating. I have cried in lab while doing work. \r\n\r\nMoreover, when you need to ask Dr. G a question in order to follow his specific instructions, he is nowhere to be found. Dr. G runs office hours during lab. So if a student is confused (which most of the time, all of us are), Dr.G is not in the lab. I have walked circles in the lab looking for him during lab hours. The TAs also do not know what is going on, so they are not helpful. It is not the TAs's fault, however, that this absurd class is so ridiculous that Chemistry Graduate students cannot understand what Dr.G wants from us. \r\n\r\nThis class has no strengths. It is a train wreck. The only benefit is, as my first year mentor put it \"You gotta learn how to deal with assholes, and this guy [Dr.G] is an asshole.\"",
    "I think the workload was so much for the course that it felt like the course should have been a 1 credit course instead of a half credit. The lab reports especially took so much time and was often stressful to complete. I am glad that they were due every other week and not every week, so spacing out the deadlines to complete the lab reports with plenty of time helped with managing the courseload.",
    "This course helped me understand in more depth the ideas being taught in general chemistry because I was able to discover these ideas and prove them for myself.",
    "The strength of the lab was the interesting lab topics chosen. The weakness of the course was the excessive amount of work that had to be completed.",
    "One of the strengths of the course is that you are forced to conduct many of the experiments independently so you really grasp the practical elements well. One of the weaknesses of the course is the strict grading system that limits creativity and scientific exploration.",
    "I appreciated the pre-lab lectures to give a briefing on what each experiment would cover. It provides extra insight into the workings of each experiment and enhances understanding of the chemistry involved.",
    "The strength of the course is that there are many resources to aid with the lab. Aside from the manual itself, there are also videos on the website that offer deeper insight into the lab of the week so that students know what they need to succeed. The weakness of this course is that it is very strict in its evaluation of lab reports and manuals, which sometimes is so harsh it discourages students from even bothering to correct their errors.",
    "The course is very well structured and goes at a challenging but acceptable pace. It teaches time management and responsibility for getting help for the very difficult lab reports. The professor was very available to help me when I was confused or even if I just wanted to check whether I was doing the right thing on the lab reports. However, the fact that it is only .5 credits is unjust. Because of the work and outside time it requires, I think it should be 1.0 or even 1.5 credits. It is a very challenging course and the lab reports truly take hours to do.",
    "It encourages you to be independent in your learning of the course material and applications in the lab which can be good but also bad if you don't know how to handle this responsibility.",
    "One strength of this course would have to be the level of detail the the professor expects on Lab Reports and In-lab during experiments. While stressful for the majority of time, I've learn to appreciate the finer details of writing a detailed overview of the experiments we carried out, though responding to the questions asked towards the end can be a little daunting. \r\n\r\nSome of the weaknesses that I think this course suffers from would have to be the inconsistent grading. Not only do returned quizzes hold little to no feedback on how students may improve, but they graded lab reports between students are often inconsistent, with some TA's docking or giving out points for specific details while others don't.",
    "What we did in this class was not at all relevant to students in Chem 163, and we were just assumed to have remembered these topics from high school or to figure them out ourselves. The class was clearly geared towards Chem 161 students, leaving me and many of my classmates wondering why we were even there every time we had lab.",
    "The workload was very heavy in comparison to the level of lecture, I wish there was more time for pre-lab lecture to grant a complete understanding of some concepts."

There is much more work to this course than is fitting for a .5 credit workload and it is not worth taking it to fulfill distributional requirements. If you do have to take this course, then try not to worry so much. It's not that bad at the end of the day. There's a lot of work and it is very tedious, but it is certainly manageable. Just try not to take too heavy of a course load when you do take it so that you have time to adjust to it.",
    "I would not discourage a student from taking this course because I think it inherently teaches valuable lessons, especially for a first year.  If anything, it really challenges you to push through difficulty and learn how to manage your time.  That being said, if you don't have at least a little interest in the subject of chemistry or problem-solving in general, I think you may find this course very unenjoyable and your time would be better spent elsewhere.",
    "I think this course is necessary, but it was really not enjoyable at all. The only good thing that came out of this class for me were the friendships I formed. Even then, they were formed mostly out of a mutual struggle and distaste for the class.",
    "If you're prepared to handle the amount of work this class requires (especially with writing lab reports), then you should go ahead and take this class. If you're required to take it, then you don't really have a choice.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in applications of chemistry or if you are on the pre-med track.",
    "This course is good at introducing lab techniques and is a good starter lab for new chemistry students, but the material can be frustrating in the sense that a lot of patience and skill is required to complete the labs efficiently and lab reports and quizzes can pile onto the already 5-hour long class to create a decent workload.",
    "Yes -- I personally really enjoyed lab, as I like the level of organization in the course. That being said, there was a lot that I thought was very difficult about this course.",
    "If they are pre-med or plan to major in Chemistry, then yes. Otherwise, no.",
    "This is not one of the most stimulating classes. Most students take it to fulfill pre-med requirements.",
    "If you have to take it, then you have to...",
    "The only students that take this class have to take it as a pre req, and therefore, hundreds of students will continue to be dissuaded from pursuing STEM because of this class.",
    "No, unless it is necessary do not take this course. There is a lot of work involved and I did not find it that enjoyable.",
    "No, unless you need to.",
    "no because the professor is hard to understand what he wants exactly and no matter what you always get something wrong",
    "If you are STEM and need the course then take it, but if you do not have to take it then don't. The work is not worth the 0.5 credits.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless it is a necessary requirement. For a half credit, this course takes up a lot of time and much of it is frankly not that enjoyable.",
    "I think so, it at least does a good job of introducing some introductory ideas, techniques, and the sort of things you should consider when writing a report.",
    "I would recommend this lab",
    "No I would not recommend this course to another student. I found it to be tedious and time consuming. It did not fuel my love of science and learning and instead stifled it in a stressful working and learning environment.",
    "Yes, good for learning chem lab skills",
    "If it is a requirement",
    "Only those that are required to take lab",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for other students. It is a very good lab course of students in Chemistry 161. However, lab reports and lab sheets are very tedious, and they require very specific things that are not necessarily important or facilitate further learning.",
    "No - but it's a pre req for so many sciences that you have to take. It's so much work and not rewarding at all. My TA's feedback was \"be more careful\" and \"try harder.\" It does not facilitate student learning.",
    "If you're a chemistry major or pre-med, yes.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it, but I would say students considering any STEM major should grin and bear it their freshman fall.",
    "I would recommend this class to students unless they need it for a requirement.",
    "no. people only take the class if its required for their major. super hard for no reason, not a positive learning environment. Cut throat, no one wants to help each other.",
    "Yes, I felt that this lab course properly taught me valuable and necessary lab skills and demonstrated chemical principles well.",
    "It's more of a requirement, but yes I would recommend it.",
    "Not if you don't have to take it, unless you really like lab reports and\/or want to develop a more structured approach to assignments.",
    "No, it includes a lot of time and commitment to the class.",
    "If interested in Pre Med yes.",
    "While this course was stressful, this course was very useful for future experience in the lab.",
    "Only take this if it is required.",
    "I would recommend this course. You're probably taking this course to fulfill requirements anyways. I felt it did a good job of teaching lab skills and the expectations for conduct in a lab. In writing lab reports, I also learned how to present my findings in a clear and organized fashion.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student on the basis that most of the work and techniques are necessary to know if they are planning on pursuing anything in the sciences.",
    "I would recommend this course to another pre-med student because it is necessary to understand chemistry for the future career. If not a pre-med student, I might recommend taking a different lab where you would receive more feedback on chemistry knowledge and not such a sole focus on memorization and significant figures. Nonetheless, I think it is important to learn how to succeed in a variety of learning environments, which was my main takeaway from this class.",
    "I guess if they need it for a pre rec.",
    "I would recommend to take this lab with Chem 161 because the same material is covered in that course.",
    "If I didn't need it for my major, I probably could have done without this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if it is a requirement for their major. Lab for five hours is not ideal for someone who does not need to commit that time.",
    "I would recommend only if they needed to, or if they were taking Chemistry already.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you have to take it. It is a lot of work for only half a credit, and it was very frustrating a lot of the time.",
    "I would recommend this course because it teaches very important skills for further chemistry work.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students interested in science and premed. I recommend that students utilize Dr. G's office hours that he offers practically every day, and engage with the material seriously.",
    "I would recommend this course because it's a useful survey of many of the basic fields of chemistry.  The labs are greatly varied in the topic associated with them and decently interesting to explore some of the different facets of chemistry in a more introductory manner.",
    "This is a pretty necessary course for most STEM majors, and it's good to get familiar with basic lab techniques, so yes, I would recommend taking it.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if it was absolutely necessary. The course is only worth half the credit, but is definitely at the very least equivalent in workload to a whole credit class.",
    "Yes, it is interesting to see how chemistry can be applied to real world situations.",
    "If you must take the course, take it; if not, do not take it.",
    "No.",
    "This course will prepare you in a good way for other labs.",
    "No, this course is not for everyone, the course is very difficult, for only a half credit it is an exorbitant amount of work. The professor was not helpful and did not make the course any easier.",
    "I would definitely NOT recommend this course to another student. If you have to take it, do what you have to but know that it's going to be a rough ride. The workload for this course was more than I did for the actual chemistry class associated with it! The lab reports are more tedious than intellectually challenging. That's what this course is, learning to do the tedious things in order to complete the given task.",
    "If you aren't taking this class as a requirement I would only recommend this class to someone who has a strong passion for basic chemistry. The reports and lab notebook work grow monotonous.",
    "I would most likely not recommend this course. The grading seems quite extra and does not facilitate an environment where people are encouraged to make mistakes or ask questions for the sake of learning. Rather, it promotes a constant stress for the students involved for many times the rubric is not for the sake of learning the concepts.",
    "Not really unless you are required to take it",
    "Yes. If you are taking Gen Chem, this is a great choice to reinforce what you have learned in the lecture. Hands experience on means you remember the things you learn.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. This course is essential for students to get an understanding of basic lab procedures. However, this course is extremely time-consuming. Though it is only half a credit, I often found that this course takes more time than the average one-credit course. Lab reports are extremely specific to small details when it comes to grading, and the analysis required by lab reports is not always explained within the lab or by practice problems. Personally, I came into this course with very limited knowledge regarding online graphs, and I struggled a lot when using different computer programs to form these visuals. In addition, I would warn Chem 163 students that although this lab is necessary, it does not accompany Chem 163 material well. Topics discussed in Chem 163 never correspond with concepts covered in this lab, which makes preparation for lab quizzes and completion of lab reports extra difficult.",
    "Yes; it is essential if you want to solidify what you are learning in lecture",
    "Yes. If you're premed, you have no choice but to take this course. However, its' really not as bad as people make it out to be. If you are able to work efficiently in the lab, you won't be spending too much time there. The lab reports start off very easy, so you are guaranteed to get good grades at the beginning. The professor is helpful in answering your questions about the report for the latter ones, so you should be able to communicate with Dr. G and get it done. If you do your work on time and aren't afraid to ask questions, you will be fine.",
    "Not unless its required.",
    "I would recommend this course to those who want to gain a better understanding of chemistry, as this course works well with the general chemistry lectures. However, keep in mind the course work load.",
    "I would recommend this course to pre-medical students and chemistry majors, or people genuinely interested in doing research as a profession in their future.",
    "Yes.",
    "They should be weary of the lab reports, they are a large time commitment.",
    "youre only taking it if you have to\r\ni recommend being later in the week and working with others, also use the questions at the end of the lab manual to study for quizzes",
    "Yes, if you are taking intro chem.",
    "Its a requirement for most.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student as I believe it is essential to working in a laboratory.",
    "Only if they need the course for their major or if they want to pursue Chem research in their future.",
    "No.",
    "Yes, because it is integral to get beginner chemistry lab experience.",
    "No. Dont take it unless you absolutely need to take it for medical school.",
    "I would not because its way too much work for what you get",
    "For any students who think they are interested in STEM fields I would recommend this course as in introduction to a lab setting",
    "Yes, its a lot of work but teaches you concepts and how to apply them in the lab",
    "Yes, Dr. G is great at explaining chemistry concepts (really enjoyed the lectures!) and I learned a lot.",
    "Yes, I will certainly recommend this course to another student as it effectively teaches chemistry through efficient experiments.",
    "If the had to take lab yes but if they are not required to no because it takes so much time and effort.",
    "I wouldnt recommend this course unless you need it for a requirement",
    "Yes, it's a pretty common prerequisite.",
    "No, but it is required for all pre-medical students.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you must take it for a prerequisite or requirement.",
    "Only if they have to take it, otherwise it is not worth it.",
    "No (I only took it for pre med requirements)",
    "This course is good if youre also taking the general chem class.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to students who want more experience in the lab environment or students who would like to pursue chemistry from a more on hands perspective.",
    "I would only recommend this course if someone needed it to fulfill their major requirements. Otherwise, I would not.",
    "No not unless it is required for them to graduate.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the level of your intellectual development surmounts any experience you will have. I truly loved the friendly people who helped me gain important scientific skills.",
    "I would recommend that you take this class if it is required for your major\/academic pathway in Yale (Eg. pre-med). It seemed to me like this class was one of those that you take just so you can get it over with.",
    "Not unless they need to take this lab as a requirement for their major\/pre-professional track. It is a lot of work for 0.5 credit.",
    "No. Only take it if you have to for premed",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student because the work is very tedious and time-consuming, but it doesn't enrich the learning process very much.",
    "Only if you absolutely need the credit",
    "It is required, but I think lab reports should be shorter for the amount of credits given.",
    "Yes, I think it is important to have lab. Lab is where you get to see your studies pay off, you get to implement your learning. I think that Dr. G keeps his lab in top shape and grades extremely fairly.",
    "It is a core course for students interested in chemistry, so yes.",
    "I would not",
    "I would recommend this course to someone looking to advance further in chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it would give them an opportunity to learn hands-on skills and gain laboratory experience that they may have never had opportunity to participate in. Also, it is very interesting because it enabled me to apply chemistry theory to actual physical experiments and predict what would occur.",
    "Yes, it is a good introduction to lab in college.",
    "I would not recommend the course to other students as it becomes difficult to be passionate about the science when the grading seems much more focused on rewarding those with careful eyes.",
    "I would not recommend this course to other kids. I was honestly stressed so much by this course and I just felt alone. I do not think I learned as much about Chemistry as I wish I did.",
    "yes only if you are required to take it",
    "I would if they were interested in observing chemical reactions and hand an interest in chemistry and hands on learning.",
    "Yes, if the student wanted to be hands on with the education.",
    "Not unless required because it takes as much, if not more time than a normal class despite being only half a credit.",
    "If they are interesting the field of Chemistry, I would recommend this course.",
    "no but you'll likely have to take it anyway",
    "Yes, I think it goes over the basics of chemistry lab well.",
    "If it is necessary for pre requisites, then yes.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students (especially pre-medical students) because this course is a requirement for most medical schools, along with two semesters of General Chemistry. However, the workload of this course and the fact that it is only worth half a credit means that I would not recommend this class to students for whom it is not a requirement of a major or pre-professional track.",
    "This course felt incredibly tedious and formulaic, teaching a manner of operations that only seems relevant for future medical students or students interested in lab work.",
    "It's a lot of work, but it may be worth it if you need it for your major or some other prerequisites.",
    "I would recommend this course to students within the STEM realm, primarily those taking Chemistry, Biology, or Environmental sciences. This is as this lab did at times provide useful information in terms of proper conduct, which could be beneficial in the future.",
    "Unless you are required to take this course for your major or other requirements, do not take it, it is an incredibly high workload for the credit which you earn for it.",
    "not unless its required no point in taking",
    "I wouldn't actively recommend this class if it's not something that you need to take, but if this class is required for a major that you may be interested in, I would definitely take itit wasn't too bad and, being a half credit, could be fit into my schedule and workload pretty easily.",
    "Yes, because the lab practice knowledge was important.",
    "Yes. All in all I learned a lot and truly gained an understanding of the concepts discussed. However, much of that was through personal efforts outside of class, with help from the Dr. G during office hours,",
    "If you want a QR credit, absolutely not. I would only suggest it if you are on the pre-med  track.",
    "I would not recommend this course. You dont learn anything new and it causes a lot of unnecessary stress.",
    "Not unless they have to or have a love for chemistry. The class at times can feel like a burden rather than something I enjoy.",
    "No unless you need to do it",
    "Only if you must take it.",
    "Absolutely not, unless they want to cry a lot.",
    "I only recommend this course if the student needs it to fulfill a pre-med requirement or a prerequisite for their major.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in the sciences, especially one that is a very visual and hands-on learner such as myself. I believe that this course was critical to strengthening my understanding of the ideas of general chemistry 1.",
    "I would not recommend this course due to the copious amounts of busy work that had to be completed.",
    "I would not recommend this to another students unless they are",
    "I would recommend this course for those who need to take it. Since this is a prerequisite course, many will not have the option of choosing whether or not to take this course. However, for those who do, I believe this course is useful in teaching basic chemistry lab skills, if that is a path they wish to pursue further in the future.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. It would supplement the Chemistry 131 lecture, was the lecture better structured and taught.  However, it is not for the faint of heart or unmotivated. This is not an easy lab at all.",
    "I would if you're interested in lab techniques\/ how chemistry is actually practiced.",
    "I'd recommend this course to another student required to take the class due to their major or choice to be Pre-Med. Due to the course's rigor, strict policies, lack of help from TA's outside of class, and inconsistent grading across the spectrum of students, I'd only think students required to take the class should while others should look elsewhere.",
    "No, I would not recommend this class, but if you're Pre-Med, you're stuck with it. The labs took forever to work on and it often felt like you just had to get lucky and use all the keywords Dr. G was looking for (there were often a lot). I would strongly recommend working on labs with other people, as this made it a lot easier and we often caught each other's mistakes. Good luck if you have to take this course...",
    "Yes, invaluable hands on experience offered."
