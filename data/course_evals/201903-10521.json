    "Really good way to learn organic reactions that you can apply in lab.",
    "I learned a lot about different types of reactions, reaction mechanisms, how to control reaction stereochemistry, how subtle changes in reaction conditions (types of metal used, types of base\/solvent used) affect reactions.",
    "This class taught me multiple different reactions for making all sorts of different types of bonds, especially in an asymmetric manner. Topics included: enolate chemistry, additions to carbonyls, cross-coupling, hydrogenation, and much, much more. As a catalysis person who doesn't do synthesis, this was a good exposure to multi-step organic synthesis, especially when stereochemistry was important.",
    "Exposure to synthetic methods as intended for the future practicing organic chemist, supported by mechanistic rationale where appropriate. I also gained an appreciation for stereochemistry and asymmetric reactions, as well as improved ability to imagine and manipulate molecules in three dimensional space.",
    "This class is very much a continuation of Orgo 2.  It is just a lot of reactions to memorize.  Needless to say, these reactions are very useful and fundamental to know.  These reactions are always stereo or regioselective unlike in Orgo 2."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "You learn really great information in this course! The information could be taught a little slower thought as it can seem like an overload of information.",
    "This course covers a lot of material fairly quickly. An optional section with bonus practice problems would have been appreciated to improve absorption of this high volume of material.",
    "went through a LOT of content - hard to put everything together in the end in a coherent way. maybe a review session?",
    "Hundreds of reactions to know. Yes, HUNDREDS. Most have some logic to them but some just require some element of memorization to get through it, especially if you have limited time to focus on this class. Luckily, the course is entirely fair and Ellman teaches it well. Provided you understand the principles, have memorized the reactions, and are decent at multi-step synthesis, this should be an easy B+\/A-\/A. One weakness is the sheer volume, but that is the price one pays to get good at organic chemistry. I think Ellman needs to grade undergrads and graduate students separately, as he chose not to this semester. This can be an issue because many 1st and 2nd year graduate students here have multiple years of synthetic chemistry research and often have taken a class like this in undergrad. For a course based on exposure more than anything else, this puts them at a huge advantage over undergrads who might be exposed to this a first time. He said the majority would get A\/A-, but when the average graduate student does much better than the average undergrad, you can see where some issues can arise for undergrads who. In addition, I think the class time was often a \"reaction vomit\" format. Textbooks weren't used, but I think having more accessible notes than just primary literature and Myers notes would be convenient.",
    "This course achieved most, if not all, that it advertised, in providing a survey of synthetic methods at an appropriate level of detail. I particularly appreciated the emphasis on practicality and usability - quite unlike other courses I have taken, I thought that the syllabus was fundamentally shaped by what Prof. Ellman thought to be useful for practicing chemists, rather than for purely academic exposition. The extra resources provided were highly useful and supplemented the topics covered in class.\r\n\r\nIf anything, I would have liked a lecture or two on nitrogen chemistry, but there was simply too much that could be covered in one semester.",
    "I wish there was more of a support system for this class.  I would have liked a section.  It's tough to get all the material when it is so advanced and there is no textbook."

   "comments": [
    "Great if you work in an organic lab.",
    "If you are considering working in any sort of organic chemistry field, I would strongly recommend this course as a basis for a variety of reactions, theory, and retrosynthetic analysis. As an undergraduate, be prepared to put in a lot of effort in this course, as this was the hardest chemistry elective Ive taken thus far, although very well taught.",
    "Yes, Ellman is a wonderful professor and super nice! The content is a LOT but you will also learn a LOT and have a much better grasp of synthetic organic chemistry.",
    "Are you looking to go to graduate school in organic chemistry, catalysis, or chemical biology? Then I'm 105% sure you should take this course. A lot of the issues in this course are related to the subject material itself and not the nature of the class.\r\nThis is the course which pushes you from the 1 step reactions from intro organic into things which resemble how real organic chemistry research takes place.  I was shocked at the complexity of molecules I could easily work to by the end of the course. This will be extremely useful going forward for my general understanding of organic chemistry. BE WARNED- the course it not easy due to the sheer volume of learning and the grading isn't trivial. EVERY reaction condition is fair game, and if you miss those particular reaction conditions for the exam, you will lose those points.",
    "Definitely, if one is interested in organic chemistry. This course stood out in my experience of learning organic chemistry at Yale, in equipping me directly with tools that could be applied in my future work.",
    "This is a really great course for chemistry majors who are interested in organic chemistry and beyond. It is memorization heavy in some respects, and definitely pushes you to apply your intuition and knowledge to more complex chemical problems. I fully enjoyed the course, but it was definitely a little overwhelming when it came to the exams because of how much information there is. Ellman is an amazing professor and he really does his best to facilitate teaching. Highly rec.",
    "Only take this if you want to go into synthetic chemistry.  There should be no other reason."
