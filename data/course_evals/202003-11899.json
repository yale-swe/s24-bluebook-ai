A lot of literature examples were shown too, which was good for gaining experience reasing such texts.",

                "The strength was the TA. He was really nice and helpful. There were often a lot of papers assigned and It would have been better if instead of discussing those papers we had actually covered more of the fundamentals. The material also needs to be covered more slowly as the contents of a 75 minute lecture were often rushed into 55 or 60 minutes.",
                "The examples used for the concepts can be unclear, particularly when they involve very large organic molecules. The course also does seem to depend a lot on knowing and having the intuition to build reaction mechanisms, which makes it more difficult for undergraduates. I think the course could benefit from teaching these mechanisms, particularly to undergraduates.",
                "Professor Miller is an enchanting lecturer who introduces topics that he finds fascinating - his excitement makes it easy to get excited about the material. However, I'd often have to rewatch lecture once or even twice at a slower speed to be able to conceptualize everything (and then I'd be blown away by how cool it is!). There is not a ton of time to process as lecture happens. Sometimes we would do example problems in lecture - more of this would be helpful, though I know it's difficult for engagement over Zoom. Or even if we took a moment to recap and process what has been introduced periodically throughout the lecture - like the style of recap at the beginning of class. Finally, this is a challenging course, and I wish there was more of an opportunity for hard work to pay off. The psets are graded for completion, and there is not much partial credit given on exams, which can be frustrating. But the psets being graded for completion does eliminate a lot of the stress and competition, which is nice!",
                "This course covered a lot of interesting material, but could have done better at demonstrating the connections between various concepts.",
                "Strengths: very interesting material, good lectures, and many office hours. Also psets graded by completion which is wonderful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none.",
                "This course was an amazing course, largely due to the passion and excitement the professor has for the subject.  The material was presented in such a way to be incredibly interesting, and very up to date examples were given.  The course philosophy was another great strength of the course, especially with respect to problem sets.  The only weakness of the course that I could think of is that perhaps posting answer keys at the same time of the problem sets would promote understanding of the material as proposed PSet answers could be checked immediately in order to understand the intention of questions."

                "Though the lecture was live, it was pretty similar to a recorded lecture because there wasn't much student engagement. Personally, I think the lecture happened so fast that I wasn't able to process enough to be able to participate actively. Professor Miller was mindful of his pace and didn't try to cram in extra material, which I appreciated. Instead of ending lecture early, it would be nice to have more breaks during lecture to process things a bit - these did happen at times and were very helpful! The teaching assistant and professor office hours were also great places to get extra help.",
                "Good avaliability of offics hours and flexibility of the instructor. Also it was good the TA had an ipad to write things on the virtual white board. I don't think we could have gotten through the semester without it."

You may not be stressed out on a weekly basis doing 15 hour psets like in other chem courses (psets are for completion, with TA office hours being very helpful\/needed), but I put a lot of time in outside of psets. I rewatched lecture every week once or twice, and then again before the finals. There's a lot of interesting material to process. The exams are very difficult, and the lack of partial credit can be discouraging. However, I learned a lot and have an incredible theoretical understanding of topics introduced in organic chemistry - it's neat to look back at old things with a new understanding.",
