                "class had interesting readings, and helpful mini-lectures that break them down and bring greater clarity. breakout room discussions in the beginning are also a good chance to hear other people's thoughts. perhaps there could be a way to encourage more student participation and discussion in the latter half of the class time, although the mini-lectures are certainly not a waste of time.",
                "I think its scope could be broadened somewhat beyond just the History of Sexuality, as it might be easier to grasp HS if taught alongside Foucault's other major works. Overall, though, a solid class with a good base of interesting material.",
                "This class is really interesting--it successfully introduces students to a difficult source material before enabling them to engage deeply in its complex issues. One weakness is that the instructor tends to lecture slightly too much for a seminar format.",
                "Strengths: class discussion, readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: occasional lagging in pace",
                "Strengths: Professor de Souza is brilliant and extremely kind and helpful, and did a great job engaging with students' thoughts and facilitating debate over the course of the class. We received extremely detailed feedback on our papers, and the readings were also not too immense, with the syllabus being very well designed. Weaknesses: I think I would have appreciated there being more student contribution and discussion after the first half of the class, since after breakout rooms & sharing our thoughts on an initial prompt, we would enter more of a lecture format."
