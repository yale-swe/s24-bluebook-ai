    "Strengths: interesting readings, well rounded syllabus, engaged professor. Weaknesses: poorly engaged students. Even though we had to submit weekly reading questions, it was clear that not everyone did the readings, which really hampers discussion in a small class. Not the professors fault though, I would say. But discussion was lackluster and disappointing considering the interesting material. Exacerbated by the small class size.",
    "Great readings, great topics, great field trips-- more background needed for this class though in terms of history of science, which I did not have, which makes the class more fun and exciting but it might help for class discussion"

    "Yes, I would recommend this course 100%! You learn so much about the history and development of laboratory spaces; if you're a science major or have any interest in learning about the subject with fascinating readings and interesting class discussions, this is the class for you.",
    "Yes I would-- even for STEM students that want to know more about the origins of their workspace, the topics are really interesting and fascinating"
