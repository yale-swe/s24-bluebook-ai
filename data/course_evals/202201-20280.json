The project portion of the class was incredibly engaging - students are put into groups of about four and paired up with mentors to work on a semester long project. You get the chance to engage with a significant medical issue and draft the necessary documents as if you were actually creating medical software. The lecture portion of the class was the provide the necessary information for students to carry out the projects (medical regulations, software design patterns, etc.), however, this portion was not very engaging.",
