    "I developed a much, much better writing ability, as well as a lot of insight into more philosophical takes on beauty.",
    "I learned a lot about writing and we really went into depth about the topic of beauty!",

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course was the small seminar environment of the class, which really helped me to develop myself. Only having 8 people meant everyone had amply opportunity to contribute to the discussion - something I think to be very valuable.\r\nPerhaps one weakness of the course is not having enough guidance for the final paper and also not submitting draft for feedback for it. I have a general understanding of what to do but it makes me uneasy submitting the final paper without receiving feedback on a draft first.",
    "I really enjoyed the course and personally liked the subject matter of it. I feel that it could be improved by spacing out the essays a little bit more because it was often hard to complete all of them.",
    "I liked the discussions to think further about the readings, but I wish we had more of a mix of reading material!",
    "It was strong all around. It had great readings, great class size, great teacher, etc"

    "Yes. The course was a lot of fun and I really liked my class environment. The workload was very easily manageable but was still enough to learn a lot from. It definitely helps to improve writing skills so is very helpful to take during the first semester.",
    "Yes i would definitely recommend it because I really liked Professor Jones and found her to be extremely helpful in bettering my writing ability.",
    "Yes! 100% interesting material, interesting topics and lots of free rein in topic choosing.",
    "Yes! I thought it was very interesting and I learned a lot!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was interesting and fun learning about beauty"
