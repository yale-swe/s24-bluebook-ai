I think it helped a lot to have a weekly one-on-one tutorial, to have oral homework and presentations, and to be able to develop a relationship with my teaching fellow. I also learned a lot about Chinese culture and history."

We only wrote two short (one- to two-page) papers over the semester and they were in mostly informal style.",
                "The strength of this course was emphasis on learning vocabulary, and constant reinforcement of it through homework and in class. I also thought Sun Laoshi brought a really engaging, positive energy to the class. I think this class could have more of a focus on naturally speaking in class. Towards the middle of the semester, there was more emphasis on this, and it improved the class.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Chuanmei Sun, oral focus, speed through material, open-endedness of assignments, emphasis on classroom interaction over individual assessment\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: even at Level 5, greater focus in class on grammar/vocabulary usage than expressing one's own opinions on the subject matter (could be improved by including more debate-style or Socratic seminar-style discussion); widely varied level of engagement across students (could be improved by starting class with a check-in from each student, or requiring every student to participate in discussions); very little work and then a lot of assignments clustered around midterm and final"

                "This is probably the best way to learn Mandarin in the world, other than in China. Everything is tuned to get us to improve as fast as possible. Because of that it's a lot of work, sometimes almost every day of the week.",
                "Yes, it is a great way to increase vocabulary and oral fluency. But, if you're looking for a course to help with writing, this might not be the right one.",
                "Yes. As it was my first Chinese class at Yale, it took a little time for me to get used to, but once I did I realized how much I was learning. I genuinely feel like I made a lot of progress throughout the term.",
                "Yes, in the sense that I would recommend it as a required stepping stone to Chinese elective courses. I sometimes felt that while I love the Chinese language and its literatures, I felt bored with the subject matter and our relatively shallow engagement with it. For example, I had what was probably my fifth unit on \"the status of women\" throughout my time studying Chinese, and this one was more superficial and less nuanced than those I had had even in high school. I wish we could discuss more contemporary and potentially controversial issues of Chinese society, including Taiwanese and/or Hong Kong independence, detention of Uyghur Muslims, suppression of free speech, etc. I realize it might be awkward for the professor, but I feel the questionable status of the current Chinese regime is an elephant in the room in Chinese classes, especially for those of us hoping to study abroad in China.",
                "Absolutely. It was incredibly helpful in both maintaining my grasp of the Chinese language as well as improving it. Sun laoshi is also an amazing teacher and created a really awesome learning environment."
