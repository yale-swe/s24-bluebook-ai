                "The course was an excellent survey of five centuries of Brazilian history from the colonization of Brazil by the Portuguese to the contemporary politics of Bolsonaro. The material emphasized the politics of race, class, religion, militarism, and other themes central to Brazilian history.",
                "I learned a great deal about the history of Brazil - from the colonial period to modernity.",
                "An awesome overlook into Brazil",

                "Brazil",
                "I learned a lot about the development of Brazil, from early contact to the present. It also helped me better understand ideas of European colonization, commodity trade, and the concept of race not only in Brazil but also in the Americas. Learned about transitions of power, revolts, authoritarianism, populist movement, and the role of the military. Brazil is especially interesting when compared and contrasted to the United States, which was done in Class, and helped me understand both Brazilian and American History better.",

                "The lectures were a bit boring :( I found it really hard to stay engaged. Plus the \"IDs\" on the slides weren't really a helpful guide for following along.",
                "Professor Schwartz is a great lecturer - he cares a lot and is truly a world expert.",
                "It was great",
                "covers a lot of material, but at the expense of diving deeply into any one subject. wish more time was spent on the 20th century, brazilian culture",
                "Good slides, sometimes hard to quote rhen",
                "Discussion and Lecture were off sync almost all semester, which wasn't a huge deal but could be improved.",
                "Professor Schwartz was very thorough in explaining Brazil's colonial age, but in turn the lectures and material from the period from 1900 to the present felt a bit rushed.",
                "Strengths: As usual for a Yale history course, the greatest strength is the quality of the instructors. Prof. Schwartz was an engaging lecturer with a great sense of humor. Mariana was a great TF, providing good feedback on paper ideas. She was also very approachable and was very understanding of students' concerns when they arose.",
                "Strengths: The structure of the course works. Sections were well facilitated, and resources provided were well organized. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The professor uses outdated at best terminology, speaks very trivially about indigenous genocide and enslavement in Brazil.\r\nHis presentations were okay. The material of the course is so skewed toward learning about politics and economics rather than a comprehensive, including social, history of the country.",
                "Strengths:\r\nEngaging Lectures disseminated a complicated history into an accessible narrative. \r\nWeaknesses:\r\nProfessor was not very available\/accessible. which I think is a shame because there are so few courses on Latin American history. Wish I received feedback on my writing from the Professor. All feedback (on midterm, paper proposal) was from the (very talented) TA."

                "Yes. The course is an extremely straightforward and no-nonsense history course, but it is worth taking if you have any interest in Latin American history.",
                "Not really. It was a super broad survey of Brazilian history, and was a bit boring. Plus, a lot of the readings were quite dated.",
                "Absolutely! A great and easy history class that was really interesting.",
                "Yes; the class is super interesting and lectures are great. The workload is very manageable but kind of backloaded, which made things tough during finals. Prof Schwartz made the lectures flow well and it was more like listening to a story than just hearing facts. We did spend a lot more time on early precolonial history and kind of rushed the modern era, which I personally didnt love.",
                "Yes 1000%!",
                "not going to blow your mind, but interesting and prof schwartz is worth taking a class with",
                "Yes",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! You will not only learn about Brazilian history, but also how to work with primary source documents and how to approach history research in general.",
                "No way! For a class called \"History of Brazil\" I personally would have appreciated hearing from a Brazilian professor, TF, or even guest lecturer. Beyond this, the professor used terms like \"Indians\" to refer to native people in a way it felt like he did not have the right to do. He similarly spoke trivially about enslavement and often discussed slavery only in terms of economics which made me uncomfortable. \r\nThis is the kind of history class that all the wrong history majors take, sorry! If you are interested in an intellectually engaging history of an incredibly diverse and substantive country, people, and culture, you are out of luck with this class!",
