    "This is an incredible survey course of intellectual history. We started with Enlightenment\/Romanticism thinkers, then went through Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Bergson, Lenin, Freud, Avant Garde thinkers, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Frankfurt School, Arendt, de Beauvoir, Levinas, Kolakowski and Kosik, Girard, Foucault, Derrida, and ended with concluding lectures. Each class takes you through a thinker or a movement within intellectual history",
    "I just feel like it made me a much more well rounded thinker",
    "I learned more in 50 minutes twice a week than I knew was HUMANLY POSSIBLE",
    "I learned about the story and spread of European intellectual history since the Enlightenment, but mostly in the 20th century. I gained a lot of confidence reading these authors.",
    "This class did an amazing job offering a survey of European intellectual history, beginning with Hegel and ending with postmodernism. Obviously, to truly understand any of these thinkers much more time is required, but I do think I achieved a relatively good cursory understanding.\r\nIt was also really cool to see how ideas that were major themes in this course came up in my other classes. I began to see the ideas in everything I read, or in random everyday conversations.",
    "I learned so much about the development of philosophy and history in the 19th and 20th centuries.",
    "I gained a new understanding and appreciation for how different philosophical movements have shaped history and modern thought.",
    "Broad understanding of movements in western thought over the past 200 years, strong introduction to prominent European philosophers",
    "I learned not only about different influential thinkers ideas about meaning and the world, but also how each of these ideas related to the other, and how each was motivated by and situated within history. Won't lie, I also learned a ton about myself in the process.",
    "Fabulous class that had such a great survey of readings. All of the lectures were very engaging and, even though it was a survey course, the lectures were really well structured to tie together the material and course themes.",
    "Knowledge about philosophy in modernity and its relationship with historical trends\r\nThe mindset to study philosophy in terms of historical development",
    "The philosophical idea of a ton of European intellectuals since Nietzsche and the historical context in which they developed these ideas.",
    "A cursory overview of various thinkers starting with the enlightenment and with a heavy emphasis on modernists.",
    "This was a good overview of European thinkers and philosophical thought, especially for someone that knew nothing about philosophy.",
    "I learned the historical trajectory of European intellectual thought from the Enlightenment all the way to the time of \"post-Totalitarianism\" in the Communist regimes of the late 1900s. Basically, we spent 1 lecture on each philosopher, which included people like Hegel, Nietzsche, Marx, Bergson, Husserl, Heidegger, Freud, Sartre, and so many more. We went in chronological order, starting from the Enlightenment, so we learned how each thinker's ideas developed from and related to the ideas of the thinkers that came before him as well as how they were influenced by the current state of society.",
    "Learned about broad themes in European intellectual history, and gained an understanding of key thinkers and philosophers of modernity",
    "I learned how to think critically about philosophy.",
    "This may be one of the most impactful classes I have taken at Yale. I learned so much about European philosophy, but the intellectual history angle made it seem to matter in a really pressing, human way. It made me reflect on what philosophy is for, what is at stake if we let go of truth, and gave me a new idol in Vaclav Havel.",
    "As a STEM major, I thought this was an excellent way to put on a different intellectual hat for a semester and learn about the world in a fun, new way. Marci Shore is an incredible lecturer, and I found myself looking forward to each and every class. She summarizes the ideas of big thinkers quite succinctly and makes all of the information digestible. Fascinating way to look at the world, and 15\/10 would recommend this class!!",
    "I'm a senior and this is the best course I've taken at Yale! Marci Shore makes intellectual history FUN and so interesting. This should be required for anyone who wants to study the humanities!",
    "I learned about the historical development of European thought, particularly with reference to subjectivity\/objectivity, freedom\/responsibility, and totalitarianism.",
    "I understand the ideological currents of our times so much better. The course made thinkers who seem so unintelligible and far-removed approachable and incredibly relevant to our current world.",
    "This course is a mile wide and a foot deep - because we are focused on so many different authors and spending a lot of time about the historical context of each writer, you really only get the main idea or two from each thinker. But it all happens in such an entertaining package!",
    "Professor Shore helps you make connections between thinkers that give the entire syllabus context and import. I started seeing through-lines between the different philosophical projects by the end that helped tie everything to everything else. I really came away from the course feeling satisfied and knowledgeable about european intellectual thought from the 20th century.",
    "This course was extremely interesting and intellectually engaging while keeping intensity and workload very comfortable.",
    "I learned so much! This class genuinely reframed how I think about crucial aspects of life.",
    "One of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. An amazing overview of key philosophers told in an engaging and moving format.",
    "An overall notion of the flow of ideas in europe water Nietzsche.",
    "I learned to think about Europe's key philosophers from Nietzsche onward in dialogue with each other and within their historical context.",
    "an in depth overview of the main thinkers and philosophies of europe over the past 300 so years. Really great baseline knowledge that makes other philosophical spaces less intimidating to engage with.",
    "It was a great intro to intellectual history in Europe and the history and ideologies from which philosophers emerged",
    "Broad ideas in the currents of European intellectual history since the 1800s. Learnt to think and articulate ideas; link concepts together and have a big picture view of ideas.",
    "I learned a ton about the broad trajectory of European intellectual history, as well as a lot about the many thinkers that we covered in the class. I also got to practice writing philosophy-type papers, and participating in philosophical and historical discussions.",
    "A broad appreciation of how philosophical ideas have developed in Europe",
    "Most importantly, the class allowed me to view 20th-century history through a different lens than what is taught traditionally in history classes. We now looked at major events, specifically the rise of totalitarian regimes, through the writings of great thinkers. It really helped to provide an explanation to the forces that helped men like Hitler and Stalin gain power.",
    "I didn't really develop any skills, but I liked gaining the insight of where my intellectual efforts might fall in the heritage of intellectualism. That was cool. I gained a LOT of knowledge about European intellectuals over hundreds of years leading up to thought today, and a viewpoint on the broad arcs of intellectual history.",
    "Learned about the most influential thinkers in modern Western philosophy and about the biggest schools of thoughts in modern Western philosophy. Cool thoughts that are existentially thought-provoking.",
    "Good foundation on the most influential philosophers in Europe in the 19th and 20th century. Broad overview of each thinker and how they relate to each other.",
    "I learned so much about all the different philosophers we studied. I am able to talk about major intellectual thinkers from Hegel to Heidegger with ease and great enjoyment.",
    "How to integrate my knowledge of philosophers and thinkers with their historical context",
    "historical perspective on the major tenets of 18th-20th century philosophical thought--especially surrounding Stalinism and the second world war. The course covered philosophers from many different subjects and a great reading list; favorites being, Hegel, Heidegger, Dostoevsky, Havel, and Arendt.",
    "I learned so much about European intellectual history and the modern history of philosophy. I learned how to place thinkers in dialogue with each other, and I learned how various themes have played out through various thinkers over 150 years.",
    "I got significantly better acquainted with the European intellectual history of the 20th centuries which I found fascinating and which informed my understanding of the contemporary world.",
    "I learned about intellectual philosophical thought in Europe--the thinking of many philosophers, how they were connected, and how they were tied into the history of the time. I learned how philosophy and history are tightly linked and how many philosophers in Europe built upon each other's thoughts.",
    "I finally understand big trends in philosophy and intellectual thought! It's given me a better understanding of how our trends of thought now have been shaped by previous ideas. Also, now when people are being pretentious and talking about Hegel or post-structuralism, I actually know what they're saying.",
    "Knowledge of many of the major thinkers and intellectual movements from the enlightenment to now.",
    "It was a good course that taught me the major currents in intellectual history.",
    "Intellectual History Since Nietzsche was an engaging and thought-provoking survey course of European intellectual history. It provided a comprehensive overview of the evolution of influential ideas over the past century, and theory learned was often grounded in historical context. The selected readings provided clear and targeted snapshots of the most important aspects of the frameworks of the various thinkers studied.",
    "Learned so many different philosophical approaches to understanding life, human agency, our place in the world, etc.  Particularly after the nihilistic crisis of meaning left by the death of God",
    "Overview of European intellectual history since Nietzsche cover both historical context of each of the featured thinkers (mostly through lecture) and introduction to their major philosophical ideas (through lecture also, but mostly through readings and section). A fascinating course for those interested in an overview of Western intellectual thought more or less from the Enlightenment onwards.",
    "This course will give you a very interesting perspective on the history of modern European philosophy. It unites the texts you might study in a philosophy course with the methodology of history (that is the definition of intellectual history, but this class does it very well). As such it will allow you to place ideas in their context, trace the continuity of certain concepts and ideas, and ask questions that span several centuries. Even if you have studied Hegel, Nietzsche or Simone de Beauvoir before, this class will help you understand how their respective ideas fit within a great web of intellectual thought.",
    "We learned about the main ideas and schools of thought throughout history starting with the Enlightenment. We learned about the history surrounding the theories and ideas, and acquired the tools to talk about them.",
    "I learned an enormous amount about intellectual history.",
    "I gained a broad overview of Intellectual History from the dawn of the Enlightenment period until the ostensibly \"post-modern\" period.",
    "I gained both a broad and more specific understanding of the movements of intellectual thought in Europe after the rise of atheistic inclinations in philosophy (Nietzsche's God is dead). Professor Shore is an excellent lecturer, and brought to life key ideas and continual themes throughout each thinker  I've learnt to recognize and appreciate the influences these thinkers had on each other, and the rough \"periods\" that intellectual history could be segmented into since the Enlightenment. Ultimately, this survey course offers  through introduction of various thinkers and their thoughts  several possible responses to the notion that God is dead; this was a valuable takeaway for me as I confront my personal journey.",
    "I learned so much about European intellectual history. What does this actually mean? I can now speak thoughtfully about thinkers like Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Sartre, Heidegger, Arendt, and the like. All these famous last names will become apart of your vocabulary!",
    "How to deeply read, analyze and write about key philosophical thinkers. Also bolstered essay writing skills.",
    "You gain a basic understanding of the evolution of intellectual thought in Europe through the 19th and 20th centuries. You learn how the major thinkers from these eras were in dialogue with one another, and how their ideas were related to the time periods and places in which their thinkers lived.",
    "Though the title suggests the class starts from Nietzsche, the course roughly covered major thinkers since the Enlightenment.",
    "I developed a broad understanding of the intellectual history and philosophers covered in the course.",
    "Pretty strong overview of intellectual history, how to think about major philosophical trends and how they relate to history and our lives today",
    "This course was a great survey of some of the most important figures across Western thought. You get a sense of the vague biography of each thinker and the contribution they made to the discipline of philosophy (and other disciplines, including psychology and government).",
    "I learned so much about European philosophy, starting from the Enlightenment and ending with post-modernism.",
    "General understanding of recent philosophical thought since the Enlightenment. It familiarized me with key players and names I would otherwise have always wondered about.  Such a good class to provide fundamental understanding of important intellectual thought. I feel like I worked my brain in a good way and prepared myself for dinner conversations to come :)",
    "Learned about intellectual thought in the 1800s and 1900s, how to better read and think more critically about philosophical texts",
    "I learned so much about intellectual European history. My knowledge of philosophical trends in Europe has been so expanded. Im considering being a history major after this course",
    "This course provides a glimpse into European intellectual history by going through major ideas developed by relevant thinkers. Learning the transition from Modernism to Post-Modernism was intellectually rewarding. It was a highlight of my semester.",
    "Wow, I learned SO MUCH, even as a senior, about intellectual history. Existentialists. Phenomenologists. Existentialist Phenomonologists. Critical Theory. Social Theory. I have such a better framework for understanding literally every other theoretical work I have read and will read.",
    "I learned a great deal about European intellectuals and the historical context in which they existed.",
    "I learned all about different thinkers and their relationships in history. I have found the knowledge to be supremely useful-- and has come up a lot since taking the class.",
    "I learned about European intellectual history and the works of major intellectual thinkers."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: lectures are amazingengaging and fascinating. I have never seen Yale students attend every single lecture the way they did for Professor Marci Shore. Furthermore, my TA (Nishin) was the best TA I've ever had at Yale. I went to his office hours almost every week and he helped guide me through the main ideas of each thinker. This was the first course I've taken in this subject, but I did not feel disadvantaged at all\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the midterm and final did require a lot of studying, just because there are so many terms\/quotes on the sheets that Professor Shore hands out. Perhaps there could be condensed sheets for exam studying, but you can also just use your discretion to figure out which are most important",
    "Marci Shore is a rockstar and her lecturing is a huge strength",
    "NO WEAKNESS. ALL STRENGTH. TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS TAAKE THIS CLASS",
    "The strength is Marci Shore! She has such an incredible way of narrowing down and discussing philosophical concepts that they really make sense and make sense within the biographies of their authors and their times.",
    "The course is SO interesting. The material is so robust, and Prof's Shore's lectures are gripping. The readings are good. You don't have to do them, but you will get so much out of them if you do!",
    "Best lecture I've ever taken. Reasonable assessments, engaging section, and lots of freedom with the paper. No improvements.",
    "This course should probably be renamed \"European Intellectual History since Hegel\"",
    "This course is incredible. Professor Shore is beyond incredible. Her lectures, frankly speaking, consistently leave one shook.",
    "Incredible material, incredible instructor.\r\n\r\nOnly weaknesses were it would be helpful to have a bit more information and guidance for the paper - we only really got this information a few days before Thanksgiving break and it was due just over a week later. I would also love to read more work from each thinker (for example we left out a lot of Kant's moral philosophy) but of course this is a survey lecture so might not be feasible!",
    "strength: very interesting narrative to combine history with philosophical thinking\r\nweakness: sometimes class did not get to the handout concepts",
    "Strength: the materials are incredibly interesting and prof Shore's improvisation makes it even more engaging. If you have the curiosity of knowing what the important ideas that influenced humanity in the modern era are, you will enjoy the lecture very much.\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes the key words on the handouts, which are tested as ID questions on the exam, are not sufficiently covered, partly because she talks quite fast and we don't have time to jot down everything. She doesn't write on the board, so you have to try very hard to take notes.",
    "I was not a fan of the lecture style, but this may be more a result of the nature of the field (history as opposed to philosophy) than any shortcomings of the course. Lectures are generally fun, interesting bios of the thinkers, but this comes at the cost of a superficial discussion of their thoughts. It seemed that some thinkers' complex work was communicated in such a way that accessibility and catchy-ness came first, actual thought came second. Sections and readings made up for this, if taken seriously.",
    "Strengths: Marci Shore gives incredible lectures. The material is interesting and well organized in terms of lectures and readings throughout the course.\r\nWeaknesses: The paper. There was no official prompt and I felt very confused because my TA didn't read drafts. I thought I was taking a history course but it was definitely supposed to be a philosophy paper.",
    "Strengths: Professor Shore is such an engaging lecturer! She makes philosophy a very accessible subject by explaining the complex ideas of each thinkers in a clear way. Since this is a history course in addition to a philosophy course, we focused a lot on the historical context of each philosopher's ideas (how it is situated in both intellectual history and regular history). Therefore, each lecture was almost told like a story, which made it very intriguing. I personally liked how we only spent 1 lecture on each thinker\/school of thought. This way, we were able to cover so many philosophers, and if you are particularly interested in one, you can go learn about it on your own! It was a great survey course. This was my first philosophy course at Yale, so in my mind, I would rather learn about a variety of different ideas and how they were all connected to one another over time, rather than only focus on a single philosopher for the entire semester. The workload was also very low and manageable. There were weekly readings, which were very interesting, and a final paper due at the end of the semester. My TA was also great. \r\nWeaknesses: None at all! This was an amazing class!!",
    "This course is extremely strong. There is no busywork, and it covers a large amount of material, but everything feels in depth and nuanced. \r\n\r\nThe only improvement I might recommend is focusing a little bit more on certain foundational thinkers, and a little bit less on the revisionists\/applications. For instance, I would've loved multiple lectures on someone like Marx (who has many, many ideas that had widespread influence) and maybe a combination of the Revisionist Marxism lecture with the somewhat similar \"Antipolitics\" lecture.",
    "the content is cool and pretty well thaught. but like the exams-- oof. the content asked on the exams isn't hard, but it just feels like expectations were NEVER set. actively told on the midterm that there will be quotes and foreign terms, yet foreign terms are translated and no quotes to be found. felt like our studying could've been more effective. not to mention that the essay question was misleading enough that several people in my section did pretty poorly. like if someone knows the content pretty well and messes us so badly on a \"very open-ended\" question, the problem is probably the question. just didn't feel super fair; like people were caught out on technicalities rather than knowledge.\r\n\r\nthen we were told that the final would be the exact same format as the midterm, repeatedly. but we got there, and there were a TON of quotes and foreign terms were not translated.",
    "Strengths: Marci Shore is an incredibly engaging professor! She has so much charisma and energy and she was very captivating to listen to. Also, if you want a general overview of European philosophers in the context of European history, this is a good course to take. A lot of \"cocktail party\" material!",
    "There are only strengths. Professor Shore mesmerized us in lecture, and the readings were the perfect length and always keyed in on the most impactful passages of the philosophers. One suggestion I do have would be to add a quiz or another short paper at the beginning of the semester because the final is worth quite a bit.",
    "Marci Shore is without a doubt one of the greatest lecturers at Yale. The TA's are hit or miss; mine was very disorganized, and this made sections feel a bit like a chore, but aside from that I have no complaints.",
    "The only thing I think could be clarified \/ discussed more during the course is the difference between philosophy and intellectual history. I understand that several students suffered on the midterm for not properly providing historical context for certain terms or thinkers, but throughout the course it wasn't clear to me how much emphasis was placed on the historical context versus on the philosophy itself.",
    "Strengths: Professor Shore is a captivating lecturer, and the reading material is diverse and (usually) fun. Section with Clara was also illuminating. Cons: Some readings were tough to get through and didn't add much to the class (e.g. Being and Time). After the midterm, lectures seemed to become more scattershot, and it would have been helpful to have a clearer sense of trajectory. Where does Girard fit into the structuralist\/post-structuralist progression? How is dissident political thought different from existentialism?",
    "Professor Shore is an excellent lecturer. Despite not having a Powerpoint, her lectures are easy-to-follow and interesting! Section helped to clear up any questions we still had about these thinkers and engage with the questions they were asking for ourselves. The readings were well-selected and I enjoyed completing them every week. One incredibly minor weakness is that the course only has one writing assignment. I always think it is better to have a writing assignment midway through the course, even if only 300-500 words, so that the students can get feedback on their writing before the final assignment.",
    "This was by far the best lecture I have attended at Yale in my 4 years. Marci Shore is clear, engaging, passionate, and captivating.",
    "Lectures were a joy, and even section discussions were surprisingly painless. Writing essays for this class is much more enjoyable than cramming for midterms and finals, so I guess I wish the papers had been more important grade-wise and the timed tests less so.",
    "Marci Shore is the best. Do whatever you can to take a class with her. This course was accessible, engaging, low commitment, high reward, and the lectures were incredible.",
    "The only weakness is that the reading and writing load is so low, so if youre looking for an intense class which covers philosophical topics in modernity this course doesnt quite do that.",
    "It's great! Maybe teach Wittgenstein instead of the avant-gardists; I know they're useful for structuralism but I'd argue they're less important.",
    "Strengths of the course is its breadth, its narrative, and its concision. Weakness were the lectures that gave overviews of many philosophers in one period.",
    "It is a really fun lecture to go to and its all interesting material. \r\nSometimes it feels a little fluffy and you wish or more depth.",
    "Professor Shore is an engaging, inspired lecturer who connects philosophy to daily life and contemporaneous history with great skill. The reading list was great. It was exactly what I was looking for in a survey course. I really appreciated how carefully curated the readings were.",
    "No weaknesses. The course is fantastic, best of my yale experience.",
    "Great lecture, my sections were not great",
    "Strengths: ideas are reduced and content simplified to an introductory level; concepts are very interesting and applicable to the real world; midterm was reasonable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Shore speaks too quickly and her lectures are hard to follow, does not use any visual aids to help students to follow her lectures, her email replies are unhelpful and generic; final was tough and the course does not prepare you well for tackling it; difficult to follow for non-humanities majors or people who did not have a background in the historical\/philosophical ideas. I think the instructors should be aware that there are people taking the course who have not had any background in the material and using certain terms without explaining them makes the course very difficult to follow and grasp.",
    "Professor Shore is a great and engaging lecturer! I learned a lot both from her lectures and from sections.",
    "Strength: Marci Shore is an amazing lecturer\r\nWeakness: The second half of the course is a bit disorganized; TFs do not know much more than what is assigned in the course packet.",
    "Particularly looking at the class from a high level when studying for finals, I realized the genius that went into the course structure. Professor Shore artfully links one thinker to the next and through the syllabus shapes a narrative regarding the trajectory of the 19th and 20th centuries.\r\n\r\nI think if Professor Shore had used some visual aids it would have helped in certain instances. As to be expected, many of these concepts were very difficult to wrap my head around in lecture. That being said, putting a picture to a concept certainly doesnt hurt!",
    "The lectures were amazing, though it was easy to get away with not actually doing the readings. Discussion was unhelpful, but more on that later.",
    "The course is a great survey of the basics of modern Western thought. I loved it!",
    "Strengths are Marci's lectures which are absolutely brilliant. She makes even the most boring and convoluted topics sound cool and beautifully lucid. She is a great, great lecturer and a major reason to take this class. Section was not as interesting, unfortunately. It seemed very logistical and specific at times, and we didn't discuss or analyze the readings enough.",
    "Strengths: great lecturer, really interesting material, not too much of a workload, manageable readings \r\nWeaknesses: the quality of this course still really depends on the quality of your TA. My TA did a great job preparing us for the exams, but it was hard to receive feedback, and it sometimes felt like I was just fishing around for whatever my TA was looking for in an assignment rather than explaining the material I had actually learned.",
    "This course is great.",
    "It doesnt cover as many modern thinkers as I would like",
    "Lecture is absolutely phenomenal and prof Shore is great lecturer--a storyteller of great talent and a really fun professor. her lecture style and engagement--especially personal connection with the philosophers and eastern European language and culture--was the biggest strength of the course.  The weakest part of the course however was that the TAs were inconsistent. My TA was great, but many others were not and therefore knowledge of the material, preparation, and grading varied a lot. Throughout the year there was much consternation about this from my classmates. I personally was fine. I enjoyed my TA, but often shared notes or compared insight with other sections.",
    "Every lecture is super engaging. However, I don't like that there are no lecture notes or lecture slides beyond the handouts. Sometimes, Professor Shore would interpret the thinkers in a certain way or provide context for the thinkers that were not available elsewhere (eg. Wikipedia or Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). Many students recorded the audio from the lectures because of this. I didn't, so I felt like I was at a slight disadvantage when I was studying for the final exam. Also, I didn't have any friends in the class, so I found it additionally hard to study for the exam. That being said, the review sessions were helpful.",
    "The lectures were absolutely phenomenal, but the extreme variation between discussion sections (some of which didn't really spend much time discussing) was less than ideal. Because of scheduling conflicts I ended up attending four different sections over the course of my time in the class and the learning experience in some was very different than in others.",
    "I think that the lectures were fascinating and readings were great. Section didn't feel necessary for this course, however--what I learned through lectures and readings were enough, the discussions didn't provide new insights.",
    "I loved the lectures. I honestly didn't do that much of the reading, and I wish I had. I just had too many other heavy reading classes. I'd say a huge strength is the lecture, although it definitely dips in quality during the later part of the semester. The best lectures are the ones that focus on a single thinker, but towards the end of the class they start to get confusing and jumbled, since Shore might be talking about like six different thinkers. My section was really good, but obviously that depends on your TF and the other people in your section. There are so many sections though, so you can probably find one that will really make the class good. Honestly, this class would probably be kind of a bummer if you didn't have a good section to help you understand the reading (because some philosophers seriously suck at writing and their work is super confusing). The lectures are great, but how much you actually learn is really dependent on your TF, since they are the ones that walk you through the texts and give you feedback on your essays. \r\n\r\nOh also, just note that the final is significantly harder than the midterm. For the midterm, the IDs were more just general terms or super famous quotations, but then for the final it was these super specific quotes where we had to identify the year and book and all of that. Basically, actually study for the final even if you did really well on the midterm with minimal effort.",
    "Loved the topic, but the inclusion of some writers like the avant-garde poets at the expense of writers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Arthur Schopenhauer is frustrating. We went over Hegel and Kant's influence on Nietzsche but not Schopenhauer, who was the primary thinker who influenced Nietzsche along with Plato. I think Wittgenstein's exclusion is the most surprising, given that that his work was probably the most influential in the linguistic turn in intellectual thought. I just don't see how you can adequately look critically at Sausuerre (sp?) and Derrida without first reading the Tractatus.",
    "Very few weaknesses. However, I felt we were told to do one thing on the exams but in reality the exams were graded very differently.",
    "Strengths of this course are Marci as a lecturer, and the readings she selects. The main weaknesses were absolutely the tests and sections. The testing was so arbitrary. Grading was not standardized, so one TAs opinion could make or break your grade with little guidance from Marci.",
    "Professor Shore's lectures never failed to captivate the audience. They were detailed, funny and highly informative, often supplemented by very interesting anecdotes. I at times felt as though doing the readings after the lecture would be more conducive to my understanding of the text, seeing as some readings were very dense.",
    "Strengths are the lectures. Marci Shore is incredible and she communicates the ideas so well and everything is so engaging. Can't really think of a weakness, but a few lectures that were about multiple thinkers (as opposed to just one) where sometimes a little complicated to follow.",
    "Professor Marci Shore is an incredible lecturer--you will enjoy and learn something from every lecture if you pay attention, and somehow Professor Shore manages to end every lecture on a mic-drop moment. The readings and work load is manageable. Personally I wish there were reading responses or other more regular assignments to help you stay on top of the readings, but I suppose section served this purpose. The one final paper (due after Thanksgiving break if taught in the fall) is a great way to explore a specific thinker that you were particularly interested in throughout the course.",
    "The lectures were by far the strongest part of the course. They were engaging and interesting and left you thinking about them even hours after the hour had ended. The readings were manageable in length and the sections were useful to better understand the material.",
    "The lectures are very good but the exams do not accurately measure understanding and effort.",
    "The course was definitely intense, as it covered a lot of material and a lot of ground. I appreciated that the essay gave the student an opportunity to investigate a certain topic in depth. The temptation to properly discuss a few ideas is very great, and if anything I would have allocated sections to match interests or perhaps backgrounds of students participating in the course, although I understand that this is logistically difficult.",
    "I thought the broadness of the survey course was an incredible weakness. While obviously every survey course is rather broad in scope, this was especially true with the different philosophical thinkers. Studying multiple thinkers each week led to only a cursory understanding of each.",
    "Professor Shore's lecturing is a major strength of the course, as she manages to clarify difficult to understand philosophies but also brings life to these thinkers by her storytelling and linguistic flair. No major weaknesses!",
    "STRENGTH: Marci is amazing!! Take it for her. For the exams, all you need to know is what she says in lecture WEAKNESSES: Hard to think of any, but the second-semester thinkers were definitely more difficult to understand",
    "Many of the thinkers discussed in this course are some of the most influential people of the last couple centuries, so learning their ideas and reading their texts can be extremely interesting and rewarding. But the survey nature of this course also has a serious downside: reading fifteen pages of a difficult thinker with little other context about their ideas can lead to confusion and little to no real understanding of their philosophy.",
    "Great syllabus and text selections. I would have preferred to have had more close readings, as well as more discussions on the development of the thinkers' philosophies.",
    "I loved this course! There was one or two lecture toward the end that felt less clear, but in general the lectures were incredibly interesting and engaging.",
    "Fantastic course. Strength - manageable and interesting readings, great lectures, good section. Overall a great lecture course.",
    "Professor Shore is a phenomenal storyteller and selects very knowledgeable teaching fellows. Like any survey course, however, we read very little of each thinker and spend a maximum of one lecture on each (though many get even less time than that). It youre trying to do a deep dive, this isnt the course for you, but its great for someone looking for the main ideas (perhaps someone who didnt do DS).",
    "Since the course is a large lecture, it has the inherent drawbacks of a large lecture, but I think theres not much to be improved. The lectures were extremely engaging, and Professor Shore was able to break down all the concepts even for students who had never taken philosophy before.",
    "The lectures are incredible! I was Credit\/Ding the class and still never wanted to miss one. Professor Shore is so dynamic, so knowledgable, and so articulate.\r\n\r\nI did not enjoy section. It felt like a waste of my time and I did not learn anything from spending 15 minutes \"discussing\" these complex and nuanced philosophers.",
    "Strengths were definitely the instructor and my teaching assistant. Both did a good job of weaving various authors together into a coherent story. The lecturer (Marci Shore) is great at explaining difficult philosophical concepts in ways that the students (both those who have a background in philosophy and those who do not) can understand. She also told several memorable anecdotes throughout the semester and is someone who really seems to care about the students.",
    "I thought that the second half of the course was a bit more disorganised due to the number of thinkers focused on in each lecture.",
    "The only weakness is that each lecture was only 50 minutes long, and it felt a bit rushed by the last five minutes. I would love to listen to Professor Shore for 90 minutes straight.",
    "Strengths - Marci shore is such a great lecturer and is great at clarifying really tough concepts and historicizing the thinkers to explain why they felt how they felt. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses  Nothing. I wish we went more in depth, but thus is in the nature of a lecture course. Perhaps the only thing is that Prof. Shore went off on sometimes not super useful tangents about a particular historical story about some of the thinkers when it wasn't particularly helpful or relevant to their theoretical contributions (I was more interested in the theory).",
    "Lectures were very well taught and section yielded interesting discussion.",
    "I personally loved all of the lectures before the midterm. I thought some of the lectures in the second half of the course tried to accomplish too much. I preferred when we focused on one thinker instead of a large group.",
    "The obvious strength of the course is Professor Shore. Her lectures are wonderfully clear, insightful, careful, and passionate, so much so that you feel lucky each and every day to get to learn from her. She makes you care about the thinkers and the movements, as well as asking questions and giving space for you to think for yourself. She is unbelievably smart and witty, she makes jokes, and she really, obviously cares about this course and her students. You will always wish you knew a fraction of what she does, and you will always wish the lectures went a little longer. One small weakness of the class is that section wasn't used very effectively and often felt like a waste of time, though none of that take away from how wonderful Marci Shore is.",
    "The greatest strength of course was the lectures; Professor Shore's lectures were always incredibly informative and engaging. Additionally, I liked how we achieved a lot of breadth in terms of material without feeling like we were moving too quickly, so that you'd have enough background knowledge to delve deeper while still having a solid understanding of the topic as a whole."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student at Yale, in any major. Professor Shore is brillianther lectures are the most engaging that I have experienced at Yale. It does not matter what your major is, take this course. She does not try to trick you on exams, and my TA was fantastic",
    "Yes simply because these thoughts are generally relevant to anyone's life in one way or another.",
    "YESYESYES. NO matter what your interests are you will be so glad you took this course.",
    "It's a popular course, but only as valuable as the effort you put in.",
    "Yes! I think basically anyone should take this class because it teaches you how people have thought about things (but not trying to get you to think in a certain way), see how they write, and talk about them. I'm a senior, and this class worked really well after intro philosophy classes and others along the way because you can always get more from thinkers, and other classes tend to narrow in on a type of philosopher\/critic. On the other hand, it worked really well as an introduction to the subjects for first years I knew, and for non-Humanities field people (good general knowledge, addresses underpinnings of social sciences, fun learning how people thought).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. The workload is manageable. The readings are interesting. It's a great way of being introduced to a whole range of thinkers, and it can help give you a sense of what you might be interested in if you aren't sure yet (like me).\r\nAlso, it's a great blend of history and philosophy. The ideas don't exist in a vacuum.\r\nI also recommend studying in groups. It's a great way to talk through ideas.",
    "YES! Please take this! Not so hard and so amazing to know!",
    "Yes! You will gain a new appreciation for how philosophical movements shaped history and modern thoughts. Wonderfully entertaining and enlightening lecture. Makes complicated ideas very accessible and fun to discuss with peers!",
    "PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE. Whoever you are, you will gain so much from the ideas Professor Shore presents in class. Whether you want this as background for future humanities classes or just as an intellectual challenge, it's worth it. You will also find yourself applying it to your own life; there's no way to leave this class and not think critically about yourself and your place in the world. It's amazing.",
    "Definitely! Marci is a great lecturer and the material is so interesting. She also made it accessible to non-humanities majors so if you are looking for a thought-provoking class (and some good phrases for cocktail party conversation) then this is the perfect class.",
    "Definitely! It's an amazing class especially after PHIL125 and PHIL126, which provides an understanding of philosophy after Kant from an intellectual history perspective, and Prof. Shore is a great storyteller!",
    "Absolutely. \r\n\r\nIf you have taken PHIL 126, intro to modern philosophy, and would like to continue the intellectual journey till the contemporary time, this is THE course. Even if you haven't, it's good to have a basic understanding of the most important intellectual trends in human history.",
    "Yes. The lectures are incredible. That being said, I didn't do as well in the class as I wanted to because there are a lot of ex-DS kids and I HAVE NEVER TAKEN A PHILOSOPHY CLASS OR WRITTEN A PHILOSOPHY PAPER BEFORE. so when that paper came around, and my TA didn't read drafts and no exemplar papers were published, I kinda knew I was screwed. But grade aside I enjoyed the class and my TA was very king and helpful in terms of summarizing and helping us understand the readings.",
    "YES PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS!!! This class is exactly what I expected from Yale when I decided to go here. It was a great survey course that covered the ideas of numerous intellectual thinkers throughout Europe. As a STEM student, I knew nothing about philosophy going in and was a little nervous, but Professor Shore made the subject very straightforward and accessible. I now know about the Hegelian dialectic, MarxismLeninism vs. Revisionist Marxism vs. traditional Marxism, existentialism, structuralism, the long-lasting implications of the Enlightenment and the death of God in Europe - ideas that I would have NEVER learned about on my own. The weekly readings are sometimes confusing\/challenging, but Professor Shore explains the ideas very clearly in class, and it is nice to discuss them during section. Although I am not a philosophy major and do not need this knowledge for my future career, it was so enjoyable to take a class outside of my major, in a subject that I knew nothing about! I found the subject matter and the professor to be incredibly engaging. This is one of those classes where the lectures are such high quality, and the workload is relatively low, so it is a great balance! Please take it!!",
    "Yes! This is most likely the best course I have taken at Yale. Marci Shore is a wonderful lecturer and presents the ideas in an incredibly engaging way.",
    "if they were into conty stuff. i dont think its worth it if interest isnt there.",
    "Yes! Marci Shore is fantastic, the material is super important, and it is a class that seems to attract a lot of none History majors because it is such a friendly environment.",
    "Yes! This is a must take at Yale.",
    "YES!!! Take this class. I cannot emphasize enough how incredible Marci Shore is. Her lectures were absolutely phenomenal, and I loved looking at the world through a new intellectual lens for a semester! It really changes the way that you think about history, and dialogue between people, countries, etc. Don't think twice, just take this course.",
    "YES!!! This is the best class I've taken at Yale!!! This class reminds me why I love studying the humanities \/ philosophy -- for years and years people have been approaching the same questions about being, time, death, power... and it's so wonderful to be in a place where you can study the ways so many brilliant thinkers have asked and answered these questions in their own ways and in different moments of time",
    "I would overall--it's a great overview of European thought between the eighteenth and late-twentieth centuries. Don't expect a super deep dive into the philosophy: the class is more like one-day lectures on an individual\/school of thought, with the readings mainly intended to support what you heard in class rather than to push further. But the paper is fun to write, and the exams are fair overall.",
    "Yes! I wish I had taken this my first-year. It is an excellent foundation through which to understand many of the important ideas of our times. Even as a senior, I found that it filled many gaps in my knowledge and enriched the other classes I was taking alongside it. It prompted me to continue thinking about these questions in my every day life.",
    "YESSSSSSSSSS. BEST CLASS I'VE TAKEN AT YALE. I'd pay so much money to have this class video taped. Honestly, Marci Shore could make a podcast out of this class and probably become a celebrity. The transcript of these lectures would also prob be a best-selle.",
    "Absolutely! The lectures are phenomenally entertaining and informative, and it is hard not to be a fan of the stories Marci tells. The readings can be abstruse, but they aren't really necessary for the class - evaluations only really focus on the top-level ideas of each thinker, as well as the uniting themes that all the writers grapple with. There isn't a ton of in-depth analysis of individual authors, so the workload is pretty light. Overall, a great 5th class.",
    "Yes, this was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale despite it not being very demanding (I did all of the work and it was still the easiest course I've taken).",
    "So good! So good! A masterpiece of a class, put together in such succinct and exciting lectures. Very little reading, but the reading really enriches the class. The subject material is super super good to know, and could not be taught in a better or more understandable way.",
    "I would recommend it, as its intellectual engagement is huge.",
    "This is the best class I've taken in four years at Yale. If you have interest in philosophy and especially if you have limited exposure, you have to take it. The material is so interesting, inspiring, and genuinely relevant. Marci Shore is a spectacular lecturer and she makes class just so good.",
    "Definitely take this course.",
    "yes! its a good course, i feel like i learned a lot and it was very enjoyable learning.",
    "This is a great survey of modern and postmodern European philosophy. Professor Shore is a brilliant lecturer and powerfully shows how philosophy and history drive each other. She makes the great debates (teleology v. subjectivity, Enlightenment v. Romanticism) feel immediate and alive. I loved the class.",
    "Absolutely. This class is a must, regardless of your major or interests. It is FANTASTIC!",
    "Absolutely. Marci Shore is great and you will learn a lot and enjoy learning it",
    "Not if they did not have any background in the relevant ideas, unless they're willing to work doubly hard. The course material is for sure interesting, but the lectures can be hard to follow and inaccessible without background.",
    "Definitely take this!!! Professor Shore is a fantastic lecturer, and this class will fill in gaps in your knowledge you didn't know you had. Take with friends if possible, and enjoy talking about philosophy and the lives of philosophers with them over the course of the semester. Great class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Shore is a deeply engaging lecturer who really knows her stuff, and the course covers a broad swath of thinkers and, if you've never read them, the class provides a great way to get an introduction into what people at cocktail parties or philosophy majors in turtlenecks are talking about. Also some cool people with cool ideas. And some less cool people with less cool ideas, but it's great to learn about them too. Overall, great introductory course to people I probably should've been introduced to ages ago, but glad I got the chance to do so through Shore and my TA (who was also phenomenal, but that feels more up to chance).",
    "Yes. The course material is interesting and thought-provoking.\r\nThe course load is little too.",
    "Absolutely! This class provided me a whole different perspective on 20th-century European history. Furthermore, it made me better understand the role of religion and the problems we continue to face today with the death of God. This class truly has had an impact on how I view the world and I would definitely recommend others to take it as well. The workload is low and the material is definitely accessible for any student, STEM included.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone who's looking to enrich their cultural understanding of intellectual history. The lectures are great, and Professor Shore does a good job of making the potentially lofty concepts discussed actually meaningful to your everyday life\/philosophy. It's more so a philosophy course than a history or anything else course. Think philosophy over time. If that's the kind of thing you want to understand, this is the course for you.",
    "YES! It was definitely one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Shore makes the philosophical material so easy to understand it's incredible. I didn't want to leave Yale not having taken a philosophy course but I thought a pure philosophy course might be too out of my comfort zone so I love that this class situates philosophy in history. Definitely a great lecture to take.",
    "Yes, this is a great course for anyone -- humanities and stem students alike. Lecture is always clear and engaging. If you pay attention and do a couple of the readings, I promise you will learn a lot and have a good time. Take the class!",
    "Yes---it's a nice, well-paced introduction to intellectual history\/philosophy. If you ever felt like you wanted to understand major western philosophical concepts from Enlightenment onward but didn't want to take a philosophy course in which you actually had to analyze and critique said concepts---this is the course for you.",
    "yes. I think every student at Yale will love this course.",
    "Yes!!!!! Marci shore is a fantastic lecturer. Each lesson is strongly interwoven like a narrative and an oral history, and she ends each lecture with a very thought provoking anecdote or Quote from one of our thinkers that has sparked many lunch conversations",
    "Definitely. Engagement with this course is paramount. If you read the work in depth and discuss it at section you will find yourself thinking deeply and understanding history in new ways. i loved this class and the new mental stimulation it provided, though such often comes from personal perogative rather than the pressures of assignments--which holds you accountable for your learning but also allows you to go at your own pace and choose to go deeper into your favorite philosophers or whomever interests you most.",
    "Yes! I learned so much. I'm a cog sci major and I'm already interested in this sort of thing, but it was still definitely out of my normal academic course load. Professor Shore will give you all the juicy gossip on 19th- and 20th-century philosophers. You'll start calling philosophers by their first names and throw around their ideas like it was second nature.",
    "Yes, this course is an indispensable foundation in intellectual history.",
    "Yes, if you want a great broad yet in depth understanding of European historical and philosophical thought, hear engaging and beautifully put together lectures, and be able to have fascinating discussions that extend beyond the classroom about the most important thinkers of the past century, then take this class!",
    "Yes! It's a great survey of western thought. I'm really glad I took this class, especially shortly before I leave Yale, since it felt very quintessential \"Yale\" and super helpful for understanding the world. It's also a nice class to get you thinking. I definitely approach problems differently after reading about how other people have answered the same questions I have. I'd say this class was actually valuable to me as a human being, and not just me as a student. Shore assumes no prior knowledge, so I feel like now I have a good grasp on key intellectual ideas.",
    "Yes! Already have.",
    "This course is a really solid introduction to recent European intellectual history. I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking to gain a deeper understanding of the core questions that have animated European thinkers over the past several centuries. Even for people who've already taken philosophy or intellectual history courses that count some of the thinkers covered in Intellectual History Since Nietzsche, the class does a really good job of filling in blanks and helping you make connections across thinkers.",
    "Most definitely",
    "Be careful with a TA. Its a good class, but you can really get screwed if you get a bad TA. Shop wisely.",
    "I would unequivocally recommend this course to other students, majors and non-majors alike. It will leave you with more questions than answers, and provides a robust foundation for understanding the systems of thought that shaped and molded the modern western world.",
    "YES! I see the world differently now. There are so many different schools of thought we learn and all are so eye opening and key for understanding life.  Anyone with an interest in any humanities or social scenes should take this course! It's so useful.",
    "Definitely. This is a great introduction to many important thinkers for anyone interested in academic humanities, and this is a solid choice for a humanities class for any STEM major. I would highly encourage anyone and everyone mildly interested to at least shop the first few lectures.",
    "YES. Should be core curriculum.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is even in the slightest interested in the history of philosophy and intellectual trends. It is truly an amazing course and a once in a lifetime experience.",
    "Yes but only if they credit d the class.",
    "This is a good course to get a basic introduction to some philosophical concepts of pretty important people. I would recommend the course if you are interested in philosophy, otherwise it can get a little dry and hard to follow. If you fall behind on work in this class then it can come back to bite you by the end of the semester. You definitely need to stay engaged with the material in order to do well and follow along with lectures.",
    "YES - everyone should take this course for your own benefit in life",
    "Yes, if he or she is interested in intellectual history!",
    "No.",
    "Definitely! This course is one of the must-takes at Yale, regardless of what major you're coming from. On one hand, as Professor Shore opens the class, it's a great way to gain material for cocktail party conversations  but more seriously, it offers a glimpse into the human condition as perceived by society today. How did we get here, what have we sacrificed, and where we might go. This class is also a great follow-up to Directed Studies, as it picks up roughly where DS ends, overlapping a little bit but quickly going beyond the DS syllabus to more modern thinkers like Martin Heidegger, Vaclav Havel, Foucault.",
    "Yes! These thinkers come up everywherethe news and other classesand being able to spot their influence in the world beyond Yale is incredibly worthwhile! All this material is also taught by the living embodiment of sunshine Marci Shore, making this whole course even more worthwhile. She handpicks the most fascinating thinkers and drops them right into our brain. This course is like intellectual candy! Definitely take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to a philosophy major, but not someone majoring in history. This class is MUCH more based on philosophy, and the ideas of these thinkers. There is little to no time spent looked at the historical context of each of these thinkers. Sartre, for example, had an amazing and influential life, yet the course did not cover any of his movements in the U.S., Cuba or France.",
    "If you want a brief overview of many important thinkers, consider taking this course. But you will not gain a deep knowledge of all these philosophers, if any of them. You should consider taking a philosophy course (which this is) and diving deeper into a period or couple of thinkers to gain a better understanding.",
    "Absolutely! Great survey class. I think putting all these thinkers in the context of intellectual history significantly facilitated my understanding of their respective philosophies.",
    "Everyone should take this course. Its so interesting and great information to have.",
    "Absolutely, for any major at Yale. One of the best lectures Yale has to offer.",
    "Yes! This course opened my eyes to the questions that the Western tradition has asked and a broad variety of attempts at answering those questions.",
    "Yes, you learn so much about the course of Western thought since the Enlightenment. I think its a must-take for students at Yale.",
    "Yes!!! It is amazing.",
    "Yes definitely! Whether or not you need a humanities credit, this course is definitely accessible to just about everyone, and I think it teaches important theories that any undergraduate should at least be familiar with. Note that most of the course is weighted towards the two exams, which both require a good amount of memorization, but as long as you are fine with that, you should be able to do relatively well in the course. The course is also backloaded towards the second half of the semester (essay due in the final week of classes + final exam during exam week), which is definitely something to be aware of.",
    "Definitely.",
    "Yes for sure. Professor shore is a wonderful lecturer. It was like listening to a story each class.",
    "Yes, especially if you are new to philosophy\/history. The course is well-structured to provide a general understanding\/overview. Tests and homework are very reasonable.",
    "Absolutely, this course serves wonderfully as an introduction to modern European Intellectual Thought and proves constantly engaging and interesting, largely due to the work and enthusiam of Professor Shore.",
    "Easily the most important class I've taken at Yale, and I'm a senior. I wish I took it as a first year or sophomore. I took DS for a semester and was really frustrated and dejected by the philosophy course I took, so I steered clear of philosophy from then on. However, theory  and particularly the theorists that Prof. Shore highlights  make up the backbone of the humanities and social sciences. Without having a global and chronological timeline of these theorists' work, I was at a loss in many of my classes (even without knowing it). These thinkers are SO IMPORTANT and there is no book that easily takes you from the Enlightenment to modern day (I've looked). Marci Shore is superhuman for her ability to pull them all together in a meaningful and easy-to-understand way.",
    "Yes, the thinkers covered in this class are integral to modern-day thinking. Frameworks through which we understand the world are not born in a vacuum, and thus, it is important to understand where they originate from.",
    "Definitely!! Loved it.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student; it was super interesting and informative."
