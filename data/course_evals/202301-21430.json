                "I learned interview skills as well as gained connections to others in the scholars program. We also spent a bit of time each week in class on a presentation that was led by other students on a topic of their choice, which was great because it allowed me to be exposed to topics I may not have researched otherwise. This class was really good for community building and amazing for an introduction to the Scholars (now intensive cert) program. Working with a senior on their thesis was also a really good insight into where I will be in two years, which is good preparation.",

                "I am walking away with a community of people who are interested in education! I developed great passion from this course, and I learned so much about other aspects of education than those I have already encountered. It made me really excited for the rest of my time in the Education Studies family!",
                "Through a research paper completed as our final, I developed my skills of conducting and writing about education-related research.",
                "I learned how to conduct a fruitful interview, how to use a bank of interviews to develop my own unique argument, and how to situate my argument against a broader literature. I also learned how to felt!",
                "I learned about conducting interviews and writing research papers.",

                "This class truly felt like a community and reminded me why I wanted to join the EDST Scholars program in the first place. I loved learning about different topics in education studies each week from presentations by my peers, chatting together about our passions while drinking hot chocolate, and helping with a fascinating research project. I also learned how to conduct interviews, code qualitative data, and develop a capstone project.",
                "I learned a lot about several different topics in education through the student presentations. The course also allowed me to connect with other Ed Studies scholars and learn even more about the Ed Studies program."

            "comments": [
                "I don't really think there were weaknesses to the course, other than the time slot, but honestly it was a blessing in disguise because it allowed us to be a little bit rowdy and really spark relationships between students along with learning the course material.",
                "Being able to connect with my classmates was really powerful! I loved the presentations because they were so passionate. The assignment did help me get a better understanding of what capstones look like. Although I wish I could have gotten more feedback and guidance from the memos!",
                "The strengths of this course was its workload and the instructor. but its main weakness was that course expectations and assignments were not always clear.",
                "Strengths: Cohort bonding!! I really got to know the other students in the Education studies cohort both as people and as students. I think the model where we got to make presentations on anything we wanted in education worked really well  people got very creative with it. Getting to conduct interviews for Akio's capstone was pretty cool too.\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like there was a little too much structure with the memos\/final project. The writing process for the memos and final project combined felt like it could have been condensed into a week.",
                "Strengths: the class is not a class, but a community. Coming together as a cohort every Wednesday evening, where everyone feels comfortable to be themselves, made the class feel like a hangout. I'm also grateful that TZB provided an outline of the course at the beginning of the semester so that we could feel some structure amidst the nontraditional format. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: at times, the class got kinda rowdy, and it was definitely hard for students who are less inclined to speak to feel part of the conversation.",
                "Strengths: class sessions shaped around community bonding where students just hung out \r\nWeaknesses: to that end, classes were unstructured at times",
                "I had a lot of fun in this course. I think that because we spent a lot of time getting to know each other, we didn't spend as much time doing actual course stuff. I wish that we had had more readings and more writing assignments, and that the course was more of a discussion seminar about texts we'd read. While I have specific education interests, I'm in the program because I find a lot of things that have to do with education interesting, and I want to be exposed to things that I haven't seen before. I think if the teambuilding had been more of a \"structures to help you meet in small groups outside of class' people would have still participated in it and we wouldn't have needed to use as much class time for it. Also, a ton of extracurricular things happen at night, so I think it would be better if the course happened during the day",
                "This course is structured to help students get to know one another, which is incredibly valuable in a cohort that will spend multiple years together. The work was very manageable and TZB walked us through what we needed to do  its basically a (much much) smaller version of the capstone, and I loved that our work benefited a current seniors project. I also really liked that we took so much time for class presentations  TZB values her students experiences and insights more than any other professor I know, and gave us so much room to explore and share with one another.",
                "I have zero complaints about this course. TZB is phenomenal and the course is structured well to bond the cohort while also teaching valuable skills necessary for future research and study.",
                "I really liked the student presentations, I thought they were a great way to get to know the other students in the class and what theyre interested in. I think I would have liked more feedback along the way as I wrote my paper. Im not entirely sure what my grade will be which is concerning.",
                "unorganized and at times chaotic, it would be helpful to have clearer expectations and have our assignments graded throughout the semester",
                "I really loved the presentations element of this course, as it encouraged us to learn from and with one another. I enjoyed learning about different topic areas in education studies and bonding with my classmates. I also really enjoyed helping with a capstone research project and felt the assignments were spaced out well. The spread out workload helped a lot with the final write up. There are no weaknesses of this course! I enjoyed every class session and cannot wait to continue in the EDST Scholars program.",
                "Strengths - I think the class allowed us to connect with one another and learn about our interests. I think there was a great balance of community building and assignments\/work. Class was fun but also very informative. I loved that I learned a lot from my peers through the presentation assignment. I feel like collaborative peer-peer learning is not something that is also prioritized in Yale courses, and I loved this aspect of the course. I also loved all of the activities we had for the course and especially loved felting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I think more dinner meet ups would've been nice as the first one allowed us to connect with one another outside of class. I think the time of the course could also be moved up."

Of course, you're required to take this course if you are a scholar, but I wouldn't change anything.",
