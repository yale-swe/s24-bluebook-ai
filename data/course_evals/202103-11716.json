                "This class teaches students how to define and delineate wetlands. The first half of the course focuses on wetland properties--their hydrology, soils, biota, sedimentation, and flooding regimes. The second half of the course focuses more on wetland management and relationships--restoration efforts, mitigation banking, herbivory, invasive species, constructed wetlands, and conservation projects in the United States. Students gain a broad understanding of wetlands, how they are different from other ecosystems, the processes within them, and the services they provide.",
                "I learned about the ecological importance of wetlands, the threats they face, their role in mitigating climate change, why we should protect them, invasive species and other ecological processes/species/identifiers in wetlands.",
                "Very few, only from what I learned in the textbook.",
                "I definitely learned a good amount of information on wetlands, from hydrology, soils, vegetation, animal species, and climate change impacts. I think for me, the most insightful part of the course was on invasive species, and I'll never look at Phragmites in the same way.",

            "comments": [
                "There were no rubrics given so it was pretty hard to know whether you were doing something correctly. P-sets were graded a lot more harshly than I anticipated at first and a rubric would have saved me a lot of heartache.",
                "I see no strengths in this course. Pedagogically speaking, I think this was the worst class I've taken at Yale. It just felt like we would read the textbook and then regurgitate what the textbook said in class. I thought this would be one of my favorite classes at Yale as an EVST major, but it really did not spark any desire to learn more about wetlands and ecosystem science.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Freidenburg is very nice. The course was organized in a logical fashion. The overall workload was pretty low.\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of the students took the class because they were passionate about the material, but many of us felt that the class wasn't engaging and that we didn't learn very much. The presentation of the material was not very effective. The slides hardly contained any text, so if students had to miss class for one reason or another, they couldn't really tell what was happening.",
                "I think this course was very organized, and I loved how accessible all of the readings were. I think this course could be improved by less textbook reading, or more context on why learning things like zonation rules, species competition, and soil types are important. As this is an EVST course, I would have loved to see some articles that criticize Western ecology and the way it forces boundaries on natural continua. Incorporating more discussions on the context of this information would have kept me engaged.",
                "Content was interesting and the field trips were great in applying our knowledge and experiencing wetlands first-hand. Psets were doable but the exams covered a wide range of knowledge which was sometimes difficult to memorize. 50% of our course grade had not been shared yet before Credit/D/Fail which was also a little frustrating.",
                "The readings were incredibly dense and often very boring. The classroom in the second half of the semester was boiling hot, which wasn't the fault of anyone, but definitely impeded learning. Assignments were manageable and feedback was useful.",
                "I think this class should be reorganized. On the one hand, I feel like I learned a lot about wetlands, from their hydrology and soils to management efforts to their ecosystem services. That said, as we learned, wetlands are such a diverse and difficult to define group of ecosystems, I felt that there was almost too much material to cover in this course, forcing us to study things broadly instead of deeply. For example, I know that wetlands are important for carbon and nitrogen cycling, but I don't know how the carbon or nitrogen cycles actually work.  For some of the concepts, I feel like I would not be able to answer questions that pushed me beyond a basic understanding.\r\n\r\nI think it might be helpful to cut some material to study other areas deeper. The first couple classes, on classifying and defining wetlands, I think could be condensed to free up more space for other material later.\r\n\r\nI also think the wetlands in the news part of class took a little too long and repetitive. Students clearly did not read each article or watch each presentation. I would turn this assignment into a group project to save time or cap the class at a lower number, maybe around 30, so there were not so many presentations.\r\n\r\nMy favorite parts of the course were learning about the Louisiana coastal wetlands and the Everglades. There are so many cool wetlands throughout the world! I think it would be worthwhile to select a few of these and discuss them in depth, their species, ecosystem services, historical relationship with humans, and geochemistry, as we did with the LA coastal wetlands and the Everglades.\r\n\r\nI also found the field trips fruitful and would make them mandatory. I think starting them early in the morning (for college students) on a Friday discouraged students from attending, so I would push the meeting time back to 10 or 11 am.",
                "I thought the readings were interesting and balanced. I did not feel like lecture added much to the readings. If you do the readings in the class, lecture didnt feel very useful. However, if you didnt do the readings and only attended lecture, it was confusing and lacked a lot of information that was covered in readings (and thus what you were tested on). All in all, I did not find lecture to be very interesting. However, I appreciated the field trips that were offered and the readings were thoughtfully chosen.",
                "This course was poorly organized and poorly taught. The instructor was often frazzled, or confused. In response to genuine curiosity and willingness to learn, the TAs were hostile and annoyed.",
                "Strengths: Informative and fun field trips, group work in class, overall organization of assignments, good mix of topics/approaches\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture was sometimes unclear/confusing, class was too big (should be kept as a seminar)",
                "Weaknesses: I think this class was especially tough for me because of how few assignments there were only four problem sets and two exams counted for a tremendous portion of my grade, and there wasn't much other work to boost your grade if you didn't do so well on one or two of them. I also think that this class was a little hard to follow because it seemed like a lot of it was based upon some things that aren't exact, and even though the teaching staff stated that it's good to have \"open-ended questions with many answers,\" I found that to be a bit frustrating. Lastly, I think that there wasn't much of an avenue for collaboration at all, other than studying with friends in the class if you had them.\r\nStrengths: Professor Freidenburg is an extremely sweet person, and you can tell that she is very passionate about wetlands. I think this lended to some very interesting lectures, and pretty cool field trips to places that she frequently works with. I also think that the class focused a good amount on climate change, which will be relevant to our futures as well. Lastly, I think that there's a good blend of science and policy (management, conservation, mitigation, etc.) which definitely makes the class a bit more applicable to wetland sciences.",
                "Strengths: the material is interesting and the structure of the semester is very well organized. I also liked the wetlands in the news presentations! Weaknesses: sometimes it was hard to track what was important in the lectures and what the main topic of the lecture was, especially on days when we broke into small groups for more than 5-10 minutes or focused on the details of one particular article",
                "Some strengths of this course is that the workload is relatively easy to understand so it is a good gateway course for whoever would like to see if they are interested in environmental science. The field trips were also very interesting and fun. \r\n\r\nA weakness of this course is that it requires a lot of reading.",
                "Strengths: Lots of interesting topic, Prof. is very nice and passionate, field trips are very cool\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Material can be very dry and reliant on reading papers at time",
                "Lectures were pretty dry, and doing wetlands in the news presentations weekly in such a large class really ate up a lot of time. I enjoyed the field trips!",
                "the lectures were not very good, even when I was interested in the material; I liked wetlands in the news",
                "The strengths of the course were its thorough and straightforward organization on Canvas as well as the continuous reliability of the course format to the syllabus. The even spacing between problem sets as well as the congruence of the exams to course content was great. \r\n\r\nAn improvement for this course would be to have a discussion forum or something similar on Canvas to submit questions for WITN presentations instead of asking them in class. I feel that there were often really great questions asked during the presentations that might have required a bit of searching, but just couldn't be done in time during lecture. If the forum is online, there could be universal deadlines for participation to submit questions and then a participatory deadline for presenter(s) to give replies."

                "Yes, if you are interested in wetlands specifically. I did think there were elements that were interesting for a BA-pursuing EVST major however it was not my favorite EVST class because it was so niche. My favorite parts of the class were the case studies of the Everglades and other restoration/conservation projects because these can be applicable to a broad array of interests. However, these did not come until the last third of the course.",
                "This course was unhelpful, discouraging, and demeaning. I felt uninspired as a scholar, and discouraged as a scientist. I do not recommend this course.",

                "I would really only recommend this course to another student if they know that they want to be an environmental studies major or if they are certain that they will love a class that is completely about wetlands. Other than that, I would probably say that this course isn't really designed for students who fall outside of that aforementioned box. I'm not an EVST major, and I took this as a fifth class the low amount of work that you're graded upon, coupled with sometimes unclear grading made this class a bit more of a gamble grade-wise than I had originally anticipated. All in all, for the average student, no I wouldn't recommend this course. But, if you really want to, do it!",
                "I think this is a good course for environmental studies majors and people who are new to the topic but need a science credit. It's sometimes hard to stay engaged during lectures because they're pretty long but the workload is manageable and the material is interesting when you focus on it.",
                "I would recommend this course to whoever is interested in environmental science and would like to take a relatively easy class to see if this field is for them.",
                "If you have to take it for your major, it's a fine fifth class to take. The psets are manageable if you put sufficient effort into them and the exams are okay (but you have to study really hard)",

                "maybe",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student, as it presents highly relevant information to current climate issues in a lens where the studies are accessible and distill concepts in ways that make it easier to remember and employ in their own thinking."
