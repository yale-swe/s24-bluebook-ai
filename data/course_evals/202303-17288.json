The concepts such as repetition as it relates to coordination and \"duel\" were very interesting though challenging. The skills that I gained from this class are intangible and thus hard to explain, and we often examined situations with a lot of simplifying assumptions. That being said, the professor is wonderful and the class is genuinely fun to attend.",

This course elevates your critical thinking approach and your intuition to games and illustrates how even the most seemingly mundane assumptions in models can cause drastic deviations in equilibrium outcomes. I would say the most valuable thing this course offers is intuition into games, which can and will translate to real-life situations.",

The course changed my thinking for the better.",

                "This course has clearly been finely tuned over the many years that Professor Polak has taught it. I don't have any criticisms. Lecture was fun, the exams were fair, and the problem sets were challenging yet doable.",
                "The structure of the course is fantastic. It offers a lot of flexibility as all of the material is posted online, including lectures. The psets are also well rooted in the material from the course and really helps in understanding the content. There are honestly no major weaknesses with this course, probably one of the best and most accessible courses in the Econ department.",
                "I wish that one PSET (out of 10) could be dropped. Otherwise, very interesting!",
                "Strengths - amazing lectures and professor, abundant office hours with TAs and peer tutors, short p-sets, very engaging and interesting content, fair exams, and playing games in class keep you engaged. \r\nWeaknesses - p-sets are answered/solved fully before the due date if you go to office hours causing you to not even try on your own by the end of the semester.",
                "The biggest strength is Prof. Polak - he is legendary for this course, and for good reason. Lectures were engaging and fun to attend, and his sense of humor made them even better. The exams were very fair, and the problem sets - while difficult - were helpful in reinforcing my understanding. I'd say the biggest weakness of the course was that solutions to problem sets were not posted - it made studying for exams much harder and felt unnecessarily annoying. It also made it hard to understand why points were taken off on problem sets.",
                "This course was well organized and really designed for people to succeed. The professor even gave extra office hours to help explain PSET questions. It is a really tough course though so it needed that extra effort I think",
                "strengths - prof polak is an experienced lecturer and very personable so lectures are always entertaining. the in-class games are great. psets are reasonable, exams are HARD but fair. but HARD. study study. do all the practice questions twice\r\nweaknesses - none really. the tfs and prof were very accommodating and willing to help.",
                "Strengths: Amazing professor. A lot of Office Hours provided. Absolutely GREAT Peer tutor Beichen Zhang!\r\nWeaknesses: Often hard to keep up with lecture topics and different games because covering so much content.",
                "very engaging games played in class that made lectures very fun to attend, interesting and funny lectures. exams can definitely be tough but workload is manageable",
                "Strenthgs: very engaging lectures, stimulating p-sets with helpful office hours, and a wide variety of interesting and relevant material covered. Weaknesses: not a lot of opportunities for individual help with understanding, feedback on assignments was not helpful",
                "Strengths: Ben Polak! He's the reason this class is so popular. Every lecture is engaging, and he's clearly very thoughtful and intentional about pedagogy. The psets were also great---they never felt like busywork, and were a nice opportunity to run in logical circles with friends every Wednesday night.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I'm not sure what the pedagogical reason was for only giving pset answers verbally in section (not posted online, even after the due date). Sometimes we didn't get through the whole pset, and sometimes I wasn't sure I wrote the answer correctly. It would have been nice to have a way to check when studying for exams.",
                "I really enjoyed everything about the course.",
                "Great lectures, many outlets to help students learn",
                "Strengths: Ben Polak has taught this class for many years, he knows how how to teach the material.\r\nWeaknesses: It's hard to pinpoint, but the class felt pretty disjointed. Psets are also really difficult and not actually graded so hard to even get feedback on your work. Also no pset drops/late days are allowed which makes it a bit tough sometimes.",
                "Very interesting content",
                "I think that for the homework, we should've gotten more feedback. It felt like completion most of the time which wasn't very constructive for my learning.",
                "Class was engaging, professor was one of the best I've had at Yale, and the problems were genuinely interesting (or made interesting) to learn about\r\n\r\nSection was not helpful for me personally; they only went through the problem set answers instead of reviewing topics from the previous week. Would have preferred the latter",
                "Strengths: I think that this course was super engaging. The topics that we covered were all really interesting. I loved going to class every day\r\nWeaknesses: I object a little to how the midterm was structured. It was a few true/false and one really long question. I think that this unfairly punishes students who happen to not \"see\" how to do the long question. I think it makes more sense to do two medium-sized questions instead of one really long question",
                "Very engaging, interesting problem sets, lectures are actually fun and interesting (unlike many other econ courses)",
                "This course is the most engaging lecture I've ever taken.",
                "At times the concepts were hard to adapt to and Professor Polak might move through it too fast but beyond that, he is so incredibly funny and charismatic, and it certainly kept the attention of the class. I do wish the problem set solutions were posted or at the very least, more feedback could be given on Gradescope. I do appreciate how interactive the class was with polls and physical examples.",
                "Strengths - Polak is a very engaging lecturer and makes the material very interesting and applicable.\r\nWeaknesses - Psets were overly challenging, games got repetitive at the end of the semester.",
                "I don't think there are many weaknesses to this course. It was extremely engaging and informative. Maybe the one thing is to have pset solutions posted after students hand them in.",
                "Professor Polak is an incredible lecturer. He made even this 300+ student course engaging. The games he chose are relevant to real life, and I enjoyed his random mentions of historical facts and TV shows. I thought the course overall was really well organized.\r\nWeakness: (small) some of the office hours ended up becoming just problem set review instead of a chance to get hints to try solving the problems ourselves.",
                "the lectures and professor are awesome",
                "Strength: Ben Polak is a FANTASTIC lecturer. His humor and wit make the class much more lively than the other economics lecture I've taken. I also enjoy studying for the finals a lot. I honestly learned a lot just by getting a group of friends and then working through past exams with them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Can't really think of any. This is one of the canonical classes at Yale for a reason.",
                "Strengths: Professor Polak is an engaging lecturer who made classes enjoyable and engaging. The problem sets and exams were all reasonable. Overall, this was my favorite class this semester!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would strongly prefer if the sections functioned as addendums to the lectures rather than just going through the problem sets. Also, we would sometimes not finish the problem sets in section, and since the solutions were never released, we would just not know, which was frustrating and made exam preparation more difficult. Please just release the solutions!!!",
                "Lectures are fantastic. Professor Polak is really engaging, and the material is conveyed very well. There is a lot of support for the material and psets. I felt like I got all the material I needed from class and never really needed much additional guidance.",

                "This class is very engaging and extremely interesting. Even though you might not use the exact formulas you learn in real life, you still feel that you will use the overall skills and logic taught by the class in everyday life.",
                "The lectures were truly some of the most spectacular lectures that I've ever seen. I would've appreciated more practice problems to apply the lecture matieral, specifically in preparation for the exams, which were (reasonable, but) challenging.",
                "lecture slides need to be posted before class",
                "Interesting material, felt a little drawn out at times especially with all of the Nash Equilibria stuff",
                "I thoroughly enjoyed the logic puzzles without an overabundance of math, but felt that some more math could have been useful/even enlightening. The psets were well-suited to gauge our understanding of course concepts. The lecture slides were sometimes difficult to understand following lecture, but the recordings aided in recall.",
                "I thought the lectures were engaging and the exams felt fair, but I wish office hours were more evenly distributed throughout the week. They were stacked right before PSET due dates, which makes sense in theory but in practice makes it hard to finish a PSET far in advance of the due date if you have any questions about it. This can be especially problematic in busy weeks when you want to clear out your PSET work load over the weekend.",
                "Strengths: Lectures and exams\r\nWeaknesses: The last lecture was NOT sufficient preparation for the final question on the exam. That felt unfair.",
                "Good professor, good class, fair tests, fair Psets. Solid econ elective and I learned a lot.",
                "Strengths - incredible lectures and guidance on problems sets",
                "The class is well-taught, but it was better taught on open yale courses. The discussion sections were really unhelpful, and I feel like they would be more useful if they were spent explaining the lecture material and going over other practice questions (instead of just reviewing the pset). It seemed like no one was very engaged in the course.",
                "Really well organized and lots of resources in terms of practice material and office hours available.",
                "A strength was the quality of the lectures and the experience of the course. A weakness was the flipped classroom problems.",
                "The course attempts to cover too many games. I wish they would focus on fewer and explain them further.",
                "Ben Polak is one of my favorite lecturers at Yale. Content is quite approachable, and he does an excellent job teaching it.",
                "Psets help form understanding, exams apply concepts in novel ways, lectures funny and informative!",
                "No complaints- interesting content, amazing lectures, and strong student support.",
                "This course is very engaging because of Professor Ben Polak. On its own, the course material is a little dry. But, his explanations and enthusiasm in lecture really make you want to attend and learn. I think improvements could come in section. I understand we need to know how to do the homework problems. However, when we are given the solution (and work) for one problem a week already in the flipped classroom, I had less of an incentive to attend section. I felt confident about my other homework problems, so I did not go to section as much as I should have. If section were designed as mandatory with other example problems and further explanation of lecture concepts, I think i would have felt more prepared to solve out games on my own. I followed the content in lecture clearly, but often felt I could not do the work on my own. This is where I think a redesign of section would help.",
                "Benjamin Polak is best professor I've had. Lots of learning through games and examples made the process more engaging and fun",
                "Could have separate discussion section questions",
                "The course was very well organized and well taught.",
                "Strength: lots of office hours and peer tutor hours to help with PSETs\r\nWeaknesses: the class was much harder than expected (after reading all the past reviews on the class, i disagree with what many people said... the class is very challenging and takes A LOT of time and effort), and the PSETS were quite challenging. The lectures went by really fast, and it was difficult to understand the concepts.",
                "Would be great if a quarter of the exam was not based on memorising the names (names by the instructor, not actually conventional games) and outcomes of such games. Given that the grades are curved, this entails a lot of time spent on dry memorisation. Not the most engaging activity.",
                "I believe the course is very good and clearly explaining what could be very difficult ideas to initially grasp. It was very different to anything I did before and I liked how it started off slowly. It was sometimes hard to grasp concepts in class but the recordings were a lifesaver and I think every class should have them.",
                "Strengths: Professor Polak is a highly engaging professor. The support system of TFs and peer tutors was phenomenal.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: tests count for a significant portion of the grade, and only having two questions on the midterm can be very harmful to students' grades.",
                "Problem solving and social structure analysis",
                "Great lectures",
                "This is such a fun lecture class. Professor Polak is great and has so much experience with the course. It's well-organized and the TFs are super helpful. There's a lot of support for problem sets and office hours, which is also great. Sometimes Professor Polak can go through content quite fast, but all lectures are recorded and he'll often go back and explain something if a lecture was rushed at the end.",
                "This course is very interesting and Professor Polak is extremely engaging as well. The lectures are well-structured and clearly-presented. The only weakness is that I wish that discussion sections provided us with new practice material instead of only going over the previous week's P-Set. I also wish that we received more feedback on P-Sets and exams to better understand what we did wrong (i.e. by receiving an answer key).",
                "For a lecture class, the course is very engaging, which helped me retain the concepts we discussed in lecture.",
                "The lectures in isolation are interesting, engaging, and societally-relevant, but they feel very far removed from the problem sets and exams.",
                "econ curve is the worst",
                "Strengths: Professor Polak was a kind and fun instructor that made lectures interactive and engaging, and the TFs are super helpful and understanding. I found the topics we learned to be very interesting, and I enjoyed the critical thinking/problem-solving aspect of the course. Weaknesses: The course is fast-paced, so missing a lecture or two can make it hard to catch up. Also, since almost everyone did very well on the PSETs, it put more weight on the midterm and final, which made studying for these exams a little stressful (especially considering the econ departmental curve.",
                "Biggest strength of the course: Ben Polak. I LOVE THIS MAN he's so wonderful and makes every class entertaining.\r\nPossible improvements: make more office hours and peer tutoring available later in the week, for some reason, there were basically only Monday-Wednesday which was sometimes hard to fit into my schedule.",
                "I found the lectures very engaging and the problem set questions thought-provoking. Sections were often very similar in structure to office hours.",
                "Strengths: overview of many interesting games, the incorporation of real-world examples, engaging lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no problem-set solutions posted, which is challenging come time for studying for exams",
                "The course was pretty well organized, although I found it frustrating and ridiculous that PSet solutions were not posted. I think the point of this was to force office hours attendance and i thought it was pointless.",
                "Strengths: REALLY caters to student learning, Professor Polak is also the BEST and does so much to try and make sure students' needs are met; tons of different section times, and Professor Polak does a \"reverse classroom\" where he does a problem from the pset over Zoom with the students\r\nWeaknesses: just a super massive class, so it might be difficult to receive individualized attention to where you are misunderstanding things; for many people maybe this was okay, but I felt that the lectures were a little too quick for me",
                "The lectures are excellent.",
                "strengths: very engaging and fun professor and very helpful and available TF team, course is very well-structured and professor seems to have perfected it after 15+ years of teaching\r\nweaknesses: very large class size and recorded lectures make it very easy to not engage fully with class, but this is up to students personally",
                "The class moves very fast and covers a lot of information. On the positive side, the material is very interesting, the class is very fun (with a lot of student involvement) and the professor is wonderful. He is very funny and makes sure to keep the students engaged. Additionally, Professor Polak holds a \"flipped classroom\" covering the hardest question on the pset, rewarding students for effort. I do wish that he would post the solutions to the problem sets for exam review instead of just going over it in section, but that is relatively minor.",
                "This course is quite good. The choice of games was interesting, as are the problem sets. Prof. Polak is a slam-dunk of a professor. However, I strongly disliked the pop quizzes that Prof. Polak experimented with this semester. I prefer to do my classes asynchronously, but these forced me to come in person, only to get nothing out of them (entirely due to my own inability to focusnot Prof. Polak, who is an OUTSTANDING lecturer). In the end, I still spent the same amount of time reviewing the slides that I'd have otherwise spent had I skipped the lectures, so attending them was a redundant time-waster for me. I got an A without meaningfully watching the lectures, suggesting that in-person attendance probably isn't necessary, but I STRONGLY encourage those with better attention spans than mine to get as much out of the lectures as they can. Although my inattention is my fault and mine alone, I would've perhaps had an easier time if Prof. Polak had spoken faster (but maybe that's just me). I didn't think that the concepts in this class were complicated enough to justify how slowly he moved.\r\n\r\nA few other areas for improvement: the exams could've been harder to more meaningfully discriminate between students; I don't like how Prof. Polak structures his exam questions (2a, 2b, 2c, etc., but often with multiple subquestions in each lettered sub-question, instead of just going 2ai, 2aii, 2aiii, etc.); the reasoning when grades were deducted from psets wasn't always clear; etc.\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH I'VE DEDICATED MUCH MORE SPACE TO THIS COURSE'S WEAKNESSES, ITS STRENGTHS TRIUMPH AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.",
                "I felt like the course was a very strong course overall, but the primary strength I'd like to highlight is that the course felt very well-organized in a way that facilitated student learning. While problem sets were always a step up in difficulty compared to lecture examples, I felt like they prepared us well for the exams, and testable content on exams was always very clear. One policy I think could be changed is that solutions to problem sets were not released. I think the intention was that the professor wanted students to attend section to discuss solutions with a TA, but I feel like it would have been helpful to have solutions available, especially when going back to review problem sets before exams.",
                "I overall enjoyed the course and the course content, but found a handful of the teaching fellows to be unhelpful.",
                "The strengths of the course was the abundance of office hours and help that was offered to us students. In addition to this, I appreciated how organized everything was within the class. Everything followed the syllabus smoothly. One area that I found difficult was the problem sets. I remember the first week, my friend and I went to five hours worth of office hours because we needed help with a singular question and not a single office hours made it throughout the entire question. In addition to this, each TF solved the problem with a different method, so we struggled to understand how to solve the question.",
                "Strengths: recorded lectures \r\nWeaknesses: Final Exam was hard",
                "Strengths: extremely engaging and interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none to report--dropping a pset perhaps would have been beneficial though",
                "Lectures are recorded which is always a plus. P-sets are not the plug-and-chug type and most likely will require going to office hours and \"flipped classrooms.\" On one hand, this helps you build a deeper understanding of the concept being taught. On the other hand, it requires a bigger time commitment. Exams are in between easy and fair - as long as you study and do the reviews, you should be fine. Course is organized; Polak has taught this course many times before.",
                "Lectures were extremely engaging and I really enjoyed listening to Professor Polak's anecdotes. Expectations were clear and well-communicated. PSETs were tough but not unreasonable. Exams about the same. I wish there was a bit more opportunity for review sessions, as peer tutors were helpful but discussion sections were not.",
                "The lectures presented information very efficiently and the problem sets were very deliberately and precisely designed to refresh the lessons of the lecture and facilitate further thinking along the same concepts. There was essentially no wasted time or busywork. Ben Polak is a delight and sprinkles the lectures with just enough wit to keep them lively while explaining the concepts very clearly.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness is that the Psets didn't have explanations for missing points; you had to go to section to get the full answers.",
                "It is strong in that the lectures are spanning and very good, Polak is a great lecturer. The support around it weren't always excellent and could use work, particularly when it comes to exam prep.",
                "I thought that the format, with in-class games that involved the students, made the course quite engaging despite the large-lecture format.",
                "Strengths: The lectures were engaging and very well organized. The psets were helpful and aligned with the exams in the course. There also were lots of resources to help students with understanding the material. Weaknesses: I wish sections were not just to go over problem set answers. I found that did not help me very much, and I would have preferred to see some other practice problems instead.",
                "My man polak is sensational. Sometimes its hard keeping general lessons and rules straight and applying them to new situations."

                "Absolutely. No matter what you major in, this course teaches you how to think rationally.",

Most of the content doesn't require any background knowledge, so it's very accessible for any level of student. On top of that, the content is relatively interesting considering it's all theory and learning game theory can add a really interesting perspective on day to day issues. Professor Polak is also one of the best and most engaging professors I've ever had the pleasure of listening to at Yale.",
                "Highly recommend; it is a fun course that is intellectually stimulating and provides both opportunities for general curious independent studies as well as just the general lecture. There are many avenues for developed learning.",
                "Yes! Regardless of your major or your background, this is an excellent choice.",
                "Absolutely! It is so much fun, has a generous curve, and applies to almost any field that you may work in.",
                "Yes, absolutely - it's far from easy, but tremendously intellectually rewarding, and Prof. Polak's lectures are really excellent. I'm very glad I took it!",
                "Yes, it they need an econ credit",
                "yes! i would recommend it! but do not be fooled by the word game, this class is fun but also really serious and hard imo. prof polak's exam q style is 60% logic + thinking the way he thinks, 40% econ. that being said, it's doable (and maybe even enjoyable) if you do enough of the practice questions and learn his style of reasoning. but definitely not a walk in the park.",
                "Yes, a great Econ elective and Professor Polak made the class fun!",
                "Definitely! One of my favorite classes at Yale, and Professor Polak is such a fun and interesting lecturer. You will not be bored in class. Even if you have to take this class Cr/D/F, it is 1000% worth it.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to all Yale students; it changes the way you view many aspects of world events and your own life's problems/decisions.",
                "Yes!! This course should be a model for other intro courses. It has a super low barrier to entry (they offered calculus review sessions to anyone who wanted, even thought calculus wasn't even required for exams) and Prof Polak explains everything in a clear, easy-to-understand way. It is also just fun, and worth taking even if you never plan on taking another game theory/econ class.",
                "Yes; take this course to broaden your economic horizons.",

Engage in the games that he presents and start the problem sets early so that you have time to think deeply about the problems. The first one or two problem sets are pretty hard but you get adjusted to them.",

                "Great course to learn basic concepts of game theory. Standard workload of 1 problem set per week + midterm and final. Easily manageable through going to lecture and office hours. Highly recommend actually going to in-person lecture! Professor Polak is entertaining and a great guy!",

                "Absolutely! You'll have a lot of fun in lecture and doing psets (they are fun to think about if you have the right attitude). Definitely the best econ lecture I've had. I thought some things we learned had really clear applications to real life. The course is organized really well, and you can get into a rhythm if you plan well. Start the problem sets over the weekend, and take a serious shot at every question. Don't just use the flipped classroom to skip a question on the psets--that'll just make the exams go worse, and you won't learn as much. Try out different sections and office hours to find a good ones.",
                "the games you learn are so interesting and applicable.. just a lot of information",
                "I would, however I took game theory in high school so nothing before the midterm was new information for me",

Lectures were always incredibly engaging. The psets were not too difficult and provided fun puzzles to work through. The class was generally pretty low stress. I had a good time and it provided a nice class to round out my semester.",

                "Yes, I would, especially for Econ majors. I found this course very useful, and especially enjoyed taking it concurrently with intermediate microI thought taking game theory helped me understand some of the later lectures in intermediate micro and complemented the class very well.",
                "Yes, excellent course.",
                "Take as an econ elective. Ben is amazing, the psets arent terrible, the lectures are pretty interesting and engaging and the exams are very fair. Pretty typical Yale econ class, prolly on the more interesting and easy side.",
                "Yes !",
                "I honestly wouldn't recommend. I don't think the exams were a good test of our knowledge, and I felt like I didn't consolidate what I was learning until studying for exams.",
                "Absolutely. This was my favorite course I have ever taken.",
                "Yes! Game theory is such a unique subject and it was really interesting learning about all the different games and strategies over the course of the semester. I will say that game theory as a subject is not as intuitive as I thought it would be and you definitely have to practice a bit to understand concepts in the class. Admittedly I skipped a lot of lectures after the midterm and was cramming hard before the final but the content itself was very fun to learn and it was really satisfying once I \"got\" topics. Ben Polak was a fantastic lecturer and he really explained concepts well and was able to make the class really interactive. The midterm and final were both pretty fair and workable to get through.",
                "Absolutely, you learn so much and also just an entirely new way of thinking. One of my favorite classes this semester and potentially one of my favorite classes that I have ever taken.",
                "Yes. This class was applicable and very interesting. Polak is a great lectures and the content uses games, examples, and math to prove it all. Very good class.",
                "Only if it is a required course.",
                "Absolutely! I am not an econ major but found this course quite enjoyable. Great for someone with a STEM-y brain but a knack for social sciences/humanities/logic.",
                "Yes! Great type of thinking you won't encounter in another class.",
                "Absolutely- must take regardless of your major. You learn extremely salient topics with wide applicability and the lectures are just fantastic. Polak is amazing, hands down one of the best professors I've had at Yale.",
                "Yes, the lecture is extremely engaging and interesting. I think Game Theory is one the best examples of Economics as a social science that requires critical thinking and theorizing. There are plenty of Teaching Fellows to help you understand the content. I really enjoyed this class a lot.",
                "Definitely, best teacher ever, fun classes with games and examples. Not too difficult. Best class I've taken at Yale",
                "I would recommend this course to another student - but I think that it has a false reputation as 'gutty,' when, in actuality, it requires a good amount of effort to get an A- or an A. Professor Polak is wonderful and witty, though, and teaches incredibly clearly, so I would still highly recommend the class - jsut know that it won't be a true 'gut.'",
                "Yes, one of the most applicable subject matters to other disciplines",
                "Yes I would! It was very well organized and the content was engaging and interesting.",
                "Not really. If you enjoy abstract critical thinking, problem solving, equations, etc then sure, it could be a good class... but if you've never taken an econ class before or you don't like working with numbers, then no. It was a lot more quantitative than I expected",
                "No.",
                "Yes definitely, it enhances the way you approach problems which is a very essential and transferrable skill.",
                "Yes. It is a great introduction to game theory that exposes students to a wide variety of topics. I especially enjoyed the second half of the course (sequential games).",
                "Yes",
                "Very good and I would definitely recommend.",
                "Yes. I think this is a must-take at Yale. ECON 159 teaches you how to think about problems in a way unlike any other course I've taken at Yale. It's also worth taking Game Theory for Professor Polak - he's a very interactive professor and it's fun to be in class. The content can be quite tough sometimes but there's a lot of support from TFs during office hours, which is great.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to dig deep into game theory. It is quite theoretical and math-heavy, so you definitely need to be interested in the theoretical concepts, not only the applications. If you do not like theory and math, this course is not for you. However, for anyone looking to better understand this aspect of economics, this course is a fantastic way to do so.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class for students interested in understanding decision-making and strategy.",
                "YES YES YES 100% For anyone even remotely interested in game theory, totally take it. I would say however be careful to make sure (if you are taking this class for credit) that you have the time to achieve whatever grade you aim for. I would not call this an easy A at all but certainly an easy credit if you want it to be. Take it for Ben, take it for the content, take it for your friends, take it if you're curious!",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend Game Theory to another student, especially if they enjoy thinking through strategic situations. Professor Polak is a fantastic lecturer and the course introduces you to a number of famous problems/games that are useful to formally solve.",
                "I'd recommend this course to someone interested in the principles of game theory or someone who wants to look at various scenarios in the world from a different, logical lens. It makes for a good elective choice if you have that option",
                "For an Econ credit or a basic understanding of game theory, yes.",
                "Yes, definitely. The framework that it provides and teaches students to look through is really helpful and definitely debunked some of my preconceived notions of what I thought were obvious but actually not realistic. However, if you are not a very logical oriented person or often like to ask questions, you may struggle catching up with the ways to do and think about the problems if you are just going to lectures. Overall, just as content itself, I think this is a great class and certainly a must-take with Professor Polak.",
                "Absolutely. This is an excellent class. I'm not an econ major and just took it for fun and the content is great, and Professor Polak is one of the best lecturers at Yale in my opinion. You have to pay attention in class to stay on top of the content but if you can do that you will love it.",
                "Yes, one of the most fun classes I took this semester",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. I was planning on taking another class but found the first two classes so interesting that I pursued this course instead. While I struggled with the material, it was still a wonderful class to take even if you have to Credit D it.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in economics and just thinking about problems in general. I would definitely not say the course was an easy course, but I feel like the workload was very reasonable and TAs were very approachable.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course and really enjoyed the content. While it is challenging in the beginning, things get better as the semester progresses.",
                "Yes! It's an interesting course and the work is not too much. Ben Polak is also a great lecturer and uses fun and engaging examples.",
                "I would recommend the course if a student is interested in Game Theory or it is a credit requirement. Beyond this, the course is at times challenging to follow.",
                "I would recommend this only if you have to take it or if you truly enjoy Econ, otherwise don't.",
                "It's a challenge at times, but definitely worth it if you enjoy problem solving.",
                "Definitely. One of the most intellectually stimulating classes I've taken.",
                "Yes. It is so interesting and applicable to the real world. It is the only Econ class I've taken that I personally felt taught me real things that I'd use going forward.",
                "Yes - take this course even if you're not an econ major. It's not math-intensive and helps you build up core skills that will certainly be useful in other areas.",
                "Yes! If you need a fun QR or econ elective, this is the class to take. Professor Polak is a gem at Yale and is among the most engaging lecturers I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. I will genuinely miss this class. Fun, useful, interesting, and engaging all around. Challenging, yes, but very worth it.",
                "Yes, it is a good introduction to game theory which is important for applications beyond just economics. The class is very interesting as well. Just be prepared for a large workload.",
                "Even if your major does not have any obvious applications of game theory, I would highly recommend the class because it will give you a much better understanding of actions and their consequences in the political and economic worlds. The workload is manageable, and I actually enjoyed doing the psets, as all of the questions seemed meaningful.",
                "Yes, it is a great way to introduce a totally new way of thinking to yourself.",
                "I would recommend it for those who are interested in economics or in the concepts of game theory.",
                "This course was a good introduction to game theory and was a relatively good class to take. The workload was very manageable, and the lectures were engaging. That said, if I could go back in time, I probably would not have taken this course since I am not sure I gained much other than a bunch of definitions of game theory concepts. But, if you like game theory or just want to learn more about it, this is a good course to take.",
                "Yes!"
