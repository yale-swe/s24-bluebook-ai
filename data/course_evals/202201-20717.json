                "Professor Pellegrino is a truly great professor, who is willing to challenge her students. She is the main strength of this course. She seems to be a slightly tougher grader than most of the department, which I enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThis course could be improved by eliminating the requirement to do VHL activities and replacing them with daily quizzes on vocabulary and grammar. Students often seemed to skip studying for class altogether (i.e. did not do the activities required of them), then crammed the activities before exams. I am not blaming the students, because there is little way to ensure accountability with the current way ITAL 120 operates. I think a daily quiz system would greatly improve things.",
                "This course is amazing in the sense it teaches you a new language. The only weakness is the pace of the course, I believe it may move too fast for a majority of students.",
                "I would say that there were too many assessments and not enough opportunities for students to raise their grade up through homework, projects, etc.",
                "Extremely well taught, engaging and fun class.",
                "I think there should be smaller class sizes. It is hard to learn snd language with so many people. Deborah is awesome though 10\/10",
                "The strengths, for me, were the instructor and the in-class work in groups and pairs. A weakness is that the course feels very rushed.",
                "I really loved this course, however, there were times when I had the chance to really hone in on vocabulary. That was perhaps my favorite part about L1. That is really the only thing I would change!",
                "This course is structured in a way in which students can learn more about one another while practicing speaking Italian. I feel that learning a language is all about connection. You can become connected to other people who speak the language as well as the culture. In class, we often asked open-ended questions to each other in pairs and then shared what we learned about our partners to the rest of the class. This helped develop a sense of community, which is crucial for a class where students are learning a new language. While there were some units that were particularly difficult, at the end of the day, students knew that they were in it together.",

If you are looking for a language credit, or if you just love the Italian language and culture, this is the perfect course for you!",
                "Absolutely! Deborah Pellegrino is the perfect professor and you will have a great time learning Italian from her.",
                "Yes! This course was my favorite course of my first-year. In this course, you will learn a lot about your classmates while strengthening your knowledge of the Italian language. This class may meet Monday through Friday, but everyday is completely different.",
