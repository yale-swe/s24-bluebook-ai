                "The hands-on nature of the class makes it very engaging. Having students lead the discussion every week is also a good way to maintain engagement in the reading materials. \r\n\r\nI would make sure students have a clear idea of their final paper as early as possible. Maybe ask for an outline and bibliography before the final paper to make sure students are on task.",
                "The course was very conducive to student engagement and facilitated participation from everyone in a way that never felt daunting. However, some of the assignments and reports were overwhelming because of how much there was to get through and the time constraints for them. I think narrowing down the number of objects for analysis and providing a clear and more organized list of requirements and an option for work flow would be very helpful."
