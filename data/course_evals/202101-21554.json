                "Strengths: Professor Qiu is a very understanding instructor and was always willing to adapt to student needs. The course content was very interesting, and it was very helpful to have textbooks to follow along. Homework and exams were also fair and helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures felt a little bit disorganized towards the end of the course. It was also a bit weird to me that we never talked about tensor products.",
                "The clarity of explanation could have been better. I often felt confused and the instructor could have improved his handwriting. I also felt the midterm was slightly unfair given that one of the problems was impossible to solve. In terms of strengths, I would say the instructor is helpful during office hours and the project allows a lot of freedom to explore an area of interest.",
                "It was never made clear why represetation theory is important. The course was very definition and computation driven, but there wasn't much motivation for what we were doing. It made it kind of hard to engage with the class."

Many of the difficulties of this cannot be avoided due to the abstract nature of the material.

If you are taking this class, be prepared to study some of the material from the textbook though. It often takes multiple tries to understand the material."
