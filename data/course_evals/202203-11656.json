                "I really enjoyed the flipped classroom format. The Coursera videos allowed us to absorb the technical content, while the Q&A sessions allowed for really valuable engaging with this content and produced unique discussions. It was awesome to see Metrick and Geithner apply their expertise to our questions. The assignments were also a valuable, but low stakes way for us to engage with this content. It was empowering to see that I was able to write papers on the financial crisis, as I used to think it was a super complicated topic that I would never fully understand. No weaknesses!",
                "Flipped classroom style was not the most engaging",
                "Amazing class.",
                "I think we should have less memos required, or at least make them 1 page instead of 3, it was very hard for me to do all of them and get good grades on them. I also wish not all of our learning sessions were on Coursera or that we did a little bit of a review in class before jumping into questions.",
                "Very well taught",
                "Strengths: Prof Metrick's pre-recorded lectures are very helpful and insightful; guest lectures are also great; memos and papers pushed me to engage with academic papers and research on the crisis.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Prof Metrick's in-class Q&A sessions (flipped classrooms) could sometimes be a bit disorganized in terms of the questions he answered; I think a bit more structure (perhaps if first half of the class was teaching new content and second half was Q&A) would enhance the pre-recorded lectures more. Other than that, I enjoyed the class a lot!",
                "Strengths - great teaching, interactive format, formulated so that you learn a lot and actively engage with the material. Weakness - if you dont like flipped classroom classes or watching ahead of time then this might be a weakness, but it helps with the material a lot. Workload can be high at times.",
                "(Already responded to this question on the SOM survey)",
                "Strength is everything. Metrick and Geithner are amazing, grading is relatively fair, and writing assignments make me dig deeper to the topics talked about in class. If youre worried about the hybrid format, go shop the first class and Metrick will convince you that this is a must take for any Yale student.",
                "Great structure of course with easy to understand videos explaining complex topics and then class time is used for questions. I really enjoyed the structure and it kept me engaged. The only session that was too loose was the one taught by the TAs on the books we read. That could have ideally been smaller groups in discussion rather than a lecture.",
                "This was my favorite class at Yale, I fostered an environment that focused on learning rather than grading\/testing. This style resulted in me getting more out of this class and a lot less stressed about how I was doing.",
                "I really enjoyed the reversed classroom structure and allowed to understand the material before entering class with specific questions on the topics covered."

                "Absolutely. Super engaging, and an interesting way to learn more about financial economics.",
                "Yes! Even if you are not an economics major, this is such a fascinating course on a topic that everyone should know about. It is also very special to attend lectures given by Secretary Geithner. Professor Metrick is also a very engaging and passionate lecturer.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in learning about the 2007-2008 crisis, this course gives a good introduction into the core ideas",
                "Absolutely! The class disproves several key misunderstandings of the global financial crisis held by the public. Everyone who wants to be a responsible citizen in the society should have some correct knowledge of the crisis (instead of learning it from the movies).",
                "Yes, Professor Metrick is a great teacher. Seeing Secretary Geithner is a great experience. The pair will get you really invested in the GFC! I think the workload is higher than expected though, and a lot of the class (quizzes, memos) felt to me to be regurgitating what the opinions of the professors were. But some of the writing assignments really did let us be creative and give our own opinions.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, definitely! This class gave me a really clear picture of what happened during the global financial crisis. Especially for those going into finance, learning about what happened during GFC is very applicable and important. The class was well-organized, and I learned a lot. The in-person Q&A sessions from Secretary Tim Geithner (the Treasury Secretary during the crisis!) was especially a highlight, and it was such a cool opportunity to be able to ask him questions live.",
                "I would 100% recommend if you have any sort of interest in the topic. Metrick is a fantastic professor and Geithner too, albeit less involved.",
                "Absolutely! It's a terrific course",
                "Yes!!! I would recommend to any Yale student since theres minimal prereq. Also, you should definitely take this if you have watched documentaries on the GFC and are curious to evaluate the perspective out there.",
                "Yes, I learned so much and the professor was excellent and very easy to understand.",
                "This was my favorite class I have taken at Yale so far. Even though I was taking it pass fail, I got so much out of it and learned more than I could have imagined about the financial crisis. Honestly, hats off to everyone who put this class on, by far a top notch class.",
                "I would definitely recommend the course if you are interested in the financial crises, policy regulation, or the banking system in general. The class structure allows for a deep week to week learning with the quizzes and the pre-recorded lectures."
