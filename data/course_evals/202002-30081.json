    "The comparative aspect of the course was very interesting, and I appreciate it. I would have liked a little more feedback on the looking diaries and tips on how to improve those assignments, but the feedback from the midterm exam was very helpful for the final.",
    "Discussions are a little long. Lectures are very interesting and engaging.",
    "This course was interesting, fun, and challenging.  All survey courses face the problem of compressing long time periods into a few class meetings.  Summer courses are even more compressed.  It would have been nice to meet in person and look at artworks together, in real time.  However, the online-format was well-managed.  There was small group work, lectures, and in-class discussion.  There were many opportunities to write about art works and receive meaningful feedback from the instructor.  The readings were well chosen and interesting. The course required a lot of work, but not so much that it was impossible to read closely."

    "Definitely! Even though Professor Coyle went through thousands of years of history, I still felt like I grasped the main concepts from various civilizations, which will help me choose what more specialized courses to take in the future.",
    "Yes. It is a great introduction course.",
    "Yes.  The artworks and readings were interesting."
