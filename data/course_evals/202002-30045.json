    "this course is like calc 2 but in 3 dimensions...\r\n-you learn how to take multiple integrals (double and triple integrals)\r\n-cross products versus dot products\r\n-vectors\r\n-surfaces\r\n-work and flux",
    "I furthered my knowledge and understanding of advanced math topics while also learning the applications of the theorems taught in class.",
    "Through this course, students were able to learn multivariable calculus in the engineer-perspective. One skill that was notably gained through this experience was time management and adaptability, through the massive workload in a short period of time. The ability to visualize 3D shapes was gained as well.",
    "I think I learned a lot about multivariable calculus.",
    "I learned a lot of new theorems involving finding volumes using triple integrals",
    "Math Knowledge, English Skills",
    "multivariable calculus",
    "I learned problem solving skills and calc",
    "Beginning of the course covered vector calculations. Towards the mid\/end of the course, covered using parametrics, partial derivatives, double and triple integrals to solve for the area\/volume of an irregular shape.",
    "Knowledge of multivariable calculus, as well as its specific applications in an engineering\/physics context."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Honestly the course was designed very well, and other than the short time constraint of the class, which is necessary for it to work, there isnt anything I would change.",
    "Strengths: you don't need to know how to prove anything. Tests are more fair than 112 and 115 (no true and false!). open book\/notes test. I liked having the lecture before class because then we get actually spend time with the material instead of struggling to understand during class.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Prof should've definitely had weekly office hours even if it was for just an hour. \r\nI felt that most of the exams were fair except for the last one which covered two weeks of material instead of just one. It wasn't super representative of the pset. Instead of having the exam, we should've had a final pset instead. The workload was also really heavy but it may not have been able to be avoided because there are only 5 weeks in the course. \r\nAlso sometimes points would be taken off on the exams for silly things, but Prof fixed that in the end and gave us points back. \r\n\r\nSuggestion: I know that Zoom doesn't compare to being in class but I do feel like Prof could've found a way to make the course more interactive. Like Zoom has a built in white board. He would say things like, \"If we were in the classroom I would draw this on the board\"... but sir, you still can, on Zoom... He didn't teach a class last semester, so I understand that this was his first time figuring out Zoom.\r\n\r\nIt's also SUPER difficult to collaborate with others on Zoom unless you have a friend in the class already. A suggestion would be to have a google form in which students can opt-in to forming a study group. Collaboration is SO important for STEM and I feel like the element is really lacking in online classes. Other professors did this last semester and I found it really helpful.",
    "Strengths- lectures pre-recorded with class time for review was helpful. Problem set and exam grading turnaround were quick. \r\nWeaknesses- the last two weeks of material felt rushed, and the last exam did not seem representative of the homework material. Some exams had unclear\/inexplicit expectations (e.g. simplifying or keeping answers in a certain form), though this was somewhat addressed later on.",
    "At least with the online format, I would have preferred to not spend so much time in class reviewing the topics covered in the recorded lectures and instead to have more examples worked out in real time",
    "Strengths of this course can be found in the teaching team, as they were all motivated to encourage students and support them when needed. A weakness however can be found in the time length, though this was not a fault to anyone in particular, just the nature of our current circumstances.",
    "This class is incredibly difficult in five weeks, but the professor and TAs made it worth it.",
    "I thought Professor Smooke taught well, but there was a great deal of material in a short amount of time.",
    "This online class was very well organized with both synchronous and asynchronous work. I felt that I got the help I needed. Some of the material such as the theorems feel more like memorizing than understanding.",
    "Weakness -- class time. All Prof Smooke would do is essentially repeat the material from the modules, with no additional information. going to class felt like a waste of time, especially since the course was incredibly fast-paced so students would never have questions during these mandatory sessions. i personally had no idea what was going on during lecture ever and felt like if class was mandatory, at least making that period worthwhile. i wish the prof would have instead done practice problems during the zoom meetings and *reinforce* the material rather than just repeat the same information from the modules. the strength of this course was the amazing TAs.",
    "Professor Smooke is absolutely fantastic, and so dedicated to his students. The main strength of the class was the way it was structured; listening to the pre-recorded lectures ahead of class was especially helpful, and made the in-class lectures that reviewed the topics very approachable. Only weakness is that the courseload was absolutely insane for a summer class (some problem sets took about ~12 hours to complete), but this class is worth the effort.",
    "Strengths - well-organized, great TA\r\nWeaknesses - difficult to engage online"

    "Yes, its hard work but you learn a lot and the material is taught very well and clearly.",

    "The class is tough, but I would recommend it to anyone considering a STEM major.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. While this course was indeed challenging, the information learn is quite essential.",
    "I would recommend this course because I learned a great deal but it was fast.",
    "Yes!",
    "no, do not take the summer online version of this course at least. MATH 120 is your better bet. if you want to see a repeat of the the recorded version of lectures for three days a week, be my guest.",
    "Yes, take this instead of 120, especially if Professor Smooke is teaching!"
