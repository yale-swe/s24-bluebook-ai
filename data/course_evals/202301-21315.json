                "I really appreciated how this class challenged me to think critically about the texts I was reading: this was a novel experience for me and has helped to discover the richness in texts. Because of this class, I have understood what makes an argument compelling: it is one that is not obvious, but one that introduces a fresh way of viewing a topic. This class also allowed me to practice the skill of listening attentively to the insights of others and not feeling rushed to make a contribution.",
                "From this course I gained insight and a pretty good introduction into African literature, a branch of literature that I had always been interested in but had not yet explored. I was also able to critically develop my essay writing skills, and handle ideas more thoughtfully and effectively when it came to developing a paper.",
                "I gained an understanding of how past and modern African literature interacts with the field of global literature. I also formed a regular practice of reading and analysing a novel every week."

                "Strengths: The workload was very manageable, the syllabus was well-structured, and the books were fun to read.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The fact that classroom participation affects the final grade really encouraged me to think critically and make contributions during discussions. The weekly discussion posts also allowed me to practice the skills I would need when writing essays: to focus on a specific motif, theme, or excerpt and generate a novel insight from it.",
                "I deeply admired and appreciated the texts that were analyzed in class, just because they were a breath of fresh air from the western canon, but also created important questions about what was considered world literature, which I found extremely fascinating as an English major. The class discussions were enjoyably thought-provoking and interactive. I do wish however more literary theory pertaining to African literature was explored.",
                "A strength of the course was the engagement of the professor in class and the selected books. However, I sometimes wished that the discussion would go more in-depth past the general themes of the novels. The feedback I received on papers was helpful and informative."

                "Absolutely! Professor Iheka is incredibly knowledgeable and an interesting person have discussions with. He always has valuable insights and propels conversations in thought-provoking directions.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course for someone who loves reading. Though the reading amount is heavy, if a student begins before the course starts, it will not feel as overwhelming. To also have a meaningful time in class, it is important for the student to make key observations about the text in their reading time.",
                "I would recommend the class to any first year whos interested in taking literature, as the course offers a refreshing take on world literature on a continent that has been overlooked for too long.",
                "I would recommend the course to any student interested in reading a general selection of African writers. Because of the scope of the course, the class does not spend too much time on one writer. Instead, the class provides an overview that can facilitate noticing the parallels between different writers and the influence of political movements on storyline."
