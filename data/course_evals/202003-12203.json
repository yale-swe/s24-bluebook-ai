It was really really helpful, insightful, and I think every econ and business major should take this class. It's a new way of looking at things.",

This also relates to corporation production, personhood, racial formation, and culture. I also learned how to read ethnographic research and write my own (including ethnographic interviews).",

Concepts like corporate sovereignty, Fordism and post-Fordism, corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporations and the legal system, and the integration of finance with corporate governance were all topics we explored. Additionally, despite coming in with no knowledge about what anthropology or ethnographies were, I left the course knowing the basics of the ethnographic method and with an appreciation of the anthropological field. This class is so interdisciplinary and cross-cutting and relevant to everyone's daily life  anyone will benefit from taking this course.",

                "The class topics were interesting, but there was an incredible amount of work for an introductory level course. The shorter recorded lectures were nice because it allowed students to focus on the information in smaller chunks that could then be reinforced in section, but we essentially had a discussion post and reading response every week when one of the two would have been sufficient to ensure we were doing the work. We also had to do a final paper and a final essay exam, which just felt like we were writing two final papers for no writing credit.",
                "Lectures were engaging, but I would like more interaction with the professor.",
                "Oftentimes, I felt a disconnect between the readings and couldn't formulate a clear connection between all of the material covered over the course of the week.",
                "I honestly can't think of a weakness off the bat; professor Douglas was very considerate and flexible, the material was always relevant and built on to each other as the class went on, the pre-recorded lectures explained everything thoroughly and provided more examples.",
                "Strengths: The course topics are incredibly interesting, and structured in way that does an excellent job of tracing corporate activity and influence. The reading material was extremely interesting and thought-provoking. Prof Rogers gave really great lectures clarifying and expanding the readings. The paper assignments were actually really enjoyable; you will literally struggle keeping the second one at the page limit. My TF was super great as well, and our discussions were really good and organized.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The weekly readings were extremely long. I think that upwards of 150-175 pages some weeks with generally about 100 felt like a lot of reading, and that some of it could have been abridged to focus on the more relevant points. A lot of the reading was extremely interesting, it just could be quite long, and on top of the lectures it genuinely could feel like a lot. Also, readings and announcements were posted across three\/four days, so it felt like you had like four\/five days of class with section, and not two + one day of section.",
                "Strengths: Packed in a lot of information in a clear and concise manner that was easy to follow. \r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "Strengths: Every week of the course was so organized and structured, making it easy to follow along. All of the readings were really interesting and the concepts were relevant to Yale students' daily lives as well. Feedback on assignments were particularly helpful. I really appreciated how Prof. Rogers went out of his way and got to know every single student in the class this semester - it really showed how much he cared about this course and wanted everyone to succeed. The breadth and depth of the content in the course is just fascinating. I really enjoyed getting to do my own ethnography of a corporation, and all of the assignments were appropriate in length and in content. I don't think there were any weaknesses of the course, aside from the fact that the advertised listed time (Mondays & Wednesdays) was inaccurate and the course was a Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday course.",
                "Way too many assignments and readings. Too much material for a survey course. I enjoyed the major assignments, but there should have been less weekly assessments. Too much screen time.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Douglas and organization!! The course followed such a coherent structure and introduced us to authors that were built on by other authors later on, which made the readings more and more rewarding, especially towards the end. We had a bunch of modules that tracked corporate evolution through time and that touched on a bunch of different spheres like corporate social responsibility, supreme court cases, finance and Wall Street, etc. Super varied and interesting content.\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "This was such an amazing course. It was a great format for a 4th or 5th credit, where there is enough commitment needed to keep you engaged, but it's not as high stakes and the material is so so interesting.",
                "The reading load and work load were engaging and appropriate.",
                "Amazingly engaging class -- incredibly open to students' opinions and welcoming any and all thoughts and ideas that students raise. no weaknesses that i can think of!",
                "Strengths: much of the content feels very relevant to the present, Prof. Rogers does a good job of breaking down complex readings in his lectures, ethnography assignments feel very accessible and approach interesting topics\r\nWeaknesses: shortened lectures 3x a week were hard to plan for, having a paper and an exam at the end of the semester felt a bit heavy, two reading responses also felt unnecessary",
                "Strengths: the course provides a deep dive into anthropological, political, and sociological conceptions of the corporation, without assuming a background in corporations.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes this course suffers from trying to cover too much at once; dense ethnographic readings not fully explored.",
                "I enjoyed the lectures and thought they provided really helpful explanations of the readings, especially for the harder ones.",
                "Breakout rooms were not very helpful and sometimes ruined the flow of seminar discussions. besides that I could tell our TAs and prof rogers worked hard to ensure a smooth running semester that we all enjoyed. I think some of the heavier readings could benefit from more discussion to unpack and understand the main points of the reading rather than starting to analyze them which was difficult at some points.",

                "Very engaging for an online course.",
                "Even though the entire course was asynchronous, the course was very organized in terms of what readings we had to complete and what videos we had to watch. The readings were a lot, but I think most students just skimmed through the readings.",
                "Strengths - prof, discussion section, material",
                "The readings were all incredibly engaging and interesting, and the lectures helped summarize key points that might've been confusing. I did find that some readings were rather dense and difficult to get through.",
                "The readings aren't as engaging as I wish they were, and a lot of them are hard to get into for a student who isn't an english\/sociology\/psychology\/anthropology major.  You meet the professor once or twice, non live lectures are hard to be engaging, and the section was not very engaging either, though that may vary by section.",

I also appreciated that Prof. Rogers took time out to meet with everyone in the class individually, despite it being a relatively large lecture. While I liked the flexibility of being able to watch the recorded lectures when I chose, I would have appreciated if they were posted earlier in the week so that I could better plan for how much time I should be allotting each day. I also felt that having to do both a midweek discussion and a reading response for section was somewhat redundant.",

I think it would have been a bit helpful if the lectures were more consolidated so that there weren't so many different ones to keep up with during the week. I think that having a midweek discussion and a section response was a bit redundant. Keeping up with 3 or 4 different lecture videos, 2 discussion posts, and a live section was a bit difficult with a virtual section. It didn't quite allow for as much self-pacing as I would have assumed for an asynchronous class.",
                "I liked the asynchronous format because it allowed for more flexibility, but I think the engagement with the course took a hit because of it. Even though we had once a week seminars with our TFs, it doesn't really seem a lot of time to cover a whole week's worth of materials.",
                "Succeeded - recorded lectures. Rogers was really good at making them interesting \r\nImproved - maybe some bigger discussion sections",
                "There were a lot of shorter lectures, but they corresponded with the readings relatively neatly.",
                "I think the idea of live sections is good, but pre-recorded lectures are not engaging and don't facilitate interest.",
                "i liked recorded lectures instead of two times a week meetings.",
                "The recorded lectures were very successful. However, each week we were required to complete two responses, one for the lectures and one for section, which I found a little excessive. I think one 200-word response would be sufficient to gauge understanding of the course material.",
                "Asynchronous lectures were great but could have done better with the number of lectures"

                "I would not recommend this course to another student, unless they are truly interested in being an anthropology major. The workload outweighs the content of the course.",
                "Yes, this can be eye-opening regardless of major or interest.",
                "Hell yes",
                "Absolutely. This class will blow your mind if you're open to it. The topics are genuinely so thought-provoking and eye-opening, and the readings do such a great job of demonstrating the topics. Prof Rogers does a good job of lecturing. The class doesn't really focus on critiquing capitalism as much as it does exploring how people are caught up in corporations and corporate power (because it focuses on humans!), which I think it really refreshing regardless of whether you are across the economic spectrum.",
                "Yes -- especially if you are planning on working or being involved in the corporate sector in the future! This course provides some valuable perspectives on corporations and presents interesting ways in which to think about companies that will undoubtedly be crucial to keep in mind! Also, Professor Rogers is a great lecturer and asks a lot of thought-provoking questions that really challenge you to think about corporations from various different perspectives. Also, the ethnography of a corporation we did at the end was an incredibly fun essay project -- even in these COVID times!",
                "100% yes. This course is so relevant to all Yale students whether you are planning to work for a corporation or work against corporations! The ways they have intersected with people's everyday lives is really fascinating. This course also opens up the door for further anthropological exploration by letting you acquire an ethnographic toolkit. It was amazing to be able to take what we learned in the course and apply it to a real corporation through the ethnography assignment. Moreover, Prof. Rogers is really great, with funny stories, and is really helpful in focusing in on the key insights for every week. Despite the fact this course was primarily recorded lectures, I felt more engaged with this course than I did with many of my other live lecture classes, which is a testament to the structure, organization, and passion that Prof. Rogers has brought to this course this semester.",
                "Yes, but this was an insane amount of work. Interesting concepts, great instruction. But simply too much work for a lecture survey course. I was astounded by the amount of readings, weekly assignments, and large assessments. In my opinion it was a pretty inappropriate amount of work given the virtual format and the pandemic.",
                "YES. Incredible course no matter whether you're going to work for a corporation or protest them. The course taught us to interrogate every part of a corporation from the inside and out and really equipped us with a range of perspectives to think critically about what corporations are and what they could be.",
                "yes, if you'd like to develop a more critical lens through which to view the corporate form and the corporations you will inevitably work for and interact with post-grad",
                "Yes, especially as an introductory anthropology course.",
                "Absolutely! I was a bit scared going into it, but the course material is so relevant and interesting that there wasn't a week where I didn't enjoy watching the lectures.",
                "Yes, it was extremely insightful and eye-opening.",
                "Absolutely!!!! So fascinating, engaging, and enjoyable!",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. The readings are fascinating, expectations for work are clear, and the course is superbly organized.",
                "Yes. I felt that this course gave me a lot of tools to think of corporations in more nuanced ways, which I think will be helpful in navigating both how I consume and how I engage with corporations throughout my career. Most of the readings were really manageable, and Prof. Rogers does a good job of breaking down the ones that weren't.",
                "Yes, this course completely changed my perspective and understanding of corporations, and all of the information was very applicable to the real world and corporations as we know them today.",
                "Yes, professor Rogers is invested in the material in a way that makes students feel similarly about what he teaches.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes!!! This course breaks down the genealogy of a societal mainstay that seems almost transcendental. This class provides you with the tools, both theoretical and anthropological, necessary in understanding the depth and breadth of the role of the corporation in the functioning of modern capitalism. This class allows you to apply theory that you might have engaged with before and ethnographic tools in a targeted manner towards a concept that is extremely intriguing!",
                "Yes! I think if you are looking for a humanities credit, this is a great course to take. There wasn't any enrollment cap so it was accessible to all students. It's also a great introduction to anthropology in my opinion because it shows the breadth of anthropological research. If you're interested in the nuances of corporations and the history of them, take this course.",
                "Absolutely - Rogers is really knowledgeable, you gain insight on corporations and is a great foray into anthropology",
                "This class is genuinely so rewarding. Professor Rogers's lectures cover the ways that corporations intersect with history, law, and even philosophy in so many interesting ways that are applicable to pretty much anything; this has been one of my favorite classes!",
                "Yes, this course was incredibly thought-provoking and shined a new light on how to think about corporations. It offers some perspective on the flaws of traditional thought on corporations and gives various new conceptualizations of these corporations that is incredibly captivating.",
                "It is a lot more readings than I expected but besides that it was an enjoyable class. Interesting ideas and topics along with time to talk about whatever questions during discussion kept me interested in the class. There were times when it seemed like a lot or I lost interest but overall the experience was good.",
                "If you have a great interest in sociology or the corporation, sure. The readings are thick, but the class doesn't require much effort outside the essays you write, and to show up to section. But this course is nowhere near as interesting or engaging as I wish it was, and I expected to be more interested based on the syllabus.",

                "I would recommend taking this course, the professor and TFs are excellent.",
                "I definitely would. The course material was very interesting and the material I learned was not only important for my study of anthropology but also for my  personal understanding of the world.",
