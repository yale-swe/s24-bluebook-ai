It holds you to a high standard and you definitely must prepare the reading well before class, but it is never very long and Simona picks great selections. The foundation it has given me in Italian literature is invaluable. This course includes a great balance of speaking, reading, writing, and listening. I think this course would be great on its own but I'm glad I took the Duecento to the Renaissance course first as it gave me historical context.",
                "Yes! If you want to learn about Italian literature at a broad spectrum, this is the perfect course! Simona is also so well versed in the content, and also the sweetest professor out there."
