Each class session was thought provoking and its format as a seminar gave far more insight than a lecture could. We read a wide array of books and placed primary and secondary sources in conversation with each other.",

We studied in great detail the kinds of testimonies, sources, and narratives we can look to to gain a holistic understanding of the Holocaust on a more personal level, rather than just facts.",

                "Strengths: Professor Dean is extremely intelligent and synthesized our points in an effective discussion. She posed very thoughtful questions and was extremely vital in our class discussions to push us further.\r\n\r\nWeakness: More feedback on writing would be great",
                "Strengths: Readings, class discussion, excellent look at \"how to write history.\"\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The writing expectations required a lot of independent motivation and contemplation-I enjoyed that exercise but I know some found it stressful.",
                "Strengths: interesting reading, good discussion\r\nImprovements: some more detailed feedback on essays would have been helpful; having the essay for a book due the same week that we have to read the book gets a little but crunched for time",
                "Maybe a little more structure for each session would help, but the discussion based classes are also quite interesting.",
                "I have no ways to improve this class other than asking the professor perhaps set requirements earlier in the semester for the final paper (Eg, having a rough draft due or a bibliography). That being said, it is a junior level seminar for history majors and students should know how to manage their time.",
                "The style of the seminar is very, very discussion-based. It's like a 2 hour long conversation, which has its merits. In order to get the most out of the class, it is important to come prepared having done the readings (which are enjoyable and interesting) and feed into the conversation. This isn't difficult because the conversations take place after a student presents some guiding questions. This is the kind of class where you don't even really take notes, you just engage in conversation -- and the conversations are interesting and thought-provoking enough that you can retain the information.",
                "Strength: very interesting content, good organization, good readings",
                "This course was great overall -- discussion was really productive in general and Prof Dean is a wonderful, thoughtful discussion leader. At times, discussion could get tiring but that is sort of the nature of the course given that it's a longer seminar and each session focuses on a single book."

The ideas about writing and synthesis we talked about in class found their way into my writing for other courses-I felt like the themes of this course lined up perfectly with my greater academic interests in very surprising ways! You do not have to know anything about the Holocaust or even be particularly interested in it as a subject to get a lot of value out of this course.",
                "I would, especially for people interested in this specific subject. You have to read at least a book a week, but the themes and subjects are engaging. The essays are very self-directed, and Prof. Dean is pleasant/easy to talk to",
                "Yes! its a great class that inspires a lot of self reflection too.",
                "Yes! For anyone who wants to understand the Holocaust and the values we place on its history, taking this class is a great first step. The books were hard emotionally, but each one was an important and beyond worthwhile read.",
                "Absolutely. Prof Dean is wonderful and somewhat laidback. This helps create a class environment where everyone can feel comfortable sharing without fear of a right or wrong answer. If you have any interest at all in memory/history, the Holocaust, or working with source material that isn't pure textbook information, this is a great class to take. The workload is more than manageable.",
                "Yes! Prof. Dean was great at facilitating discussion, and the course was well-organized with very interesting readings that explored different aspects of the Holocaust experience",
                "Yes, absolutely! This is a laidback seminar where you learn a ton! Professor Dean is a wonderful discussion leader and a lovely person. Definitely take this course!",
