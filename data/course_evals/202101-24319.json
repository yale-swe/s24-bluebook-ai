Having never taken a film class before, I definitely improved my ability to analyze and understand film techniques, and I learned some basic film history.  I had a more solid science background (AP Chem and Physics in high school), so the physics material was less new, though I learned a lot more about quantum mechanics, which was exciting.\r\n\r\nThe most meaningful insight was how to put cinema and physics in dialogue with each other, something I never would have thought to do without this class.",

                "They tried to make it work but the way the class was structured and taught was not conducive to any sort of learning. The connections between physics and film made no sense. From the physics side, how the topics were discussed via film didn't make physical sense. From the film side, physics didn't need to be brought in to teach about film, it just made things confusing. I knew it wasn't a class about physics in film before I took it, but I think that would have been a much more solid base to teach from and could actually be a good learning opportunity.",
                "it was engaging \r\ncould be more interactive and incorporate breakout rooms",
                "I really liked the interdisciplinary approach that the professors had. I hope Yale continues to offer more similar classes! I think some of the lectures would have benefitted from a clearer structure, but overall it was an eye opening look at both fields.",
                "two great professors in their own right. interesting take on an interdisciplinary course. felt a bit all over the place, though.",
                "This course was heavily structured, which was a strength; one could easily imagine an attempted combination like this falling apart. The topics in physics and cinema didn't always seem to cohere, though.",
                "This course is really great for inspiring intersectional and cross-medium thinking for students. However, the physics lectures could be made more approachable for non-physics students",
                "there are really no weaknesses, the course is taught in a dual professor way which was really cool because every topic had multiple perspectives and provided a lot of insight. the final project was also super fun",
                "The teaching was good and there was lots of TA support, but it was not able to bring out a lot of student engagement. I think the causes of this, however, were mostly because of the Zoom format where people could turn off their cameras.",
                "I think the big strength is that you have Devoret and Casetti, who are heavyweights in their departments, orchestrating a dialogue together. The big downside is that I think that they're sometimes more interested in the ties between the subject than making sure the students get what they're talking about",
                "The strengths of this course are the professors' passion for their subjects. It was so great to learn from them about things they care deeply about.",

                "I loved the structure of this course. It allowed for so much freedom in terms of completing the work, which was very helpful for a stressful virtual semester. There were very few, large assignments (as opposed to many small ones) which was great because you could organize doing the work in a way that is beneficial to you. It's the kind of class where you get what you put into it - which, and I emphasize - is ESSENTIAL for such an innovative course. The thing is, some students were very good at physics and some very good at film, and some familiar with neither. This is why the flexibility with the major assignments and the lack of emphasis on remembering gritty, irrelevant details was great. It allowed for much more lateral thinking about the subjects and I felt I came away with a deep appreciation for each topic.",
                "Strengths: the professors. I don't think you could have another more interesting pair of distinguished scholars.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: limited in-class discussion. Most of the interaction took place via discussion posts - more of a COVID restriction than course design.",
                "I wish there were viewing times for the required films so you could watch it and discuss with the ta or other classmates afterwards.",
                "Lecture did not seem organized and assignments also not great.",

Sometimes the lectures could feel a bit disorganized or like the connections between the two subjects were being a bit forced, but I always had a great time listening to them talk.  I think the course could be improved by interweaving more of each discipline throughout rather than splitting the semester in two to focus mainly on film in the first half and mainly on physics in the second.",
