                "Kristin Hankins was the strength of this course. She is an incredibly insightful and wise editor, and believes in this process in a way that goes beyond anything I have ever experienced. I think we needed to meet as a big group more frequently, because as our projects became longer and longer the utility of the writing groups waned. I think one of the things that we did well during the end of the first semester and the second is beginning to incorporate topics directly related to American studies into our course readings, which I appreciated. We can bicker over whether AMST is a field, a discipline, or as I like to frame it, a *technology*, but I think this course is a great chance to delve deeper into what we do and why we do it.",
                "I thought this was really well done -- the deadlines seemed so daunting going in, but by the end, I appreciated the challenging pace and felt proud of my finished product. \r\n\r\nLoved working with writing groups!",
                "I was super grateful for how this course gave us time to read about and practice AMST-centric research skills, and gave us a sense of how research and writing works in the discipline. (If anything, I could have benefitted from this sooner! Maybe a mini-workshop for new AMST majors?) Having a structure around writing my thesis that was tied to a weekly class was very helpful for me. I enjoyed working with a smaller subset of students in a writing group, and I thought our readings were, if not riveting, at least helpful for thinking about my research. I do think that the course could benefit from some AMST-department-related guidelines on advising--often, I and my classmates had questions about how we should be using our advisors, and I felt like the department could have helped set more expectations around that for us and for our advisors themselves. That would have been super helpful for me in the process of writing my thesis."

                "If you want the time and support to do a great American Studies thesis, the yearlong course is a great option. However, if you have another major or something that requires a senior project, just make sure you're really honest with yourself about workload and with your own experience and abilities regarding long term, independent work. It's possible to do two year long senior projects, but very challenging. \r\n\r\nOverall, though, I loved how the yearlong course let me get to know the other thesis writers and our instructor. You're still doing challenging independent work, but it does help to have a cohort to go through it together with.",
                "It's required for yearlong AMST senior theses, but nonetheless I would! It was super helpful to have a structured class to go to every week to help keep me on track--otherwise, I think I would have struggled to know when I was supposed to be moving on to the next step of the thesis project. I also loved that it gave me a group of peers to talk to, collaborate, and commiserate with. At times, the class felt a bit like a support group--we all rooted for each other, and it made a difference to have that community."
