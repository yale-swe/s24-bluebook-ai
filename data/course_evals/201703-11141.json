    "I significantly improved my ability to converse in French, as well as analyze and describe French literature and films. I best improved my grammar and writing.",

    "some vocabulary, grammar skills, tense and mood in sentence construction",
    "I learned quite a bit of grammar, particularly about tenses. I felt as though there were many helpful strategies that were taught.",

    "I learned fundamental aspects of French grammar along with a gained comfort in conversational French."

   "comments": [
    "The class was very engaging and personalized for each student. It was a friendly and comfortable environment to speak and interact with other students. The material, however, was a bit outdated and included phrases and examples that were a bit old, so the class lacked a bit of modernity.",
    "The tapes, although they are SO useful, are ancient and SO not engaging. I would find myself checking my phone during the long pauses between questions. The MMP videos were a lot better to engage with. Other than that, I loved the variety of material (books, films, etc.), and I loved the professors.",
    "The oral examinations are a very poor test of real acuity, and do not simulate any real conversational or oral skills whatsoever. The atmosphere and environment of the oral portion of exams were poor. Oral in the classroom was decent but at time unenengaging. The format was usually not conversational, and more queston and answer about set topics. The lack of flow and realism of the oral made me feel there was something lacking.",
    "I think one major weakness is the lack of a word bank for the vacabulary. It is not practical for students to memorize words and understand how they are used without being able to see them.",
    "Outdated material often crammed into too short a time frine. Still, teaching was excellent and enjoyable.",
    "It largely covers the language well, however, the manner vocabulary was tested frequently felt like guessing, as there were frequently sentences that one might be able to translate but not have a clear idea of what the blank might be.",
    "It is very strong in design."

   "comments": [
    "Yes; the class is great for expanding vocabulary used in conversation and it refreshes your grammar well. You are also exposed to more French culture and customs through literature and movies that prepares you well for the exams and future French courses.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who is passionate about French, because if you're not passionate, I assume it would be hard to be motivated to get all of the work done.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone seriously interested in improving their French language skills and become an adept conversational speaker."
