                "Strengths: The readings were super interesting, we even we had access to texts that were not published yet. She also assigned podcasts, which made the workload a bit more bearable. The weekly reading reflections were a great, low-stakes way to practice analytical writing skills and prepare for the class discussions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is no fault to the professor (or anyone else), but there were students who refused to really engage with the course materials. They clearly did not do the readings, but still decided to participate in class discussions uniformed, they were not open to changing their beliefs and often seemed to intentionally miss the entire point. This unfortunately, took away from the seminar experience. On the other hand, there were some students who spoke a lot, not allowing others to really share their opinions. This could be improved by Professor Ware setting a 'rule' for students to make sure they are not speaking over anyone -- or just by saying things like \"if you have already spoken please allow your classmates a chance to share.\"",
