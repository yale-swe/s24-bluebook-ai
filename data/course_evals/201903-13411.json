   "comments": [
    "I think I learned a lot about how to write a thesis, write a cohesive paper, and my overall weaknesses in writing.",
    "My writing greatly improved through taking this course because I learned how to effectively develop a claim and capably defend it with evidence from various sources. I also learned how to dismantle counterclaims and bolster my stances.",
    "This course is a great introductory writing course that I would recommend to anyone who is hoping to improve their writing and get an introduction to the types of writing expected at Yale.  My writing definitely improved throughout the course of the year, particularly my organizational skills.",
    "I learned how to transition from a high school writer into a college writer. I learned how to properly participate in a seminar-style classroom (making points and also responding to others).",
    "This course helped me sharpen my writing skills and analytical skills.",
    "the biggest skill i learned in this class was to revise my own writing. I used to spend very little time on the revision process when writing essays, but this class taught me that if more time is focused on revision, the writing process becomes a lot easier and I can display better work, far better than i thought I could have.",
    "This course greatly improved my writing skills especially in writing argumentative papers. Over the course of four papers,  I learned how to make strong claims, choose relevant evidence, and organize my ideas logically. I learned a number of helpful revision techniques that I will continue to for other courses.",
    "I learned how to expand my essay writing skills, including creativity, structure, and research papers.",
    "Reading closely, revising essays, strong thesis",
    "By taking this course you gain an excellent understanding and appreciation for the role of narrative made manifest through our lives as human beings and in various forms of literature. Stories are an integral part of human nature and their value is extremely powerful, capable of carrying the voices of many, of bringing about peace or war, and sharing insight into what our future might hold."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that having more of an overarching theme running through the course or something tying all the units and readings together would have been beneficial.",
    "Craig is a great teacher who is always extremely engaging and fun to learn from.",
    "Overall, this course was taught effectively and I learned a lot. It was lacking in that sometimes other students in the class didn't participate so much, which made the seminar a bit awkward sometimes. It could be improved by maybe adding reading responses due at the beginning of class such that students would have already thought through material before class and were fully ready to participate.",
    "I loved the teacher and the way he ran the class. It was interactive, and it benefited me greatly.",
    "I thought a big strength was the essays we received and the time we got to edit them. One hard thing about this course was the length of the readings we received, but that gradually improved as we were challenged to think about the readings in different ways throughout the course.",
    "Strengths: The seminar style of the course facilitated interesting discussion and provided an environment where people felt comfortable participating and contributing their opinions. Craig is a great professor who leads discussions well and chooses interesting readings that are relevant to the course as a whole. The mixture of writing exercises, roundtable discussion, film viewings, peer editing workshops, and presentations kept the class varied and prevented class time from feeling repetitive. The only weakness would be the length and depth of some of the readings, but if you put in the time and effort to understanding them, they are relevant and lead to interesting discussion.",
    "The biggest strength for me was having a good teacher that was intelligent and witty. For a basic level english class, I think the syllabus is adequate.",
    "Great lesson plans\r\nShorter readings",
    "The strengths were the variety of texts that we were exposed to and the very engaging discussions we had in class."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wanted to improve essay writing skills in a relaxed, low-stress environment.",
    "I could not recommend this class more. Especially for me, Professor Eklund helped make the transition to college much easier by being patient and flexible with deadlines and overlap between classes. I would certainly take any other class that he were to offer.",
    "Yes, I would both recommend an English 114 class in general and recommend taking Craig's class.  The course material itself is interesting, and Craig's easygoing style in class only makes it more enjoyable.",
    "The material we read in this course was quite interesting, and Professor Eklund taught effectively\/interestingly. If students are looking for a course where they can concretely improve their writing and focus on reading, I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. I would recommend it because the class was not too hard, but it did challenge me intellectually.",
    "yes i would, especially if they want a fun course to take that is easy to be engaged with while helping improve their writing.",
    "Absolutely! It is a great introductory writing course and the seminar style is a great way to get feedback and input from your peers and the professor.",
    "I would recommend to another first year because its a good way to get an english credit and in my experience my teacher was great.",
    "Definitely. Eye opening course, great lecturer.",
    "Yes, if you like being exposed to multiple genres to understand the overarching role of narrative."
