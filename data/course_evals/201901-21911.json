    "I learned more about the Chinese language, mainly how to speak and write it. Also, I learned more about Chinese culture.",

   "comments": [
    "I feel like a strength of this course is that everything was very well organized and the schedules were easy to follow. However a weakness is the tests can be ambiguous when words can be translated into english with multiple meaning causing for some confusion.",
    "Chinese",
    "This class teaches chinese very well. The classes are small and the teachers are very nice",
    "I think the course gave me all the tools to speak Chinese. For example, the grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciations were all taught well. However, I still have trouble speaking in spontaneous situations. So, I think adding more speaking exercises that aren't rehearsed would benefit me.",
    "I wish we used old characters more. We learn so many characters, and sometimes use one only once, so it's extremely easy to forget it.",
    "Great course overall. I think it would be more beneficial to record the dialogues similar to how the heritage classes do it rather than memorize them for class."

    "Yes, if you are interested in Chinese. You definitely need to like learning languages to enjoy learning Chinese since it is a very difficult language to pick up.",
    "Yes, helped me learn Chinese",
    "Definitely",
    "Yes. If you are interested in learning Chinese, then I think this course will definitely help you get started.",
    "Absolutely. Chinese will become more and more important, so I think it is a worthwhile investment to learn Chinese, especially at a school with such a strong program.",
    "Yes. Great skill to have."
