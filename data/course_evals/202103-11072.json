I think this would be much better for the student, rather than making them write a paper on why we want to do BME--because some students don't actually know if they want to do BME or not. As college is a time full of uncertainty, I think some more support would be more helpful, instead of assignments.",

I think it is very unique to have every student in your major and year in one class, but by the end of the semester I didn't know any more people than I knew on the first day. The guest lecturers were very informational, but I didn't think we needed to have so many of them as it began to feel repetitive after the first five or so. I would have appreciated more group projects throughout the semester (not just at the end) or time during class to work / have discussions with the professor and our peers.",

The workload was not bad, so I was able to spend more time looking at the options and discussing the major with others from the class as a result.\r\nThe one weakness I would comment on is that we did not receive any of our essay grades back before the end of the term which means that we did not receive feedback on where we stood grade-wise.",

It gives a great introduction into the possible careers, and I enjoyed hearing from actual biomedical engineers. The workload was also very low and allowed you to engage at the appropriate level for a 0.5 credit course. Professor Fan is also great and makes class enjoyable.",
