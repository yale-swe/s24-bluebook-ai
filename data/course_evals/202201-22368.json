                "This course was great in that there was an environment of ease and no judgement so I felt comfortable speaking in Spanish. An improvement could be that there is more group work outside of class.",
                "weaknesses: more feedback and less work on asynchronous days\r\nstrengths: very relevant to everyday life",
                "I think the strengths of this course are the different forms of engagement i speaking and writing and listening. I do wish we followed grammar\/vocabulary lessons more traditionally because sometimes I was unsure on certain topics.",
                "Strengths: Professor Sanchez Walker is amazing! Also, some of the material we study is just fascinating. The course itself is discussion centered, which I loved!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course is a lot of work. Also, there is a lot of art analysis- if there was more media studied (like historical books and primary sources in Spanish) things would be a lot easier to get (like patterns relating to the Mexican caste system).",
                "Professor Sanchez-Walker was phenomenal. The course design was fantastic and we discussed very interesting content. I was engaged throughout the semester.",
                "The primary strength of this class is that is taught students to use the language to communicate with one another rather than focusing strictly on the linguistics.",
                "strengths-- academic spanish writing and reading. \r\n\r\nweaknesses-- a lot of computer work and writing, would have been beneficial to have less screen time and more talking",
                "Strengths: great, kind professor with engaging material!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we reviewed grammar a bit more. I still feel like mine needs work. + I think it could get confusing where homework assignments were. Sometimes they were in the inbox, sometimes in assignments, other time in announcements on canvas",
                "I liked its focus on the content of the topics in order to encourage discussion and speaking from all class members. It was nice to take a break from vigorously learning grammar and just explore use of the language in a judgment free zone.",
                "This class did a good job in focusing on class discussions - everyday I was able to practice Spanish and have the opportunity to speak in class. Through a mere frequency of talking I was able to gain confidence in my speaking abilities. We also had many opportunities to practice our writing skills as well - through essays, JamBoards, and tests. I would suggest that this class have weekly grammar reviews so that we can be refreshed on grammar topics as well.",
                "I wish there was a bit more focus on grammar. I appreciate that department takes a more natural and conversational approach to language instruction (as opposed to vocabulary memorization, exams, etc.). However, I can get by communicating myself well using pretty basic grammar structures, and so I seldom found myself *needing* to learn more advanced grammar despite that it probably would have been better to use. \r\n\r\nAlso, although I thought all of the art and history that we talked about in class was very interesting, I would have appreciated units that were less academically niche, or the inclusion of more assignments that incorporated more everyday-type Spanish speaking.",
                "The class I think had too many students in it but Prof. Sanchez-Walker did the best with the situation. I thought class itself was really well-led and everyone got to participate at least a couple times per class. The topics were more advanced and challenging for my Spanish skill level, which helped me improve. However, the homeworks were where it got a bit confusing. Prof. Sanchez-Walker would sometimes assign homework by sending us a message in our Canvas inbox, sometimes in announcements, and sometimes by writing it on the board in class or saying it aloud. Since there wasn't really a centralized place where homework was assigned, it got a little confusing. Also, there wasn't a syllabus, which added to the confusion."

                "Yes! It was very enjoyable",
                "I would recommend that another student take this class, especially if they are interested in studying abroad. While it is difficult to master Spanish proficiency skills within the classroom, this class definitively gave me the confidence to feel like I can communicate my ideas and thoughts with someone else in Spanish. The workload was very manageable and the expectations on assignments was always clearly laid out. There was also a diversity on types of assessments\/homework which kept the material engaging.",
                "Yes, the workload is not bad at all, but it's still challenging and you'll improve your Spanish skills."
