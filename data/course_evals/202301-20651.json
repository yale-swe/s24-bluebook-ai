                "Strengths: \r\nLectures were very high-quality, and class was highly organized. The office hours were extremely helpful. Homework was a very reasonable length & was (mostly) representative of exam content. The project was helpful and allowed us to explore linear algebra applications of our interest.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSome of the exams had conceptual true/false questions which our homework did not adequately prepare us for. The office hours were not as abundant as I would have liked.",

                "I think the course was well balanced  problem sets were consistent in difficulty, though the first and only midterm happened early in the semester such that the final was a lot more of the grade in the end.",
                "I believe that this course provides strong academic learning, through well structured lessons and a project.",
                "This course benefited from the ample study hall and office hours opportunities. I always felt academically supported and that I could always go somewhere for help.",

                "strength: pset arent very long, the content is pretty applicable for engineering majors\r\n\r\nweakness: the course is taught in a very application based way, however the exams felt quite conceptual. more practice sets for exam prep it would be very helpful",
                "This course gave me practice with the basics of linear algebra, but it was not very engaging and did not leave me feeling that I had a strong conceptual grasp of the material. I think the course could be improved with better organization."

                "This class is a waste of time. You can learn everything the course covers in 2-3 weeks reading a textbook, the pace of the class is glacial. There is also not much time spent learning 1) why what you're learning is useful and 2) the intuition for linear algebra. We spent the first half of the class covering up to matrix multiplication. Take this class only if you have to, don't do what I did.",
