    "How to use R code",
    "In the span of five weeks, I was able to learn the ins and outs of introductory data analysis While solidifying my skills in statistics, all while doing it on my own time. In only a month, I feel that my skills in R (and computing in general) got a lot stronger, and I feel more prepared for higher-level S&DS courses.",
    "I gained a wide variety of data analysis tools in this course that can be applied to a wide variety of settings. Also, I even gained a deeper understanding of statistical concepts that I had originally been introduced to in introductory statistics.",
    "How to code in R, review of intro stats",
    "Learned how to code in R. The main topics were data cleaning\/analyzing, making different types of plots to display data, and doing statistical tests and regression.",
    "You learn how to use R for data cleaning and statistical analysis. You also review a lot of statistical tests and when to use them when looking at certain datasets.",
    "I learned an array of R functions, as well as methods for conducting statistical analysis in R.  I learned to create aesthetic plots and adjust them as I pleased. I also learned a few new statistical tests I had never learned previously, including ANOVA, ANCOVA, logistic regression, and more. I learned of new types of distributions and analyses for statistical inference. In short, I learned how to conduct  a formal statistcal analysis of data, as well as how to present it in an aesthetic way.",
    "Basic statistics and how to code in R.",
    "R",
    "Basic R Studio knowledge that applies an introductory level of statistics",
    "Great intro to R & data analysis. Learn about data cleaning, running t-tests, correlation tests, bootstrap and permutation tests, regressions, ANOVA, and a little webscraping.",
    "You learn the basics of R",
    "I learned how to use R and how to implement different statistical methods.",
    "learned r and statistical analysis in great detail.",
    "You'll learn how to use R.",
    "I learned how to use R and RMarkdown along with some very important data analysis techniques. This class taught me everything I wish the ECON department could teach me about R and more helpful techniques that I could use for my senior thesis.",
    "I learnt how to carry out data analysis, and understand the data that I see in the world around me.",
    "I have developed a better understanding of the R language and interpretation of data and graphs.",
    "I became better at using Rstudio and statistics overall.",
    "In this course I learned how to code in R markdown, how to conduct and evaluate various statistical tests (regression, t-test, p-test, histograms, ANOVA, etc), and how to organize procedures of statistical data analysis in coherent ways. I started with a strong background in programming but no experience with statistics or data science, and this course caught me up to speed very quickly.",
    "I relearned what felt like everything important from my AP Stats class, learned several additional statistical topics, and, most importantly, got a lot of good practice using R for stats and data manipulation.",
    "R code, and basic stats",
    "Learned how to use R and apply it to statistical concepts",
    "Basic statistical knowledge up to generalized linear models as well as a comprehensive overview of R.",

    "I've learnt R and how to conduct statistics analysis, which is super helpful.",
    "Very good r skills, better than I had before",
    "I learned a very good basis of the coding language R. I would feel very comfortable using the program now to perform exploratory data analysis on a given dataset (data cleaning, plotting, hypothesis testing, etc). I also learned many different types of statistical methods and how to interpret them; this was more of a utilitarian learning as we mostly discussed how to interpret results of a test in R rather than how and why the test works, which was fine by me. It was also a good refresher on basic statistics. I hadn't taken an intensive stats course since AP stat 3 years ago but the combination of Prof Reuning-Scherer and the amazing TFs made it easy to get the rust out.",
    "The main benefit of this course is that it helps develop R skills.",
    "I definitely learned R coding and understanding how to make and organize information into different statistic models.",
    "I learned a lot about data analysis and how to use R to do that",
    "I learned how to work with R. Although the class is classified under stats, coming in with little to no stats is doable. There are numerous resources available if you have any difficulties with the material.",

   "comments": [
    "It was excellent!",
    "As a summer model, I think JDRS did the best he could. I feel like there could have been more emphasis on how to go about finding useful data as well as more advisory on the final project in class; however, the overall course was informative, helpful, and easy to keep up with.",
    "This course works well as a part of Yale Summer Session and it honestly doesn't have many points for improvement. I thought it was a terrific introduction to data analysis that was intensive while allowing students flexibility to pursue other summer endeavors.",
    "Strength - Great course to take remotely over summer because all lectures are pre-recorded. 50 hours of office hours a week definitely allowed anyone to take this course living in any timezone.",
    "The course is great, it's well taught, provides tons of resources for those who were previously unfamiliar with R, and the TAs are very helpful.",
    "Very comprehensive course and a great introduction to R! I liked how we were able to review different statistical methods in each class and translate that into R. I appreciated how all the information you needed to complete your problem sets were all well-taught and laid out in the lectures; it allowed me to apply what I was learning and I found that to be very beneficial.",
    "Strengths: Professor JDRS is awesome! You are allowed to work at your own pace, videos are intuitive and engaging, and homework is easy to follow. I feel like I learned more about statistics the past five weeks than I did throughout AP stats and an introductory statistics course (220) last semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: If I had to choose one, it was that some videos weren't available the day we were supposed to watch them and do homework based on the material. It was probably more on Canvas' end.",
    "The pace was great and the availability of TAs and professor for help with homework was amazing.",
    "Very fast and last week of class had a lot at once. Pset, final, and final project all due within a couple of days of each other.",
    "Tons of office hours are great! Also the video lectures are fantastic. Honestly, this is a great class to have asynchronously and online -- almost better than in person I imagine.",
    "strength - you learn how to code in R\r\nweakness - very fast pace and could fall behind",
    "The lectures were good at teaching the relevant material. The weakness was that this material was not the most interesting to me. I felt I could learn R on my own time. Instead, I wanted to learn statistics in depth. I admit this was my own fault for choosing this course.",
    "great course. great professor. TOO CRAMMED AT THE END, didn't really learn much of the data scraping because everything was so condensed.",
    "Strengths - Professor, content of the course\r\nWeakness - 5 weeks for the course was pretty intense",
    "Strength was definitely office hours. There were so many throughout the week that made the fast pace nature of the course actually very doable. Another strength is the professor -- he has explained data analysis techniques is a much more engaging way than any econometrics professor I've had while at Yale (and I'm a senior).",
    "I think the only weakness is that this class moves very very fast. At the same time, the professor and all TAs are very approachable and are always there to help you.",
    "The prerecorded lectures and helpful code documentation posted was incredibly helpful.\r\n\r\nThe speed felt uneven at points with certain topics becoming more difficult.",
    "The instruction in this course was top notch and some of the best I've received in a STEM context at Yale. JDRS is an excellent and enthusiastic lecturer, and his course materials are excellent. I think the asynchronous model worked really well for this class, though the one thing I could have benefitted from would have been a clearer documentation of the interpretive aspect of the tests covered in class-- I could figure out how to replicate them for homework using the code but found it more challenging to locate the descriptions of what they meant.",
    "Prof Reuning-Scherers lectures and assignments are excellent, and grading is certainly not unfair. I think some homework and exam instructions border on too explicit, and could be removed from the assignments without making them too difficult. My only suggestion is, particularly for the online format, to have a dedicated opportunity to get a group for the final project (perhaps on Piazza).",
    "So much support and great online setup.\r\nThe wokrload is pretty high over the summer tho.",
    "Strengths were the abundance of office hours, asynchronous learning. Weakness is sometimes there was a delay in getting information about assignment logistics.",
    "JDRS does a great job and the online format worked really well for this course.",
    "I noticed no weaknesses. The instructor was amazing.",
    "JDRS is an amazing professor who had so many office hours for the class, with very engaging lectures!",
    "The summer version of this class was super fast paced, which could be a little overwhelming. For the most part this wasn't a problem for me until the last week of class where the material and assignments were so fast paced that I felt I didn't have an opportunity to learn everything. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, the class was fantastic. By the end, I felt a had a really good understanding of R and the tools that I can use within it. There are plenty of office hours for when you are stuck, which was incredibly helpful. The pre-recorded lectures also allowed for a really flexible learning environment.",
    "Strengths: Good video format; lecture code provided; fun professor; homework followed lectures closely. Weaknesses: Poor email responsiveness; a lot of work at the end, especially for small groups on the final project (1 or 2 students).",
    "The compressed five-week schedule of Yale Summer Session meant that this course moved very fast and indeed it did--three psets a week, sometimes replaced by an exam for one of them. This was typically doable, though there were a few times that course materials were uploaded late (psets, lectures) and that made the completion of them stressful. This course could be improved if the professor uploaded those materials earlier.\r\n\r\nOverall, though, the course is great. The professor is great at tailoring his lectures to intro learners of R. There is ample TA support, and in fact, TA sessions every day of the week if one wanted help, as well as TAs who would answer questions online through Piazza.",
    "strength: lectures easy to follow and psets are super good exercise. Exams are reasonable.\r\nweakness: pace is a little too fast. hard to digest within such a short time.",
    "The structure of the class was great, I felt that the pace was good.",
    "The teaching team for this course was the biggest plus. There were a total of over 50 office hours each week (this was a 5 week summer class) between prof JDRS and the 6 or so TFs for our class of around 60-70. They were extremely smart and always had a way to help me with homework, logistics, and general content questions. Prof JDRS was also super enthusiastic at all times and I could tell he was passionate to teach us - there were always inside-jokes he would make to keep us entertained. The fact that it is half coding\/half stats made it very capable for being taught online - using RStudio (a coding program) for basically all work we did made the class inherently more intuitive, eg we could follow along the lecture code line-by-line in our own program window and execute commands on our own. The class overall had a TON of content, which isn't inherently a bad thing. The condensed timeline, though, made this a bit more challenging. The pacing was basically where every weekday was about the same as a normal T\/Th class on campus, meaning we would go through about 2 full weeks of on-campus learning in only 5 days. We had homework assignments due about every 2-3 days that took about 5-8 hours each for me, which meant I was working pretty constantly between studying, watching lectures, doing homework, and going to office hours. I wouldn't do this course with another one at the same time. The fast pace also meant that grading would sometimes fall behind - something I wish could be better. Sometimes we wouldn't get grades and feedback back until the night before an exam. Lastly, the information in lectures is pretty dense, so it sometimes is unclear what is important and what is not, but it easily becomes apparent in the homework so you can always go back into the lecture code and look at what you need. Although learning to code in R often made the class more exciting that it would have been otherwise (I felt like a Hackerman(TM) ), coding can also be a pain. More than once I found myself staring at a line or two of code that would work for half an hour before going to zoom office hours where a TF fixed my error due to a basic mistake in less than 10 seconds. I guess that is more of an endorsements of going to office hours though, haha.",
    "I think it would have been helpful to cover ggplot earlier in the course.",
    "Given that the class was online, the resources and information available was amazing. The instructor and TAs were quick in helping and answering any questions. From my perspective, there were no weaknesses.",
    "The course was heavily optimized towards asynchronous learning. There were many office hours so students could easily asks questions if they got stuck.",
    "The office hours are really helpful",
    "Strengths - EVERYTHING! I took this class over the summer, and while the workload was heavy for an accelerated timeframe, the immediate and ample amount of help made it manageable!  Jonathan's amazing and approachable, and every ta I interacted with was knowledgeable and friendly.",
    "Good lectures and psets"

    "Definitely! If youre interested in stats and learning R code",
    "Yes, regardless of your field, data analysis is a good skill to have.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student at Yale. The computational and analytical tools students in this class gain are invaluable and can be applied to any subject, regardless of what your interest is.",
    "Yes! Even if you are not majoring stats, R is a great skill to have!",
    "Absolutely, if they want to learn R.",
    "Yes! This is a wonderful way to get introduced with R and statistics.",
    "Absolutely 100%. You learn how to display statistics in a way that anyone can understand. You also learn new statistical tests without getting into the nitty-gritty technical\/theoretical equations and what not. My favorite class of all time.",
    "YEs! great intro to coding R which is useful for future stats classes.",
    "Yes",
    "Its useful if you want a basic understanding of how to use R.",
    "Yes! If you want to learn how to analyze data, clean data, and webscrape with R, I would highly recommend this! I left this class with a really good understanding of how to work with datasets, and I feel very comfortable working with data in the future.\r\n\r\nI've taken quite a few other stats classes (in other departments like Econ and Global Affairs), and this is by far the best. At the same time, I would recommend taking some other stats classes before this if possible. Intro stats, AQA (in Global), or econometrics would be helpful. Probability theory (S&DS 241) is also helpful. Some of the stats is breezed over, and Prof gives you resources to learn about the stats, but it's def extra rather than being built into the class. If you don't have a good grasp of basic stats (e.g. distributions), some things may be confusing.\r\n\r\nUltimately, if you want to do social science research (either at Yale or not), I highly recommend taking this class. I feel like I really know how to use R confidently now!",
    "If you want to learn how to code in one course, this is it",
    "I should have realized before hand, but without proofs, the fun of math disappears. This class teaches very practical skills and not the logical thinking that I prefer.",
    "yess! This course is good, just be aware the summer version is very fast",
    "Yes - JDRS is the best",
    "Yes. Regardless of what your major is, this course is a must-take, especially as data science is becoming ever more relevant and accessible.",
    "Yes",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course if you have some previous exposure to statistics!",
    "Highly recommend. The statistical background learned is useful for any future career and understanding the world.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student prepared to do the work for it. As a summer activity, the workload for this course is a heavy lift, but I think it's well-supported and worthwhile.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course over intro stats, especially if youve taken a similar intro course in high school. The coding itself is not hard, so this is less a learn to program class than a work with data class, which I found very valuable.",
    "Yea, so many skills, and everything about the class is totally manageable.",
    "I would, great way to learn R and statistical concepts and see their applications.",
    "Yes, it makes the realm of statistics seem a lot more intuitive than other classes do.",
    "Yes. The course was challenging and interesting. I loved the instruction and the homework was clear on its requirements.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes I would recommend. If you are worried that you don't have enough of a statistics background, take YData\/S&DS 123. YData was a perfect introduction for me, and the classes sequence perfectly.\r\n\r\nIf you are taking this class during the summer, it can definitely be down simultaneously with another job\/internship. It might be a busy summer, but since the classes are pre-recorded, it is certainly doable.",
    "Yes. It wasn't hard to learn the prerequisite statistics that I didn't know, and I enjoyed learning R. Also, the professor is great.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn R. However, at least for the summer session, be prepared that the course moves really fast. \r\n\r\nIt seems that the equivalent of AP stats is all you need to get by in this course as foundational knowledge. However, I would recommend that the student reviews that material on their own or be prepared to review, because they get more out of this class' content if they do.",
    "yes, if you wanna learn R and get a good start on data analysis.",
    "If they want to learn R, definitely",
    "Yes! The teaching staff were so willing to help me do the best that I could and I felt very cared for. The summer class is very fast-paced though, but I can see it being much more manageable during a regular semester. I would hesitate to take this class if I hadn't taken at least AP stat or an intro stat class at Yale though, because you're assumed to have a pretty good basic understanding of concepts like normality, t-tests, correlation, z-tests, probability distributions, CLT, etc. I took S&DS 123 last semester where I learned python, so learning R was not too hard - they both have similar intuitions, but I could see someone learning to code for the first time have a little more trouble, but it's nothing to worry about since the TFs are so helpful!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The instructor, TAs, and overall class was great in the sense of learning the material and providing any assistance whenever you came across a problem.",
    "Yes, you will learn how to use R and how to actually use basic stats.",
    "Yes - good intro class",
    "Absolutely! Reading and working with a data is an important skill. Although the subjecy can be mundane, Jonathan's lively instruction and cool datasets made the material engaging. That said, I would recommend a student come in preparing to work for the A. Doing well in the class is attainable, but getting an A requires dilligence and appropriate time management.  A lot of my friends didn't expect the grading to be so technical and detail oriented - but if you put forth the time and attend office hours, you'll be fine!",
