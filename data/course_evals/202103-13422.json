We also covered applications to PDEs from a bunch of different fields, including calculus of variations, harmonic analysis (Fourier transform, Schwartz spaces, Hilbert transform, Radon transform), complex analysis (generalized Cauchy integral formula), and functional analysis (theory of distributions, existence of weak solutions using the Riesz representation theorem). The end of the course touched on scattering theory and numerical methods.",

                "Strengths: Course content is interesting and diverse. Prof Schotland is very knowledgeable about the subject and has many keen insights. Weaknesses: Many of the homework problems were algebraically tedious and not that interesting or insightful. I would have liked fewer problems from Evans and more problems that tied into the cool techniques we saw in lecture from functional analysis, complex analysis, etc.",
                "There could be better notes for some of the topics that weren't in the textbook (distribution theory, etc.). This course was relatively laid-back, though, which was great.",
                "I enjoyed all of the material that Professor Schotland exposed us to. His treatment of functional-analytic results as black boxes was a change of scenery from other math courses at Yale. The most worthwhile part of the course was the understanding that PDE techniques could be justified and explored in greater depth, assuming that the student is willing to put in the time and effort to follow lengthier treatments of the subject matter."
