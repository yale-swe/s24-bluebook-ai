                "Professor Evans is a great teacher. The lectures were excellent, delivering lots of knowledge in a concise and understandable way. The only \"weakness\" I perceived related to the remote nature of the course; it would have been great to have a few more opportunities to engage.",
                "Very good course! I think it did a good job balancing the opportunity of going into more depth while laying a strong foundation of geology.",
                "This class was really interesting and was overall taught well. I think that having the lab component to be able to actually see real examples of what we are talking about would have been nice to have, but understandably it was cancelled due to COVID.",
                "This course was very engaging even for being fully virtual. Lectures were great and well thought out. The professors and teaching staff were all very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. The workload was very manageable and homework assignments were actually compelling and very interesting. It definitely would have benefitted from being in person, but honestly, it was much better than almost all of my other virtual courses. I didn't really meet anyone from the class because of the wide range of majors\/class years\/etc. and because the course was online, and I would have liked to maybe interacted more with the other students.",
                "The weekly homework assignments were a great way to ensure we were understanding course material.  I also thought it worked really well to have a portion of our final research project assigned in each homework.  That way, at the end of the semester we had most of our research compiled.  It made compiling the final project fun and interesting instead of stressful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Evans, he is a great speaker and easy to follow along with. Lectures are short and concise.\r\nWeaknesses: Chapter readings from the book did not always translate to the homework set or help.",
                "The order in which the course material is presented is very logical and easy to comprehend. The homework sets were relevant to the content covered in lectures and ample help was available if needed. I found that even the times at which lectures were held were optimal. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this course that would not have been an issue in a non-pandemic year would be that there were no hands-on examples or in-person engagement with specimens relevant to the course material.",
                "strengths - there were no tests, psets only, and final was comprised of psets\r\n\r\nWeakness - the lectures could be a little dull at times because of the lack of interaction",
                "Strengths: problem sets were interesting, TFs were very available, Professor Evans is extremely knowledgable.",
                "It was a great course overall. The only thing I would have liked to see would have been qualitative feedback on the problem sets I wasn't quite sure what I might not have understood."

                "The virtual lectures were great! Obviously being in person and forming that community would have been better, but it went generally pretty well. One thing that could definitely be improved is that there weren't many (really any?) opportunities to interact with the other students in class, so I didn't form connections with any other students in the course.",

The course could be most improved by requiring participation for a grade in the future, as complete engagement is sometimes difficult over a virtual platform.",

You learn so much about the world around you, and what you learn is really applicable to understanding the physical spaces around you. The hometown project is also fantastic!",

                "Yes yes yes!!!! Professor Evans is great, and the course is very informative, interesting, and fun. If you are looking for a science gut, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a science credit that will teach you a lot of interesting concepts from geology and broaden your horizon, look no more: this is the class to take!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, whether they were interested in pursuing the earth sciences further or not. Learning about local geology sheds new light on a variety of different issues or unique qualities about a location, from economic growth to the ability to extrapolate potential future issues for a community of people.",
