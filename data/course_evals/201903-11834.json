    "The class forces you to practice and develop your Spanish skills every day. I definitely noticed a significant improvement in all aspects of my Spanish abilities by the end of the semester.",
    "I learned better reading comprehension from the weekly lecturas and understand more colloquial phrases.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of Spanish grammar as well as the history and culture of Latin American countries.",
    "I improved my Spanish a lot in this class! I felt that writing, reading and listening developed most over the semester.",
    "Preterite vs imperfect, future, conditional, pluperfect, and a few other tenses. More refined grammar rules and a lot of new vocab. All four language skills were enhanced",
    "I learned more grammar in Spanish."

   "comments": [
    "The course had interesting readings that made the homework worthwhile. The class was also structured so that we would practice speaking every day. My biggest complaint with the class was the amount of supersite homework that in most cases seemed more like busywork, rather than something that was improving my control of the language.",
    "The syllabus was difficult to understand and the course was more focused on perfect conjugation, not necessarily getting the point across.",
    "This teacher was pretty awful, he graded way too harshly on everything.",
    "One of the weaknesses was that we never went over the homework assignments in class. I thought they were a good way to practice, but it isn't helpful if I don't know the correct answer or how to correct my mistakes",
    "Sebastin is great!! He really pushes you to improve but also genuinely cares. I would love to have had more practice with speaking.",
    "An excruciatingly large emphasis on preterite vs imperfect, which felt unnecessary at times. Also, a lot of class time was just spent doing worksheets, which quickly started to feel mundane",
    "There are a lot of discrepancies in grading among the different Spanish teachers, especially with participation. Some teachers inflate the grades more than others, which doesnt seem fair."

   "comments": [
    "If you need the language credit, this seems like a pretty good way to go.",
    "If the student has already taken Spanish in high school and needs the language credit, they should take this course. If they started Spanish in college, they should take another language.",
    "I would only recommend this course if someone had to take it to fulfill the language requirement.",
    "Yes! Sebastin was great, and your Spanish proficiency does improve a lot.",
    "Its ok. It was more work than I expected and harder than L1 and L2. Sebastian was not the best Professor  he often would not understand our questions and sometimes even teach the material incorrectly. But hes a sweet guy and will help you out grade-wise at the end of the semester",
    "I would recommend it with the right teacher."
