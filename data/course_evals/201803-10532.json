    "a broad survey of artistic practices",
    "This class taught me to expand my creativity and provided me with sources of inspiration for creating more ambitious artworks.",
    "I learned about the scope of art and that traditional views about how to make art\/ what constitutes art can and must be challenged."

   "comments": [
    "Strength, great professor and class. Weakness, no concrete grading.",
    "The course was really strong in the sense that it allowed students to get a grasp of a wide variety of areas inside visual arts. I also really enjoyed the visits we did to studios, museums and libraries throughout the course. Those made the concepts we were learning in class really concrete. I would like to see more of these visits.",
    "Having a more precise syllabus and more timely grading would be nice. Aside from that, I enjoyed the content in the class and how it was presented. I especially liked our visits to different art galleries on campus.",
    "Definitely a more hands on approach to the class would allow the final project to collect more weight. Also we only had one week to go from the conception of an idea to a final product, meaning we were not able to revise or improve our work.",
    "Course is very cursory, and you dont really get a chance to get comfortable in any medium, as with most survey courses",
    "shallow but broad",
    "The course provided a decent overview of major concepts in visual art, such as composition and color, through the use of examples, film, and other media. However, the lectures were dry and could be made more engaging. In addition, there was very little feedback given on class assignments, if any at all. Students were often left unsure of how to improve. The final critique was more comprehensive.",
    "I especially enjoyed going to the art school and hearing about different students' projects. However, I felt that the class was not hands on enough in the sense that we did not have many projects to work on nor did we have adequate feedback on our work. I felt a constant disconnect from the course material itself."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!",
    "Yes. If you are looking to be exposed to visual arts and explore many of its areas, this is the course for you.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in exploring art who don't know where to start. By getting introduced to every art discipline at Yale, I developed skills in various disciplines and figured out which ones I liked and disliked.",
    "Yes, it's a good class for those with an art background since all of the students taking the class are art majors (since it's a prerequisite). However, perhaps it would better serve those with less of an art background.",
    "It is a great class as an introduction to learning about art and various approaches to art.",
    "If it is required, yes. But the class does not facilitate concrete learning well.",
    "no",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants a less time-consuming class but still wants to learn broadly about art. However, I would not recommend this to someone who wants to be fully engaged in art projects."
