There are a number of interesting discussions about this time and vocabulary words that are unusually applicable to the common day. Additionally, this course is quite grammar intensive: one learns verb conjugations, participles, gerunds, and numerals. Coming out of this course, I am a more effective and nuanced communicator.",
                "I learned a lot about participles, gerunds, and numbers. I also learned a lot about the history of the Russian Empire.",
                "Continued to strengthen grammar and confidence. Learned a lot about Russian history between Catherine the Great and Nikolas the Second.",
                "I learned Russian grammar, history and plenty of new words.",
                "I gained a much more thorough knowledge of Russian political history than previously, as well as the full capability of discussing and interpreting these concepts in Russian. I gained a greater understanding and vocabulary of verbs and their classification."

                "There is a lot of independent work in this course, so it can be easy to fall behind if you don't do your part. That being said, the professor is great and is available to help with whatever you need.",
                "Honestly, I thought this class was super well taught and organized in the best manner possible. The grading was fair and I honestly felt like I learned much more in this class than prior years of Russian.",
                "Everything about this class is great, and there are no weaknesses that I can think of. Personally, I prefer more grammar\/vocab content in lecture as opposed to open-ended discussion, but having that be the main in-person component really helped me to come out of my comfort zone!",
                "I felt that some of the grammatical sections of this course focused on memorizing rules at the expense of communication. That said, by the end of the course, I found myself often reaching for the correct case rather than merely the correct vocabulary when trying to make a point. You have to be incredibly dedicated to the language in order to rewire your brain - this is a heavy work load course!",
                "The curriculum is very well-organized, and the due-dates for certain big projects are flexible. I don't see any weaknesses.",
                "Vocab is not very applicable. Wish we did more conversational work\/ practice. Essays were a bit challenging to read. \r\n\r\nLoved doing the projects! Much better than a final test.",
                "The only weakness I can think of is the heavy workload.",
                "The strengths of this course were the in-class discussions of Russian grammar, which assisted in clarifying questions about the textbook readings. \r\nPossible improvements could be made to the homework assignments in giving an alternation of vocabulary drills and essays."

                "Of course! Chances are if you've already gotten this far in Russian at Yale, you've had Dr. Muravnik as an instructor and know that any class he teaches is fantastic and conducive to learning at a breakneck speed. The start of the class may be rocky for the first week or two, but after you find your Russian groove again it really takes off! Highly recommend!",

                "Absolutely! You improve way more than in L1-L4",
