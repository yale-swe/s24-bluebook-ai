                "One of the strengths was the emphasis on exploring Italian media through film and tv. It was helped me pick up on the nuances in spoken Italian that arent conveyed in textbooks. I thinkit would have been easier to learn some of the grammatical concepts we learned from the textbook if we had a greater variety of exercises because sometimes the ones from the textbook focused more on drilling the concept was rather than how to integrate it into speech.",
                "Great recap of previous grammar topics and lots of new interesting case studies of Italian culture. Great final essay assignment too",
                "I love the yale model of languages this class is basically all strengths. The only kind of weakness is that, given the nature of the curriculum, L3 and L4 kind of re hash all the themes of L1 and L2. It was helpful for me because I took a year off from Italian, but if you go straight through and retained all of L1/2, it could be a bit slow. Not a fault of the profs though! Just the nature of these kinds of languages.",
                "Not really any weaknesses!",
                "I really enjoyed this course, I dont think anything needs changed",
                "Do not have students present songs. This is a waste of time and kicks off the class with something that is easy to tune out and does not engage us in learning or using Italian. There should be more opportunities for us to converse in Italian during the class. There should be more instruction on grammar throughout the class. It often seemed like we only got serious about grammar the day before the test, frantically cramming everything in to try and remember it for the exam the next day."
