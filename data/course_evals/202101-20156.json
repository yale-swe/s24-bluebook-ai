                "Professor Levine was the biggest strength of the course in addition to her very well-crafted syllabus. There was something to be learned from every poet that we read, and they engaged with each other wonderfully. She did let us know she was replacing Tennyson with Keats in future iterations of the course, which is also an incredible choice! Invariably, in courses of this nature, the syllabus would be dominated by white, male voices, but Professor Levine really took care to include diverse perspectives and not just teach the poets that ENGL 126 mandates (such as Pope and Wordsworth). The inclusion of Rossetti, Brooks, Thretheway, and Wheatley was great. Professor Levine was incredibly helpful during office hours and in her essay feedback. She is also an excellent seminar leader. Please take this course with Levine if you are able to!!",
                "This course is a great overview of English (British and American) poetry from Pope onwards. The syllabus was pretty well-selected and I liked that a running theme through the course was a focus on poetic form and appreciation rather than thematic categorization of the poets. I came out of this class with a much greater appreciation for poetry and a new favorite poet. The assignments were also good--the papers helped me really engage with the texts, and the writing-poetry exercises were a lot of fun (I wish we had more of them!).",
                "Loved Professor Levines commitment to contextualizing what we were reading. Felt the discussions could have been more structured occasionally. But overall I had a very positive experience",
                "I think the level of discussion could be better but Prof Levine is so great.",
                "A great introduction to poetry and authors from this time. Poetry can be a little difficult at times, but its nice to go through it as a class."

                "I would without a doubt recommend this course to another student!! It was my favorite course in a 5.5 credit semester. You must take ENGL 126 with Professor Levine. I cannot express how incredible of an instructor she was. For starters, I walked away from every class with my mind blown because of how effective of a seminar leader she was. She always provided historical context to the poets we studied which was extremely helpful in an course designed to be an introduction to English poetry. It could have been very easy to just jump into discussing the poems without context, but her mini-lectures helped us have a better understanding of literary history. In this way, our discussions of the poems were richer, and we could better track how English poetry evolved over time. Professor Levine always had a wonderful sense of direction during class, and the seminars never felt like they were going in circles or that we were just floating around aimlessly. I think she had certain things she wanted us to walk away with. I loved that she had points she wanted to hit because that helped me as someone who did not have much experience with these poets to know what to be looking for. However, she also allowed us to express our own thoughts and never dominated discussions. Outside of class, Professor Levine was unbelievably helpful during office hours. And it really spoke to her character how she interacted with students during office hours; they were never \"transactional,\" but she genuinely cared about her students and their growth. Please take this course with Professor Levine. You will not regret it.",
                "I recommend this course to anyone who wants to try out an English class and anyone who is interested in poetry.",
                "Read great poetry in this course! Great prof!",
                "Yes! Prof Levine is one of the better foundational English lecturers.",
