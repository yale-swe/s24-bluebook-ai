                "Everything about national security. Very well-thought-out lectures.",
                "We learned a significant amount about South Asian history (more specifically, that of India and Pakistan), the fundamental theories of national security, its applications to India, and general power dynamics in the region. It was an interesting course in that it felt very narrow in scope (national security) yet was incredibly informative in a wide array of topics.",
                "This course offers an in-depth exploration of Indias national security issues and the history around them. I learned a tremendous amount of information taking this course about Indian politics and history . Beyond just being genuinely interesting material, it's also super relevant and I was surprised by how little I knew about the state of affairs and happenings in a critically important area of the world. This course offered a chance to learn about something that Ive never been exposed to growing up in the US, yet I think it has empowered me to think about issues globally in a different way than I had before.",
                "This course combined the higher-level studies of grand strategy and International Relations with a massive amount of particular information about India and its region.",
                "This class was a broad overview of contemporary India's most pressing security issues as well as its political structures that facilitate the maintenance of national security. I came into the class with some knowledge of India's geography and regional issues, so the new insights that I gleaned from the class mostly pertained to the more technical aspects of India's military and national security community.",
                "Professor Singh has so much knowledge and personal experience it is a very engaging class where you really get to understand what the situation is like in India and the general population's perceptions of National Security matters as well. If you walk into the room day one with no prior knowledge you will be amazed at how much info you can quickly pick up.",
                "I learned about India's strategic position in Asia, what its main challenges are and the intricacies of it's government and military. I also developed the skill of writing things other than traditional academic essays, namely a detailed response to popular books and a policy briefing.",
                "I learned how to critically analyze current events in view with historical forces",
                "This class taught me a lot about geopolitics and strategy. While the focus is on India, the readings give you a general education on world geopolitics.",
                "I developed a broad understanding of all the national security issues facing India in the modern-day and their origins.",
                "I learned about Indias domestic and International policy. Absolutely amazing if youre interested in the area.",
                "Professor Sushant Singh's class on Indian National Security in the 21st Century provided me with number of skills and insights.\r\n\r\nIn terms of subject matter, the class provided me with a thorough overview and insight into the major themes of Indian National Security: relations with neighbouring countries, ties with global powers, military and nuclear considerations, the philosophy of national security, internal security threats (focus on the northeast), the Indian Military-Industrial Complex, and Indian Security Institutions. I profoundly enjoy every-single topic covered, but was particularly intrigued by our discussions on Kashmir and China. I have left this class with a thoroughly developed understanding of each of these topics and feel comfortable writing and debating about all of them.\r\n\r\nTaking this class provided me with the opportunity to develop particular skills as well. As an individual of Indian origin, I came into the class with many predetermined views on a number of the topics addressed. The conversational nature of the seminar and openness to questions pushed me to think about these views critically - I have thus finished the semester with a completely different outlook subjects such as India's current government, the implications of partition, and the role military should have in society. I am incredibly thankful for the opportunity this class and Professor Singh gave me to question and develop my personal views on these issues.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I developed certain specific writing skills by completing the assignments related to this class. Our first assignment consisted of reviewing two texts on a topic considered in class, and critically analysing them alongside each other. Here, I further developed my critical thinking capabilities as well as how to balance my own arguments with objective analysis of a text. For the second assignment, I chose to write a article-style piece, which also introduced me to an entirely new type of writing that I now am looking to pursue even beyond this class.",
                "I gained a very well rounded understanding of national security in India, including threats and internal structures.",
                "I learned a lot about India's political history and its relations with its neighbors.",
                "I gained great insight into Indian domestic politics and international relations."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Sushant Singh. His knowledge is truly insane; he seemed to personally know every person of relevance in South Asia! He's so passionate about the topic, and every seminar really put everything he had into delivering the message. In the last seminar, he had a moment where he genuinely was so deeply sad about the direction India was going in, and his concern for the world if nationalism and populism gain more power in other states. Weakness: this was honestly a leminar (AKA, seminar that acts like a lecture). I didn't really mind it though; it gave us ample chance to ask questions and really form a connection with Prof. Singh!",
                "Professor Singh is absolutely brilliant. He made the seminar interesting every week, and he was able to create a great classroom environment where students were encouraged to speak up and ask questions. Sometimes seminar classes have a tendency to lean towards 1-2 people just completely dominating the conversation, but I was very happy that Professor Singh encouraged everyone to share their ideas and thoughts. I honestly cannot think of a major weakness with this class.",
                "No weakness. Only strength. When a man has a gun to your head, what do you do? Flinch?",
                "The course was structured rather well. During the first half of the semester, we focused on different national security issues by geographical locations, while in the second half, we focused on more technical aspects of national security such as nuclear policy and the organizational structure of India's national security apparatus. Professor Singh encouraged us to ask questions and gave good replies to them. The assignments took the form of one midterm paper and a long final paper. We were given a variety of prompts and I mostly enjoyed researching and writing them. Although the class was a seminar, Professor Singh prepared PowerPoint slides for each class and used them to aid his instruction. There were times when the class felt overly didactic and like a lecture, and student engagement during the seminars was not always active. The readings for the class were interesting; however, I would have liked more substantial academic papers rather than op-eds. Perhaps this was a result of there not being very much extant formal scholarly literature on Indian national security; however, I do not think that op-eds and online news articles are appropriate for the rigor of an undergraduate class at Yale.",
                "This was a great course to take if you are more into a lecture-style seminar. The readings are manageable and very well-picked as it helps provide a base for the discussions that Professor Singh had in class. The course is very well organized and clear making it very easy to follow. There are no weaknesses that I could think of.",
                "Professor Singh is an absolute legend. He will tell you stories about his time with the military in Kashmir or about his interactions with the US state department. He also has a vast amount of knowledge and offers in-depth responses to every question. Singh, as a visiting fellow, has a fair amount of time so he's really welcoming to meet with in office hours and to be a general resource.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of this course is that while it is advertised as a seminar, it is really a lecture. The entire class is spent either with the professor talking or in Q&A. We don't really have a chance to talk to each other.\r\n\r\nThe course's curriculum is overall good and I enjoyed the assignments. Sometimes the detail about Indian government agencies or specific operations seemed niche but I think it's good to understand a specific example as a case study.",
                "Strength: Class discussions were interesting and relevant \r\nWeakness: Felt more like a lecture than seminar",
                "The strengths were the lectures and general knowledge of the professor. Professor Singh is very knowledgeable and his lectures are very easy to follow. There were not many weaknesses.",
                "It was a great course. Each lesson focused on one or two topics that really allowed the class to dive into them each week while also being distinct enough that by the end, it felt like I had a good picture of India's national security issues.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses, everyone was welcome to participate",
                "This class is absolutely brilliant - exactly what I hoped to experience from a political science class at Yale, and more.\r\n\r\nThe primary strength of this class is undoubtedly Professor Singh and his teaching - I will expand on this in the next section of this course evaluation.\r\n\r\nSomething that I particularly appreciated in the structuring of this class was the variety of sources available to us in preparation for discussion on a particular subject. The Professor provided us with a multitude of links to videos, readings, chapters, and articles such that we could come to seminar with a clear idea of what we would be discussing, as well as with questions to ask.\r\n\r\nThe format of the class was also excellent - the floor was always open to questions and discussion. I learnt a lot from the responses the Professor would give the questions my peers and myself asked.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the subject matter covered, every week felt equally exciting as we were covering new ground whilst consistently returning to fundamental questions of national security. I learnt about South Asian history, arms and nuclear weapons, and contemporary Indian politics all through the lens of certain recurring questions, and absolutely loved this variety.\r\n\r\nThe Professor's slides were clear and structured, as well as available to us after the seminar. I did not feel rushed to take notes as all resources were available to me before and after the class, so I had the chance to engage fully with the seminar as it was happening.",
                "Very good! Prof had a lot of experience with the subject matter so he could answer a lot of questions.",
                "I learned a lot from the class and each class topic was very engaging however originally the syllabus mentioned we would spend time referring to the readings and discussing them in class with students leading that discussions however after the first class, there was never any time to refer explicitly to the readings so that element of the class was done away with."

                "Absolutely! The class is amazing, the lectures are very engaging, and the Professor is especially accommodating. I was unable to get my final paper in on time and he was very understanding and cares about the student's education\/learning more than grades. 10\/10 experience, one of the best classes I have taken thus far at Yale. I hope to see more courses offered by him.",
                "Yes! Sushant is a wonderful person who deeply cares for each of his students. He made it clear that grades should never be a concern (the lowest he went was an A- for any assignment), and the papers themselves were actually super interesting! If he teaches another course here at Yale, I will def look into taking it.",
                "Yes. I would highly recommend this course to any student; even people who only have a slight interest in political science. In all candidness, I signed up for this course almost completely randomly and on a whim. That was the best course selection decision I have ever made during my time at Yale. This course was incredibly fun and very laid back. The material was genuinely super interesting and it was a perfect balance of the teacher teaching and the students getting to discuss. The only thing I would say is to take this class in person. I think that this class would lose a lot if it were taught over zoom, unfortunately.",
                "Absolutely. You will regret not taking it without even knowing.",
                "I would recommend the course, but with some caveats. Those who already have an understanding of India and\/or national security may want to look elsewhere, as some of the material felt rather introductory. If not, however, I would recommend it to students interested in gaining exposure to one a part of the world rapidly growing in economic and strategic importance.",
                "Anyone interested in learning more about National Security matters in India, and the challenges that India faces in the current world should take this course. Or anyone looking for a very interesting professor with a good sense of humor, and first-hand experience in his course material.",
                "Overall, yes, because you can get a good grade if you do the work and you will literally be one of the most knowledgeable students of Indian security in the country. But don't expect a seminar and be prepared to write two substantial papers.",
                "I would!",
                "Absolutely! its a great way to get aquatinted with strategy and geopolitics without having to have too much prior knowledge.",
                "Definitely, this is a great course to take and the material is highly applicable to the future of India and the region",
                "Absolutely, amazing prof with excellent content.",
                "Professor Sushant Singh's class on Indian National Security in the 21st Century has without a doubt been my favourite class at Yale so far. I would most definitely recommend it to another student.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether you have an extensive background knowledge on India, you will learn a ton from this class. Many of the concepts considered, such as nuclear weapons and the division between the state and the military, are universal ones. But should you have even the slightest of interest in India and Indian politics - then wonderful, you will enjoy this class even more.\r\n\r\nI would take this class again if I could.",
                "Yes!",
                "If you are interested in international studies and learning about the politics of other countries, then yes. India is in a very interested state right now as Hinduism and Nationalism rise under Modi, and Professor Singh is very knowledgeable and passionate on the subject.",
