                "This course was strong in reading and writing instruction. I think the course would benefit from more listening comprehension practice. The videos we watched for each lesson's oral homework were extremely interesting, and I wish we had watched more of those. This would increase my ability to understand casual/colloquial Chinese.\r\nA strength of the course was also the biweekly handwritten quizzes. By the time the midterm and final exams rolled around, I had memorized far more characters than in previous courses. \r\n\r\nMajor weakness: This course should absolutely be 1.5 credits. Despite only meeting 3 days per week, it is about 1.5x the amount of work of CHNS 130/140, which met 5 days per week and was 1.5 credits. I spend more hours on Chinese homework alone (not including studying, class time, or office hours/events) than any other course I have ever taken at Yale. With every course, this becomes increasingly true.",
                "Strengths: Prof Wang is always enthusiastic and lively, makes it that much more fun learning from her. The workload isn't high though it's a constant grind, but you know what to expect throughout the semester. \r\nWeaknesses: I feel like as you move up in the courses, there's more of an emphasis on spoken and verbal Chinese over written Chinese. I honestly miss writing characters so I wish we practiced more writing.",
                "More one on one time with the Professor",
                "The course is wonderfully intense to promote quick learning. Unfortunately this means that the class cant adequately cover in depth all the material its supposed to. The instructor always had to chose between giving a lesson on how to use the new structures or having class discussions about the readings when we should have been able to do both. I think a way to improve this would be to have the class meet everyday while covering the same amount of material. It already feels like 1.5 credits worth of work, and this would allow the content and the work that students do outside of class to get the exploration and focus it deserves.",
                "Very engaging classes revolving around discussion! Pacing could be a little better because I wanted more work with grammar structures",
                "One strength of the course is that the assignments were very clearly written out on the canvas site at the beginning of the year. This allowed me to get ahead with work when I needed to, and I always had adequate time to study for tests. The class also adequately focused on all aspects of learning Chinese including writing, speaking, reading, and listening comprehension. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course is that information was we sometimes went off on tangents that made it hard to get through all of the crucial information for homework and tests in the class period. I enjoyed this extra sessions, but when we didnt spend enough time on important structures, it sometimes made it harder to do the homework.",
                "Wang Laoshi is an excellent teacher. She is patient, funny, and incredibly engaging. The textbook was at times frustrating as well as the pace of the course especially when there were lessons that were denser in terms of new vocabulary and grammar. The lesson about  was very challenging and we didn't have much time to review it.",
                "A fantastic class with an absolutely amazing professor. The material and pace was very similar to other classes, but the classroom dynamic was incredibly fun and enjoyable. Nothing to improve upon."

Frankly, I would only recommend this course to someone who enjoys Chinese and is happy to commit a significant chunk of their week to completing Chinese coursework.",
                "Of course! Prof Wang is always a joy to learn from, and by the time you're at L5, everyone else is as interested and passionate about Chinese are you are so the class benefits from that. By the middle of the semester, everyone's super comfortable speaking in Chinese and group discussions, it's a great atmosphere.",
                "Wang Laoshi is incredible!",
                "Id recommend it to anyone who has a genuine desire to learn Chinese. This is not a class to just take for fun, but if youre interested in the material, youll really enjoy it and learn a lot.",
                "Yes! Keep learning Chinese, or you'll forget it!",
