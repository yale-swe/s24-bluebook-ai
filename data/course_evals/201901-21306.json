    "I solidified my knowledge and understanding of music theory.",
    "Learned basic music theory and how to understand how our feelings and intuitions relate to intervals",
    "I learned the component parts of music (e.g., pitch, rhythm, keys, melody, harmony, chords, form), how to identify them by reading & listening, and how to apply them in my own compositions. The class enhanced my ability to not only analyze music, but also appreciate it."

    "This class was very engaging and the professor was very good at teaching while making the class enjoyable.",
    "Strength: very engaging and hands on learning, professor was amazing!\r\nWeakness: none posed",
    "The instructor (Bronwen) was an absolute gem. Wish we had more exercises in the later half of the semester, bit Im being nit-picky here. The class was incredibly educational and fun.",
    "Strengths- the way it was taught. It was not very rigid but helped with learning \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- none",
    "Strengths: Professor Garand-Sheridan's enthusiasm and support throughout the entire semester. Her love of music was infectious. Weaknesses: It was a little unstructured at the beginning of the course, but I understood the professor's intent behind not following the textbook, and she was also open to our feedback and advice on how to improve class time."

    "I would highly recommend this course because it was a great introduction to music theory. It was also a very enjoyable class because the professor helps make the class very interesting.",
    "Yes, especially with Bronwen! She is so passionate about what she teaches and it is so contagious. We explored different avenues of music theory that were very fascinating. Even with prior knowledge of music theory, I was able to learn something new every day.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone looking to understand why music feels a certain way, and those looking for a solid foundation in music theory.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Especially with Bronwen.",
    "Yes!! It taught me what I needed to start as a learner in music. Bronwen is the best, most energetic and caring professor.",
    "Absolutely! It's an easy A but you actually learn a lot! And bronwen is such a wonderful professor and will help you along. Was the most wholesome class at Yale Hands down. The class helped each other and we got close.",
    "Yes! It's an excellent, gentle introduction to the fundamentals of music for beginners; a solid crash course in basic theory for experienced musicians who never learned it prior to Yale; and a breath of fresh air for stressed students who appreciate listening to music.",
    "Absolutely. The workload is little to none, but if you love listening to the music, then you will get so much out of it because it makes you think deeper about how the music that you listen to in your daily life is created. It was a really nice fourth class to have, and I'm definitely taking MUSI210, although I heard it isn't as easy."
