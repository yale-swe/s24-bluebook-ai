                "I learned about the historys news future of animation.",
                "This course was a good survey in methods of animation. It started with earlier forms of animation, two-frame thaumatropes, twelve-frame zoetropes, and then evolved into full-blown stop-motion animation.",
                "Principles of Animation was a fantastic, hands-on course that not only introduced us to the early techniques of analog animation and its corresponding media history, but also introduced us to so many of Yales archives and collections. I was introduced to Dragonframe as software, copy stand photography technique and slide projectors as a medium, all of which will be highly influential to my practice going forward.",

                "Some unrealistic deadlines made the course a bit more challenging than it needed to be! I think every student pulled at least one all-nighter trying to get an assignment done on time. Would also appreciate more\/deeper discussion of historical materials and assigned viewings.",
                "Professor Hagari really cares about students' learning and gives deep helpful feedback that pertains to each student's individual situation. Professor is really nice, respectful, and understanding. When he asks how are you, he means it, and he takes students on field trips to various museums on campus. Even though projects are a lot of work, you can learn a lot and get feedback from class critique and the teacher.\r\nI hope that next time this class will be clearer about the project expectations and upcoming schedules. Sometimes there were Canvas announcements, which were helpful for knowing exactly what the project expectations are, so it would be helpful to have one for each item that's due. Sometimes projects were so open-ended and new to me that I had no idea where to start. Also, I wish the class coordinated a trip to New York. I am so thankful to Professor Hagari for showing our work in Times Square, but the process of asking classmates to go together was quite stressful (it would be unsafe for me to take the train or car alone, and my classmates were very last-minute planners).",
                "I wish we had more time for projects",
                "Strengths: What I enjoyed most out of this class was simply having a class dedicated to experimenting with animation. The class was also a very supportive community, and it often felt like we were all working together in an animation studio despite working on completely separate projects. We were always excited to see what our peers made! Ben also made excellent use of the resources on Yale's campus and we got to see a lot of animation-adjacent artifacts at the YUAG, Beinecke, and West Campus.\r\n\r\nWeakness: For a class called \"Principles of Animation,\" we actually didn't get much formal training in any traditional principles of animation. We didn't really learn traditional techniques for realistic or effective animation (other than a focus on pacing), we just learned about different animation techniques throughout history. The pacing of the class also put us all in a bind a number of times considering Ben sometimes wanted quite a bit of animation in a short amount of time. Thankfully he was very flexible and understanding when we hadn't finished our animations for check-ins, but we all put in A LOT of work and many many hours at the CCAM to complete our animations.",
                "Strengths: comprehensive overview of the history of animation and generous hands-on assistance with learning each of the \tanalog techniques. Provides a rich semester full of field trips that introduce and engage students with Yales archive and outside researchers. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses to speak of. Ben expects a lot from his students but also commits himself to helping and providing ample support.",
                "I enjoyed the diversity of techniques we learned to make animation (especially obsolete technology such as 16mm scratch animation) \r\nWorkload was ok overall but sometimes the deadlines were too close to the date that it was assigned on."

                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course, but would let people know that if they want to create work they are proud of, it will take a lot of time. This is true of most classes, but animation is a particularly time-consuming art form.",
                "Absolutely. The course was fun, engaging, inspiring and supportive. I looked forward to every class period because Ben surprised us with a new immersive learning environment or shared films from artists and directors that excited and inspired us as a class. The class demands a lot of time and commitment, but for anybody interested in film, media history, drawing, painting or analog technique, principals of animation was perfect.",
