                "Before the midterm it was really good, after the midterm it got unnecessarily complicated. You could tell that most people did not pay attention anymore and relied heavily on office hours. Clustering and regression are fine, but anything more advanced than that is of no use to non-senior and graf students. Also, why do we need to submit the final project in the form of a paper, a video, a poster AND a website??",
                "Strengths: I can now say that I know how to code using the Python language. The professor was also very good in teaching the content and keeping the class engaged. I really enjoyed my time with Professor Sohee.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The class goes by really quickly for someone who has 0 coding experience. Therefore, it requires a lot of work outside of class on my part. It would be good if the class can be a little bit slower.",
                "strengths:\r\n- very intensive - learned a lot, especially for beginners\r\n- discussion session very helpful in going through the course materials\r\n- homework very reflective of what was taught in class\r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\n- second part of class after midterm was very difficult and quite hard to follow as it was fast paced and people would need to do part that are needed for their project\r\n- objective of progress report was not clear. Not sure why we need to do that part\r\n- Not sure if video recording of our presentation is neccesary",
                "The first half of the semester I followed along with well enough, but once we stopped doing Python psets in favor of working on the final project (a convoluted data science project), I became completely lost and the lectures and sections no longer felt helpful or like anyone was engaged. We were simply copying down code and not learning. The final project was also ridiculously complicated: along with a proposal, progress report, and the final report, supported by the coding itself (which is touched on but never well explained, bas she is trying to cover way too much content), you are made to make multiple video presentations, do an in-class presentation, and make a website as well as a poster. I understand the purpose of each of these but altogether it is way too much, especially when the foundation of the project was never solid as there was not enough instruction on getting started, as we were picking a research topic and data sets.",
                "Strengths: I definitely learned a lot about coding in the first half of the course and felt very supported by Prof Park and the TAs.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the second half of the course, learning how to code graphs essentially to prepare for the final, felt way too fast and was difficult to understand.",
                "weaknesses: lecture, work, and at times the professor",
                "The course sped up a lot towards the end and was difficult to follow. I appreciated the sections and office hours as ways for me to learn better.",
                "The structure of the course was great! I feel that I learned a lot through the final project by being able to use what I had learned in the first half of the course outside of a problem set- but to conduct my own unique series of code. The only thing I would change is the number of requirements at the end of the final project. Rather than a video, poster, and website, it would work to present to the class with the website which would allow us to focus more on our final reports.",
                "The course is a good introduction to Python, though it moves very fast at the beginning. The learning curve is quite high, especially for people who have never coded before, and it would have been nice to spend more time on the basics.",
                "Strengths: It really does presume absolutely no previous knowledge in programming and starts from the ground up. The amount of resources available (ULA/Professor office hours every day) was really helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The data science unit was a bit abstract at times, and that time perhaps would have been better spent learning other things about Python. The final project had far too many redundancies  we had to reformat the same information across 3+ different platforms (written report, website, poster, video), which was excessive.",
                "It is difficult to properly balance the workload of this course, as going to office hours is vital to proceed in this class. This means that on top of going to biweekly classes and a discussion section, you will also have to go to one or two office hours per week. The first few weeks are manageable, but when the final project rolls around, the courseload becomes extremely difficult to manage. Otherwise, the class covers vital knowledge regarding data science and python, which to me has been applicable outside of just this course.",
                "One strength is that the TAs were very helpful and there were alot of resources to learn the material, like a textbook and lecture slideshows. However, the workload at the beginning of the course and for the final project was heavy.",
                "The course CPSC 110 established a solid baseline introduction to Python programming. The varied grading components: midterm, quizzes, assignments, final project and participation, allowed for a multifaceted assessment of student learning. I also felt like the grading was extremely fair and often generous. The final project, in particular, stood out as a highlight of the course, enabling students to apply their learning in a practical, engaging manner. Additionally, there are multiple office hours and w some Undergraduate Learning Assistants (ULAs) were very helpful, providing clear and patient guidance which was instrumental for many students in understanding complex concepts.\r\n\r\nHowever, the course had its shortcomings. Professor Park is trying to cover a lot of ground, some of which feels unrealistic in an intro course. Especially at the beginning, the workload was so heavy, we couldn't always cover everything in lectures or sections. This means we end up doing a lot of self-study to catch up or understand the material. A significant issue was the excessive number of assignments, many of which were graded solely for completion. This volume of work was at times seen as redundant by students. Feedback on this aspect of the syllabus was not always well-received by Professor Park, who showed frustration with criticism. Because there are so many assignments, deadlines seemed arbitrary and were often pushed. As a result, the course often felt disorganized. The quality of assistance provided by ULAs was inconsistent; while some were exceptionally helpful, others were known to end office hours early and showed frustration when students did not readily understand the material.",
                "Strength: Professor Park is extremely kind and will make sure every student understands the topics.\r\nWeakness: It is a very demanding course for non-stem students."

It is one of the most challenging classes for me, but I also learned the most. This skill is also useful for me when applhying for jobs and my interviews. So far, it has been one of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",

There are benefits to learning computer science among other humanities and social science majors, though people who have done data science-type projects before are definitely at an advantage. I wanted to learn Python but had no interest in data science, and found the second half of the semester (which was focused on a data science project) confusing, terribly taught, and not engaging, though learning Python I actually enjoyed.",

                "No, take another coding class. Trust me, its not worth it. The first half of the class is okay. Psets can take awhile but are rewarding once you figure the problems out. However, you need to do the readings/teach yourself because the lectures are hard to follow (and yay attendance is mandatory). The second half of the class dives so deep into random coding applications without really showing you how to do them. Felt pointless and that they did not prepare you for the final project.",

                "I would recommend it if the student is ready to put in the work. Because the class moves so fast at the beginning, one has to put in a lot of time outside of class to understand what is being taught. However, office hours and the ULA's were an amazing resource and one that should definitely be used to the fullest.",
                "The course load was on par with classes that award 1.5 or 2 credits; only take this class if you want to be challenged.",
                "I think I would! It's a pretty approachable first start to programming and likely the easiest introductory CS class that Yale has to offer.",
                "If you are willing to show up to office hours and spend a significant amount of time on the psets/project (far greater than most other classes), this class may be worth it, as it is an introductory course into an important technical skill.",
                "I would recommend this course if they are a humanities / social science major, need a QR, and had some exposure to coding before! The beginning of the course with the Python portion goes by really fast, thus, having a bit of exposure to basic coding principles may be very helpful.",
                "If you're thinking about taking CPSC 110, here's my take: only dive in if you're really into Python programming and data analysis. This class is not an easy A and it's not your go-to for an easy QR credit or a chill fifth class. I went to every single lecture and still ended up confused a lot. You've got to juggle two quizzes, three modules, and a homework assignment every week. I often had to go to office hours as well which means that including the two lectures and one set of office hours you are looking at 5 hours of class time (at the minimum and that doesn't include working on the assignments). And here's the kicker  because the workload is so heavy, we couldn't always cover everything in lectures or sections. This means you end up doing a lot of self-study to catch up or understand the material. \r\n\r\nProf. Park, though she knows her stuff, wasn't always the most approachable when it came to feedback about the workload. It felt like she took our feedback about the many assignments personally, rather than seeing it as constructive (especially towards the end she would express overt frustration with the class). The deadlines are also often arbitrarily pushed which adds to the confusing, disorganized nature of the course. \r\n\r\nIf you are taking the course my best piece of advice is to find a ULA who's teaching style works for you and stick with their office hours. For me this took a while as a couple of our ULAs would even bail on office hours early or get frustrated if you didn't understand concepts quick enough."
