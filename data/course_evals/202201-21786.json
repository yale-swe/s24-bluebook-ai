                "It seemed as though the topics taught in class were extremely overcomplicated for the level of knowledge we were starting with an for what we needed to know for exams. When we went over ideas I already had strong foundations in I realized how confusingly the material was being taught. I wish the material was taught in a more accessible way that is conducive to understanding. I think this is simply an issue of our professor being too smart! He did really want us to succeed I can tell, and he set up lots of support systems for us, however, lectures were extremely quick and convoluted.",
                "There was a severe lack of practice materials on each concept, which made preparing for the midterm and final very challenging.",
                "Lecture slides very theoretical and notation-heavy. This got in the way of fully understanding the course concepts at times in favor of rigorousness. However, if you read slides carefully the information is very accurate and descriptive.",
                "The biggest weakness is Roland Strausz. He is hands down the worst professor I have ever had, and dozens of my peers will echo that. He overcomplicates things, chooses to release materials in an odd manner thats not conducive to learning whatsoever, he is very confusing, and he is just the worst in every imaginable way.",
                "Strengths: Well, if you want an in-depth coverage of the mathematical side of the concepts youve learned in an introductory economics class, youll find it in this course.\r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Weaknesses: Huge lack of resources for getting practice and poor lecture notes. Also, having the final worth 50% of the grade with a lot of ambiguity surrounding the difficulty of the exam was a bit ridiculous. The instructor and TAs literally said the difficulty surrounding the final will be somewhat like the midterm (which was not true at all) and that the final was cumulative when it covered only 5 or less of the lectures in the course.  Also, the instructor and TAs either took a vacation to the Bahamas or blocked everyone on Ed during finals week because they did not respond to a single question on the discussion board during the days before the final, which I would think is the most crucial time to be responding.",
                "Strengths: clear structure, steady pace\r\nWeaknesses: overwhelmingly abstract at times",
                "The recorded lectures are a blessing. It is difficult to take notes because there are a lot of words for handwriting and a lot of equations/graphs for typing. No practice tests for exams sucked hard.",
                "The biggest concern that I had with this class was that Prof. Strausz refused to provide any practice problems for the midterm or the final. It was very hard to internalize everything simply by looking at the lecture slides and p-sets. I also felt that sometimes when students asked for clarifications about the exam, the professor became very combative and not very respectful of students' feelings. In general, the content of the class lacked clarity, the professor was not very understanding, and I felt a lack of support throughout the course. \r\n\r\nStrengths: the TFs made this class more bearable",
                "Course was not well taught. Lectures were unhelpful, provlem sets were not representative of exams, exam content was sporadic",
                "Strengths: Lagrange\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures could've been more clear, psets could've followed lectures better, practice materials for exams",
                "More practical application of concepts during section would have been good. However, the information was presented in an organized way during lecture.",
                "The course was well-organized, but there was no guidance for exams- no practice problems and the content was quite different from problem sets. So much weight was put on these exams, but it was extremely hard to study for them.",
                "Professor did not teach material well, I had to teach myself everything.",
                "The course would have been better if more practice questions were provided, especially for exams.",
                "Strengths: The course was somewhat well organized. I appreciated the recorded lectures Prof. Strauz made in addition to the in-person lectures. The psets were not unreasonably long.\r\nWeaknesses: While not too long, the later psets became too difficult for the scope of the class. A TA even admitted that the later psets were beyond an undergrad level. Furthermore, Prof. Strauz and the TAs were not especially helpful. If someone posed a question in Ed Discussions, it often was not answered very satisfyingly. Some concepts could have been explained more clearly, especially in the latter half of the course.",
                "Weaknesses was that it was taught super fast and professor never went over examples.",
                "Weaknesses: Very hard to grasp all the information in a cohesive manner, mostly got a lot of formulas",
                "Although the class did give an overview of intermediate microeconomic material, different parts of the class hugely varied in difficulty, some to the point of being quite hard to understand. While not inherently a problem, the aversion to giving practice material made it difficult to be able to understand how to do difficult material in practice.",
                "I was not super enamored by the testing and grading system. If 95% percent are guaranteed a B or A such that there needs to be a compensating effect in making the tests impossible, something is deeply wrong; would have preferred assessments that reflected the difficulty of what we learned in class rather than being always far more than what we did",
                "Could be better connected to real world situations, but overall well taught",
                "I think that this course could have spent a little longer on the materials we covered towards the end of the semester.",

                "Need more test practice material.",

                "The lectures are poorly taught, the slides are not comprehensive, the problem sets are far too difficult in comparison to the lecture material and the exams, we were not given any practice exams to prepare, the TAs gave little to no support.",
                "Better slides, more interactive material, inclusivity of exam-practice materials, and so much more.",
                "Strength is that every lecture is pre-recorded. Weakness is that the real time lectures are very hard to follow and that the psets are not reflective of exams",
                "This course did not facilitate student engagement and was not open for students to ask questions, etc.",
                "The course is too theoretical; lectures are useless and a waste of time, even after attending in person AND watching recordings. I might as well teach myself, which is what I ultimately did in the end.",
                "I think it could move a little slower",
                "Its intermediate micro. Lots of people just arent engaged and it is a hard class. Clear, well explained lectures are key. Prof. Strauzs recorded lectures were helpful.",
                "There are no strengths to professor strausz, maybe that he recorded lectures. weaknesses is that he expected way too much of us with extremely little guidance and absolutely no support",
                "I think Professor Strausz did a good job reasoning through specific examples for the mathematical application of concepts. However, it would have been helpful to spend more time on applying these concepts more generallythough section was helpful for this.",
                "Though we covered many topics, it was often difficult to understand how they could be applied to real life scenarios.",
                "It was purely mathematical with no regards to understanding of students. The grading distribution was also not good.",
                "Strengths: Problem sets were designed to really teach a deep understanding of the content \r\n\r\nWeakness: Lectures were not always related well to content on problem sets and overall students were unequipped to solve the problem sets on their own (even with a lot of time devotion)",
                "give more tangible examples.\r\ngive practice exams and problems to prepare for exams",
                "Strengths: Material was continuous and everything was on the slides\r\nWeaknesses: instructor was boring and did not support students enough. Questions went unanswered, no matter how much the TAs tried to help. His personality did not encourage questions and things were not explained clearly or intuitively. Problem sets did not receive clear feedback. There was little to no time to learn everything covered in this course.",
                "Teacher gave overly complicated lectures and little to no practice problems except one prob in section.",
                "I appreciated the way that Professor Strausz and the TAs found the material very interesting and wanted students to be interested in it as well. I think this class was poorly structured: the lectures were hard to follow as lecture slides were often filled with words and math and moved through way too quickly and section was too short to be able to delve into the breadth of the material. Office hours were all online which made it difficult to foster student collaboration, and the problem sets were often extremely confusing. I really wish that we had been given practice problems for both the midterm and the final as it would have helped my understanding to be able to practice the concepts and there were few opportunities (really just the 7 total problem sets) to do so.",
                "Lectures were portly done, absolutely no content went to the larger picture of understanding microeconomics",
                "This course is a requirement for many majors at Yale. I found the pace of the course as well as the way the information was conveyed to be confusing, difficult to follow, and often frustrating at times. There were no materials for students to practice with for the midterms or the finals. The p-sets were often far more advanced than the material covered in class, and sections didn't provide us with a time to ask questions about the p-set as they were all after the p-set due date.",
                "This was poorly taught i feel like i did not fully learn and internalize the material",
                "z",
                "I think this course needs the better organization of material. I found it challenging to connect the core concepts to the math, which made it difficult to internalize the math and apply it on the exams and psets.",
                "A strength of the course with Professor Strausz was that the problem sets and exams were very based off of the lectures slides, so if you understood what was gone over in class you were sure to do well on the exams.\r\n\r\nA weakness to me was how low stakes the problem sets are, and how high stakes the exams are as a result. I think it should be more balanced, because there is not a huge incentive to keep up with the material in the second half of the course as you go along but then the final is worth 50% of your grade.",
                "The lecture is hard to follow at times but that just may be the content itself that is not easy to understand. I think the lectures could be changed in a way that is more accessible and easy to understand. The office hours (TA and peer tutor and professor) were however very helpful to get a better understanding of the material as well as sections.",
                "This course inherently goes way too fast and there is a lot more math than suggested. There honestly should be a Multi Pre-Req.",
                "The weaknesses are that Roland Strausz was a really bad instructor and that the final is worth 50% of our grade and we only have two exams and just problem sets to determine our grade. The midterm occurs way too early in the semester to be a good indicator of understanding and the curve on the midterm was egregious. Sections also were not that helpful in strengthening understanding of the material."

                "If you need this course then I guess you simply have to take it, however, I would not recommend it for students who don't need it unless you are really talented and knowledgable in economics.",
                "I did not feel very interested in this course, the lectures were stale and there was no benefit to attending lecture compared to watching the recorded ones online. Unless this is a requirement, I would not take this course.",
                "Yes, if you're curious about economics of firms, individuals, and their interactions.",
                "You have to take it for the major, but don't take it with Roland or you'll hate yourself.",
                "If you need to take it, you kinda have to. I would not take it with this prof though.",
                "If youre an Econ major or would like to take an Econ class that has this course as a prerequisite, take it if Roland isnt teaching it because Ive heard the instructor in the fall is actually pretty good. If youre not an Econ major, Im giving you a genuine warning: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS, unless you enjoy pain, of course (maybe a bit of an exaggeration). In my opinion, the class was not exciting in any manner whatsoever. I took it because I thought learning about applying multivariable calculus to Econ would be interesting since Im a math major, but I was so wrong. You essentially apply the same mathematical technique (Lagrange multipliers)  and a little integration to different economic concepts for the entirety of the course. When we started a new lesson, I got my hopes up as the lecture would begin with a motivating example about how what youre about to learn can be applied to something significant like a Supreme Court case, but instead, the lecture would describe how you can determine how much utility will arise when a supposedly rational consumer who spends the entirety of their income and dignity on melons and coconuts purchases more coconuts than they can handle from a firm on some island that happens to have a monopoly on all coconuts in existence. And how would you determine this? You guessed it, Lagrange multipliers. By the time I realized this was how the entire course would be, it was too late to drop. If youre good at math and have some knowledge of multivariable calculus, the class is pretty easy, but the content is just not that interesting and really doesnt seem applicable to anything, so sitting through lecture is just painful. Maybe Im missing the point of how the economic models covered are applicable, but they seem way too general to have any real value. I never took Econ 115 (only took AP Econ in high school), but quite honestly, Econ 121 is pretty easy if you have a strong math background. I would recommend taking multivariable calculus before taking this class to truly appreciate the math; otherwise, youll just be plugging and chugging, which means studying for exams will be a load of memorizing techniques. Also, while this probably wont apply to future students because Im pretty sure Roland was only teaching this semester, I personally did not like his lectures. His lecture notes were also incoherent, so it was useless to try and read them over, and we never received any additional practice problems or practice exams, so your only way of testing your knowledge was redoing the problem sets. If Roland teaches the class again, he definitely needs to make his lecture notes more thorough. The problem sets were also way harder than the exams and the solutions to the problem sets used concepts that we did not cover in class at all. Its pretty easy to find good explanations of the content online, though. One good thing I can say about the course was that my discussion section leader (shoutout to Sophie) was very helpful and was always there to supplement the knowledge that was not provided in lecture. The other TAs were also pretty good and helpful when I could make it to office hours. In conclusion, you should shop it and see if its your thing because the content could be interesting to some people, but if youre not excited about the first few topics, I dont think it gets much better from there.",
                "Well, if you're taking this course, you probably don't have much of a choice. Make the most of it, get comfortable with Lagrangians, and hope you get an easy final.",
                "Yes; its a requirement for the Econ major and trains you to appreciate the mathematical models behind how economies work",
                "Yes! Its necessary for most econ related majors. If you don't intend to use much econ in your life there's no need to put yourself through the quantitative hassle, but otherwise it is foundational.",

                "Only if you have to",
                "I would recommend this course, but only if they had previously taken a course on economics, as the information learned is useful but needs proper basis with prior economic lessons,",
                "Only if necessary. The material is quite dry and the exams were very stressful.",

                "Outside of being an economics major, I would not recommend this course.",
                "Yes, but choosing a good professor is important",

                "I think in a different iteration I would recommend it, but this semester's class was poorly taught.",
                "Yes! Especially if youre interested in economics, this course provides a deeper analysis of a lot of fundamental tools that can be useful in other classes",
                "Take it only when it's taught by someone who speaks English as a native language! (They tend to revel less in the power of arcane symbols and technical gobbledegook) And make sure to attend sections or you'll have no idea what's flying. Otherwise, pretty good course - somewhat repetitive (be prepared to solve the same Lagrangian 1000 times over the course of the semester) but some of the theory is really cool - very much enjoyed learning about the Slutsky decomposition, for example, and the concepts behind modeling externalities.",
                "If you want to get a sense of an Econ class go for it",

                "No, unless you have to take it for your major.",
                "No I would not. To be honest, I wouldn't even recommend it to students that need it for their respective majors. This class made me change majors and is by far the worst class I have taken at Yale to date.",

                "I would recommend this course to a student who really wants to delve into the quantitative aspects of microeconomic theory.",

                "If interested in econ, you definitely should. If not, dont bother- you wont find out how to solve poverty or change the world",
                "yes as an econ major.",
                "I definitely dont recommend this course unless youre absolutely sure that doing maximization problems wont suck the life out of you. I think its just Professor Strausz though. He definitely did not make learning intuitive or easy. Only take this class if youre good at math. No review materials are posted before exams so if youre looking for practice problems, good luck finding them in the textbook.",

                "I would only recommend this course to Econ majors, who are required to take it anyway, just because of how specific it is to the field and how it's an application of a couple of mathematical principles to many econ situations.",
                "I would not recommend this course to anyone who has not had much calculus exposure except if it is a pre-requisite for a major.",
                "If its required, then yes.",
                "Not really useful unless you need to take the course. If you want a high-level understanding of microeconomics, then ECON 115 is sufficient.",
                "You need it for a requirement but take it with Eva I heard I don't know why we got the visiting professor. I enjoy multivariable calculus so I liked those problems but the whole game theory bit was really unnecessary and poorly taught. I recommend it in that it is just intro micro with calc so if you liked that class like me it won't be so bad but again the grading distribution of assignments is crazy."
