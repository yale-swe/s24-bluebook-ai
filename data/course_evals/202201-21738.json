                "I think a strength of the course is its free form nature. It also has sufficient guides to ensure progress. Perhaps, it could focus more strongly on the chosen theme of the semester.",
                "There is absolutely no quantifiable way to gage how well you are doing which to some may be aggravating. There was an even mix of grad/professional students which made for really interesting conversation and collaboration, though it sometimes created distance between the older and younger students which nobody seemed to make an effort to resolve. In a course like this, healthy working relationships are essential to successful collaboration, and some students seemed more focused on evolving their own vision than working with and supporting the group. The professors did little to mitigate that culture, or to set ground rules for respectful and community minded discussion and collaboration. The professors also know many of the artists we study/ guest lecturers personally which (while very cool) made it difficult for the class to feel comfortable critiquing their work, saying we didn't understand it, or saying that we had any less than a positive experience when speaking with them.",
                "Knowing at the outset (i.e. on the syllabus) that the final piece was to be about climate change would have been helpful and might have affected my choice to join the course.\r\n\r\nMore effort on community norms/trust-building earlier in the class prior to diving into improv activities would have helped group synergies and reduced some of the conflicts that came up\r\n\r\nI think we needed a bit more in-class time for small group performance development and rehearsal - every run-through of our etudes felt a bit too pressured and less generative than I would've wanted.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a bit more unstructured all-group discussion and performance development (talking through the logistics of the piece, what was on our mind) would have been nice. Like maybe a group presentation/sharing that wasn't a specifically creative work but just things we were thinking about.\r\n\r\nA bit more access to tech (specifically cameras and video editing software/studios + a quick intro to them or how to use IT support) might have been helpful with our video work.\r\n\r\nMore of a focus on race, class, queerness would have been nice. In comparing this to my other class - black queer performance studies - this class leaned much more on the side of practical theater studies texts than theory/critical studies/etc, which I think had both benefits and drawbacks. Still, in the readings that we did have, I think there could be more attention to having contemporary examples of critical humanities scholarship re:arts & putting that in conversation with what we were watching. That's my face was a good start, but definitely could have used more.",
                "This course was really interesting in principle but I think struggled in execution. Not having a film professor limited the extent to which we were able to experiment with our own work and I think perhaps we would have benefitted by spending more time explicitly with dance and theater instead of in film, where there was less infrastructure to support student work. I also struggled with the group I was placed in and there was no room for movement or feedback in the process which became very frustrating when it was clear we had different goals."

For many of the exercises you must be able bodied which seemed like a restriction for some of the students, so keep that in mind and communicate with the professors early if you are worried about engagement or may need and accommodation. Go in with curiosity, a voice which allows you to advocate for your ideas, and a lot of buzzwords up your sleeve, and you'll be fine. Most people said it was an unforgettable experience (in a good way)!",
