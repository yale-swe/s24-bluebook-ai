                "We learned about amplifiers, MOSFETs, and BJTs mainly, as well as how they operate together to make more complex circuits.",
                "This course is about amplifiers, their characteristics, how we implement them using basic electronic circuits, and how those building blocks have been miniaturized and optimized today to construct the ICs that power the world. Skills include circuit analysis (large signal + small signal), bench top electrical measurement and testing, electrical schematic capture, circuit design, breadboarding, oscilloscopes, power supplies, function generators.",
                "I was able to gain a deeper understand of transistors and different configurations which allow for integrated circuits such as Op Amps to work. I was able to learn how to do circuit analysis on amplifiers and feedback circuits which are essential to signal processing and data collection. This was helpful in lab where I frequently use sensor circuits for data processing and collection."

                "The labs for this course were much more organized than previous classes I have taken in the department, and I thought the homework was pretty helpful in solidifying the material. Professor Xia sometimes lost me during lecture, though.",
                "strengths\r\n- prof xia\r\n- TAs\r\n- extremely organized class (we had all deadlines by the beginning of semester and ALL were fulfilled)\r\n- fair amount of work\r\n- fair grading",
                "Pretty standard stuff for an EE course. Reasonable length homework, reasonable exams, and the labs were much better than the 203 labs. Most labs only took about 2 hours instead of the full 3, and were way less tedious and more informative than 203 labs.",
                "This course was effective in the ways it presents the content. The slides are always to the point with minimal fluff. The homeworks reflect the example problems from class as well as the exam content very well. This means that EENG 325 is one of the few EE courses where students are not forced to put in excessive amount of extra work to understand the course content, as long as they are comfortable with the details of the homework problems and regularly attend lectures.",
                "I think a big strength is the order in which we were taught the material. It followed a logical path which allowed me to make connections with other material effectively."

                "Yes, this course is a great culmination of things covered across the intro EENG 2xx series. I would also recommend taking this course before EENG 310 and 320 so that you have a good practical foundation for most of the technical material relevant to EE hardware internships early on in your undergrad career (interviews and applying for research positions becomes easier if you can mention that you are comfortable with basic circuit design, amplifier topologies, etc).",
                "To students who want to major in electrical engineering, I highly recommend this course. The teacher, Professor Xia, is very effective and clearly communicates and ideas and concepts. He also does well at answering question. This course also made me feel very confident in my circuit analysis in real life examples and applications."
