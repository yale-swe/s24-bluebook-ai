                "This was a great course. Professor Lafferty and Khusainova explained the concepts clearly and were always responsive and available to meet. The assignments were engaging, fair, and challenging. I cannot think of areas of improvement. It was an excellent class.",
                "The course did a really good job offering a crash course to coding and stats. At times, the math was hard to follow virtually and it was tough to answer some of the stats questions on the pset but the coding portion was awesome. I wish there was a central resource we could use to see all the commands we has used, but that wasn't a barrier to my understanding.",
                "A good intro to python. Theory and application coverage are well-balanced and complement each other very nicely.",
                "I think overall it was a good course to learn about python and be introduced to datascience. I think it would have been more beneficial to learn python from pandas instead of from a different package.",
                "The course is structured well for learning, especially for those with no computer science background. Lectures can be a little slow and dry, but otherwise the course is enjoyable and a great way to get some more experience with coding and data science.",
                "I feel it is harder to learn coding virtually, but overall the course was very organized and straightforward. The office hours were helpful and both John and Elena were great.",
                "The course was a good starter for python/statistics but the lectures were a repeat of the textbook and given how short the textbook chapters are, it is almost more worth your time to read the textbook and use office hours as needed for clarification.",
                "Lots of office hours, teaching staff very eager to help",
                "Strengths: the curriculum design was fantastic. The recorded lectures, online textbook, and psets were all really well-made and designed towards learning. The amount of time spend covering the basics of Python was generous and quite helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: the projects were really just extra homework assignments, there were no creative aspects to them (i.e. you couldn't choose project topics, they were preset like in the psets). Also this could have been due to being fully online this semester but I found the course format to be extremely unengaging, and some of the lectures were particularly dry.",
                "I hated this class so much, I don't know how to describe how excruciating it was. This is not a gut. \r\n\r\nThe instructors were helpful, it was just hard to be in a large lecture virtually. I think this class would have been fine not during the pandemic.",
                "Very strong course on giving a well rounded intro to data science.",
                "Strengths - the textbook was easy to read and explained stuff well \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Course was pretty badly organized. Assignments took forever to get returned, expectations for the midterm and final were not clearly communicated, the professors changed one of the midterm questions midway through the exam, after many people had already finished it, which changed the correct answer. Then, they refused to answer Ed Discussions questions about the change for multiple days while students speculated if their memories of the question being different were correct. The textbook was updated halfway through the course which changed many of the reading assignments and led to broken links on the course website. If Yale is trying to make YDATA an important course in their new datascience initiative, they could put more effort into it. A worse copycat than CS50. Also, why call it 'Y' data if it's directly lifted from UC Berkeley.",
                "This course is very strictly organized and everything follows a clear schedule. The work is consistent and office hours are regular. If you are not familiar with python or data science, they start from the beginning but it moves very quickly. I signed up for this course thinking that it would be an easy QR credit. It is not. A lot of people take this class if they are a CS major or a Stat major and to them I think it is quite easy. For someone who isn't familiar with STEM in general, this course was really difficult for me. I wouldn't say that is necessarily a weakness of the course, but it isn't really designed for people with absolutely zero STEM background.",
                "Strengths - no reading.  Assumed no background knowledge, so approachable.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - super dry (altho i think that is just the material).  The exams were hard and I think writing code is kinda dumb on principle.  I wish the exams were more like the psets.",
                "Strengths: both Professors Lafferty and Khusainova have mastered the art of introducing content and then immediately demonstrating how those concepts or tools can be applied. The structure of the course (3 days a week, 50-min lectures) was surprisingly more effective than I recall. I never got the chance to feel bored in class and it always seemed to zoom (haha unintentional pun) by. I also liked how they always had a review lecture before exams. Bless them for structuring the course so nicely. And bless the TFs and ULAs for being so helpful. The support network for this class was iron wrought. This class was incredibly well organized and I was constantly impressed by how completely and lucidly concepts were presented. The professors also sought to make sure students who wanted project partners received them; that was just one example of how the teaching staff went above and beyond.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes on psets, I would receive different answers from the ULAs/TFs and the professors. This was a little confusing, but the one time I recall it, they gave credit for both true/false answers on that pset question because of their miscommunication. I think that there wasn't a strong community of S&DS 123 students outside of going to lecture and office hours, which is the only thing I wish I had more of.",
                "It was well structured and made very accessible.",
                "Strengths: the class is very organized and runs smoothly. The textbook is great and very useful. The workload is manageable; the problem sets and projects are not challenging. Weaknesses: Sometimes the lectures follow the readings exactly so are not very engaging. It also would have been helpful to learn pandas instead of the datascience package.",
                "great structure and great content",
                "It was a well-designed and engaging course! My only suggestion is to release HW and project answer keys for studying purposes, because I wasnt always told why I lost points",
                "I really appreciated the amount of office hours held and the discussion boards the help throughout the class.  The only thing I would change maybe is the amount of assignments, as it was very easy to feel overwhelmed or swamped by how much was going on.",
                "I honestly didnt watch the lectures and just read the textbook and did pretty well in the course",
                "Strengths: everything. There was amazing support from the TA's, a plethora of office hours, both textbook and lectures were clear and easy to follow. The only weakness was that it couldn't have been in person.",
                "This course provided numerous opportunities through class demos, problem sets, and projects to practice the coding skills necessary for the class which was very helpful for a student who had no experience coding in Python prior to the course. Also, the class uses a variety of real-world examples, such as sports or disease statistics with COVID-19, to reinforce the concepts from class.",
                "Strengths are the breadth of topics. Weaknesses are the depth.",
                "Strengths: good pacing, especially for total beginners (I had absolutely zero stats or CS background). Good lecturers. HW/Projects were always challenging but not draining.",
                "You really do learn to use of python the biggest weakness is that the exams don't really match up with the psets and the skills you are learning from them.",
                "I would like to focus on the stat part of the class because I still dont understand some of the calculations like the sample sizing despite reading the textbook as well.",
                "This course was incredibly engaging and well-taught, but I do wish we learned more about the Python language itself. There were some parts of the lectures whose code they gave us but didn't necessarily explain.",
                "The course spent too much time going over very basic concepts that students already should have known, especially in the beginning.",
                "I'm not sure if tutoring was offered for this course, but I know some students had difficulty and it would be a real boon to include.",
                "Strengths: Really good introduction for someone who has no experience with python, both the professors were very good explainers and very open to answering questions, Psets and projects really reflected the material taught and weren't too bad. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only weakness really was that it was a somewhat basic introduction to python. Perfect for beginners, but if you're someone with a background in programming it will probably be too introductory",
                "Gave a strong overview, but sometimes felt like the deeper conceptual understanding was glossed over",
                "Strengths: They have this class down to a science. Tons of office hours, Ed Discussion is super helpful, the demos and textbook were great! So are the professors! I literally can only think of strengths. I was new to data science and stats and coding, and I loved this class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "I think this course was very straightforward which worked well with the sometimes complicated subject matter.",
                "Assignments were doable for a coding class, especially for someone without coding experience",
                "The course is well structured and keeps students engaged but I think some of the statistics topics werent explained very clearly which made understanding difficult.",
                "It was a very engaging course and I enjoyed the format. However, it was very fast paced and required that you stay on top of all the material.",
                "i think this was a great introduction to python and statistics, but when I would show the course's content to my friends in computer science or data science, many said that this way of teaching was not very efficient and that there were much easier ways of doing the problems assigned.",
                "There were a lot of office hours that were extremely helpful for completing psets and answering questions",
                "I think that this course does what it sets out to do. That said, I think more CS demonstrations of statistical facts (such as CLT) would be cool.",
                "I do not like how many lectures there are, I would rather longer lectures but fewer of them.",
                "strengths: the materials are synced with UC Berkley's Data 8 so there are a lot of resources available\r\nweakness: not enough office hours throughout the week and the class didn't really explain the statistical concept well. It feels like a brush, more emphasis on the coding",
                "This course was very well organized",
                "The materials are very well prepared. I dont get why the solutions are not provided for practice problems.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The course, since it is based on Berkeley's Data8 course, is very well documented\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Sometimes there was too much focus on the code and not enough on why we were doing what we were doing",
                "In general the questions on assignments and tests could have been more clear and well-worded.",
                "The homework was fine. The ULAs are helpful and the professors are nice. The exams were tough but not impossible.",
                "Lecture is slow and could be sped up. The slides available aren't particularly helpful."

                "Recording the lectures was tremendously helpful but having the option for live virtual lectures was also great.",
                "It would've been nice to be paired with a partner for every project or had more group activities, but for the most part it was fine.",
                "Please record lectures even after the pandemic.",
                "Office hours, and please post more midterm and final practice tests",
                "The virtual office hours were convenient and helpful. Would recommend getting a second screen if it were virtual again as it is difficult to have your code and the professor's code on a single screen.",
                "Everything was fine.",
                "Pretty well adapted for pandemic teaching",
                "As someone who is not STEM-y, I find that working with other people on PSETS and Projects is really helpful. COVID made this hard. Especially because it was impossible to meet anyone. If I had taken this class with a friend it would have been bearable. Alone it was awful.",
                "All were good.",
                "Recorded lectures were helpful and lectures slides and examples were always easy to access online. There were also a lot of office hour times, which were helpful when doing the homework assignments. I think they could have used more structured midterm and final review sessions.",
                "Supported: shorter but more frequent lectures; lecture slides posted at the start of class to follow along; combination of demos and new content every class; interaction via discussion questions mid-lecture\r\nCould have been improved: not much. I wish that the professors office hours weren't at their specific times since I could never make 12-1pm Mon or Wed. As a result, I felt like I didn't get to know the professors at all. I feel like COVID has robbed me of knowing my professors as well as I could have, which hurts a lot.",
                "They worked great! Makes sense given we were able to go through the demos together. I'm sure this was fairly similar to regular class.",
                "Professors were accessible and engaging even through the screen",
                "The lectures being recorded helped immensely.",
                "The Zoom virtual lecture format coupled with numerous office hours for professors, TFs, and peer tutors was very helpful and effective for this course.",
                "This class was pretty perfect for the COVID environment. Rewatching lecture videos helped me a lot in preparing for exams.",
                "Definitely keep the option of recorded lectures",
                "The Ed discussions and recorded lectures were helpful",
                "Most of it wasnt impacted, since the course is so computer based anyway.",
                "The live virtual lectures were fine, especially for a course about computer programming. My only complaint is that the only times we ever did any coding was during the homework. Maybe having the students write some of the code in-class will help with better mastery of the subject.",
                "The adjustment to online learning worked very well for this class. The lectures were engaging, them being recorded was nice, and there were lots of office hours held where people could get any help or ask questions.",
                "I liked the ability to return to recorded lectures on subjects that I was still confused about",
                "Great test management, ed discussion worked super well, great at answering questions during class. I give them an A for their management of online courses.",
                "I think that the demos available to us were a good way to follow along.",
                "Virtual lectures could have been switched up a little to keep engagement",
                "I enjoyed the course format.",
                "The virtual office hours were very helpful",

                "I think the setup was good given the pandemic",
                "The fact that there were really no required synchronous part of the class allowed it to be very accessible to all time zones across the world to accomodate for remote learning.",

                "Yes. This is an engaging and challenging class but at no point did it become too overwhelming or difficult to handle (especially for a non stem major like myself). This skills that you learn are tremendously important and applicable and the professors are great. It is definitely not a gut, but it is not extremely difficult. It is the right amount of challenging.",
                "Sure! Good introduction to data science using Python as it is the standard course across many other colleges. However, I would recommend that having even a little bit of background in CS/Python first would probably be the best.",
                "Absolutely. It was a great introduction to both python and stats.",
                "Yes, because it provides a light yet insightful look into Data Science and helps students learn some basics to a useful programming language.",
                "YES! Lafferty and Khusainova are great at dumbing things down. It's a good intro to python.",
                "Yes, I enjoyed learning about python and datascience since I never had any instruction on it before. Worth trying but it is not everyone's cup of tea",
                "Yes -- this is a great introductory course for getting your computer science and data science knowledge up, and the professors are great.",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed it. It is well-staffed by people who are very helpful.",
                "If you want to try out an S&DS class this one isn't bad at all but its also very surface level so otherwise you may not get much out of it.",
                "Yes, basic python was very helpful",
                "Yes, though you get out of it what you want. Great class to CR/D, especially if you're looking to learn Python but perhaps have a busy semester and aren't as interested in the stats side.",
                "No. Not interesting, a lot of work. Don't take this for the QR requirement. \r\n\r\nIf you're interested in data science, I'm sure this course would be fine!",
                "Yes, I think it's imperative to have the understanding of this course's subjects in the modern world.",
                "Probably not. Unless you want to half-learn statistics and half-learn python.",
                "Not if you are not a STEM major. If you have a background in CS, Statistics, or data science, I think think course is quite fair and easy to get a good grade in. If you are like me and a humanities major looking for a QR credit, this is not an easy credit. It requires a lot of continuous engagement with the course that is quite boring and difficult if you are not interested in the material.",
                "If you need an intro stats & programming course then yes.  I took it having taken other stats courses to learn Python which made it more chill.  It is a solid course, but definitely not super engaging.  Not super hard, but not a gut.",
                "Yes!! I think this is one of those classes everyone should take because it introduces you to two fundamental things. First, statistical concepts. These are so important just in being able to consciously consume information and realize that a correlation may be portrayed as a causation... but that doesn't make it one. Second, Python! Such an accessible way to learn data science applications with coding and I'm glad I took this course. The midterm is not super tough, but you should know the content thoroughly before you do the practice exams (ie don't get behind on lecture content). The projects are so rewarding too because you get to work with datasets of bicycles, heart disease, flights, etc.",
                "Yes. Great class to learn the basics.",
                "Yes. I had no background or experience in data analysis or statistics (not even in high school), and this course served as an accessible and easy introduction. I would highly recommend it to people looking for a QR credit or people who are interested in taking an intro S&DS class.",
                "yes, it's a great elective for non-datascience/computer science majors",
                "Yes, especially if youre new to coding/nervous about coding but want to learn. Profs are always willing to answer questions abt technical issues and dont judge at all",
                "One of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. I had little data science knowledge before this course, but this has given me so much understanding.  Never once did I feel 'lost' or 'out of my depth'. The material was easy to follow and the code was easy to review. The lectures were well-paced. Highy recommend",
                "I would recommend this course to a student that is interested in learning the fundamentals of coding in Python and an introduction to statistics.",
                "Not during Covid.",
                "Yes, you learn important rules and practices in statistics, and its not too much work",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because of the real-world applications of this course. Not only did I learn more about prior experiments or current events through the data analysis sets used in this class, but I also have a foundation of statistics skills that I can use in the future for a variety of different applications.",
                "Yes! If you know nothing about data science this is a good first step.",
                "Yes. It's a great intro to stats, Python, and data science. If you're familiar with any one of the three, it'll be easy, and if not, you will learn a ton fast. Wouldn't tell you to take this if you're just looking for a QR, but if you're actually interested in learning about data science, 100% recommend. Not super time intensive, but get a good amount out of the class.",
                "If they want to learn python yes but I would recommend having a background in statistics before otherwise the second half of the semester is quite difficult.",
                "Yes! Very good for python, but try to study the math/stats and logic behind it yourself.",
                "Absolutely! There are so many analytical skills you learn and you gain a deeper appreciation for the math/logic behind studies.",
                "Good course to really learn how to use python 3 and a good pace. It uses real life scenarios and data to help understand the practical uses of coding in data analysis and is generally just really fun to learn if youre into it.",
                "Yes if you didnt have any statistical background!",
                "Nope. The course tries to be both stats and CS, but kind of fails at both. Other students Ive talked to seem to find stats 230 much better at bridging these fields.",
                "Yes, it was fun and I thought it was useful knowledge for work in the digital age.",
                "If you don't have too much programming/data analysis experience I would absolutely recommend this course. I had never even used python before and I feel like it gave me a really good introduction. That being said, if you're someone with some prior knowledge, this course might be too introductory for you, it is definitely geared towards students with little to no background.",
                "If they wanted an introduction to coding and an introduction to stats. At times it was a little confusing, but I still felt like I left with a better grasp on the basic material.",
                "100% yes!! If you are new to coding or stats, this is the class for you. I'm not going into academia so I decided I wanted to learn python instead of R. I think it was the right call, and I loved the class. The textbook and demos are fantastic, and the class goes at a good speed for learning. I really enjoyed the class, the Professors Khusainova and Lafferty were wonderful and kind, and I just loved it. I never thought I would say that about CS, but yes!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I feel like many coding courses can be intimidating but this was a very good introduction.",
                "Yes great for introductory stats while also learning how to code a little",
                "Yes I thought it was a good intro to data science.",
                "Yes, if you are willing to put in the necessary work, it was a good learning experience",
                "yes",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone because of the computing and coding skills introduced.",
                "Yes, provides good fundamentals to coding and stats",
                "Good for premed students interested in trying out programming",
                "I would recommend this course to someone with some, but not a lot, of CS/statistics knowledge.",
                "Yes, great foundation for coding/stats with a good amount of challenge, but not too much for it to be unreasonable.",
                "Yes, it's a good intro class to Python and statistics",
                "This is a very interesting course for introduction to coding and data science",
                "I likely wouldn't recommend this course to another student.",
                "Yes; knowledge in data science and/or programming is becoming an incredibly important skill nowadays, and this class is a great introduction into both",
                "For those want to learn statistics, yes",
                "One of the easiest As Ive gotten at Yale.",
                "Yes, it is a very beginner friendly in terms of math and coding, and still stimulating even if not a beginner in those fields",
                "Yes, if you need a computational course for the neuroscience major, this one isnt too bad.",
