I gained a better understanding of how to write clearly at a college level. I was exposed to a host of ideas and texts, from the politics of collections to material environments in decolonization to Marxian theory to Homo faber and more.",
                "This course really developed my writing discipline and skills while also helping me learn how to schedule my writing and use the resources that are available at yale.",
                "This was a very intellectual course which I really enjoyed. It discussed topics and authors that I had never been exposed to, presented vocabulary and ways of speaking and discussing that I really learned from. I learned a lot about what resources and facilities that available to me at Yale but overall this was a perfect introductory course to start my first semester with."

                "Strengths: dense and deeply insightful discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I believe the course's coordination with the other 6PGX classes could improve and feedback could be clearer.",
                "Strengths: The last four modules were quite successful because the concepts layered on top of one another. Ideas of techne and epistime in the Odyssey led to Arendt and Homo faber, Marx, the fetishization of commodities, Hegel, commodities organized as collections, and the house as a place of production. There was a very clear line between the texts, making discussions quite intellectually satisfying.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The Friday lab sessions were relatively unorganized. I think we need more writing practice sets - those were quite helpful. The library module needs to be thrown out and replaced with another module. Also, I think the class needs to find more non-western texts that are actually useful and interesting. The library module had a few non-western texts but they didn't involve that much reading and they were not very interesting. Perhaps start with the Capitol, then go directly into the ship. Surely there are interesting Chinese narratives for the capitol and ship, right?",
                "The course was really broad and abstract and I feel that a landed main idea couldve helped the conversations flow better even though those ideas were often given by professor F.",
                "I really like the small size of the seminar and how deep our discussions were able to get. I thoroughly enjoyed all of the readings which worked so well with one another. It was never a stretch to make connections within the seminar portion of the course. I would perhaps like a little more emphasis on the personal writing process and how to improve it but otherwise, this course was a pleasure."

                "Yes, especially after a year where the instructors can revise the course material. It really opened my eyes to a world of ideas previously unknown to me. Furthermore, it gave me a unique introduction to the humanities which I otherwise would not have received.",
                "I would recommend the course for anyone wanting to increase their writing skills and looking to widen their thinking.",
