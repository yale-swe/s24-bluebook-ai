                "Each week of the semester had students read and engage with very interesting and niche works of art, many of which were very interesting. The weekly discussion posts did a good job of getting students to complete the assigned texts before class, although it was fairly clear (to me at least) when some students were just using AI to write everything for them. The free-flowing nature of discussion did lend itself to going off on tangents and it often felt as if we had departed heavily from what was actually present in the art, and solely speculating based on inclinations.",
                "I think the content selection was very good, but I think that student discussion could be increased by asking for questions students had on the texts rather than only opinions.",
                "I like that it only met once a week for a longer period (2hrs). It allowed ample time for readings and facilitated a deep discussion during class. I kind of wish the class discussion hadn't been as reliant on student presentations, though, because sometimes the presentations missed the point of the reading.",
                "I loved the course as it was. More feedback could have been helpful, but Professor Syrimis hosts regular office hours and is always happy to chat.",
                "A strength is that the course material was very interesting each week. I really liked that students structured the discussions each week. However, I feel like the discussions got off track at times and that some students dominated, preventing other people from sharing their thoughts."

                "I would recommend this course, but definitely look through some of the works (especially for later weeks) before deciding to take the class. Some of the works were intentionally chosen to challenge one's preconceived notions of what is appropriate for a seminar discussion, and as a result, were pretty uncomfortable reads/watches. If you don't want to engage with something outside of your comfort zone, this is not the best class to take.",
                "Yes if you want to take something completely different and learn and read things you never thought you would read.",

                "I highly recommend this class! I learned a lot about reception, and honestly had a lot of fun. We talked about interesting topics I've never discussed in any of my other classes at Yale over 4 years, and Prof. Syrimis is wonderful! This is one of my favorite courses that I've been able to take."
