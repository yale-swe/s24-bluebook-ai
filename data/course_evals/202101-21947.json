                "The classroom environment is really engaging and you learn a lot about the dialect and cultural nuances. \r\nOn the other hand, grading is unclear--no feedback is provided on tests, so you don't always understand why you received a certain grade or what you can improve on in the future to avoid that grade. Additionally, sometimes there would be assignments due that were not explicitly mentioned on the schedule. I think the schedule is a really useful resource for students, so it would be a good idea to update it each time there is a change/addition of an assignment. Lastly, deadlines for submitting assignments are kind of weird--on two days of the week, you have to submit your work midday, while you have to submit your work by midnight on the other days. Since we have daily assignments, I think that all homework should be due at midnight each time. It just makes scheduling/getting work done more manageable to have a consistent daily deadline.",

                "I appreciated how the instructor worked to make the class engaging. We would converse in break-out rooms multiple times during each class, which was good practice.\r\nThat being said, sometimes such work felt rather repetitive; you would converse with one classmate, go to another break-out room and discuss the same thing, and then go to the main room to discuss the same thing as a class. It might be worthwhile to change topics that are being discussed to make sure that students are challenging themselves to use new sentence structures and vocabulary."
