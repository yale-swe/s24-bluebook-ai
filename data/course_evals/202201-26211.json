                "Ben Polak is great.",
                "As with anything they teach, the biggest strengths were Ben Polak and Joyee Deb. They're just so fun as lecturers that it's easy to pay attention. The biggest weakness was probably just logistical. This was the first time the course was taught, so it's understandable that things might not run so smoothly, but a couple psets didn't have solutions before the end of the course, and the profs office hours, while super helpful, were at incontinent times relative to when the psets released (e.g., pset due Thursday, office hours Friday morning, next pset comes out Friday afternoon).",
                "Strengths: the topics were very interesting\r\nWeaknesses: we only had 3 problem sets, but since this is the first semester this class is offered, I imagine it would be more organized in the future",
                "There was not as much structure to this course as ECON 159 (which is to be expected, since it was a continuation of the course into interesting applications more than its own independent course). The material was pretty slow at the beginning but then sped up at the end a little too quickly. Otherwise it was interesting and a lot of fun!",
                "The content was super interesting, although it was not very applied (similar level of \"appliedness\" as Econ 159). Some topics were really cool and relevant to other aspects of life. This is definitely because it was the first year, but the course lacked some organization: it was often unclear what problem sets were due when, and it was really hard to study for the final in advance\/understand what would be on it (and in the end, after taking the final, I think it would have been quite hard to study those concepts). Professors and TA are awesome!",
                "This course was short, and I think it being only a half-term class worked to its detriment. The material was interesting, but the policy pieces that were so engaging were downplayed in the effort to cover difficult topics in game theory in a timely manner. Additionally, the problem sets were very short, and not returned prior to examination, which made preparation extremely stressful, and increased the likelihood of seeing problems we had never practiced before. I think students would have preferred longer problem sets where we could sample every kind of question to shorter ones that took up less week time, but left us more prepared for an exam. Additionally, the departure in this course from the purely \"Econ and math\" introduction to game theory was perhaps one of the best parts, and investment as well as testing on that material would have left me with a better opportunity to showcase my knowledge\/effort in the course.",
                "Strengths: Both Prof. Polak and Deb lecture very well. They go at a reasonable pace and explain clearly. Overall the class was structured pretty well, especially for its first iteration.\r\nWeaknesses: The final exam seemed a bit too much given what we learned in lecture and problem sets. Additionally, a flipped classroom was only done for the first problem set. It could have been clearer what information we were responsible for and what we werent.",
                "More feedback on Psets.",
                "Both professors are amazing lecturers. More practice on problems would have been nice.",
                "I think the strongest part of the course are the games played in class. They were engaging and made lectures interesting. The weakness of the course was that it seemed a little rough around the edges, likely due to the courses novelty.",
                "More feedback on Psets and more Psets on things that show up on the exam. Game Theory is a topic thats really learned by doing exercises and felt like there were too few of those in the course."

                "If you enjoyed ECON 159 and are up for a challenge, this course is perfect. The two professors are engaging and both clearly care about the content. Concepts were more difficult than 159 and lectures were a little faster.",
                "I'd recommend it to a student who loved Game Theory and wants more of it, with the caveat that hopefully next year there will be more study material and things will be more organized beforehand.",
                "Yes. I think following an experimental first semester, with two amazing professors, this class will be one of the must-take courses at Yale. However, in this term, the lack of feedback, as well as lack of opportunity to practice concepts that were incredibly new and unfamiliar to most students due to the short problem sets and lack of practice exam, made it a somewhat stressful experience.",
                "Yes, I absolutely would. I thought this was a perfect continuation of ECON 159: Game Theory, and actually enjoyed it more than the first course! Great class with Profs. Polak and Deb!",
