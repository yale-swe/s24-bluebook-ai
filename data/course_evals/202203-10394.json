                "This class taught me SO much about modern South Asian history and contemporary culture/politics in a really approachable way. Rohit is like an insanely engaging lecturer, and I never once felt the desire to skip his classes. The course begins around independence from Britain and weaves a lot of recurring themes throughout the history of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh together up until the present day. As a South Asian American who was born and brought up in the United States by parents who were born in India, I was surprised by how much new information I learned.",
                "This was a super insightful course, and I learned so much about the history of South Asia post-partition, as expected. He presented many differing views on all of the topics, and it was a very nuanced look at the class material. I feel very lucky to have learned about this material in such an unbiased and insightful setting.",
                "Learned about India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh since 1947. I feel like I have enough knowledge now to confidently talk about these countries in conversation, etc. Professor De also frequently did analysis of primary sources in class, which I think was beneficial just in general (as I have to do primary source analysis in many other classes).",
                "This course was very content-rich and provided an expansive overview of contemporary Indian and Pakistani history (political, social, cultural, etc.)",
                "Knowledge about Indian history & contemporary politics",
                "I learnt about the modern history of India and Pakistan, how these two countries have developed since partition, and how to consider multiple historical perspectives while studying modern history. I also developed writing and critical evaluation skills, and the ability to recognize history through almost any source or experience that occured during this time.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Everything! This is the best class I have ever taken at Yale by far. Professor De is an inspiring lecturer and he always asks for input from the class. The assignments allow you to be creative, and the readings do a great job of capturing varied viewpoints.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe final is quite a time crunch!",
                "The course is fantastic! It really is not super difficult honestly, and the teaching staff does a good job of 1. telling you which readings to prioritize and 2. summarizing the important points of the readings in section. I will say that this course is probably way more difficult for someone who is not of a South Asian background, as there is a lot of contextual knowledge that Rohit/the TFs kind of gloss over. It's definitely still doable -- the non-South Asian students in the class were often the most prepared and most engaged students in lecture and section, and I'm sure they got some of the highest grades in the class -- but they definitely needed to put in more work than the rest of us. That being said, if you are of South Asian descent, and have even a really small amount of background knowledge on the region from your parents, it's super interesting to take this class and fill in a lot of the gaps in knowledge that you may have. Additionally, Rohit approaches the history that he teaches from a holistic standpoint, weaving together a lot of themes, so it's cool to trace those throughout history. I think the workload of the course is perfect! You definitely need to come to class and section, and do at least the main reading for each lecture. Aside from that and the occasional, short writing assignments, the course workload is very manageable. The two exams are very approachable, and I think that Rohit/the TFs are very understanding people!!",
                "Strengths-- prof de!! Teaching assistants!! drawing on art/movies/ads/books etc as real sources for learning about history!\r\nWeaknesses-- (this is to be expected, but covering all of India/pak/bangladesh in one semester is hard to do without rushing some of it and focusing on India). I also think we often didn't get feedback or grades until very late which causes some anxiety if you're worried about how you're doing.",
                "This class is great! The material and lectures are perfect. The assignments are alright and manageable, but students would greatly benefit from having some more guidance on assignments, or some more feedback. We didn't get most of our assignments back, even ones from October, before class ended.",
                "Strengths: Professor De, organization of lectures (inclusion of primary source analysis, student participation)\r\nWeakness: did not receive any feedback on assignments before the final besides the midterm",
                "Strengths: great content, good readings, lively class discussions\r\nWeaknesses: we did not receive any feedback/grades on our two essays; sometimes expectations were not clearly communicated; the course felt a bit disorganized sometimes",
                "Strengths: highly structured lessons.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: little if any feedback on class assignments, no timely grades.",
                "This course was amazing! It was very well organised, lectures were very engaging (and still contained an element of discussion), and all the topics and material covered were so interesting. Professor De is a brilliant professor, and the discussion sections really allowed me to learn so much, so I didn't really miss the close, intimate feeling of a seminar. This was definitely my favorite class I've taken at Yale so far!",
                "Strengths: Prof. De is an engaging and energetic lecturer! Additionally, I enjoyed how he connected the course material to current events in South Asia.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish students received more frequent feedback on their work throughout the course. Other than grades and comments for the midterm, there was little feedback on written assignments. Additionally, I thought that the final exam was a bit long: perhaps 2 essays instead of 3 would be more fitting for the 3 hours allotted time (similar to the final exam of another history course that I have taken, which allotted 3.5 hours for 2 essays of 1000 words each)."

                "1000%, especially if you have any ties to the region, you will learn so much and everyone should take a class with Professor De.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone, but I really can only speak to the experience of taking this course as a person of South Asian descent living in the US. I would not say that I came into the course knowing much about South Asian history aside from super basic knowledge about the Partition, the Indian government, and a vague familiarity with the names of some important people. That being said, the course's enrollment is heavily skewed toward South Asian students, so Rohit and the TFs tend to occasionally speed past information that may be difficult for someone with less cultural background to keep up with. It is by no means impossible to do well in the class if you're not South Asian, but it is easier to do well in the class while doing a lot less prep for the lectures/sections/exams if you have a bit of that cultural context. I would say that the pro of the course kind of leaning toward having a bit of that cultural context is that it makes it even more interesting and engaging for South Asian students. There is an extremely limited number of South Asian Studies courses at Yale, which is such a shame, so it's wonderful to have the opportunity to finally walk into a lecture and really understand the full context behind the content of the course.",
                "Yes, yes, and yes. Professor De is an amazing lecturer and you can tell he really cares about his students. The exams include a book review of a novel, a simulation, and a movie review alongside in-class essays, which I found to be really interesting. Professor De moves quickly but everything is so well-organized that you can follow along, and you'll end the class feeling like a real expert on India and Pakistan post-1947. All in all, Professor De's course is one of the best I've ever taken at Yale. I enthusiastically recommend it!",
                "yes!! take it for prof de-- he is amazing to talk to about anything related to South Asia/legal history/honestly anything. The TFs were also a vibe. You learn so much and its clear people care more about you learning than about being punitive about grades/deadlines etc.",
                "YESYESYES! If you have any interest in this history, this class is worth it. As a stem major, I didn't love how reading-heavy this class was, but it was so worth it.",
                "Yes definitely. If you have absolutely any interest in South Asia, this course is great for you. Professor De is also wonderful, so take this class to have him as your professor!",
                "Yes! It is so interesting to learn about, Professor De is a brilliant professor, and it is very well taught. It is a good amount of work but it feels very worth it. This was the best class I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes. This is a great course to take if you are interested in South Asian history. Additionally, if you are interested legal history, this course may also be a good choice because Prof. De frequently discusses constitution-making, court cases, and the role of the judiciary in India and Pakistan."
