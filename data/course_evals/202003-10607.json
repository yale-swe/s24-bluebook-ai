I learned about the history of understanding differences in infinity, and how gradually certain assumptions became popularized in fields of science.",

I was taught to question how exactly we know things and how much we can stretch our knowledge in order to understand the concept of infinity. I learned how to craft arguments and explanations in a succinct and organized way. This course also provided a review\/investigation into mathematical topics that was quite enjoyable and applicable.

For a class with no prerequisites, the beginning of the class almost scared me off with the math. The second half of the course was more philosophical which I enjoyed more.",

The content is immediately interesting and thought-provoking, which makes analysis of the arguments all the more fruitful.\r\nW - The lecture format got a bit repetitive sometimes",

                "This course was definitely harder than I expected. My TF was very helpful in section and otherwise, but the lecture slides were generally confusing and the lectures were not well-explained.",
                "This was one of the most enjoyable courses I have taken at Yale! The questions we dealt with were fascinating, and the problems we had to solve were more like games than homework - it was really interesting to think them through alone and in groups. Also, Professor Maxwell and our TA's were clearly very enthusiastic and engaged with the material, and that made it all the more exciting to think about the material as a student.",
                "I thought the material was quite good. I thought the pset questions were ok, but the midterm was a bit weird. It was more of a time crunch than anything and I found the grading to be rather weird.",
                "The professor and teaching fellows were greatgood explanations of complex concepts, very accommodating to student needs, and great about stopping for questions and discussion after a good amount of content had been covered. The midterm covered and asked a lot in only an hour, but the questions were fair and the curve was generous. The only weakness for this course would be the time it took to get back our graded problem sets. It wasn't too much of a problem until the end of the semester when students were left unsure where their grades stood for the class.",
                "As a Humanities major, I felt a little lost in this class. Of course thats not the fault of the class, but I definitely think it wouldve been helpful to either include more detailed, extensive explanations of various concepts for those who arent already familiar, or change the description of the class to indicate to prospective students that a little bit more familiarity with mathematical concepts is expected.",
                "There should have been some sort of mathematical prerequisite to this course, because a lot of time was spent reviewing the basic math. A lot of questions that have been resolved were posed but not answered, which was somewhat disappointing. More discussion about the place of infinity in the physical rather than metaphysical world(s) would also have been nice.",
                "The course was very thorough and did a really good job of explaining very complex themes and problems. It was engaging and the readings helped to understand the lectures better. However, I found it difficult to learn from my mistakes on problem sets\/tests\/papers because the feedback was sparse or unclear, requiring me to meet with my TA.",
                "I appreciated how the professor would star or place a question mark on the presentation slides with information that we were expected to know. This division between supplemental information and crucial information allowed me to more effective study for exams and prepare for discussion section. The discussion sections were very helpful in enforcing my understanding of the material. Allowing students in the section to lead the conversation and guide it in a direction we wanted to investigate increased engagement.",
                "The course started off in quite a dull way with huge amounts of mathematical proof but it proved useful later on in the course. I do prefer the philosophy side of the course."

The sections were also very helpful, and it was refreshing to get to discuss the material in a smaller group, even over Zoom.",

Having live lectures + uploading the recorded sessions is the most ideal lecture format in my opinion. The discussion sections were great for clarification and expansion of the concepts covered in class. My TF did a great job at facilitating casual conversation guided by genuine student interest while also hammering down on the concepts we needed to understand for the class. The midterm was offered in two proctored sessions: one during regular class time and an alternate session at a time voted on by students that could not make it to the first.

At times we even dive into some of the math so that the intuition behind philosophical claims make sense, and I found myself relying on mathematical reasoning a lot when attempting to support certain claims. While the class is in philosophy, I felt like the class is geared more towards people who enjoy math and its related concepts.",

I can see how it would not be fun for someone that's not a fan of math, for the first part of the class focused a lot on set theory and required proofs on the homework. We also covered some geometry, calculus, and statistics. This class would also not be fun for someone that does not like thinking about philosophical issues, as this class consisted largely of paradoxes involving infinity. If neither of those are an issue, or if you are looking for something different\/a challenge, then I recommend this class. There will be a lot of support from the teaching staff and no previous experience with any of the topics covered in the class is assumed, so you can feel comfortable in your decision to take this class regardless of your academic background.  If you are unsure about it, the topics covered in this class were really interesting and it would be worth at least shopping this class to see what it is about.",
