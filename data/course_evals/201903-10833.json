    "The basics of microeconomics and how to think critically about factors of production and labor markets",
    "basic econ skills -- some topics include, labor market, capital market, market structure, information signaling, etc",
    "A relatively thorough foundation in the principles of microeconomics, including production, market structures, and factors of production.",
    "I learned about Microeconomics.",
    "Basic introductory economics skills, like supply and demand, utility, labor, capital, different market models, etc.",
    "I developed a basic understanding of economic concepts and how they apply to real life. The course was really helpful to make sense of how the economic decisions are made and what factors should go into decision-making.",
    "My critical thinking skills were sharpened and I found myself truly engaged with the class material which made it easier to apply economic concepts to real-life situations and become better situated with the material.",
    "I learned the foundation of economics and different economic systems.",
    "Everything. I learned a ton in Economics. Ranging from simple supply and demand to Heuristics and the the labor market, I feel I have a very solid understanding of consumer centric economics.",
    "economic analysis of capital, labor, and product markets; price, tax, and subsidy calculation and analysis; thorough understanding of the fundamentals of microecon"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: online lectures to view after class were very helpful\r\nWeaknesses: more practice problems and applications could be given out. The textbook was also very confusing and not a helpful resource",
    "strength: very well organized lecture, interesting content\r\nweakness: lots of content covered, not enough practice problems given",
    "This course covers every topic relatively well, but it is not as thorough as it should be (and as the textbook was written) in a lot of areas.",
    "Strengths: Engaging professor and general applicability of topic to life\r\nWeaknesses: Not a lot of student interaction within the class.",
    "A lot of students who previously took econ are in this class, so it's difficult if this is your first econ class.",
    "Strengths - i learned a ton about microeconomics. I feel prepared for next semester\/year  \r\nWeaknesses - the curve isn't great; you really have to keep up on the readings and stay proactive on your studying.",
    "It was great that this course is a seminar. That is the biggest strength. The opportunity to engage with the professor and ask questions is significant.",
    "This course was very engaging due to the deep level of knowledge demonstrated by the professor. The fact that economic concepts were applied to real-life scenarios and many examples were given was incredibly helpful. Furthermore, the small class size allowed for greater understanding and allowed for engaging class discussion that went beyond plain facts already presented by the textbook.",
    "The course was very well taught and informative.",
    "Greatest strength was the teacher. Professor Koker was an amazing professor and did an incredible job of making sure his students understood his lessons. Weakness was the competitive grading curve (which can't really be avoided) as I feel I have a very solid understanding of Economics yet my grade doesn't display that as much as I may have liked it to.",
    "The course moves rather quickly (as it must) and the material can be daunting to students with a weak math background. The textbook price is high for students on fixed incomes, but overall the information is worth the investment. The understanding of market structure was the strongest part of the course and understanding unique cases was the least attended to"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Very good overview into economics and good learning environment in the smaller seminar",
    "Yes, if you want to build fundamental knowledge for micro econ, strongly recommend",
    "Yes, but I would recommend it with the caveat that the benefits of taking the seminar over the lecture are relatively limited in my opinion.",
    "Yes! I loved this course and Tolga's teaching style. It made sense to me, and I could see its application to real world scenarios.",
    "Yes! Highly recommend the seminar, especially for first-years and prospective economics majors, as it keeps them more engaged in the course and ultimately helps them gain a greater knowledge of the material.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. First, because of the small class size. This seminar was great and I think if someone wants to learn Econ, they should take the seminar class, so that they can get involved in discussions and develop a deeper understanding. The second reason is the way the course is thought. Professor Koker is an amazing professor. With him, classes did not feel like classes. Everything was very smooth and he seemed everything look easy.",
    "Yes. Economics is a course that one cannot regret taking because it applies to so many real life scenarios. The workload was very manageable and the professor's willingness to go out of his way to make sure each and every student understood the material being taught was evident. Furthermore, the examples given by the professor and the relation made to his own life experiences made the each class engaging and successful in getting the concepts across.",
    "I definitely would because it is geared towards helping students gather a deep understanding of the economy.",
    "Yes. It was brilliantly taught and of very interesting material.",
    "Any student taking this course should be prepared to pour hours into study for the tests (more so than other classes) and must be able to exhibit a strong comprehension of economic math. The course offers an amazing insight into how supply, demand, and market interruption synthesize, so I would highly recommend this class to students interested in those subjects."
