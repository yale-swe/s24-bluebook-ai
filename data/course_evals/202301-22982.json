In the weeks that covered art that I had learned in past courses, I re-thinking and criticizing the approaches I assumed were the norm. I think the course has a difficult balance between learning what the reading's overarching theories are and thinking critically about what these theories are missing/not missing. I think returning to works of art to apply the week's theories helped. I also think that it may be good to present on only one or two of the readings each week. Sometimes, there is so much content that it is difficult to analyze the reading and extract the critical approach in every reading."
