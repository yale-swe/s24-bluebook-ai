I felt like I was learning applicable skills and about very relevant topics. The collaborative nature of the class made it really enjoyable as well. The only thing is I wish there was a brief time allocated, maybe a homework assignment or one day, to review grammar structure as we move through the units.",

                "Strengths: Low-stress course that actually valued conversing and discussions to facilitate language learning\r\nWeaknesses: Since it meets everyday, there are daily homework assignments and projects/writing assignments at times which drags on after awhile.",
