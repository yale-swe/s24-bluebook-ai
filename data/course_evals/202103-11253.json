                "The size and consistency of the course made engagement and keeping up easy.",
                "The format of this course is absolutely fantastic--there is a perfect balance of written work, tests, language exchange meetings, films, etc. that provided a very balanced and engaging semester of Italian. The opportunity to practice Italian in so many different situations was invaluable.",
                "I really enjoyed the language exchange component of this class as well as all the lessons about Italian life and culture. This made the class really fun. Deborah is also a huge strength. She is really an incredible professor who cares so much about your development in the class and about your personal interests.",
                "Strengths: Deborah's instruction, partner activities in class, thoughtful projects, weekly compositions\r\n\r\nAreas of Improvement: not many to say to be honest, this course is well-structured so that students get out of it what they put into it.",
                "The strengths of this class were the variety of different assignments / projects that were assigned. Class never felt very stale and a lot of time was devoted towards discussion which made participating and learning much more fun. Review material for exams could be strengthened as most times the class would be given the review material a day or two before the exam, which made it more difficult to be ready to ask questions in class.",
                "I think that this course is very well designed, in that it goes over a lot of the grammar learned in L1 and L2 while also including more engagement with the language, including more reading, writing, and analysis assignments. The one hesitancy I had with the course this semester was in the language exchange program. While useful in theory, it became a hassle to schedule meetings and difficult to find things to talk about.",

                "Yes! I love the italian department and would encourage it as a language to anyone.",
                "Absolutely--especially with Prof. Pellegrino. The course has a fantastic structure and is broken up by activities and small trips that make the experience extremely enjoyable.",
                "Yes!! This was my favorite italian class this far so if youve already taken some itaian, definitely take this class. If youre deciding on a language, the italian department is full of really wonderful professors and youll learn so much about the culture and history of Italy in addition to the language. Taking italian has been one of my favorite experiences at Yale.",
                "Yes. As far as language classes go, the workload is not bad (so I'm told - can't say I've taken other language courses, but this definitely isn't nearly as work-heavy as something like Chinese). Deborah is an engaging and fair instructor, and she is passionate about the language and culture (and this goes for the other instructors in the department too from my experience). The exams are a bit of a time crunch but aren't bad otherwise; the final is neither a time crunch nor too difficult. Assignments are numerous but fair in difficulty. The in-class experience is good and feels pretty low-stakes; just keep up with the exercises that are assigned, and you shouldn't have much trouble. \r\n\r\nOverall, my experience completing the language requirement was good, and I'd recommend it to other students.",
                "I would recommend it. Most people who take L3 Italian are still taking it to fulfill a language requirement, and Italian is the best language at Yale. The quality of instructors across the board is superb.",
                "I would highly recommend this course as it is very rewarding while also being very fun.",
                "If you're taking Italian, L3 is a great course to continue with. If you have the time to meet four to five times a week (depending on how asynchronous learning goes), I recommend it.",
                "Absolutely; Italian is a great language to study at Yale and I enjoyed this course a lot"
