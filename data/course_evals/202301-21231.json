            "comments": [
                "Strengths: students make a variety of compounds including medically relevant ones; Weaknesses: grading on EPs seems very arbitrary still and especially on post-lab assignments, the instructions were not very clear (professor contradicted TA at times, TA and document said different things and two different instruction documents was very confusing). I also felt like we did essentially the same experimental procedure each week with little variation, once we heated with oil but besides that it felt very repetitive.",
                "After the first semester of orgo lab, this semester was much more fulfilling. You are doing full syntheses pretty much every week, and the labs are still around the same length.",
                "Strengths: very well organized, labs reinforce concepts covered in lecture. Lab staff are helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Post lab assignments seem to have an unnecessarily large focus on formatting and style.",
                "Strengths: incredible TA, Dr DiMeglio is wonderful in every way, course was improved a lot this year\r\nWeaknesses: reading assignments and in person learning did not equip us to do well on most quizzes, EPs should be complete / incomplete b/c theyre not very intellectually stimulating and I dont think grading them makes us try harder or learn more",
                "Strengths: Dr. D is a joy to be around. The labs were low-stress and a nice way to decompress and do some fun chemistry. You get to make some recognizable compounds, like acetaminophen. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Your TA will dictate much of your experience in this class. I was fortunate enough to have a lovely TA who graded fairly and emphasized learning, but I have heard frustration from classmates with other TAs. The quizzes will have typographic errors and blurry images, and test arbitrary details from the pre-lab notes. That being said, it's doable, especially with the dropped quiz.",
                "Strengths: very easy to follow. Many of the same techniques (vacuum filtration) to obtain products were reused throughout the course. This ensured that I knew what I was doing (I felt confident in the lab). The labs were interesting and not tedious. Many labs were partnered. \r\n\r\nWeakness: pre lab assignments are a bit of work, but once you get the hang of it, you're good",
                "I felt like the strengths of the course included the instruction of the material, the kindness of the professors and TA, and the welcoming environment that really facilitated learning in the space. The main weakness of the course was the high workload and the difficulty of the quizzes which didn't correspond to the 0.5 credit and level of instruction in every case.",
                "The course was conducive to student learning under supervision; Teddy, Teresa, and Dr. DiMeglio were constantly available to support students throughout each lab. \r\nThe one suggestion I have is to try to improve the regularity of feedback and grading, particularly with regard to assignments like quizzes, so that students are able to adapt and do better if they find that they are struggling at any point.",
                "It was well organized and easy to follow.",
                "Clarity and uniformity of formatting requirements must be improved, they seem to be subject to the TAs interpretation and they could stand to be more standardized with appropriate templates or typical ACS formatting.",
                "Strengths: very well-organized, interesting labs, good guidance\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been good to practice column chromatography a bit more because this is a huge part of organic synthesis and usually takes more time than the reactions themselves. However, we did not do it once in the second semester.",
                "Strengths: Prof. DiMeglio and the entire Teaching Staff are INCREDIBLE. I have never been in a lab environment where I felt so safe and supported in simply asking a dumb question or clarifying something. They are all absolutely amazing and truly care about the community. Weaknesses: none",
                "The course was much better structured than last semester. I was able to learn a lot more this semester.",
                "The in-lab portion of this course is fun, educational, organized, and efficient. However, the work assigned outside of lab is way too much for a half credit course. This course would be much better if it were either made a full credit or if the post-lab assignments were removed or if we were given experimental plans rather than having to make our own (although I do this the EPs are educational and a good skill). The post-labs barely reach us anything except how to follow the very specific formatting requirements of the course. In a real-world context, a journals editors would help us format things properly, so even following such directions isnt that important of a skill. The formatting requirements for everything and the large amounts of points deducted for not following them are unnecessary and certainly not of proportionate educational value.",
                "It is hard to improve this class because I think it is largely as good as a lab class can get. The one thing would be the Post Labs. These are a very large part of our grade, but are not graded based on understanding or knowledge, but almost entirely on small formatting issues. People lost points for starting sentences with numbers, for font differences, and not adding elements in the report that were not asked for in the prompt. If post labs were graded better the class would be great.",
                "I really enjoyed this course and thought the experiments were both fun and intellectually stimulating. The only thing I would improve is that I think the quizzes were unnecessarily difficult and the grading on some assignments was pretty arbitrary.",
                "Dr. DiMeglio is fantastic. She is attentive to students' needs and very helpful. The course was well organized.",
                "No weaknesses!\r\n\r\nSo many strengths, but I especially enjoyed not having to do tedious lab reports after every lab. I understood the material without writing 15 pages!",
                "Well-taught and gives us the proper amount of independence to be able to fully develop the skills needed in a chemistry lab.",
                "Strength: supportive, helpful staff\r\nWeaknesses None",
                "I felt that the quizzes we took were a big part of the grade and not always reflective of grasp of course in the lab given the time crunch! Other than that, I really thought that the small section structure of the class was beneficial to individual learning. I also liked working with a lab partner.",
                "Strengths: interesting experiences. Weaknesses: TAs are harsh on grading.",
                "Strengths: expectations and assignments were clear, strong support from teaching staff, engaging activities in lab; Weaknesses: none.",
                "Could be improved with clearer grading standards and giving students access to rubrics",
                "Strengths: labs were super straightforward and it was great to actually be able to synthesize products and understand why it worked and what the mechanism is. The workload was very minimal and doable, which made it a great learning environment. This has been my favorite lab so far. There were no weaknesses.",
                "The organization of this course is outstanding - the modules and EPs make sure you know exactly what is expected of you well ahead of your lab time, reducing stress both in and out of the lab. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I'm worried about is coordinating quiz content properly between students in the sophomore and freshman organic chemistry courses. Some of the last few assessments relied on information that hadn't been introduced to the freshman class yet (e.g., reactivity of the alpha carbon in carbonyl compounds, etc.) - it would have been helpful to give students the heads up so they could learn the new content in advance, whether that's through an announcement or a handout.",
                "I appreciated the way the course was organized and would not change it.",
                "Strengths: professor who cares about her students a lot and makes the lab a smooth process. Also very fun \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the quiz questions are unreasonably difficult and the grade cutoffs are not very generous. A lot of tedious/busy work in the class that it sometimes felt like a whole credit instead of just 0.5.",
                "The strength of this class is that you really get a hands-on experience of what it is like is an organic chemistry lab, which really helps with furthering your understanding of chemistry in general. There are not really any weaknesses to this class as the workload and materials are pretty fair.",
                "Strengths: Pretty enjoyable, labs matched the lecture material\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the work felt like busy work",
                "Some of the EPs feel extremely tedious, but if you survived CHEM 222L, they really won't be bad. The experiments are WAY more fun though!",
                "This class was a lot of fun! It follows the curriculum of Orgo II more closely and you get to apply what you learned in class to lab. The quizzes were difficult, but if you study the course packet and class content you can get a good score on it. The workload is also not bad at all until post lab reports come around, but Christine releases them in advance so that you can get started on them early.",
                "The course is thoroughly taught and exposes students to organic chemistry lab techniques through hands-on teaching in addition to supervision.",
                "Strengths: Dr. D's labs are so well-organized and centered on student learning; her passion for teaching and putting experience and learning before grades is so apparent by how much I (and basically all of my fellow peers) enjoyed our lab experiences\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: really no weaknesses here, although I will say grading is so heavily dependent on your TF -- but I do think Dr. D tries to recalibrate section grades at the end of the semester if there are blatant differences in TF grading between lab sections",
                "This course is a great way of practicing laboratory techniques.",
                "The strength of the course is that it is really organized. The pre-lab work prepares you for lab every week, and the time spent in lab was reasonable. The weakness of the course would be the quizzes which were a bit difficult. It was hard not knowing what to study, and sometimes material on quizzes were specific.",
                "One strength is the independence each student receives.",
                "Strengths: small lab groups facilitate learning, prelab lectures are very helpful\r\nCons: quizzes felt unnecessarily fast",
                "This course was organized well and I felt prepared for each lab. I think having more details for post-lab assignments would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: student engagement, interesting material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: slow grading of assignments at times",
                "I wish I had received feedback for lab reports earlier because I would make the same mistakes on the next few lab reports because I would have already turned them in by the time I received the feedback on the first one.",
                "I think this class is great. There are lots of office hours, which is really helpful.",
                "Maybe more examples on how to properly conduct scientific writing would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: very well organized, great TAs, accessible resources, amazing communication from Dr DiMeglio, consistent office hours, consistent class structure. Weaknesses: quizzes were hard because first year ochem lecture was consistently 2 lectures behind lab content, scientific writing guide for post lab assignments is overwhelming for small details like formatting and writing style directions",
                "I think that the grading is rather variable, meaning that there are so many small details that are evaluated, but with large papers like lab reports it's hard to know what to focus on. The course does do a good job preparing for this, by publishing templates and instructions.\r\n\r\nHowever I think that if there was some way to be able to revise assignments based on feedback and perhaps get some credit for revising, it would help balance the variable feedback with learning and improvement.",
                "I found all the labs to be quite instructive, although I felt inadequately prepared for the quizzes.",
                "Interesting work!",
                "This course was truly one of the worst designed courses I have taken at my time at Yale so far. Not only was it terribly designed and overall awfully communicated with a multitude of contradicting documents and unclear and unstated expectations but it also was unable to foster a learning environment. It neglected the fundamental mandate of teaching lab skills and instead attempts to poorly recap and inadequately assess content from the lecture course, with quizzes designed not to test or learn but rather as an unnecessary attempt to introduce academic rigor on topics fully outside the scope of the class. The staff, while extremely helpful in the lab, from the purposes of actually teaching and properly assessing work displayed incompetence of the highest order, with variation between the staff well-exceeding what is to be expected from such a fundamental course in the curriculum. My suggestion would be a careful redesign of the entire course to ensure that it truly focuses on the Lab part of the course and removal of the unnecessary and poorly designed organic chemistry knowledge assessment components. The staff of Organic Chemistry Lecture are more than competent  at their jobs and therefore the staff of this course should not feel as though they need to cover those components as well. I am sincerely disappointed in this course, the labs were fun and well-thought out, yet it felt like they weren't the focus of the staff, and that is a major flaw that needs to be fixed.",
                "This course requires a lot of work and attention to detail with the pre-lab assignments, which can be very arduous. But very informative and learned a lot about different chemistry concepts.",
                "making the expectations for post lab much more clear.",
                "I think that this course's layout is wonderful for the information that it teaches. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "This course was very engaging and I overall enjoyed it quite a lot. However, there were times when I felt that the assignments felt repetitive, especially between the EP and lab notes. Other than that, I learned a lot between this course and lecture. The lab quizzes could be quite difficult at times, since the time limit was rough.",
                "Strengths: The support systems in this course were by all standards amazing and they helped me keep going and perform my best at all times. Dr. Dimeglio and Dr. Clark are two of the most understanding, kind, supportive, and knowledgeable instructors I have ever had in my life so I was lucky to have them in this course. They are both amazing on both the professional and the personal levels.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think that the course can be adapted to allow more room for exploration of diverse interests. I also think that grading can be better restructured in a way that gives the actual lab work more credit than quick 10-minute quizzing performed late at night after an exhausting lab day. Also, the timing of the quizzing can be changed a bit to make it more flexible for students who have commitments post lab.",
                "This lab really helped me understand the concepts that were taught in organic chemistry lecture when they aligned well. Most of the time, they were well aligned and I could apply the lecture material to lab reports and vice versa. However, during the times when the lecture and the lab did not align, I was left a little confused in lab when we ran the reactions.",
                "Strengths-\r\n1. How closely students work with the TF in lab and how available the TF is to students outside of lab.\r\n2. How often students repeat techniques in lab\r\n\r\nWeakness\r\n1. The only weakness of the lab is the 10 minute quizzes. It doesn't allow time for students to truly engage with the material and often results in unintentional mistakes due to the extremely short period of time allowed to take the quizzes. Also, there used to be an option to take the quizzes twice and only record the highest grade. That is no longer an option, so the 10 minute quizzes are even more stressful and sometimes not an accurate depiction of how much the student remembers/knows the material.",
                "Some strengths are that the labs are well-designed and easy to follow, and the grading is not unfair. Working with partners was a great way to learn the content in a much more efficient and productive manner. The experiments were fun to learn about and carry out as well.",
                "I loved the way this course was organized and how we learned new skills every week."

                "Yeah; it's just a continuation of orgo 1 lab and I felt as if I solidified the techniques learned and gained more experience with them. It is more chill than orgo 1 lab in my opinion because you know what to expect and are used to the weekly schedule.",
                "Most people don't elect to take this course.",
                "Yes. This lab is relatively chill. Only two post-lab assignments, and weekly labs are interesting and engaging.",
                "If it's required, yes",
                "Yes. It's fun, low-stress outside of the post-labs, and honestly super relaxing.",
                "Yes. This lab course was engaging, not too hard, and actually fun. (didn't take too long)",
                "This course provides an interesting, hands-on lens to the synthesis that we learn about in the lecture courses. Would recommend it to students who are interested in the subject and who have the time do work thoroughly on the assignments!",
                "Yes, it was an interesting course for someone interested in chemistry",
                "Yes if they are interested in organic chemistry skills. Otherwise, I don't see why you would take this.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed the class even though it was a requirement, it was a wonderful way to spend my time",
                "Only if you have to take it or if you enjoy working with your hands.",
                "You probably have to take the course, but its not too terrible. Much better than gen chem lab obviously and many of the stressful parts of first semester orgo lab are second nature now.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in chemistry or need it as a requirement. This is probably the chemistry lab course with the lowest workload.",
                "YES. It was so fun and genuinely not stressful at all. I loved it!",
                "Yes, to supplement organic chemistry II lecture.",
                "Yes, if you have taken lab for Orgo 1, this lab is basically the same except more chill since you already know what to do and what to look for half of the labs you basically do the same procedure and the only thing that really changes are the starting compounds you use.",
                "I think that this lab sequence was a good continuation of CHEM 222L and would recommend this to another student. The course structure facilitated individual learning, and I felt sufficiently challenged.",
                "No. Don't take unless you absolutely need to for med school or your major.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I thought that the teaching staff was excellent and the instructions and expectations for labs were clear. The experiments were engaging and I learned a lot. The course was very analogous to the lecture.",
                "no",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! This is the first chemistry lab class where I feel like I've been truly able to apply my knowledge. It was really cool to actually conduct the reactions we learn in class and fully understand why it worked! It was a very purposeful lab and was extremely rewarding.",
                "I would as long as the skills being introduced are relevant to the student's career and/or major - as a chemistry major, this course helped me feel a lot more confident in the techniques I'll need to know for conducting research in the future, but people pursuing other fields would naturally benefit from focusing on other methods.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it is great for learning the fundamentals of organic chemistry lab techniques.",
                "I would recommend to anyone premed and/or a chem major.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. However, as it is not an introductory course, most people are going to take it regardless. It is much more enjoyable compared to the first organic chemistry lab as you already know how to conduct some of the experiments so you are really focusing on the content now.",
                "I would. I think this course being 0.5 credits was accurate, unlike some labs that are definitely 1 credit worth of work. If you took orgo lab first semester and are trying to decide whether or not you should take it again, I would go ahead and take this class. In general, I found it more enjoyable than the first semester and did not dread going to lab.",
                "Yes! Good experiments, and if you stay on top of the bigger assignments, it's really not a problem.",
                "Yes - it's a great extension of Orgo I lab!",
                "Yes! Orgo lab is lots of fun and if youre taking the class you should take the lab",
                "For a student looking to dip into organic chemistry lab techniques, this course is a perfect fit.",
                "Yes, would highly recommend this course if you are a chem major or need another orgo lab for premed! Very easy and chill course that is also really engaging",
                "I would definitely recommend this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student taking organic chemistry 2. It was an excellent course that corresponded with lecture perfectly and also helped to solidify topics learned in lecture.",
                "Definitely! Much more fun the gen chem lab",
                "Yes, it supplements the lecture course well.",
                "I definitely would. Being in lab is a unique experience and offers skills that cant be learned elsewhere.",
                "If they want to feel more comfortable in a lab or if it is required for their major",
                "I'd say yes! Apart from your actual lab day, you don't have much work outside of class, just the weekly EPs - which go by faster once you get the hang of them. The class environment is also pretty chill, and the TFs were always super helpful.",
                "Yes! Its a great course! Best follow up to 222L where all those techniques become muscle memory. Lots of partner labs! Quite fun!",
                "Yes!! Honestly a great class to introduce to organic chemistry lab techniques.",
                "This course is necessary for many students and therefore it is not something that many take by choice. That being said, for students taking this course, there are a couple points of advice I would recommend in order to survive. First of all, ask previous students about your assigned TA, and change to another section ASAP if possible. The single deciding factor for your performance in this class is not effort, it is your TA, and although they suggest that grades are normalized by TAs, that is highly doubtful. Second, your primary focus in this class, at all times, should be the memorization and execution of all formatting rules, as outlined in the in the over 15 page guide. Scientific inaccuracies and lab skills are secondary to these incredibly important and necessary formatting rules, ensure that every assignment has the exact formatting down to the punctuation as TAs apparently assess these more carefully than teaching the important content. Finally, simply study every known scientific literature surrounding the weeks lab in order to answer the weekly quiz, and ensure that you read the questions quickly. Lab skills and practical chemistry are less important than reading and analyzing a paragraph length question on theoretical chemistry that was never taught nor has any bearing on the actual lab itself, all in less than a minute.",
                "Yes, if you want a perspective of organic chemistry that is applicable to real fields",
                "Yess so fun just a tad time consuming especially if you don't cut any corners.",
                "I would recommend this course to students taking the lecture component, since there is quite a bit overlap between the experiments and lecture content, although more heavily focused on topics covered earlier in the semester.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. This course facilitates your understanding of organic chemistry with hands-on experience with many of the techniques that are commonly used to perform the reactions that you learn about in lecture.",
                "Yes; this is a great lab to solidify lab techniques. The TFs are all very nice, helpful, and available.",
                "Yes, if you are required to take it definitely worth taking with Dr. DiMeglio. This class is well-taught and helps reinforce concepts in organic chemistry lecture.",
                "If you have to take orgo 2, definitely take this lab!!  It'll really help with your conceptual understanding and make the subject more bearable."
