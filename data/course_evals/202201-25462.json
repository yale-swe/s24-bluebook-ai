                "In this class, I learned much more about strategies of structure and effective articulation in writing. Through the close readings and writing exercises, I have learned more about what makes a good writer, how to create a message with impact, how to use a tone that is convincing, and how to articulate my ideas into tangible English words.",

I gained insights related to writing with my reader(s) in mind, writing from a place/position/identity near me. Skills-wise, I became more comfortable reading and writing modern essays aside from the typical research/academic-oriented papers that are very common in the Yale classroom.",
                "This class truly changed the way I see writing and reading and helped me develop a newfound appreciation for both. I really loved the way the class was structured into five \"themes,\" and that we got to read samples of writing from each theme before trying it ourselves. Rather than read to merely absorb information, this class encourages you to read and pay attention to the effect that the author's words have on you, as well as the strategies they employ to achieve that effect. In terms of skills gained, I learned how to analyze a text for main ideas and purpose, weigh the pros and cons of employing certain literary strategies and formats, and structure my own writing in a way that best conveys my purpose."

                "Unclear grading outcomes.",
                "The workshopping essays was great. Loved hearing what others were writing and getting their own feedback on my writing. One thing I might change would be the order of the essays - the first paper (self-portrait) was the hardest to write because I didnt really feel ready to write about that yet, whereas starting with the portrait of someone else/place essay mightve been easier",
                "Strengths: workshop format, balance of reading and writing; weaknesses: stressful grading",
                "Strengths: this course really pushes you to be critical during every discussion and every time you write! It is challenging, but you really grow as a writer within the course of one semester. The workshop process (discussing another students work) is especially a strength because you get to critique another persons work and reflect back on yours\r\nWeaknesses: I sometimes wished there was more time in-class to write and workshop. Class time was heavily focused on discussing readings, which was useful, but we didnt get much time to practice writing ourselves in class",
                "Strengths: I loved the variety of essays we were able to read, and the feedback we received on essays was in-depth, clear and always quite helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: a wide variety of readings to discuss and learn from each session; the pacing of essays allows for ample time to write, get feedback, and revise; in general, class materials were pretty accessible.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of many."

                "Yes, some of the discussions were fun and I think I improved my writing. It did slightly feel like more serious essay topics were more likely to give you a better grade than the more trivial essay topics but I enjoyed the course overall.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this course to any student willing to work fairly hard to improve their writing and develop an appreciation for modern essays",
                "I would recommend this course to any student! It is just a great class to sharpen your writing practices, as well as be exposed to different types of writing styles from classmates and other assigned readings. It is also a great way to receive clear feedback from peers and your professor, so you can understand how your writing can become more effective.",
                "Absolutely! It was a very challenging class, but a very rewarding one as well. You get so much feedback from your professor & peers throughout the semester, and you can always approach your professor for further questions on ways to improve your draft. The selected readings are also very thought-provoking about the world (not merely exemplary in technique).",
                "I would recommend this course! It's a good introduction for those not super familiar with creative writing, and the personal nature of the essays we wrote also allowed me to do a lot of personal reflection that I found fulfilling.",
                "Highly recommend! ENGL120 is an amazing WR credit and you'll see how many new writing techniques and insights you gain, especially with Professor Baynes-Ross as your instructor you'll receive clear and timely feedback on all your submissions. Of course, the quality of the work you produce is contingent upon the time you put into class but overall you'll become so much more equipped to write at and outside of Yale. This course is probably one of the most enlightening that I've taken.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student! The experiences we read about represented a wide array of authors with various backgrounds-- some very well-known, and some lesser known, including some former Yale students. The writing we read in this class effectively helped me, and I'm sure other students, view the world from other people's eyes, as we touched on important topics such as racism, cultural assimilation, and mourning loss. All pieces provided such a unique perspective on a wide variety of other topics too, such as school, video games, and food, and I have a much deeper appreciation for all of these things now having taken this class."
