Although this is the structure of L5, I greatly enjoyed the class and wanted to have it more! \r\nThe design of the class was the greatest strength. I always knew what to expect and felt that I was set up for success."

                "Definitely- I think this course took the language of learning to the next step. I was able to engage more with specific topics of Indonesia and learned a ton about what it would be like if I actually went to Indonesia."
