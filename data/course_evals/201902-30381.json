   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very gradual intro to biostatistics. It is slightly back-loaded but granted it is accelerated for a reason. The professor and TF are very accessible.",
    "I believe the instructor was phenomenal. She was extremely helpful with the information and was willing to make sure students understood the material. In terms of improvement, I would have preferred more standard answer sheets handed out for the problems set but I appreciate corrections to problems sets where handed back within a timely manner.",
    "Good baseline understanding of statistics required for medical and public health research.\r\nExtremely clear, concise, very well layed out lectures\r\nLecturer and lab tutor both extremely good at explaining concepts\r\nVery fast marking\r\nSuggested improvements - make lectures slightly more interactive\/less boring, don't have the 5% grade for participation in in class exercises as it doesn't seemed to be formally assessed, have a break in the middle of all two hours lectures",
    "This course helped fortify the existing knowledge I had about biostatistics. The pleasant and approachable nature of both Dr. Maria and Dr. Victoria who were patient beyond description is beyond description. I have not had such wonderful teachers in a long time. There was no question to which Dr. Maria did not know the answer- and if there was something that needed further discussion, both teachers came back to us with extra information. Dr. Maria even conducted extra classes on Logistic regression which were probably not part of the course syllabus. I applaud the teachers of this class and would recommend it to anyone who would want to take it. The only negative I could find is the lack of availability of the textbooks in the library and the textbooks being kept as course reserve only and not part of the general borrowing section of the library - as a new student without resources, this really hampered my learning.",
    "Great instructor. Maria explains really well and slides are very instructive. Although the workload is high, the different labs and problem sets are really helpful to learn.",
    "Very satisfied with course.  The instructor has a wonderful ability to break the course down to a very basic level (assuming students have no prior knowledge of the material) and build from the ground level up.",
    "The lab session was great because I felt like I learned both theoretical and practical contents of basic statistics.",
    "The course was honestly really useful and helpful, particularly given the difficult material. Maria was a fantastic instructor. My one suggestion would be to improve the pacing of the class as a whole. I thought we spent too much time on lessons such as probability while we had to rush through more difficult concepts like hypothesis testing. As a result, the first few weeks of the class were slow while the last few weeks were rushed and often hard to follow.",
    "Overall, the course was great. Very well organized. Clear expectations and goals. Very well designed and implemented.",
    "My only comment will be on the amount of problem sets we had to do. It was a little too much compared to the time we had.",
    "strengths were the detailed slides and SAS videos",
    "Very good course",
    "lots of material, wouldve enjoyed taking this class at a slower pace with some more real world context",
    "Absolutely enjoyed the class, Lectures were well designed, homework was graded timely, and the instructor had also been very helpful. The only thing I felt that it could be improved was the lab sessions. The goal of this class was to make sure students would be comfortable using SAS (the software we used in this class). However, after the summer session, I still experience difficulty operating statistical analysis on SAS. I wish there would have been more SAS practice in lab.",
    "This was an excellent course, probably the best I've done in my 13 years of university. Maria was wonderful and was really passionate about the material. Victoria was incredibly knowledgeable and made the computer component interesting. Both facilitated an environment conducive to learning and for us students to develop a passion for the content",
    "The problem sets were very long and somewhat tedious. While I understand this is an accelerated course and a lot needs to be packed into a short period of time, I thought many of the questions on the problem sets were similar and therefore the problem sets could have been cut down. For the minimal amount that all of the homeworks contributed to our grade, we spent an extraordinary amount of time on them. \r\n\r\nAlso, I found the course material easiest to grasp when tied to examples of health issues, and I wish this could have been done more often throughout the course. Given that we are all interested in working in the health space, being able to understand the relevance of biostatistics to our future work is critical, and I didn't feel like I could always grasp that. The \"real\" examples used in lectures were the most interesting and helpful part of the lectures.",
    "strengths: maria is friendly and approachable \r\nweaknesses: biostatistics is a difficult subject to teach, especially to a group of people with a mixed background in stats. However, more effort should be made to clarify students understanding as the term progressed. Only towards the final lessons, were road maps of the term and our learning objectives made clear and would have been helpful to have had a reminder 5 minutes at the start of each lesson. \r\nhomework: long and laborious with lots of repetition. Took so many hours."

   "comments": [
    "Down to earth, professional, punctual and great teacher. Always availed and enthusiastic about the content. Great resource.",
    "Instructor was amazing I definitely feel I learned stats better with her instructor. I feel confident to take the information I have learned for future purposes. It had encouraged me to take higher level courses.",
    "See above.",
    "Strengths:\r\nExcellent teaching skills, excellent presentation skills and involvement of the class in the lecture- make a boring subject like Biostatistics thoroughly interesting and listenable. Excellent slides, excellent material and excellent out of class communication through emails and announcements. Every aspect of the class ran like clockwork. Extremely accommodative of student requests and kindness galore. She would work even after hours clearing doubts. \r\nWeakness: Making eye contact-not enough\r\nText books- keeping more of the text book in the public health library or the bio-statistics library for poorer students to use.",
    "She is a great instructor. She explains really well and clear. She makes sure that everyone understand what she is saying. The course is well structured and integrated with the book.",
    "Very satisfied with course.  The instructor has a wonderful ability to break the course down to a very basic level (assuming students have no prior knowledge of the material) and build from the ground level up.",
    "Her class and course materials are well organized, so I felt like learning statistics step by step with class and lab sessions. The assignments were helpful to understand the contents because problem sets were relevant to every class.",
    "Maria was an amazing instructor, very helpful and fantastic at explaining difficult concepts.",
    "Great. Very kind and helpful. Designed a very well organized course.",
    "Maria is a great professor. She made Biostats look easy. The only issue I had was that there were no breaks. the course went on for 2 hours non-stop. I think one or two 5 minute breaks would be helpful to regain focus. Otherwise, Maria is awesome.\r\nVictoria too is great. She made very meaningful comments on the homework that helped me focus on the areas I was weak in.",
    "She broke everything down step-by-step and made the material very accessible \r\nFormulas sheets were also super helpful.",
    "Engaging, positive, very helpful, enthusiastic about the topic",
    "very good teacher, wouldve enjoyed taking this class at a slower pace with some more real world context",
    "Maria was very helpful throughout the summer semester. She made sure all students questions were answered timely, and she explained all the materials thoroughly.",
    "Absolutely fantastic. It's a dense subject but Maria made it interesting and her welcoming attitude made coming to class fun. Easily one of the best instructors I've ever seen.",
    "Maria was a very passionate and articulate teacher, however, for many of us the material is not the most exciting, or the easiest to grasp. I think it would have been helpful if we were always more closely tying the formulas and models to real world examples. I also think it would have been helpful if the class was a bit more interactive. At the beginning of the summer, we had worksheets we would work on at different points throughout class and then Maria would lead us through them, which was helpful. However, by the end of the course we were going through the worksheet as a class from the beginning, which didn't give us the space or time to process the information individually. Also, I appreciate how willing Maria was to help us, but because we were moving through the material so quickly, it became difficult to ask more basic questions.",
    "Dr Ciarleglio is a great instructor , she is very helpful and welcoming to all questions.",
    "Maria is lovely. She could bear in mind more that some people have very little stat knowledge though and sometimes I found the classes very confusing and not engaged. However, I appreciated her effort, especially with her video lectures which I feel make a good adjunct to her lessons.She also could annotate her slides better, as she often left a lot of the slides blank to be completed in class, which was difficult unless you had a touch screen tablet or laptop."

   "comments": [
    "If you have not done math for a long time, thats the course to pick it up. Surely, a must for someone with biostatistics as a major.",
    "I would recommend to another student to take this class with this instructor she made the class easier with her style of instruction.",
    "Yes - good overall background of statistics",
    "The course provides you with advanced basic skills of biostatistics and handson experience of SAS. I would certainly recommend that another student take this course. The teachers are patient and kind and are available 24*7 as resource people. What else can I say? I will miss the teachers and the course itself.",
    "Yes, would definitively recommend this course. Great way to understand basic concepts and statistics tests.",
    "Course is a standard introductory biostatistics course which gives you the majority of the background that you need to understand the statistical manipulations made in the vast majority of biomedical research literature.",
    "I want to recommend this course to students who begin MPH course even if they have some background knowledge about statistics. It will be helpful for them to interpret public health research and to understand concepts in other courses including epidemiology.",
    "Yes, this is a very useful course and I would recommend this to all other MPH students.",
    "Fast paced biostatistics. Covered a great deal of material but it was very well planned and executed. No ambiguity. Clear expectations and goals set by instructor. Manageable workload. Very well organized and logical progression with additive statistical methods as the course progressed.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student. Biostats is hard, but Maria is such a great professor that it made the course easy.",
    "Great introduction to statistics",
    "more work than average",
    "Great statistics introduction.",
    "As a foundation course it is essential to master this content, and this course is taught very well so approachable even for the uninitiated",
    "The course provides a basic understanding of how statistics applies to the health sciences, which is very useful if you ever plan to conduct or analyze studies, or use studies in your interpretation of issues. I would recommend it generally, as I believe this is a critical tool for anyone in the health sciences, however, I would recommend taking it over a longer period of time."
