He will devote a full single spaced page to offer feedback to your essays and is an incredible joy to meet with for office hours. This is my second class with him and I full-heartedly suggest enrolling in his classes at least once. \r\n\r\nThe strengths are the readings and the seminar structure, guided by Kapustin. The only weakness is that the syllabus is too ambitious-- we spend to little time on each author. I just wish one could either break down the readings to focus on about half as many authors or have more seminar discussions. Really an excellent class I just wish we had more time to spend delving deep. \\",

It is more difficult to create complex discussions over zoom, but professor Kapustin did a fantastic job at making sure students were engaging in conversation with each other as well as himself."

The notion that online education is anything similar (especially for humanities classes\/seminars) is absurd on its face. Despite the incredible teaching and the fact that I was deeply invested in my class material, this format and the fact that the libraries operate on sporadic and limited hours makes genuine engagement in our classes tenuous at best. Since there is no actual solution to many of these problems with online education, I really think we should be lowering tuition. It's not the teachers' fault most of the time. It is just that motivation to genuinely learn is halted by the challenges of our external reality.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Prof Kapustin teaches students how to think, analyze, and interpret text on their own as opposed to simply preaching his own interpretations as many professors do. The material is extremely interesting and supplies a diverse account of how philosophy and definitions of morality have historically influenced politics. I would recommend this class to anyone especially interested in ethics or political science! (not a gut)"
