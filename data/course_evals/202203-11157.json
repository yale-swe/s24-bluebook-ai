                "The only area for improvement to me is that the textbook is a bit outdated, and needs to either be updated or changed so that we're learning language that is useful for the 21st century.",
                "Strenght: good syllabus with requiring the student to stay on top of their studies everyday. Weakness: asynchronous day work took more than the class time would've taken (50 min)",
                "I wouldnt change anything. The class was very fun and engaging.",
                "The course schedule was very effective in keeping me constantly engaged with the language but the textbook was outdated and included some vocabulary that is not that relevant/useful. Sometimes wish we could have an in-depth explanation on some grammar rules instead of  repeating sentence patterns.",
                "Asynchronous was more inconvenient, took up more time than the class equivalent. Did not find much use in the weekly required tutorials.",
                "strengths: lots of talking and practicing in class; all the homework was super helpful for learning; much of the vocabulary felt relevant to real life; really fun atmosphere; fast-paced but not too fast to follow so it really helped develop listening comprehension\r\n\r\nweaknesses: although the presentations we did were fun and useful for speaking practice, I thought the handwritten essay was more helpful for learning characters; maybe doing a presentation every third essay and handwriting it more often would be helpful",
                "Wang laoshi is amazing and did a great job helping Liao Laoshi teach us as well.",
                "Strengths: I feel like I've progressed a lot in a semester, the course covers lots of material, teaching is fantastic\r\nWeaknesses: There could be less of a focus on reciting the lesson text and more on generating sentences ourselves. Re: homework, I found the translation exercises in L1 and L2 very helpful for grammar and there could have been more of that.",

                "Yes because the Chinese Department at Yale is excellent, and because this course allows you to effectively learn Chinese.",
