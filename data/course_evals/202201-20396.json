                "Absolutely! I would definitely recommend \"Russia and the Eurasian Steppe.\" Though I already entered the course with personal interest regarding the topic, as well as some basic background historical knowledge, I think anybody could really enjoy and learn a lot from this course. This is especially the case if Professor Bushkovitch is teaching the course! He is an incredible instructor, and clearly an expert who is passionate about the class topics. His humor is an additional plus. The content is so fascinating, and the readings are very interesting (especially the primary sources)."
