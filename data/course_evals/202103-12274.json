We rarely discussed what we learned in the textbook, instead, class time was often used to work independently on our projects. I would have much rather preferred to do that work on my own outside of class (since it can be done alone) and class time used to talk about the textbooks. I think this would have also made the midterm (the only exam we had in the class) easier.",
                "Feedback wasn't always provided in a timely way and worksheets were usually outdated or inaccurate. Writing two studies up was a good experience, but I wish it had only been one because it was so much work.",
                "This is a pre-req class that you should take before taking other psych classes, if you can. It helps your writing, especially the annoying nitty gritty bits. \r\nThe lectures were good, and it was fun to do our own research. \r\nHowever, we were very much confused as to what we should have been doing in the beginning of the semester, since the professor was also getting familiar with the course she's teaching. The textbook is horrible, and please don't force us to spend that much money on materials that'd be widely available for free.",
                "The ability to carry out our own research was invaluable to my understanding of psychology. However, the class relies heavily on a textbook in the first half which largely recaps the things learned in other classes and it would be helpful to be taught the most important material instead of having to do all of the inquisitive modules independently. The instructions for assignments are also very detailed and clear.",
                "Strengths: very well organized, clear deadlines and guidance for assignments \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the in-class assignments that i had to finish at home/ homework assignments made it hard to spend enough time on the weekly writing assignments during the week.",
                "Strengths were the instructor's enthusiasm and willingness to help. Weaknesses were that it felt a bit disorganized at times and the work wasn't always spread out very evenly."
