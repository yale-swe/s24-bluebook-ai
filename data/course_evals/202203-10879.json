                "I personally would have enjoyed slightly shorter problem sets in terms of proofs and one or two coding exercises to see the theory in action. I would have enjoyed coding an auction or looking at the behavior of zero-regret algorithms in different situations as part of the problem sets.",
                "Yang is an awesome and engaging lecturer though. It's wonderful to listen to him speak about the topic and he really is very supportive when you don't understand things.\r\n\r\nHowever, this class is a lot harder than advertised. I would suggest starting with a background into game theory and optimization because these 2 things weren't required but formed the backbone of the course. Also, having problem sets that had more 'ramp up' would be great since the gulf between the difficulty of the class lectures and problem sets was massive.",
                "Strengths of the course: Yang is a brilliant instructor and I found lectures to be fascinating, informative, and well-organized. Every lecture follows well from the previous lecture, as though you are setting off on a journey and discovery something new at each step.",
                "The lecture is very clear and well-organized.",
                "I don't have many complaints about the lectures themselves. I think the problem sets were a bit too difficult to figure out just given what we covered in class, and especially given that each one consisted of 25% of our final grade, and I also felt there was not enough communication about the final (I'm someone who really appreciates a practice test).",
                "The material in this course was very engaging and clearly explained during lectures. The psets were difficult, but enough time was provided in between in order to complete them.",
                "As someone who didn't know many people in the course, it was tough for me to find a group for the problem sets and they were extremely difficult to do alone."

                "If one is interested in writing proofs similar to intensive algorithms and enjoys economics then yes, but the class is really tough. You get to work in partners/groups on the homework which is extremely helpful, I don't think I could have done half of the problems without a team effort.",
                "Yes, if you already know game theory, optimization and proof-writing extremely well.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to those who want to know algorithmic game theory. Having taken a classical game theory course would help but is definitely not required and not necessary to survive and enjoy the course!\r\n\r\nAlso, this course is proof-based. All the lecture and problem sets are mathematical. This course is for folks who like and appreciate rigorous proofs.",
                "Yes. Very very good.",
                "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. The material was really interesting, and was presented well and at a good pace. The problem sets were difficult but also fun, and the workload overall wasn't too bad as there were only three problem sets.",
                "Yes, it really draws on concepts from both cs and econ (and a lot of math!). We use both the notions of computational complexity and nash equilbrium heavily."
