                "I learned about the skill sets of instruments that I've never written for before. Hearing about the creative processes of different guest artists/School of Music artists was an invaluable experience. I also got to develop my own musical voice more."

                "Strengths: it's an excellent way to get credit for doing something I'd be doing on my on time. It's great to be exposed to the wonderful composers who visit the class as well. The weekly lessons are also extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nCons: I wish there was more structured feedback throughout the course. We had three composition submissions, but I only got feedback on one before the semester ended.",
                "I really loved the interactive activities this semester: the visit to the percussion room with Makana, the Beinecke exhibit class, Jen and Zach's lecture about writing for their instruments. I also particularly enjoyed Natacha Diels and Lainie Fefferman's lectures - Natacha's because her stuff is so \"out there\" and Lainie's because she is very kind and grounded. The private lessons are always a huge strength and I enjoyed working with Dr. A.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Weekly lessons!\r\n- The opportunity to have our compositions performed (this was an INCREDIBLE experience and this should definitely be an option for future semesters!)\r\n- Guest speakers (I thought the amount of guest speakers we had this semester was perfect some past semesters felt like too many)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- More peer feedback throughout the semester would be fun\r\n- More optional opportunities / performances and opportunities for collaboration",
                "The combination of group lectures and one-on-one composition lessons allows for instruction catered to the individual as well as the opportunity to learn from peers and to be part of the composition community at Yale. I would like to see more opportunities for students' works to be read.",
                "Sometimes I think the weekly 2 hour meeting could be used to critique each other's work, although the guest presentations are interesting. The weekly one-on-one composition lesson is the highlight of the course; I learn so much in those meetings and am held accountable to make progress toward my final submission."

                "Yes, but it's a very self selecting pool to take classes like this. You have to a clear idea of the music you want to make at this point - it won't be fed to you and you are of course expected to write lots of music independently (as you should be). It's definitely a \"you get what you put in course\" as you can get by doing very little, but if you put a lot of effort in and take advantage of the resources available to you, you can grow a lot as a composer.",
                "if you compose or want to try it out, go for it! People often ask me if their genre is allowed (pop, music theater, etc) and the answer is yes, as long as you can understand what you're doing and commit to making 5-8 mins of music in a semester.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes!!! This course is perfect if you are a composer and want to have more motivation to work on stuff and one-on-one instruction as well. Actual class time will mostly be guests coming in to talk about their music which obviously varies but is overall super interesting!",
