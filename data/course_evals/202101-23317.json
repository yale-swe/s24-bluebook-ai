                "I think the reading might be slightly too heavy because I have taken another course in similar format and we read 9 novels (sometimes parts of a novel) for the whole semester. And a twenty minute lecture in the beginning of every class would be very nice. And perhaps we could learn something about the general information about the background, author, etc.",
                "The essay could've been a little more collaborative, but as this isn't a writing class it made sense. I thought it ran very smoothly with COVID.",
                "Strengths: the syllabus and course readings were fantastic, really interesting and engaging. The professor was also very engaged and his input made the class more engaging and insightful. There were no weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: the selected works were quite informative, distinct with individual style and telling about its time period. It was easy to keep engaged because the readings were mostly fiction, and mostly pretty interesting. I learned a lot from the prof and my peers as well.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there were more guided questions to help structure the discussions in class (because its easy to deviate with spontaneous discussion) and maybe a bit of lecture each time regarding the authors background & societal background for the work.",
                "The novels were varied, reasonable length for a once-per-week class, and generally incredibly captivating. Some moments class discussions lagged, but I would fault Zoom for that, not anything regarding the class. I would've liked more direction regarding the final paper.",
                "Some books on the reading list are interesting; the final paper gives a pretty high degree of freedom, and I was able to close-read a book beyond the course reading list and delve deep into a specific period of Japan's history.\r\n\r\nThere're some pop fictions on the reading list that definitely don't deserve an entire 2-hr meeting to discuss. Class discussion sometimes go off-topic. Kinda expected Prof. to guide the conversations a bit more.",
                "Discussions weren't too heavily monitored or directed but I think that's a good thing. It let us freely focus on different points of the novels and explore the book thematically rather than chronologically."

The readings were among the best that Ive had since my time at Yale. This course has inspired me to pursue reading more Japanese literature. The professor is great, he really cares about the class and students.",

                "Hard question to answer. The workload is totally reasonable, and the 10-page final paper is doable and, if you find an interesting topic, rewarding. Some books on the syllabus need to be removed--I regretted spending my time reading \"The Housekeeper and the Professor\" and \"Territory of Light,\" for example. Not just because these books aren't very interesting, but also I don't think these books offer a broad ground for analysis, either. Prof. is very knowledgeable, but I wish the discussion can be a bit more guided, with more lecturing on Japan's history, culture, and literary devices and theory. There was one class we spent a bit too much time talking about baseball mentioned in a pop fiction. I like baseball, but I'd prefer not to discuss it in a literature class.",
                "Yes! Professor Goddard is so kind and knowledgeable and will really give his time and energies to giving you resources on Japanese lit/criticism/research if you ask. The class was pretty laid back and discussions weren't stressful. Plus the reading material is some of the most fun and engaging I've read at Yale yet. If you're an English or Comp Lit or Literature major, this is a great choice of a class because it's a totally different style of literature but taught in English (and can count for your major if necessary, I think). The assignments were graded pretty casually and weren't hard at all to complete.",
