A weakness of this course is the lecture style of presentation, which allows little room for discussion and analysis with students primarily just sitting in their seats listening during class. Additionally, all of the homework and midterm only related to the first half of the semester, with the information learned in the second half seeming less important or more ineffectual given there were never any assignments concerning those lectures.",

                "The strengths are that all lecture notes are available in multiple (both print and digital) forms, allowing students to review what they have learned.",
                "I think the strengths of the class are in its small workload and its focus on students enjoying the material. I think the weaknesses were in the engagement of the lectures and the lack of in-depth knowledge acquired by taking the course."
