   "comments": [
    "Thought the course was structured well.",
    "SuperSite homework becomes a bit monotonous but overall the work is pretty manageable. Exams are fair, nothing is too terribly difficult.",
    "The course is really great in that the homework is not super time consuming but is consistent and previews what will be taught in class. I think the only thing that could be improved is having more in-class preparation for oral and audio exams.",
    "I enjoyed the vocal practice and grammar constructions we learned. I think that covering the grammar in a more organized way would help with memorization and retainment of the different types of contructions.",
    "The course is rather fast paced -- more review of subjects learned could help, for example making the homework about the previous lesson rather than the next.",
    "Needs more Spanish speaking and interaction in class. Would like it if the instructor spoke more Spanish and less in English. Textbook sucks and Course packet sucks",
    "The daily homework was very tedious at times. The daily homework was also extensive at times.",
    "It was a very good class. I had an amazing professor and am sad to see her leave. The class could be improved by having more practice with audio comprehension and with practice grammar worksheets rather than reviewing the textbook grammar that we read for class. Doing the practice in class would allow us to ask questions in the moment."
