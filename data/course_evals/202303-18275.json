                "I learned so much about gender studies in the Middle East! From marriage, to education, to male infertility, to trans histories, to beauty standards... and so much more. I also learned how to write a book review and synthesize an ethnography, which was new for me (someone who has never taken an anthropology class).",
                "This is the first anthropology class I've ever taken. Learned a lot about what an ethnography is and how to write book reviews.",
                "This class drastically expanded my understanding of the diverse, multilayered and complex lives of women across the Middle East. It also fundamentally shifted how I think about concepts like feminism, social movements, religion, migration, and \"the political.\" I also gained a deep appreciation for ethnography through the number of incredible ethnographies we read.",
                "First and foremost, I learned how to read ethnographies, since this was my first anthropology class. We read so many ethnographies that I learned what makes a good\/bad ethnography and I formed my own opinions about what I like\/dislike in ethnography. I also learned how to write an anthropological book review.\r\nAs for knowledge, we covered such a wide range of topics in this class because of the diversity of our ethnographies. I learned about revolutionary women in Egypt, about South Asian women who come to Kuwait as domestic migrant workers and gradually convert to Islam, about queer and trans people in Iran and Palestine, about girls' education in Jordan...we cover so much in this class, it is truly a gift.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths- very engaging discussions and interesting ethnographies. Really amazing professor and TF.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- none",
                "The course is set up very well, with each few weeks focusing on a different theme (i.e., \"gender and medicine,\" \"LGBTQ identities,\" \"women in war,\" etc.). I liked that we got to choose which weeks they wrote a book review---this allowed everybody to focus on the topics they found most interesting. If you're interested in taking this course, know that there is a lot of reading involved! Class discussions are so much more interesting\/fulfilling if you've thought pretty deeply about the book before class. Because it was a large seminar, sometimes the discussion tended more towards 'everyone is trying to speak a couple times' than genuine conversation; that being said, a lot of the time the discussions were really interesting and thoughtful. Everybody was clearly invested and wanted to be there.",
                "Strength: Marcia is awesome. She is so knowledgeable and intelligent, and there were times I truthfully would've rather her just lecture for a period of the class than have it be a whole class discussion. Each ethnography is very specific (i.e. trans people in Iran, beauty standards in Turkey, schools in Jordan), so I felt like we really did get a good sense of each of these niches. Weakness: the work load is pretty high with the expectation being that you read a 300 page ethnography each week. It's pretty difficult to meaningfully contribute if you don't actually read the book, so during midterm weeks the conversations definitely felt more forced.",
                "This course had so many strengths. One highlight was the syllabus. I loved that it was entirely based in ethnographies. I think this anthropological approach to the topic of Middle East Gender Studies is part of what made this class so impactful for me. Class discussions were also engaging and interesting. Another obvious strength of the class is Marcia! She is so incredibly knowledgable and experienced about this field, and it is such a privilege to learn from her. She is very kind and genuinely cares about the course and about her students, and provides great feedback on assignments. If I had to change one thing, I would make some of the assignments less structured. While I appreciated learning how to write an academic book review (and writing them definitely deepened my understanding of the texts I chose), I wish there had been some sort of creative component to the assignments.",
                "Strengths: the breadth of this class's syllabus is so wide that any student is bound to find at least 80% of what we read interesting. I also really liked the format of seminar, being led mostly by students rather than by instructors. The class also just has a very friendly vibe, which is of course nice in a seminar! Many of the students (myself included) were not in anthropology or Middle East studies, so there was a very diverse array of perspectives, and I am sure this is the case in every iteration of the course. And I cannot stress enough how much I learned in this course. Another positive: for all of the book review assignments, Marcia has uploaded templates and several examples on the Canvas page. This was immensely helpful for someone like me who had no experience with anthropology before this class.\r\nWeaknesses: the only weakness of this class is its homework assignments. You read a book every week, which ranges from 180-300 pages. I am totally fine with this! But the WRITING assignments for the class are just book reviews. I was a bit frustrated with the book reviews because, while learning how to write anthropological book reviews is a valuable skill, I feel that writing book reviews is not a great way to critically engage with the IDEAS in the books we read as opposed to just engaging with the books themselves. That being said, I did enjoy the comparative book review final paper, since the thematic comparison of two books offers a lot of room for creative analysis.",
                "Strengths: engaging, relevant material, inclusive learning environment",
                "Strengths: Marcia is great and passionate about what she teaches. Every week, conversation is robust and interesting. Comprehensive insight into the study of the Middle East.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Course felt rushed at times with a focus on a book per week. Really heavy reading load that impacted student engagement. Financial accessibilitybooks were pricey and added up!"

                "Yes, if you are willing to read most of the books. You won't get much out of the class if you don't.",
                "YES!!! MARCIA IS AMAZING. If you're interested in Middle East Gender studies I definitely recommend it. Marcia is so knowledgable and just an incredible teacher. That said, beware that this is an anthropology class, not a history or english class. This means the types of books you are reading are ethnographies and you aren't writing creative essays \/ crafting arguments, but writing book reviews that critique and summarize the books. Also, the work load for this class is high and you won't get much out of it if you don't actually read the books, so make sure you have the time in your schedule to actually dedicate to this class.",
                "YES. This was such a meaningful and transformational class for me. Not only did I learn so much about many different contexts throughout the diverse region of the Middle East, but this course really challenged me to think outside of Western hegemonic ways of understanding the world and how gendered people fit into society.",
                "I would recommend this course in an instant. Be prepared for how much work it is--you really do read a 180-300 page book every week, and you're going to WANT to read all these books with how fascinating they are. Yes, please, take this course, it is one of the most interesting courses I have taken at this school and I'm going into my sixth semester!",
                "Yes, this was a great class and I'd recommend.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class. While my grade wasn't exactly what I had hoped, I learned so much and grew as a person and student from doing these readings and discussing them in class.",
                "Yes, BUT be aware that this course is quite a heavy workload. You seriously cannot just skim the weekly readings (usually a 300-400 page book) and come to seminar. I would honestly describe this seminar as a 1.5 credit."
