                "The class taught us about how human rights intersect with the climate crisis and how human rights advocacy and law can be used to create change in the climate sphere. We learned how human rights advocacy works and the various tactics that you have to use --- the class was very refreshing in that it approached human rights advocacy from a more practical approach where there are compromises and strategies instead of an all-or-nothing game. Also learned in detail about specific climate change issues such as deforestation and critically discussed some of the current approaches to solving climate change (the Paris agreement, ESG goals). Learned how to write persuasive advocacy memos."

                "Weakness: This was a seminar, however, I don't think we had very much student debate or discussion. As wonderful as Daniel is, I think sometimes he went on a little too long at the beginning of class, thus making me lose my focus.",
                "This class was incredible. I loved the level of engagement, the readings were super interesting, and the structure of the course was very beneficial and helpful throughout the semester. The amount of support given by the professor to excel in the briefing memos and advocacy documents were instrumental and extremely useful. I loved how the semester was structured in two halves: country and corporate responsibility. It provided a well-rounded semester that provided many different perspectives from both the Global North and South.",
                "I really enjoyed this class! It was very accessible. I appreciated the instructions given with the readings and felt like I got a lot more out of them, and all of the assignments felt meaningful.",
                "Strengths - Positive classroom environment, very interesting readings, interesting integration with professor's work. Very clear instructions for assignments. \r\nWeaknesses - 2 hours on a Thursday afternoon is tough. But good classroom switch idea.",
                "One of the major strenghts of the class was Daniel himself. He has so much experience and knowledge in this field that he always had stories to tell of how human rights advocacy operates in reality, which was very helpful for understanding how incremental change can be made. He is also a very kind and helpful professor who is always available to meet and help after class and gives detailed feedback on the assignments. I also really liked how the assignments were set up with each smaller assignment helping with the bigger one, and it was super nice to be done with the class after reading week and not have to worry about a final. Everyone in the class was super passionate and engaged in the issues which made for active class discussions. The only weakness I can think of is that sometimes, because of time constraints and because there was also so much to disucss, we would not have much time for class discussion as I would have liked."

I don't feel compelled by the case that human rights is the way to go about it. If anything, this class made me more certain that if climate change is going to be tackled, it'll be through market forces.",
                "Yes, DEFINITELY! This course was amazing.",
                "Yes!! This is probably my favorite class I've taken at Yale. I learned so much and while the course content was heavy, I also gained awareness of the advocacy work people are doing and how I can help which was incredibly helpful.",
                "Yes - if you are interested in human rights issues and you want a broad survey into the link between human rights and climate change, this is the course for you.",
                "100% recommend this class especially with Daniel!!!",
                "Yes 100%. If you are interested in learning more about the climate crisis or passionate about human rights advocacy, or even if you just have a passing interest in both of those areas, I would definitely recommend taking this course as you learn so much about the state of our climate crisis. You learn to see the flaws in the current plans addressing climate change and approach them critically, but you also learn to see the opportunity for change and betterment."
