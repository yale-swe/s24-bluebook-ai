   "comments": [
    "Too much focus on SIGGRAPH papers at the expense of more practical or contemporary innovation. Some of the assignments were better than others (its obvious which are which) and the final project is a nice opportunity to create and explore, though stronger guidance would be helpful.",
    "Course is very repetitive, there aren't really any lectures.",
    "The strength of the course lies in the creativity it focuses on. It was unique to see people from so many academic backgrounds in a CS class, and it was inspiring to see CS take on a more self-driven and artistic character than it typically does at Yale. \r\n\r\nI think I could have gotten more out of the course if there had been more support for the final project. It occupied about half of the semester, and though it would be difficult to offer in-depth coaching for every group since there were a wide range of projects requiring an equally wide range of skills, that significant portion of the course would have been more fulfilling and less stressful if I felt as though I were being taught all the way along. The progress reports were a good way to stay on track but I could have benefited from more technical help to push my project further."

    "Yes, I think every CS major at Yale should take this course. Everyone could benefit from a refreshing chance to view CS in a creative and artistic light, and the experience of building a working product (as opposed to only focusing on psets) was very valuable."
