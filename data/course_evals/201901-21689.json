    "Seema ji and Swapna ji are pretty good teacher and are flexible enough to make this class very manageable. Not a significant amount of work at all, maybe a few hours a week at most, other than having to go to class 6 times a week (5 classes plus a conversation section)",
    "It primarily felt like a review of L1 with some new concepts tossed in. Maybe learning more grammar patterns would have been helpful with our writing and speaking skills. Both Swapna Ji and Seema Ji are very knowledgeable about Hindi though and are able to help students with worksheets during class, but it would be helpful if we could be sent answer keys after doing an assignment.",
    "The teachers and TA are brilliant, and therefore students find it incredibly easy to pick up new concepts. Teachers are always available for additional help and provide the necessary advice that is needed to improve.",
    "Great course, engaging, looked most forward to this class everyday. Its nice how Fridays quizzes you can take at any time. Very flexible and understanding.",
    "A bit disorganized, but taught with love."

    "Yeah, pretty good way to knock out a language requirement or if you want to learn hindi",
    "Yes.",

    "Yes, it is a great course to take to continue mastering the language and gives you a chance to not only learn the language but also the culture.",
    "Yes!! You get to learn hindi and have fun in class. There are plenty of outside cultural learning opportunities as well",
    "Yes."
