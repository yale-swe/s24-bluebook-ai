The course readings are very theoretical, and while our class discussions tended to be a little more interesting, I don't think I ended up taking much from the class. The class is almost entirely structured around Foundations of Economic Analysis of Law (Steven Shavell, 2004) if you want a road map for the semester.",
                "Basic introduction to law that is related to economics. I've never taken a law school class, but I think every week is a sneak peek into what a first year law class might look like. More law heavy than economics oriented. Learned about things like property law, accident law, tort law, contracts, morality and law, welfare law and redistribution, etc."

                "Was very student-led so depends on having a good group in the seminar -- at times I felt like it could have used a little more guidance from Professor Landis but ultimately I think it worked out perfectly. The topics are really engaging and you can get a lot out of the class.",
                "The course was boring at times - the readings were good.",
                "Strengths: Open-ended discussions, low workload, some interesting applications to policy and legal debates that pop up all the time. Weaknesses: Even though we would scratch the surface of these exciting debates in our discussions each week, our readings on the syllabus for next week would often deflate that momentum. Textbook readings provide the skeleton of the course and work fine to give the class a general direction, but almost every extra paper we read was way too theoretical and so old (and almost always written from the same perspective, one of a few rotating professors) that it reduced any opportunity we had to connect the principles we read about in Shavell's textbook with 21st century events and policy debates. I tried doing the readings at first, but every paper we read was so old and wordy that I really struggled to motivate myself by the end of the semester. I think the course would really benefit from a new batch of readings that illustrate current-day applications of the econ and law we read about in Shavell; in addition to the course content, I thought we didn't get much feedback on our learning. We never got our midterm exams back (only the grade) and I'm not sure how many comments to expect on the final paper.",
                "Strengths: interesting seminar format; you really get a lot of time to ask questions, contribute. Prof Landis structures the class where he asks questions and you answer based on the reading.\r\n\r\nWays to be improved: I think we could use more feedback during the year. We had 1 midterm and then 1 final. That's all. There's not a lot of opportunity to get feedback and improve, especially because the midterm was an exam testing knowledge and the final was a paper about anything related to econ analysis of the law. I think more structure for the final paper could be nice. In terms of class, I think some of the questions were just asking definitions. I think it'd be neat to encourage more students to speak with each other and debate ideas/topics."

                "Absolutely. I ended up having a fantastic time in the course. It started off a little rocky because Professor Landis doesn't really take an active role in the discussions and we didn't know each other well initially, but after the first few weeks the conversations started flowing and we got used to his teaching style. I actually enjoyed doing all the readings and more for the class. I found myself talking about the case studies with my friends at dinner, which was really fun.",
                "I would probably not recommend this course - class was marked by awkward periods of silence. I wish there had been thought paid into stimulating conversation in class.",
                "Yes, it has a low workload and, if you are interested in law school, it gives you a glimpse into some of the things that you will be studying later on. Further, Prof. Landis is really knowledgeable.",
                "Maybe. I thought this class was a good fifth class for me this semester given what else I was taking, but I don't think I learned that much. If I had to guess, I think the class would sort of be a very, very surface level look at everything you might learn in year one of law school without giving a real deep treatment to anything in particular. I do think I have a vague new appreciation for how often the law shows up in various facets of everyday life and there were some interesting econ applications (Coase Theorem, moral hazard, asymmetric information and information acquisition) but nothing that felt worth an entire semester. Oftentimes it seemed authors were vaguely overusing terms like \"efficiency\" and \"social benefit.\" But we did have some really interesting debates at the intersection of law, econ, and public policy: if the syllabus is updated to include more on current events and applied knowledge and more recent scholarship, I think the class would be in a much better place and potentially worth taking it.",
                "READ A COUPLE PAGES/CHAPTERS FROM STEVEN SHAVELL'S ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE LAW (it's a book and you can probably find a few pages online for free on google or something). If you find it interesting, take this class. If you hate it, don't take this class. This class revolved around that book (probably about 80-90% of the class is spent discussing the book). If you want a very intro-level course to law, especially accident law (torts), contract law, property law, and similar topics, then sure. I think that you should clearly know whether or not this would be interesting to you. Are you interested in questions like, what is the economic benefit/cost of having property laws? How should we thinking about when people are held liable for accidents (torts)? What are the economic costs and benefits to a contract? Is it bad (morally or economically) to break a contract? If these questions are interesting to you, then it'd probably be a good class for you. If you're interested in con law, civil rights, social justice and want to apply econ to those topics, then this probably isn't the right class to do so. Also, there's a much stronger focus on civil law than criminal law, although we touch on it briefly. Also, it's not going to be very econ heavy. I'd think of it more as an intro law class than an econ class. For the most part, you get to learn a bit about the law and think about efficiency, social welfare, the cost/benefit analysis of law, and the like. It's a good seminar-style class if you prefer that in the econ major (or if you're an EPE major). It's a good amount of reading (about 150 pages a week), meets once, and a 15-20 page final paper. Prof Landis is also a really nice professor who comes from a real-world background rather than a pure academic background."
