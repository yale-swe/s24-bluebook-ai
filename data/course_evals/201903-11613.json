   "comments": [
    "i learned about gender things! after you finish a class I feel like usually there are only a few things that you remember, but I am definittely going to take a lot of things with me from this course.",
    "What I really learned where that my suspicions about inequality between men and women were correct: things are messy and complex and there are solutions but those are messy and complex too.",
    "I learned how to view the patriarchy through the three different lenses. How the dynamics of todays society come from multiple sources, how our norms are very hard to change, and there is no easy fix to achieve gender equality.",
    "This class is wonderfully interesting and so central to every aspect of politics and just life in general. It certainly is necessary and was very enlightening in so many ways. It has major issues with being overly heteronormative and not intersectional, so it certainly is an incomplete class in that way. While this is an issue, the content is still very important and fascinating, so it is incomplete but still excellent for what it is. I thoroughly enjoyed the class. It also allowed you to enjoy academic writing which I found particularly beneficial. The readings by Ross and Goldin were especially engaging, and I will make sure to continue to consider them.",
    "Important knowledge about gender inequality and challenges women face globally. Also ways to solve these issues",
    "insight into egalitarian marriage, views of porn, workplace environments",
    "This class was great in that everything taught was very related and built on other units, readings, etc. I learned a lot about current gender norms and inequality in politics and economics\/business.",
    "I learned so much about gender inequality, the history of it, how it develops in different economies and countries, and how I am a part of it. I have gained more insight into the world around me than i have in any other course at yale.",
    "How to integrate perspectives from different fields (in particular, biology, economics, and political science) in addressing questions about women's place in society and how to change that.",
    "Critical thinking about skills related to gender issues and where bias\/stereotypes could be present and effecting various genders in the real world",
    "This class will interest anyone who wants to learn about gender, family, stereotypes, men, women, and parenting, as well as explosive issues like abortion, porn, and prostitution. This course is great for examining every day and traditional norms from varying points of view. Professor Rosenbluth explains concepts SO clearly and objectively, not at any point forcing her view or telling us what to think about any issue.",
    "learned a lot of cool facts about monkey sex and the weird male obsession with chastity",
    "You learn a very broad overview of the factors that explain the gender wage gap.",
    "This class was an interesting take on the gender divide across the world and in all sectors. It helps you to understand the divisions women face in all aspects of life and how they are trying to combat this. It also focuses not just on cultural norms, but dives into the biology that may be behind some of the reasoning.",
    "I learned how to apply three lenses to explain the differences in treatment between men and women.",
    "I learned about various different issues of gender inequality and gender differences in the US and the world. I learned about using three different lenses to explain these differences\/phenomenom\/inequalities\/problems, Biology, Economics and Politics. I also learned about possible solutions to all these problems, and how to go about fixing problems of gender inequality, mainly by using public policy. The lenses were also applied to solution. Was good to look at these problems critically, and from multiple perspectives.",
    "Knowledge I gained includes a better understanding of the structure of our economic, biological and political environment.",
    "feminism",
    "I learned a lot about how markets, power, and gender influences macro and micro decisions, as well as the institutions we historically and currently have.",
    "We learned about the obstacles women face today - mainly in the workplace.",
    "By taking this course, I developed my knowledge of the interconnected dynamics in the world between genders within the home, in the economy, and in politics. By analyzing gender discrepancies through the lenses of sex, markets, and power, I furthered my insights on gender inequality and power dynamics.",
    "Learned more about gender dynamics and the biological, historical, social, cultural, and economic position of women.",
    "We learnt about different biological, economic, and political arguments relating the difference in the gender wage gap and gender stereotypes. I developed writing skills in the writing intensive section.",
    "Learnt a lot more surroundings the origins around social constructs and women place within society.",
    "I learned basic concepts about politics, economics, and biology focusing on gender relationships.",
    "i learned so much about how women are treated in societies around the world and how various factors affect how women behave and their preferences",
    "It is a course that offers students a comprehensive view of gender equality from different angles. It also teaches some public policy lessons on how to tackle these issues and introduces the student to the scholarship on the topic.",
    "I learned the scientific(ish)\/social explanations for many of the inequalities and discrepancies that exist between the genders.  Much of the material was easy to conceptualize and understand with out too much effort.",
    "I gained a ton of knowledge on specific ways that gender plays a role in policy, social dynamics and politics across the world and across history. Since I was in the Writing section, I also learned how to write a semester-long research paper, design a better survey, conduct my own research and defend it in a long paper.",
    "Interesting survey of modern gender issues.",
    "Going into this course, I didn't know much about economics, nor was I really interested in taking an economics course. But the way we talked about econ in this class (its intersection with\/impact on gender equality) was really interesting. It helped me understand the world better, and why gender inequality looks very different in different places. I also learned a lot through being in the writing section. In my section, we went sentence by sentence through papers we had read for lecture, identifying the paper's strategy for laying out their thesis, literature review, abstract, research design, and conclusion. I thought this exercise was very helpful and made me a better writer.",
    "So much! I learned to evaluate the context of my own life and the gendered nature of my interactions. Take this class!!",
    "I gained insight about the biological, political, and power-based mechanics involved in mating schemes.",
    "This course exposed me to other ways of thinking about the differences between males and female, and the reasons others believe there are differences.",
    "I feel more comfortable and competent while articulating power dynamics that exist within various social, economic, and political structures. I can also back them up with various academic perspectives and studies.",
    "I learned about how and why gender inequality persists through both a political and economic lens.",
    "Basic understanding of the challenges that women face and how to look at these challenges.",
    "Loved the class. Learned a new way of looking at things",
    "Thinking about everything in regards to improving the conditions for women in the workforce and in life",
    "New way of looking at gender roles",
    "Nice",
    "I learned so so much from this class! I got so much insight to how women fit into todays economy and job market as well as where we stand not only in this country socially but around the world. I learned how different policies in the workplace and by the government affect women and what can be done to truly improve their equality in all realms.",
    "I learned different causes of gender bias in the market and family and how it affects power dynamics.",
    "Gender differences in the US and how women are limited and oppressed by the patriarchy \/ male dominated society \/ markets",
    "time management and writing",
    "I learned how to write a political science style research paper. I also learned so much about how women interact with the world including the challenges of balancing different aspirations in life, what situations are good for them economically, and the history of women's evolving roles. I also learned many different pros and cons of policies on prostitution, pornography, childcare, and political quotas.",
    "We learnt about the biological, market, and power dynamics that largely benefit men over women in the world.",
    "I learned a lot about the role of gender in today's society and the origins and implications of gender discriminatory practices.",
    "I learned a lot about the structure of the society we live in and more about feminism.",
    "I learned so much about the role of women in public policy and society today, through biology, politics, and economics.",
    "I broadened my understanding of how our society and gender interact. I learnt a lot of things that I will think about in my everyday life. I found it particularly interesting to think about all the class concepts with my own personal experiences of gender.",
    "This course was really great at thoroughly explaining a lot of phenomena and inequalities which we witness every day and think that we know about but perhaps dont actually understand the underlying causes and relationships.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about the complexities and nuances of gender inequality. I have found that, since this class, I am often applying the knowledge that I acquired and it is even changing my outlook on the 2020 election. By using these three lenses throughout the course, I have gained the ability to use these three lenses in life, and it forces me to accept a wider range of options and a fuller story.",
    "Understanding of how we have arrived where we are today in terms of gender equality\/struggles\r\nUnderstanding of where we need to go and what needs to happen in order to achieve gender equality\r\nHow to write a long research paper using my own data\/analyzing raw data and proving a hypothesis",
    "By taking this course, I learned a lot about how today's gender roles are affected by biology, the economy, and political power. Furthermore, I was able to dig into different societal issues and phenomenons (i.e. the gender pay gap, maternal versus paternal leave, cheating, prostitution) through these different lenses (biology, economic standing, political power)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: interesting, sections are organized well, Professor Rosenbluth is nice\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the economics\/political science stuff felt repetitive. Like I think we spent many lectures on LME\/CME and SMD\/PR, but honestly if people have questions I would assume sections would be more efficient and better for smoothing them out. The porn\/prostitution\/incel\/abortion content at the end of the semester was probably the most interesting material (because its so different and spicy I suppose), and I feel like I would have enjoyed more of that content. also no talk about trans folk",
    "I loved the course material. I would have appreciated more specific case studies of how the principles we were studying applied in a real world way.",
    "We covered a lot of different topics. One weakness that I found was that at some points the course was very statistics heavy, yet stats was not something we learned within the course itself. I wonder if stats should be included as a prerequisite or if the course could be reorganized in a way that did not require that background",
    "The content is very important and incredibly fascinating, and the setup of analyzing these issues through three lenses was very beneficial to the topic. Frances is also the highlight of this class. She is extremely knowledge, experienced on this research, and also kind and friendly. The heteronormativity and the lack of intersectionality are certainly the biggest issues with this class. The writing section was also a great experience in many ways; however, I think they should be more clear that all the papers are on the same topic and will be put together and that this class relies on data analysis. I had a great time exploring this project, but I also felt unprepared as a first-year for this class since I have limited statistics knowledge. The writing credit doesn't seem too difficult because of the relatively small page count, but these papers also seemed to stress out the people in my section more than other classes. I'm thrilled I did it, but it was also not what I was expecting.",
    "The course was structured really well and the lectures were always interesting and relevant.",
    "great lectures and really enjoy looking at topics through the three lenses",
    "The course is really well taught and organized. Some readings seemed not super relevant, or outdated, but overall very good work load, helpful discussion sections, good lecture!",
    "Strength: super easy to follow, amazing professor, low work load, easy tests. the class is so interesting that you naturally do well. \r\n\r\nweakness: tf's for the writing section made you do so much more work than students in normal sections. do not take this for a writing credit. it adds stress and work.",
    "Strengths: Professor Rosenbluth was an amazing person, always so willing to help and so approachable. Plus, the content itself was just very fascinating.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This was honestly an amazing class, but I felt that sometimes Prof. Rosenbluth could pace herself better through the lectures. A lot of times towards the end of lectures we were rushing and content was skimmed over.",
    "Very interesting and engaging lecture, overall great course that I genuinely enjoyed going to and studying",
    "Section was great I thought that turning in terms each week was great preparation for the midterm and final, more classes should do this!\r\nProfessor Rosenbluth makes herself very available and is so engaging (over email and in person), she seems to know everyone's name in a large lecture which is admirable, especially for such an acclaimed professor.",
    "strengths: very interesting and applicable to the life of a young woman, pretty easy, funny professor\r\nweaknesses: none",
    "The writing section could be improved. We wrote research design essays, rather than argumentative ones.",
    "The course is a little chaotic at times and I feel the professor does not know what the next slide is to pop up at times but the course can be intriguing at times. Also some of the facts she had on her slides just weren't correct. Maybe one study found so and so to be true but other studies had different answers. I wish she would make a statement about this saying that her numbers were found by this source but another source says differently. Nothing more annoying than being lied to at a university like Yale.",
    "The strength of this course is that the material is fascinating. Every lecture dealt with an issue I was genuinely interested in, and I wanted to be at lecture because I was interested in thinking about the questions that would be posed and answered. I think it could be improved by having more discussion of feminist theory, and dealing with debates within feminism rather than with consensus issues. On these contentious topics I was more interested and actively challenged to form an opinion and really think critically about the issue and solutions. More porn-wars type issues and perhaps less clear cut issues (although solutions to those are obviously important and I enjoyed talking about them). Second, I think that the class should talk more about how many of these pratices and unequal phenomena affect the victims. For example, we talked about footbinding and didn't really talk about how hard and terrible it was for women whose feet were bound, or we talked about sexist porn without getting testimony about how it hurt women or made them feel inferior or developed internalized sexism. This would give perspective and remind students that these things matter, and we shouldn't look for heartless, statistical solutions and instead should care and think about the individuals being affected. Finally, I think that the midterm wasn't super useful and would have rather had another paper instead. The paper deepened my understanding about its topic, and the midterm just made me go to lecture (which I think the final already accomplishes). Overall, I liked the course though, sorry to be so critical, it's only because I think it has so much potential!",
    "Strengths include an amazing professor and very interesting course material and readings. No weaknesses. Could be improved with more writing-focused content.",
    "the exam format for the writing sections should perhaps be changed--i think it makes more sense that the students in the writing section take the midterm rather than the final because writing section students also are expected to write a final paper",
    "could be more interesting. redundant at times.",
    "The main weakness of this course is its fetishization of the other. You can tell that this course is taught by a white professor because of the way people of color are treated as examples of concepts we learn. The professor chooses pictures of Indian women suffering with lots of children or African women with baskets on their heads. This not only suggests that India and Africa are two regions without development or urbanization, but also that the concepts we learn in class can only be found in the \"other\" a.k.a. not the Western world because we are \"civilized.\" The concepts in class do have examples in the Western world. If I could rename this course, I would name it \"Introduction to the World for White Females.\"",
    "Stength: Professor Rosenbluth is a great lecturer. She is really engaging, and so was the content. The lessons were also well organized.\r\nWeakness: The content felt pretty repetitive.",
    "Strengths - very engaging, interesting, well organized, the professor and TFs were friendly, approachable, and easy to talk to\r\nweaknesses - sometimes the lectures ran a bit long and more time was needed to adequately go through all of the material for the day",
    "Strengths: Nice professor, topic is good food for thought\r\n\r\nWeakness: I feel like it's not the most thought-provoking class.",
    "I really enjoyed the material of this course including the readings and the class presentations. Although I think the professor worked way too quickly and we never indulged deeply in the material or got to the end of the presentations.",
    "The course is good. The professor is nice and her lecture slides are clear. I enjoyed covering all the topics in class. A weakness is the simplicity of some concepts.",
    "Quite repetitive but interesting content. Some outdated data and sources.",
    "strengths are the class is very interesting and has a very easy workload. no weaknesses",
    "I like the fact that the course covers many topics within gender equality from different perspectives, generating debate and encouraging critical thinking. However, I would've liked to have fewer research papers to read and more readings that explained things more in-depth.",
    "+ the concepts were easy to grasp\r\n- the ideas were rather superficial \r\n- the course concepts could be better integrated to provide more meaningful conclusions",
    "The course has a great structure - the lectures are engaging and section is helpful in clearing up anything we might have missed or not understood. The opt-in writing component works well for this course, since it lends itself to interesting research but also works without it.",
    "Really great course. Lectures are very engaging and digestible! \r\n\r\nI think the final could have been a lot more challenging to really separate those who were fully engaged and those who werent. It was certainly fair but I dont think the IDs offered much challenge",
    "While some of the lectures are very interesting, most are just general repeats of ideas already stated. Its a lot of repeating. If taken as a WR, the prompt is very confusing And theres not a lot of direction given for the whole paper itself.",
    "Lectures were very interesting, but often rushed because of the short scheduled time (50 minutes). Could benefit from a longer time.",
    "I think the strength was organized well. The lectures build on each other and the vocabulary we learn throughout the course becomes more and more applicable to everything we learn. While I was studying for the Final I realized just how much I had learned  it doesn't seem like you're absorbing much in each individual lecture, but by the end, cumulatively, you realized you've learned so much.",
    "Strengthsection!!",
    "Strengths: themes are explored and developed over the course of a semester! You really get a broad, yet deep, overview of how the interplay of sex, markets, and power shape our world. Such an interesting course taught by such an interesting, kind professor! \r\nWeaknesses: For the writing-intensive sections (ie. those taking the course for WR credit), there are high expectations for the social science papers students are assigned to write, but there is little instruction for how to do so. For someone who has no background with that kind of writing, a lot of outside help is required.",
    "The lectures were very interesting and we got a good amount of support in our sections for the midterms. The material was very engaging and we reviewed a good amount. \r\n\r\nWe should have gotten more help and feedback on the final paper. It would have been nice if the last lecture was not review, but gave a bigger picture or introduced new themes.",
    "I think that, as the class progressed, the format got even stronger and more productive. The small conversations with a partner, instead of the profeessor just straight asking questions, were helpful and I think this was a good implement.",
    "I think the course could tackle the underlying assumptions we make about gender. We explored a lot of \"biological\" explanations for why gender exists but never grappled with how gender itself was created for different means.",
    "This course should really be considered an introductory course. So many generalizations were made, and I feel like we didn't dive too deep into one topic at all. A lot of people consider this course a gut and didn't put a lot of effort in it. We had ONE class on intersectionality, and to me, that really sums up this class. I wish one of the lenses that we looked at, instead of the problematic biological lens, was intersectionality.",
    "I was always engaged",
    "Great professor",
    "Writing credit was way more challenging than non-writing section which was kind of frustrating.",
    "Weaknesses",
    "I thought the way the class was taught and organized was perfect! Nightly readings before lecture prepares me for the material and were always relevant and helped facilitate productive discussion throughout the semester.",
    "It's so interesting and relevant. I really think everyone should take this course. Amazing professor. great lectures",
    "interesting topics and engaging lessons, I thought the course was really good",
    "All of the different topics are incredibly interesting. The course covers a lot, but it never feels like you're not covering something enough. It strikes a balance between depth and breadth very well, especially since you can choose to focus on different topics as you please for papers. The only weakness was really that it's pretty unorganized in the beginning when it came to sections. I ended up having to take the course for a writing credit just to be in the class because of lack of communication with what section to sign up for in the beginning. In the end, I enjoyed taking it as a writing credit but it could have been a lot more clear in the beginning and would've avoided a lot of confusion.",
    "The course material was fascinating and well presented. However, the breadth of topics was so great that it was difficult to dive into any one topic or form a complete opinion, even in section.",
    "Strengths: great lecturer, well organized section, interesting and relevant content \r\nWeakness: nothing",
    "The lectures were very interesting; I just wish that we had looked at some longer pieces instead of only reading a few pages of everything.",
    "I think this was a very interesting course and I enjoyed the lectures.",
    "I really appreciated how relevant this course was to current events  it made the course very engaging and strong.",
    "I liked that the slides were put online, it made it easier to revise.",
    "The lectures are a great length and are always interesting. It would be interesting to consider race and class throughout the course as a whole rather than in one single lecture. Sections could have had more structure or direction.",
    "Strengths: does a great job of connecting readings and lectures together. Each one builds on the next so the course feels very fluid and smooth. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes an idea was touched on very lightly and not elaborated fully which sometimes left me a little confused. In addition, there were no comments on my midterm, just a grade, so I had no idea what I did right or wrong.",
    "Due dates were never clear until last minute\r\nworkload was very back ended\r\n\r\ninteresting readings\r\ngood discussion in section\r\namazing lecture and accessible and kind prof",
    "Strengths: Professor Rosenbluth truly has the structure for the class down and each lecture I knew exactly what I was learning and the structure in which I was taught. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While my TA was incredible, my discussion section itself was a little dry at times, so the only weakness of the class is that if you're stuck with a very unengaged discussion section, you may not take much from your section."

    "Yes. Interesting course, but not hard. You can learn and not stress about having to put in excessive time for a good grade.",
    "Yes for sure! I think it is an important class for men to take so they can be good allies to women, and a good class for women to take because it helps explain patterns\/sexism that you might have seen before. I thought it was interesting that there were DKE students in the class, sure hope they got something out of it! haha . also, honestly, probably kind of rough for nonbinary students in that the discussion of gender within the class was very binary, maybe there could've been more of a mention of nonbinary people. perhaps a lecture on that topic would be good.",
    "Yes, I loved learning and I loved constructing a comprehensive analysis to specific data points.",
    "I would definitely recommend it because the subject matter is extremely pertinent and interesting.",
    "I think its content is necessary and fascinating, so yes!",
    "Definitely. I think that this subject is super important to learn about whether you are a boy or a girl and I learned about really relevant issues and gender inequality issues that persist today.",
    "Yes! Would keep in mind that the talk about gender is very biological focused and less cultural\/social construct-focused",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course. As mentioned, it's very well organized, the lecture is interesting, it has a variety of good readings. And gender equality is important to learn about!",
    "YES!!!! If you want an easy class that is genuinely so interesting and has a professor that cares about students, TAKE THIS!!! You will not regret it!! Do not take as a writing credit unless you want to write unnecessarily longer papers.",
    "This has been one if not my favorite class from my time at Yale so far and for anyone who can get into it, I highly recommend.",
    "I would for sure. I learned a lot about things I didn't know and I loved the professor.",
    "Yes! Definitely take this course. An amazing empirical introduction to gender studies and some of the big questions about gender in society today, as well as how some very prominent social scientists have gone about studying those problems.",
    "This is definitely one of the must take courses offered at Yale, not only because of how engaging and interesting it is, but also because of how applicable and necessary this subject matter is for the real world",
    "Yes, absolutely. Some central societal norms and questions are brought to bare in a sophisticated but straightforward way.",
    "Definitely. A gut that is actually interesting",
    "Yes, but don't take it writing.",
    "Yes, it is a good writing credit and the topics are interesting and fun to debate.",
    "I would recommend this course because the knowledge I gained was extremely helpful and interesting.",
    "If you want an introduction to gender and sex issues, specifically focused on public policy, then yes! Also, if you want to be exposed to a bunch of gender issues around the world, and think about solutions, it is a good class. If you're looking for a really theoretical look at the fundamental issues, (what is gender? what is sex? is it biological?) this is probably not the class, look at something that's purely WGSS.",
    "Yes, the content that is covered is very interesting, relevant, and important to learn. The professor is outstanding.",
    "yeah interesting enough. not that hard",
    "If you are POC, be prepared to already know a lot of these concepts. This class is facilitated for white (females).",
    "If you are looking for an interesting class with a low workload, then yes.",
    "Yes, because I thoroughly enjoyed the conversations of this lecture and the information covered was clear, understandable, and interesting.",
    "Sure. I took it for a writing credit and there was not that much work, although the grading kind of makes me regret taking it as a writing credit.",
    "No. I don not think the writing credit was interweaved with this course enough in terms of the material relating or the section leader helping it link. I think the course was too rushed and disorganised with students continuously having to ask for deadline dates throughout the entire semester and outlines for papers which ended up being decided by the individual TA's.",
    "yes.",
    "Yes this is one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Yale. It has nothing to do with my major but I went to lecture everyday because the material was so interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course. Little workload but good concepts are covered on gender relations.",
    "yes! definitely take this class",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in expanding their knowledge of feminism.",
    "Yes, it is a nice course if you need to add a 5th class. The material is engaging and relevant.",
    "Yes! It covers a great deal of topics that everyone should be knowledgeable about (especially in this current political climate), and the class is just interesting overall!",
    "Yes. It is a really good introduction to global inequality",
    "I probably wouldnt. Some topics are very interesting and Professor Rosenbluth is very knowledgeable about this field, but its just a very broad coverage of basic info.",
    "Yes, take this course if you'd like an overview of modern gender issues.",
    "Yes, it is important to discuss the history and manifestation of gender inequality, and our individual space within it. I would recommend taking the Writing Credit rather than just the regular credit, because I feel like it would be easy to kind of just cruise through the course without absorbing much without the Writing component.In the WR section, you choose a topic to explore throughout the semester, and you come out of the class with a unique expertise in the issue you researched that you can be really proud of. It was also my first long research paper (about 20 pages), and I think this class was a good setting to start writing research papers, because you build up to 20 pages, rather than writing 20 pages all at once. The first paper you write ~5-7, pages, then you add another ~5-7 pages for the next installment, and then for the final paper you add enough pages to finish up your investigation of the topic. I feel very accomplished and fulfilled having taken the WR credit.",
    "ABSOLUTELY it will change the way you see interactions in every part of your life and make you think about the gendered relations everywhere",
    "Yes; amazing, fresh perspective on real-world events like mating and discrimination.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! I think everyone should take it -- it completely changed how I think about the world. You take away what you put into the course; that is, if you are engaged with the course material and lectures, you will learn a lot and have a rich learning experience.",
    "Absolutely not!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has never taken a social science course because it changes the way you think of people's behavior and applies to daily life.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course!!! It honestly reshaped the way I see the entire world and it is such a great class! Sections can be dry sometimes but if you can bare those lectures are really interesting and the paper\/exams aren't too bad.",
    "Yes! Very informative and relevant, great course materials and set-up, and mamageable workload.",
    "Take it if you want an economic and political perspective for why gender inequality persists in the world today. However, keep in mind that it is highly heteronormative: the course does not challenge the underlying assumptions about gender and takes the gender binary for granted. The \"biological\" explanations for gender inequality that were presented in class I often took with a grain of salt, so about 2\/3 of the material was actually useful for me.",
    "Not really anything you haven't heard before.",
    "Yes! It was a good amount of work and loved going to class",
    "Yes! Great material",
    "Yes, but not for writing. Given no direction on papers.",
    "No",
    "Yes absolutely. It is a fantastic jump start to thinking productively about reasonable changes that can be made in todays world and had a well designed structure for student success while maintaining engagement throughout.",
    "Yes, very interesting class that shows you different perspectives of power dynamics.",
    "Yeah! good prof, great syllabus, fair assessments. If you're able to get Hilary as a TA, you'll be golden. She's so knowledgeable and helpful and she'll definitely give good feedback if you ask.",
    "Yes! It's important, relevant information that everyone should take. It's also not very much work.",
    "Yes I learned a lot and it was interesting",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It really makes you think about daily life as a woman and the different challenges we face in a world that is generally set up to be unfair. It also makes you aware of a lot of different debates going on presently about policy issues.",
    "Yes! This class is an excellent introduction to theoretical approaches and modern topics in womens\/gender studies. A perfect class for foundational learning in the field, though a little basic\/general for those with background knowledge.",
    "Absolutely. Prof Rosenbluth is an amazing lecturer and the course is interesting and relevant",
    "Definitely- was such a great and interesting class that gave me a better understanding of why women are largely disadvantaged.",
    "yes!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, as it is very visible in everyday life.",
    "Yes I'd recommend this course to another student because I think there are valuable things to learn from this course.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in public policy or female empowerment.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. I think it provides crucial knowledge on how gender and society interact.",
    "Yes, this is a great class for better understanding gender inequality!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course! It is so engaging and the pure knowledge you leave with is incredibly important in this day and age. Not only do you better understand gender inequality, but now I have a firmer understanding of our political and economic systems, but in this country and around the world.",
    "For sure - one of best classes I've taken at Yale. Great prof, important topic, good skills learned. Was always engaged and interested without being overwhelmed by work. Writing a research paper was tricky but not overly challenging to the point where it ruined class for me",
    "Yes, 110%. It's an incredibly engaging class and the workload is as much or as little as you want it to be. In that sense, if you truly cannot get to the reading for a class, it's not detrimental, but the more you engage with material outside of class, the more you will take away from the class itself."
