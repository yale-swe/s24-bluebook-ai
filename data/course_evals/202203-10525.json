                "I enjoyed the structure of having class every two weeks so that we were given enough time to rehearse, but also the chance to practice performing each movement of our selection.",
                "I think this class is wonderful in that we are able to play chamber music at a high level at an undergraduate university.  I would love it if Wendy could hire at least one coach who is of color (there are great quartets out there who are people of color), making the class a more inclusive space.  I think she should also hire coaches who have lots of experience teaching chamber music.  One of my coaches this year really did not seem to have their heart into coaching my group, and I feel like we did not receive helpful feedback-- my experience in the past with other coaches were much more exciting.  The class could also be expanded into two periods-- I feel like this class could include a lot more people-- I know many other hard-working students who love to play music just as much as I do who did not get into the class, and I think it would be more fun to have the class be less competitive to get into!",
                "The class is a very supportive environment to practice performing. It is also a great opportunity to be able to work with the coaches from the Callisto Quartet.",
                "It was perfect.",
                "More performance opportunities along the way outside of class might be beneficial",
                "This course offers a great exposure to a range of chamber music, especially if taken repeatedly. I think the course could benefit from increasing the diversity of its repertoire by including more contemporary composers.",
                "This course is tailored to very serious musicians. While it gives players experience playing chamber music, I did not feel that we were given the general skills of being a good chamber musician. I would have like a lecture or two on things like cuing, listening to other players and tuning to them, and how to have effective rehearsals.",
                "I understand that this class is billed as a Western canon class in contrast to the likes of MUSI 238, but would love to see a more diverse selection of repertoire (even within the same style/era as the Beethovens and Brahms etc. works that are historically central to the class)"
