You learn what can and can't be said in 1500 words, you start to get a better sense of what in your writing works and what doesn't, etc. Most of that comes from the feedback you get on the first draft of your essays. To highlight one small thing you learn, you also learn a little bit of how a New Yorker-style essay gets made. In the past couple months, whenever somebody's given me a magazine essay to read or I've had something assigned in another class, I read it a little bit differently now and compare it to the structures we talked about in class. I wouldn't take the class if that were all it taught me, but it's one cool benefit you probably won't learn anywhere else that's among the cool things you learn here.",

This course, by allowing me a space to be creative and write, was one of my favorites.",

                "Not enough time for feedback. didnt receive all my grades when they were supposed to be.",
                "Strengths: The feedback you get on your writing and the five very similar essays you write means that you get much better at this type of writing. It's much more fun than academic writing -- I always got to write about something I actually cared about. The readings were short but sweet -- we had more than 30 pages of reading once the entire semester, and it was one of the best readings of the semester. So we got to discuss the readings and cover almost everything every class. \r\nWeaknesses: The one small thing is that Professor Surowiecki clearly has a lot on his plate so sometimes parts of this class will slip. You will always have enough time to do revisions, and the feedback is always everything you need and more, but out of five essays we only got two grades back before the end of the semester. Sometimes the readings (which never followed the syllabus) would be posted the night before. I didn't miss not getting the grades -- the feedback we got for our revisions was more than helpful -- but they weren't there nonetheless.",
                "Good course organized syllabus",
                "This course was wonderful in that fact that you received so much feedback on your first draft so that you could fully incorporate suggestions and edits into your final draft. We read many different writers, which was great, as it exposed us to many different types of writing. Class discussions were thought provoking.",
                "The readings were manageable as were the deadlines and turn around timeline for drafts to final pieces.",
                "The strengths of this course are the open-ended nature of the essays we wrote and the discussions we would have each class period that allowed us to each reflect on our writing processes. A weakness of this course was that for each individual type/style of essay there was little education in the actual traditional form of the essay. This is the main way I feel like the course could be improved: by having the first unit of each type of essay be one of instruction in the traditional style of that essay.",
                "The best part of this course was the detailed responses to our essays. Close edits and comments on my work makes me feel like the professor really takes my work seriously. I was eager to submit each essay because I knew the feedback would only benefit me. \r\n\r\nOf course, this class is 120, and thus there are a lot of young people. And they spoke up a lot, which is good, but sometimes they didnt have the most thoughtful or smart things to say. I sometimes felt disengaged in the class discussions because the comments from younger folks seemed a off, not thought-out. Of course, this is to be expected, and I was happy to see them all so engaged. \r\n\r\nThis class could maybe be improved with more detailed instruction. One class, Prof Surowieki taught us how to list things. For example, I crawled, walked, ran, and flew as opposed to I flew, crawled, walked, and ranthe first has a clear order of importance. That helped all of my essays following that class! I was mind blown. I wish there were more moments like that, where the prof wrote on the board and gave grammar lessons/ analytical comments.",
                "Sometimes the readings can be boring. Sometimes the class is discussing the content of the reading rather than how its written, defeating the purpose of an English Class.\r\n\r\nStrengthen is that you get to read and write a variety of creative nonfictions. You definitely have a chance to become a better writer and experiment different topics/genres."

In terms of interesting-to-length ratio it's hard to get more interesting than these readings, the writing is fun and manageable, the revisions give you the freedom to experiment with content, structure, etc. while still letting you turn in good work when you need a grade, and there is good discussion in class. Also, Professor Surowiecki is terrific: he's a great seminar leader that keeps discussion lively and moving, he's gives great feedback on our essays, he's super considerate and understanding of all the students, but most of all, he's a brilliant professor who always has really interesting things to say about the readings and has an inside perspective on everything we're reading because he wrote columns for magazines like the ones we pull readings from for a long time (and still does, to an extent). You should take this class if you like reading, writing, or both (and if you're at Yale, you probably do).",
