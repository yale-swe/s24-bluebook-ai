I also improved my ability to discuss sometimes uncomfortable and almost always intellectually difficult matters in a group, being non-judgemental of myself and the others, and being willing to sit with discomfort and consider its implications.",

It taught me to ask always \" why?\" and pull back and question the assumptions made even on the most basic level about gender and sexuality.\r\n\r\nThe only difficulty was the amount of time I had to be on my laptop for this course, which cannot be remedied really until classes return to in-person. Professor Savci did try to improve the situation (and succeeded) with our podcast experiment (see question one). Professor also decreased our readings a bit.",

The assignments let us apply the readings to our own lives and develop an awareness of our own subjectivites which is one of the themes of the course.\r\nWeaknesses: a couple of the readings were a little dense, but nothing unmanageable"
