                "Content was very interesting, Prof and TA was were very helpful for feedback and help. Slides shown in class sometimes felt a bit all over the place though and didn't always have clear titles on the slides so looking back through them was kind of confusing.",
                "Strengths- didn't require video, super accessible Professor who is extremely nice and engaging, interesting subject matter, no cold calling, smaller class size, homework assignments to help with grade, a textbook to supplement the class slides\r\nWeaknesses- I think this class got a little in the weeds with the gases\/light\/formation&life cycle of stars situation. The most interesting part was about the planets and solar system because I think that was easier to conceptualize as a new-to-astronomy student. It took me seeing a graphic on Instagram of the size of the largest stars compared to our Sun for me to really understand what we were talking about with the stars.",
                "The strengths were definitely the teaching team. Both Imad and Dr. Zinn were very competent and enthusiastic in their teaching of the material. Asking questions was made a core focus of the course through section (and sometimes in lecture) and I felt like there was no lack of access to help as there often is in other STEM courses. The problem sets focused on applications of things covered in class and left me well-prepared for the quantitative questions on the quizzes and the final. The lectures were comprehensive enough to allow me to be sufficiently prepared for the in-class quizzes. The quizzes weren't too hard and I feel they were pretty intuitive based on my science background and attending lecture. The one weakness was that I don't feel like the lectures or graded material throughout the semester left us well prepared for the short-answer portion of the final. There was so much qualitative material covered throughout the semester that I found it very difficult to recall large swaths of information needed to answer the questions completely. If there were more short answer questions on the quizzes or homework, more clues given about what the short answers would be asking, or if the short answers were made into shorter, more intuitive questions, this would no longer be an issue.",
                "Lecture did feel a little slow at times. Maybe it's because of the virtual setting. Also lecture slides were not organized on canvas so it was hard to find them in chronological order. But overall, really good class, definitely builds up fundamental concepts in astronomy for future in a way that doesn't overwhelm students.",
                "was very organized into different modules",
                "Strength- Professor Zinn is very knowledgable \r\n\r\nWeakness- Half of the class is NOT about stars!!!!! It's about history, exoplanets, and telescope mechanics. Make the class more about stellar evolution! There are other classes that go over those three extraneous topics.",
                "Great course! It moved at a good pace and covered a breadth of material.",

                "The lectures were very engaging, and the discussion sections supported them well. The discussion sections helped me better understand the homework, quiz problems, and the course materials. The design of the course made it easiest to learn the material well.",
                "I think the strength was in the breadth of the material we covered and the problem sets, which were of a good level to understand the material and be well prepared for quizzes and the final exam. The weakness was that sometimes the lectures moved very slowly, and it was sometimes difficult to remain engaged in class."

Prof didn't have the best set up though in that he couldn't see chat or raised hands while giving the lecture so we were asked to just interrupt if we had questions. But people don't really like interrupting a class so no one ever really did. There may have been more questions through classes if we were able to use the raise hand function.",

The pandemic has been impacting attention spans and I'm sure I'm not the only one who began to feel bored towards the end. I would also have appreciated a stronger effort to end class on time, as my Mondays and Wednesdays were quite busy. I feel that section should also have been mandatory as I was one of the few people who attended frequently. I am very appreciative of the professor's efforts to lighten the load this semester while also ensuring that we receive a quality education - most professors seem to believe that we aren't learning unless they push us until we break, and I was stunned by the professor's compassion, especially when he moved problem sets the week after break and during the election.",

                "Absolutely. It's a great introduction to astronomy (I've heard that Planets and Stars and some of the other astro \"guts\" really aren't that good) and you learn a lot more than just stars. I'd say maybe half the course is devoted specifically to stars, and the other half teaches a lot of quantum mechanics, orbital physics, exoplanets, etc. It's an easy fifth class and I would take it either if you're considering doing the astro major or if you're looking for a fun course.",
                "Absolutely. I'm not an astronomy major but I really enjoyed this course. If you like space and stars, this is a course for you. It really shows that all of our troubles are nothing but a minuscule spec in the grand scheme of things in the universe that is millions and billions of light years and parsecs across. Knowing that we are all fleeting entities on a small planet orbiting a relatively common star out of literally billions of similar systems out there, the course makes students think what they are exactly doing on this planet. ASTR 210 gives students an opportunity to see beyond both the physical and spiritual confines of planet Earth, and see and taste a glimpse of the wide world that exists outside. Not only that, but the course gives students hope for a better future, a future where people are not confined to just one planet, but the possibilities of exploring the vast unknowns of space, and opening new frontiers for humanity. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when the entire world as we know it is in crisis, the class offered an escape from Earthly problems by asking us to examine questions more grand than that concerning our little planet.",

                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in astronomy, regardless of whether they're starting out in the astro major, almost done with a different STEM major (like myself), or pursuing an entirely unrelated major. Professor Zinn makes the course accessible to and enjoyable for just about everyone.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. The material is extremely interesting. The workload is heavy, and it takes much studying but its worth it. Especially for people contemplating an astronomy or astrophysics major, this is a good class to take to see if you enjoy the material.",
                "If you're interested in astronomy, this is a good class to get an overview of the subject, as it includes a lot of interesting material with a light workloadif anything, the content is possibly too simplified for actual astronomy majors."
