                "This course gave me an excellent introduction to the concept of monasticism and really highlighted both the similarities and differences in how it manifests in different places around the world.",
                "The highlight of this course was the month-long monastic experience project where we were able to construct our own monastic rules and follow them for a month. The course was extremely organized, so before the monastic experience, we spent several classes outlining important aspects of monasticism and how monastics use these tools to engage in their practice. Apart from learning a lot about the monastic life, the professors also invited about 5 speakers throughout the semester to talk about their experience with monasticism.",
                "This class provides a general overview of monasticism in both Christianity and Buddhism with each week focusing on a certain aspect of monasticism such as food, clothing, etc. \r\n\r\nNot only do you learn from these readings what monasticism is (and isn't), you spend a month following monastic precepts along with other rules you have also written. This experience is very helpful in identifying problems you have\/what you want to change about yourself.",
                "This was an extremely valuable course, not in the knowledge you acquire but about the insight and connection you will attain with yourself. The month of monastic practice is extremely valuable: you get a whole different perspective on your lifestyle, have a month dedicated to looking inward, and I left the month far more calm, peaceful, and content. This class helps improve your quality of life, far more important than knowledge acquisition!",
                "I developed all kinds of knowledge, skills, and insights, just not the usual ones you expect from taking a college course. I definitely learned plenty of academic knowledge as well, but the primary benefits that came from this class were more spiritual. The monastic experience project was the most intense assignment I've ever had from a class (as it reached into every part of my life). However, committing to this experience and following through with it re-affirmed my will power and fully emersed me in a new spiritual way of living. I have come out of this class with more valuable knowledge than any other class I have taken in my life. Danny and Hwansoo are fantastic teachers and this material is fascinating. I really hope that more Yale students will get the opportunity to take this course because it is truly amazing.",
                "You learn about monastic practice in both the Buddhist and Christian traditions from its roots to the present day.  Through the monastic experience project, you also learn about an alternative way of living and a lot about yourself\/your own happiness.",
                "I learned a lot about both Christian and Buddhist monasticism. It was brilliant to learn from Professor Kim, who is a former Buddhist monk now professor and Professor Eastman, whose research is on Christian monastics. Take a look at the syllabus to browse the topics covered."

                "Essentially everything was a strength: format, grading, the assignments, and the content. I would not really change anything about the class.",
                "The strength of this course is the amount of personal development and understanding that I was able to gain. While the content of the course was extremely interesting, I found the emphasis on meditation and monastic practices particularly insightful. The strength of this course is the seminar style because we were all able to have discussions where everyone could contribute their thoughts. I don't think the course could be improved in any way.",
                "Strengths - This class is very small and tight-knit. The smaller groups during the month of the project were engaging and the readings were very interesting. The films\/film clips we were assigned were also very nice and complimentary. Lastly, the guest speakers we had were amazing and listening to their stories was wonderful. I looked forward to this class every week (which can't necessarily be said about my other classes...)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - None? I can't think of any.",
                "Strengths:\r\n\r\nThe size of the class was small so despite being virtual, I felt as if I got to know the other student and instructors well. Discussion was really enjoyable and so was the content of the class. The assignments were very manageable and varied, so each one was interesting. Also the fact that you get time with a former monk to ask any questions you may have about life! All the guest speakers were fantastic too.\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n\r\nThe only thing I felt could have been improved was the final paper: it was assigned as both an academic and reflective paper which felt odd. I would have preferred to pick one or the other.",
                "There are not many weaknesses that I can think of. I think in-person classes will be amazing when they are able to be reimplimented. Trips to monasteries also seem like a great addition.",
                "There really aren't any weaknesses - the discussions were great, the workload wasn't too high and the experience project was truly transformative for most of us in the class.  The professors are also extremely knowledgable and understanding.  The guest speakers were also great and include both Christian and Buddhist monks and nuns currently practicing.",
                "The professors added tremendously to the course, sharing from their academic and personal experience with the topics. The course was well organized with the syllabus, and having the guest speakers was a wonderful addition. Both professors are fabulous seminar leaders and both are very engaged with students. They give detailed feedback on all assignments and meet with students regularly. The type of personal reflection required for the course was new for me in an academic setting, and both were very thoughtful with their thoughts and our office hours discussions. It was great that they required various meetings throughout the term, and gave such detailed feedback on the monastic reflection papers. I am a very formal and very private person and I am very happy the structure of the course and generosity of the professors crossed that line and forced me to learn and engage in this new way. They also gave us tremendous flexibility to study the angles that most interested us, and apply the class to our own lives in distinctive and personal ways. Both professors worked with us individually on our personal projects given this flexibility.\r\n\r\nThe class and the syllabus were very well organized, and I felt I was able to have deep personal conversations with my classmates because of the extra breakout rooms and monastic discussion rooms. This was wonderful, especially in the time of COVID.\r\n\r\nI am a very intense senior humanities student, so the workload is much less than what I am accustomed to in some of my upper level humanities classes. That being said, I think the workload is comparable to most Yale classes that are open to freshman and sophomores. The professors chose very interesting readings and they were very reasonable in length. They chose to allow us to spend extra time with the readings and learn them thoroughly as opposed to assigning huge reading loads; I felt that I was really able engage deeply with the readings and that was very meaningful and worthwhile for me. They also included films which added significantlythe visual engagement with the material was a whole new dimension to look at and study monasticism.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note: both professors were very thoughtful to make all the readings and materials accessible for free; we did not spend a dime in fees, textbook purchases, etc. They were very conscientious about this."

I very much appreciated the small break we had most weeks halfway through the class. It's the small things that make great differences.\r\n\r\nI don't have any improvements from the top of my head I can think of.",

Having guest speakers constantly was a wonderful addition. I have taken classes with Professor Kim before, and I felt that this class was just as wonderful a learning experience as his classes in the past have been; in fact, this was one of my favorite and most personally and intellectually productive courses I have taken at Yale. I am very grateful to both professors for their time in office hours and extensive personalized feedback."

I was so excited to listen to the guest speakers and the readings\/films we had to watch were very exciting. The class was led by Prof Hwansoo Kim who is absolutely amazing. Even if you aren't majoring in RLST or any humanities major, this class is a great way to learn something you never thought you would learn about!",
                "I would 100% recommend this course. IT IS A MUST. It's the perfect antidote to the overly-stressed, anxious, workhorse student body. Even if you think you have no interest in religion or spirituality, take this course.",
                "Yes, without a doubt. Yale students especially are caught up too much in their own little worlds. This class will give more students the much-needed opportunity to step back and reassess.",
                "I would absolutely recommend.  This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale because it doesn't just focus on challenging you in the traditional academic sense, it also gives you an opportunity to think about bigger questions that are so important to consider at this time of life particularly.  You interrogate your own happiness, way of life, ability to be in the present moment and spirituality through learning from other monastics and conducting your own monastic experience.  It really was transformative, and the lessons I have taken from this class will be ones I think we will all carry for the rest of our lives.",
