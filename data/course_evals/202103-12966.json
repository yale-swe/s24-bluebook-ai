We learned about the very long run of economies (and particularly the U.S. economy) as well as the economic theory that underpins what's on the cover of newspapers today: labor shortages and the Beveridge Curve, rising inflation and the Federal Funds Rate, etc.",

                "Strengths: very engaging lectures, Nordhaus always drops interesting stories and anecdotes from his esteemed career",
                "Strengths\r\n- My TF Pedro was incredibly clear when explaining the concepts in discussion section and office hours. He really helped me understand the models studied in class.\r\n- The alternating quiz\/p-set every week was very helpful to keep me focused and studying for the class every week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- A lot of discrepancy between what was taught in class and what was in the textbook.\r\n- Nordhaus often didn't finish the powerpoint slides in lecture and we were still obligated to know the content of these.",
                "Strengths: Standard intermediate macro class, I guess smaller class size\r\nWeaknesses: Nordhaus is hard to understand (speaks very low), he is unwilling to allow regrades (because grading errors are a part of the distribution)",
                "Strenghs: Professor Nordhaus is an engaging lecturer and obviously so knowledgeable. the TFs were amazing and explained concepts super clearly during office hours\/section. I liked the format of alternating quizzes and psets because it forced me to stay on track thorughout the semester, making the final exam less stressful. \r\nWeaknesses: We would often get delayed announcements of what quizzes\/exams will cover and what we're supposed to know. Professor Nordhaus's slides often had typos\/errors in them. We also had very little practice material for the quizzes\/midterm\/final. For many of the math-heavy equations, the professor, the TF, and the textbook would use three different sets of notations and parameters, which made it difficult to figure out how they relate.",
                "Strengths: Great professor with lots of profound knowledge and interesting thoughts on the subject from a long career spent studying it, who cares about students and does I believe want them to do well. Having quizzes and psets was also a nice break to the otherwise strict pset routine of intro econ courses. Weaknesses: This course is not very well organized. Frequently it felt like I was taking three different courses if you account for readings, lectures, and sections, each of which felt a little superfluous and a little necessary. It did not feel like there was a clear direction on where to go and there was never a clear guide to how to study for things. There were never any practice exams (with answers) or review materials, all of which could make you feel like you were stumbling in the dark. This is especially in comparison to the other intermediate econ which was much more organized and which seemed to provide a more streamlined path.",
                "Strengths: Even though it was pretty general macro, I liked the content a lot. Seeing the theoretical explanations for the econ happening in the news felt really useful; great TFs in Pedro and Bernardo, sections did not feel like a chore and instead a great chance for fully understanding content; I liked the more dispersed course structure with four quizzes, but wish the quizzes counted for more of your grade and final for a little less. Weaknesses: Minor point but wish the notation used in lectures, sections, and the Mankiw textbook all matched. It was mostly the same, but occasionally different variables used for parameters could make things seem more complicated when really everyone was on the same page.",
                "This course was a great overview of macroeconomics, the two TFs were amazing teachers, the mixed PSET \/ test schedule allowed room for more varied practice than simply having a weekly PSET would have. The Math level is also very flexible. If I wanted to, some slides explained the topics with more involved calculus while some left it to the bare bones.\r\n\r\nHowever, I feel like the professor did not really check what students had learned in Introductory Macroeonomics ECON 116, meaning that often, this course felt more like an introductory than an intermediate course.  Most topics were repetitions of topics in introductory which is not a problem in and of itself, but they were often covered far more superficially than they had been in ECON116.",
                "This class was organized in a way that was extremely conducive to learning. The material from lectures would be reviewed and expanded upon in weekly section. The textbook readings were short and did a great job explaining the concepts. I greatly appreciated having 4 quizzes and 4 PSETs instead of only PSETs as it forced me to spread out my studying throughout the semester.  Because of the quizzes, the material was much easier to recall on the midterm and final because I had already reviewed it a few weeks prior. It was also nice to have your final grade spread out across many assignments throughout the semester, so if you had a bad day, there was a chance to recover.",
                "Lectures could have been more interesting and engaging.",
                "Main strength of this course was the workload on students. Rather than having weekly psets, there were only four spread across the semester and they weren't long. Instead there were also 4 quizzes which honestly helped out both with time and understanding the material.",
                "This course covered several key topics necessary for economics majors and Professor Nordhaus was an engaging and fun professor. However, sometimes lectures felt very different then psets, quizzes, and exams. It would be nice to have more practical problem solving in lecture that more closely reflected our various assessments. Sections did help with this, but one hour of section per week was still a very small amount of problem solving help in comparison to the extent that our quizzes and exams were problem solving. \r\nI do believe that the grading in this course on psets and the midterm was a poor reflection of learning. The grading was highly nit picky and did not reward points in some cases despite students having the correct answer. Points were removed if the answers weren't framed in the exact way that the solutions were written, which I believe penalizes students arbitrarily. I believe that grading should reflect learning and points should always be rewarded for correct answers. This was most frustrating because regrade requests were essentially not allowed.",
                "strengths: i liked the smaller class format and the tfs. the quizzes and reduced number of psets was also good\r\nweakness: professor nordhaus did not provide a lot of practice materials for the exam and did not give us the solutions",
                "- Nordhaus mumbles through lectures, there are few resources to study for midterms\/exams, and most of the course is taught by TAs.",
                "Greta application of theoretical concepts to the real world",
                "Strengths: Great professor and well taught class that emphasized macroeconomic principles and related them to historical examples to provide context\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometime droned on about unimportant topics or concepts skipping over the ones that were more important.",
                "I learned a lot of theory, could have learned more numerical approaches.",
                "It could have been more engaging. It gave a good theoretical foundation for the complexities of macroeconomics.",
                "The strength of the course is that both lectures and sections are excellent opportunities to learn. You develop a very solid understanding of the macroeconomic models that are commonly used to represent our economy. There are no real weaknesses of the course."

                "Not sure if you'll ever get to take it with as great a professor ever again, but Nordhaus was simply fantastic. Really one of those \"wow I go to YALE\" moments for a lot of us. He was super well versed (as expected) and his modern applications which you won't find in any textbook were fantastic.",
                "Yes! Although likely for econ majors only, it was very interesting to learn about Prof. Nordaus's opinions on macro trends (i.e. COVID recovery, inflation spike, employment vacancies). Low workload (only 4 psets) so also easy to credit D if just interested but scared of econ curve.",
                "Yes, if you want a slightly easier intermediate macroeconomics course. But, keep in mind that Nordhaus isn't the best professor and so check if TFs are good.",
                "Yes. Professor makes the lectures engaging and is very thorough in his explanations. The quiz and pset format also forces you to stay on top of the material which makes the course more enjoyable and the midterm and final easier.",
                "I just took this class for the clout when I say I took a class with a Nobel Prize winner. But otherwise, I would recommend it with Nordhaus if Zillibotti is the other professor teaching. But if Peters is teaching, pick him over Nordhaus. Again this is a requirement for econ majors.",
                "It depends. You probably have to take it for your major. I'd heard that 126 was just about the same level of difficulty as 122, and I think I might've enjoyed it more.",
                "Yes - It's a great opportunity to learn from Professor Nordhaus, and even though his lectures\/slides aren't the clearest or the most well-structured, the TFs do make up for that during section. I ended up learning and retaining a ton, but there needs to be better communication between the professor and the TFs, or overall just clearer instructions conveyed to the students.",
                "It really depends. If you're excited about macro and perhaps not that into having a very organized, rigorous course then it's probably a good fit, also especially if you want to think more about current issues. On the other hand, if you appreciate more of an organized and structured course then you might struggle a bit in this one. Also do make sure to shop around for TAs because it is often the case that one is better than the other.",
                "Yes. Most people just take this for ECON major or another related requirement, which makes sense, but I liked it with Nordhaus and the TF team enough that I think non-ECON majors interested in the Fed or the economics in the news would also enjoy. Relevant for understanding how the broad global and U.S. economies both function.",
                "Since this is a core course for many majors, I will simply explain the differences between Prof. Nordhaus' course and the standard ECON122. \r\nIf you are looking for an easy class, with low workload and simple concepts, and little required math, take this one. \r\nIf you want a more rigorous approach to macroeconomics, I would recommend taking the over version of this class.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course. Professor Nordhaus is witty and engaging, mixing in economic theory with personal anecdotes, time for questions, and current events in the lectures. Having 4 PSETs and 4 quizzes instead of all PSETs prevented the course from feeling repetitive or tedious. The quizzes also served as good practice for the midterm and final and made it easier to recall information from months before because I had already reviewed it not too long ago. Having many assignments reduced the stress on any one assignment because if you had a bad day, there was a chance to recover. You will learn a lot about macroeconomics from this course!",
                "If taking Econ as major, yes",
                "I would recommend this to students interested in learning more about the relationships within the US economy.",
                "I would recommend this course with Professor Nordhaus to those students who are very passionate about macroeconomics or required to take the course for their major. I wouldn't take it to simply learn about large macroeconomic topics because most of the grading of the class reflected problem solving rather than your understanding of macroeconomic workings at large.",
                "yes i think this is better than the larger macro lecture. also being taught by prof nordhaus is a privilege",
                "Yes - very useful for everyone to understand the economy",
                "Yes. This is a great class and one that everyone remotely interested in economics should take. I would definitely recommend it.",
                "Yes, if you need to take it for the major.",
                "Yes, 100%. Professor Nordhaus is one of those rare professors that has been a superstar in his field, yet still cares deeply about teaching undergraduates. It was absolutely amazing to hear all of Nordhaus' perspectives and of all his experiences. Plus, you definitely get a good understanding of macro from the class - and its really not a very difficult course.",
