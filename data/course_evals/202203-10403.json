I thought the topics were great.\r\nWeakness - the readings were simply too much at some points, and although it was interesting for background, we definitely could have had more focused and involved class conversations if everyone had really done them all.",
                "strengths: awesome mix of primary and secondary sources, of close reading and the big picture, of diving into the details and thinking about legacy today; fantastic syllabus covering the major thinkers and debates of the French Revolution; final paper and conference are incredible ways to see how much we still have to learn about the F.R.\r\nweaknesses: sometimes class discussion lacked continuity, political thought (e.g. Rousseau) was sometimes invoked confusedly",
                "I liked the idea behind the course but the actual experience of it didn't really match my expectations. In many cases, the readings felt overwhelming and unnecessarily dense, which could just be a function of the scholarship on the different topics, but sometimes we'd read a 60-page reading and barely discuss it among the 2 other readings that week. The discussion was also difficult to engage with at times: there was little genuine dialogue between the students and the questions would often fall flat."

                "I would only recommend this course if you already have some background knowledge of the history of the French Revolution or are interested in the domain of intellectual history. I feel like everyone in the class could've benefitted from a stronger understanding of the actual history of the Revolution before delving into the intellectual conversations at the time."
