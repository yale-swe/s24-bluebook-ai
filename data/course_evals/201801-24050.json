    "learned a heck of a lot about astronomy",
    "This course taught me an overview about a ton of astronomical topics that I had previously known nothing about. It touches on a lot of different things but does a good job of bringing them together and contextualizing them.",
    "I learned about different scientific principles behind astronomy.",
    "basic scientific research, survey of astronomy",
    "Wow, I learned a lot in this course. So many different topics were covered, from phenomena in our solar system all the way out to the most distant galaxies. Professor Zinn also strives to continually get students to think about what living in such a large and diverse universe means for our own lives, for Earth's environment, and for the future of humanity.",
    "I learned enough introductory Astronomy that I can now understand basic news that I might encounter on a daily basis.",
    "i learned about the scientific method and got an interdisciplinary sweeping overview of astronomy"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths:\r\nProf. Zinn is engaging, entertaining, and insightful\r\npapers instead of exams\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\ntoo much material to learn it all\r\nlittle discussion for a seminar, but then again, it's STEM, so maybe thats unavoidable?",
    "More time in class to discuss and review the material.",
    "It was great that this was a small class, because it facilitated student learning well. I  say it would be nice to have more discussion.",
    "ambiguously defined as a seminar when it is a lecture course. confusing course structure and requirements",
    "Strengths: You learn a lot about astronomy while also getting ample opportunity to reflect upon life. Professor Zinn is excellent, and the course allows for students to both learn about topics that are integral to the course, as well as to explore the topics that are most interesting to them through the midterm and final papers (i.e. two papers).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not exactly a weakness, but technically the class was supposed to end at 5:20 but we always got out at 5:30...",
    "The lectures were well formatted, though a bit fast and hard to understand (also quite long, but the break in between was nice). They were rarely sufficient to answer the weekly questions without the help of the textbook. The questions were really helpful in cementing my knowledge; the questions I wrote about are what I will likely remember most, and I have documentation to look back on. I especially appreciated the deeper, thought-provoking questions towards the end, and it was nice discussing them in class. The questions were VERY time consuming though, and so were the two essays, but I'm glad they were broken up into parts. Being able to discuss a detailed outline was especially helpful.",
    "i wish there had been more opportunities to test our knowledge and more interaction with the material during seminar"

    "I doubt this course will ever be offered again, at least by Prof. Zinn, but I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a SC credit. Finding a SC class that has essays, not tests, and is a seminar is basically unheard of. The second half of the course is tougher, intellectually, than the first, and it's probably impossible to learn all of the material, unless you already have a scientific background. That being said, that doesn't really matter, as you really just need to know a lot about a little for the essays. Prof. Zinn is a little old Italian lady, but she is an absolute firecracker, and quite sweet and entertaining. She gave us gifts on the last day of class, and, of course, is brilliant. Grading isn't bad, for a SC credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Great for someone who doesnt have a lot of prior knowledge about astronomy. Prof. Zinn does a great job of making the information understandable and explaining cool phenomena.",
    "Absolutely! The best class I have taken at Yale, hands down. Graziella is so generous with her knowledge, and truly cares about each person in the class. We got to use the observatory, which is such a special experience that not many people take advantage of at Yale. Learned about the universe, but also just had great conversation!",
    "This is a nice overview to astronomy, and its  accessible to those who have never studied it before. The seminar style is also nice for student interaction",
    "very confusing",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Great overview of astronomy with a dedicated professor and not an overwhelming amount of work. It's also great to have the freedom to write about topics in astronomy that interest you for the two papers.",
    "Definitely take this class if it's offered again because it's probably the best non-STEM science credit out there AND it's actually well taught, interesting, and has such a kind and caring instructor.",
    "if you are looking for a challenging science class for non majors i would recommend"
