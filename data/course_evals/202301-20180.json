We learned about elements of history that I hadn't covered in other classes, and I learned a very intersectional history of medicine. I also further developed critical thinking skills when in conversation with my peers.",

It made me feel prepared and ready to write my 15-page final paper (which sometimes can be daunting). I felt very supported throughout the entire semester!",
                "Very well organized! Loved the readings each week and how class discussion was structured. LOVED the interactive activities and times when we got to \"play\" as different historical characters.",
                "It was super interesting and the weekly discussions were thoughtful and well structured. Some of the assignments through the semester felt a little more like busy work, and it wouldve been nice to have assignments that related to content in the course in addition to preparatory assignments for the final paper. That said, it was well organized and manageable.",
                "I loved this course and the readings we were assigned. I thought our discussions were fascinating as well. However, because we often had so much reading that covered a large period of time, I would have loved some lectures in class that helped to place everything in a timeline and provide a broader historical context to which we could attach all the readings."

                "Highly recommend. Prof. O'Donnell is great, gives you lots of feedback, is very responsive. Course material is super interesting and covers lots of different topics, and she is wonderful at keeping class discussions and activities very engaging! The assignments are great and slowly help you write your research paper over the course of the semester so you're not overwhelmed at the last minute and have lots of time to think and get feedback. It was a super fulfilling project to work on!",
