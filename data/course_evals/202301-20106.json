                "While there are many skills, and insights developed during this course, one stands out the most; developing and understanding multiple narratives within ones own archive. For me personally, it allowed me to understand the larger context of my own personal narrative. The course provided the opportunity to see how my own experiences relate to the world around me, not just from my own perspective. It offered the chance to see how others connect to my own experiences, and archive. With such a diverse group of students, the opportunity to see how they connect and relate to those experiences is priceless.",
                "I was able to learn and practice my editing skills on Premiere. I received feedback on how to organize my films, and learned storyboarding skills. Additionally, this class emphasized and practiced the power of community storytelling, especially to tell the stories of those often dismissed/neglected. For example, in my personal films, I specifically centralized the low-income community of color I came from. In addition to serving as a very flexible and freeing creative space where I could make mistakes in my filmmaking journey, this class taught me how film could be a tool for healing and resistance."

                "There is almost no technical teaching on filmmaking in this class, so know that. That said, you pick up different styles and techniques through screenings, the short media projects, and other students' work.",
                "Professor Harris was able to create a truly safe and welcoming community within our class. Professor Harris additionally brought in many filmmakers to class to talk about their filmmaking process. There are very few weaknesses. The biggest challenge of the class was the duration. A 3-hour class felt about 45 minutes too long for this class.",
                "Really fun for exploration and was very creative with projects.",
                "n/a; perfect course",
                "Although it is a film class, it feels that the main audience is non-film majors who already have experience editing. Do not take this course if you have no skills with Premiere. Discussions of films often fall flat, so do not take this class if you enjoy discussing films. However, it is great to spend time in the CCAM and Thomas Allen Harris is a kind Professor.",
                "Truth be told, the entire heart of this class depends on youthree short media projects which are independently created with only yourself and some editing software. I think it can be a double edged sword because if you start falling out of your interest in the class, the 3 hour in person class can seem like an eternity. However, what I love about the class was the community we cultivate throughout the semester and how it was able to then support different levels of vulnerability and storytelling between each person in the class, which, though isn't a guarantee, is something that made my experience wonderful and truly unforgettable.",
                "Strengths: The course forces you to make your own films.That hands-on process is really fruitful. Also, my class was able to develop such a strong community because people were very vulnerable in sharing their experiences through film, which was so cool!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The three hour class time sometimes felt way too long.",
                "The course felt quite unstructured and it felt like a lot of time was wasted. That being said, the guests were awesome and it was really fun to see the kind of work that people developed.",
                "Strengths: the community!! class had such an open, warm environment where I and others felt vulnerable and supported enough to share our work. enjoyed the guest speakers a lot too\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: didn't enjoy the selection of movie screenings as much, a lot of them felt very similar in style and though it's an archival class, I wish we could've looked at a broader genre of films for the screening or movies that used archives in different ways (there was definitely some of that diversity, but wish there was more)",
                "very fun class. not like any class ive taken at yale. \r\n\r\nthe only weakness is that the assignments are very time consuming and i feel we could do without one of the short media projects because the turnaround time is very short",
                "One of the strengths that stands out is how students with multiple disciplines in the arts, or otherwise can seamlessly engage in film. From students whose ability can produce high production film, to students experimenting in film; there was never a lack of dialogue, critique or encouragement.",
                "A huge strength was that all ranges of skill/experience with filmmaking were welcome without judgment. You could come into the class as a beginner, as an expert, or anything in between. The emphasis was on learning and expression, not on perfection. I also deeply appreciated the screenings we had weekly, as I was able to learn a lot about storytelling and film just from the films we watched. We also got to speak to a lot of the directors / filmmakers involved, which was a very cool and educational experience."

                "It's a chill class, so take it with cool people and you will have a good time! The consecutive three hours in CCAM takes a toll, though.",
                "Definitely take this class. You will more about history and your own communities and also improve your storytelling skills.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this was an incredible course that taught me a lot about myself and gave me time to reflect on my life experiences.",
                "yes",
                "I wouldnt for film majors but yes for other students. You get close to your classmates even though there is some trauma dumping.",
                "Yes! This class helps you beautifully create work that is representative of anything you care about, whether it be the most niche or most defining part of your identity. The use of archives links you to the past in a way that living in history may feel, and instills an importance of your future self to create an archive that will represent the microcosm of your life within the wide world.",
                "Yes and noif you're looking for a class that will teach you any sort of filmmaking, documentary producer, media cultivating fundamentals, no. This is not the class for you. Professor Harris largely takes a hands off approach to the class in the way that much of the class is centered around discussing the media projects we create and then bring and screen at class. However, if you're not too fixated on becoming a master editor or filmmaker in the matter of a semester and want to have an unforgettable community experience that feels closer to a family than a class, then absolutely. Also it is pretty cool that Professor Harris often brings in the directors of each of the documentaries we would screen and we would discuss and have Q+A sessions with them, and even a 1-1 with Rea Tajiri!",
                "Yes! Especially if you're POC and interested in film.",
                "I would not recommend this as an introductory production class. I think it would work much better as a kind of workshop.",
                "Yes, I would. If you're new to filmmaking and want to give it a try in a diverse classroom, then this is the place to do it. But also keep in mind that much of the filmmaking aspect is self-taught. Other than a brief tutorial on how to use Premiere, you don't learn much about how to use a camera/different shots. The class places more of an emphasis on archives and the narrative of the short films, so if you're a beginner and want to see if filmmaking/storytelling interests you, this could be a really good start. If you're interested in photography, this could also be a cool space to blend interests.",
                "yes! its good for any level of experience and you get to create a lot and learn about yourself and your classmates",
                "Absolutely. See responses above.",
                "Yes! I was able to learn and practice my editing skills on Premiere. I received feedback on how to organize my films, and learned storyboarding skills.
