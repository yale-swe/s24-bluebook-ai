                "The class covers some super interesting topics, but I wish that we engaged more with actual pieces of pop culture. For a two hour seminar, too much of the class was taken up by student-led discussion of major sociological theories. I think it would have been better for us to spend more of the class actually watching and discussing pop culture, and applying the theories to them. I wish that for homework, rather than having three readings, we could have  had two readings and an episode of a show. Or we could've watched the episode in class and discussed it together. \"Pop culture and memory\" is a very fascinating topic, but I wish there were more \"pop culture\" and not just \"memory.\"",
                "This class is really fun and interesting. The subject material is interesting and engaging. The reading can feel a little dense and terminology-heavy, and it can feel a little challenging to follow along without doing close reading every week. However, Professor Karakaya is so helpful and supportive, so you will succeed if you're willing to keep trying and communicate with her."
