                "Bob Frank is an extremely engaging and passionate lecturer and made the class interesting, even at 9 am. Throughout the course there was a bit too much probability notation used that made following the lectures difficult at times but the concepts were always very cool. Sometimes homework was very lopsided- for weeks we would have no homework and some weeks we would have very large problem sets.",
                "The workload of this course is not too bad, but the psets were difficult and I did not feel like we got enough clear feedback on how to improve our coding.",
                "Strengths: Professor Frank is a really great professor; he genuinely cares about his students. The topics of the class are really interesting, and Professor Frank is good at encouraging students to ask questions.\r\nWeaknesses: The pacing of the class really speeds up at the end, and the material gets much harder. I wish the course was a bit more consistent in terms of the difficulty level throughout the semester.",
                "The course is very well organized with each unit's presentations, code files, and readings grouped together in Canvas. The lectures are mostly going through Powerpoints but has questions and practices in them to keep the lectures engaging. The final project is also a nice way to practice and apply the skills you learned during the course. Understanding the algorithms and statistics stuff can be a bit time-consuming if you were not familiar with them before taking the course, but it is not too bad once you catch up.",
                "Thought it was a great class! Could have moved a little faster but I know that Ling & Comp II is also usually offered. Happened to be that Ling & Comp I was the only option this semester.",
                "Professor Frank is clearly passionate about the material and was able to keep the class engaged even over Zoom. The course material flows nicely from one topic to the next.",
                "Professor Frank is a great professor, the material in the lectures was amazing and very interesting. However, the problem sets were only using the general concepts from the lectures, so you end up learning a lot of material for problem sets by yourself. The amount of resources and office hours was very limited, however, professor frank was very accommodating",
                "I think the course has really interesting content and Professor Frank presents it very clearly.\r\n\r\nHowever, I felt like I didn't learn overall skills or knowledge from the class. What I came away with is a basic knowledge of Python, and a set of ways computers can process speech. I don't think I developed any broader understanding of linguistic or computational concepts."

                "Yes, definitely. The material is really interesting and Professor Frank is really enthusiastic about the topics. There is a lot of Python involved, so it is helpful to know that coming in, but the actual programming assignments are doable, if a little long. The final project is very open-ended and there are a lot of cool things you can do.",
                "Yes, but only if they have a decent background in programming",
                "I would recommend the course if you would like to learn about some useful language processing techniques without requiring too much background in linguistics or programming, since most of the linguist concepts used are well explained during the lectures and Python is a pretty easy language to pick up, although it would be difficult if you had no programming experience.",
