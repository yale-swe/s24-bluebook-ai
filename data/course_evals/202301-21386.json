This thesis also challenged me to draw upon both empirical and theoretical lessons that I encountered during my time at Yale, and made me apply them to real-world concepts. I found that economics research was immensely fulfilling despite never having done it before.",

To my knowledge, only the essays selected for prizes are publicly acknowledged, but I believe there should be more opportunities to learn about work from the entire thesis writing cohort.",
                "I think that the course is really perfect -- I loved the fall optional lectures!",
                "I think the strengths and weaknesses are pretty obvious, the strengths being that there is no better way to learn how to do research than to actually do it on your own, and the weaknesses being that a it can be difficult to start, and it can sometimes feel isolating working by yourself on something that has a deadline months in advance.",

                "Strengths: get to write an econ paper. I also like how early the essay is due (April 5 this year). It allows for a much more relaxing finals period and end of semester broadly. Weaknesses: it's a lot of work, but you know what you're signing up for, so not sure that really counts.",

Maybe more on general regression analysis, probability regresssion, fixed effects, etc.",

                "Yes, writing a thesis is a very fulfilling experience. It's worth noting, however, that this a very self-driven process, so it's best to front load more work instead of having them pile up closer to the deadline.",
                "Absolutely! I came in with no economics research experience, but the thesis turned out to be one of my favorite academic experiences at Yale. You learn so much by doing it -- and I encourage those on the fence to give it a shot.",

                "Yes, if they want to write an essay. If they are not up for the time commitment, then maybe not. If they do write an essay they should do 2 semesters. Even that I felt still left more work and future questions that would be answerable -- I don't think you can really do a thorough job in 1 semester.",

The process of finding and analyzing data and engaging with the literature on a highly specific topic of interest is very exciting, and this is a great opportunity to work closely with an economics faculty member.",
                "Yes, learning to do independent research is a cool skill and gives you more ownership of your work than a bunch of problem sets",
