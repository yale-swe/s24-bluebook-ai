To my knowledge, only the essays selected for prizes are publicly acknowledged, but I believe there should be more opportunities to learn about work from the entire thesis writing cohort.",

Weaknesses: it's a lot of work, but you know what you're signing up for, so not sure that really counts.",

Maybe more on general regression analysis, probability regresssion, fixed effects, etc.",

The process of finding and analyzing data and engaging with the literature on a highly specific topic of interest is very exciting, and this is a great opportunity to work closely with an economics faculty member.",
