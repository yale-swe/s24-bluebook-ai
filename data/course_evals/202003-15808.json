I learned the enriching practice of examining a historical period through a specific lens - in this case, we examined the Middle Ages through a religious Christian lens, as well as the perspective of evolving discourse on and understanding of minds and brains.",

                "This course had a very good selection of readings. Their reasonable length and interesting subject matter motivated students to fully and thoughtfully compete each one. The pacing of assignments was also very well planned. The gradual build up in the length of major papers made each successive assignment seem very approachable. The personal writing in between was also quite enjoyable as it allowed us to take some creative liberty and write freely about the subject matter without the anxiety of a major grade. The historical context was also very well placed as it provided us with what we needed to understand the backgrounds of the figures we studied but was concise enough not to shorten our discussion about the text. The guest speakers were also very inspiring and brought great new perspectives on what we were discussing.",
                "A good amount of interesting reading, major themes and context always reviewed by the professor, methods of the course always explicitly emphasized, opportunity for each student to engage.",
                "The material from the beginning of the semester builds well on the material throughout the rest of the semester so that everything can always be related or compared to something we've learned before.",
                "Strength: The selection of readings were all really interesting and included a wide range of perspectives. I liked the fact that we had guest speakers who came and answered our questions.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Although it is made clear that there is an emphasis on christianity, I wonder if it can be expanded more to include perspectives from Asia and Africa on this topic."

                "The course made very good use of breakout rooms in order to facilitate small group assignments and discussions. The zoom formatting did end up with quite a few instances of students talking over one another, but there is little that can be done on that front.",
                "The professor constantly provided extremely comprehensive resources to us for purposes of review, engagement, and further learning. I didn't love the many breakout rooms we had, but that was sort of a function of uneven preparedness on the part of students making them a big hit or miss.",
                "I think the only setback was that the seminar was virtual (which could not be helped). I think that conversations are always easier in person, face-to-face but the pandemic prevents this.",
                "Succeeded: I personally liked the use breakout rooms because it was a great way to interact with classmates and as someone who doesn't really like talking in big groups, I lied it a lot! Also, Im not sure if all history writing classes do this, but I liked the fact that we had our own writing tutor\r\n\r\nWeakness: It if often awkward to talk through zoom and the moments of just pure silence waiting for someone to speak was really awkward. So I think having an order for people to speak really helped with this problem."

The readings are very reasonable and professor Kennedy's class structure is full of different activities to keep each class feel fresh.",

                "Yes, it has very interesting course material and the professor is amazing.",
                "I would recommend this course. Prof. Kennedy is a great teacher, gives wonderful and valuable feedback on papers, and is a compassionate person who really sees her students as humans and cares about them.",
                "Yes. 10\/10 would recommend especially if you are premed. I took this class along other classes that looked at the brain and mind from scientific perspectives and this class really helped in understanding some key ideas that we have about the brain. My favorite module was the one on mental health and disabilities and just seeing how things change or are carried on through history. And I also reinforced the idea of our prejudices can often affect our understanding on medieval life. So it was really an eye opening class. This was also my first history class and thus, I would also recommend it to other people who want to explore history in a non-intimidating way."
