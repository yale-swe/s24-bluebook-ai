                "I learned a lot about current issues in the U.S. childcare nonsystem, such as lack of affordability and accessibility, as well as the impact the pandemic has had on childcare workers, children, and families. I also learned how vital quality childcare and early education is for children's development.",
                "Issues in American public education, especially as they pertain to early childhood. How essential early childhood is in a person's development as a person.",

                "This course pushed me to think about so many elements of the child care field that I had never considered before. It did a really good job of especially addressing the challenges in the field as well as the merits of many of the potential solutions out there.",

                "Strengths: Janna and Jessica are lovely. They bring snacks and candy to class. They absolutely love hearing from students and I love how much they value our thoughts and opinions--it makes me feel more confident in the things I have to say. The discussions were also really good and I liked hearing from my classmates. Even though we discussed for the whole class period, it usually didn't feel too long. Weaknesses: not enough guidance on expectations for the op-ed paper. A more thorough assignment sheet would be helpful. Nothing else!",
                "A major strength were the topics we covered; I appreciated the class on diverse perspectives in childcare. Janna and Jessica were also a main highlight. I would say a downside was the lack of structure to our class meetings; we discussed discussion questions for almost the entirety of the almost 2 hour seminar--I wish we had a break in the middle and also spent some time going over key concepts from the readings.",
                "Strengths: discussion with classmates was often constructive, op-ed allows students to delve into topics they care about. Sometimes professionals in the field were invited to talk to the class, and those talks were interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: more direction for projects would have been helpful, some of them felt too open ended.",
                "Jess and Janna were so knowledgeable and so kind, and the material flowed well through the semester! We covered a lot but the structure definitely made it feel manageable.",
                "The biggest strength of the course was definitely Jess and Janna. They both care so much about not only the material, but also the success of students. It is so clear how much they put into the class, and I think it's so impactful when they are able to draw from their own firsthand experience with many of the topics we discuss. I also think the workload was very manageable, and the readings were enjoyable. I thought that the way the discussions were student-led also really helped us all to learn and to think more deeply about the material, and it gave us the ability to guide the discussion to what we were interested in. There were no weaknesses -- this is my favorite class I took at Yale.",
                "Strengths: the kindness of Janna and Jess and their dynamic! The space they gave for discussion.\r\nWeaknesses: oftentimes the theme was repeated like \"childcare is important\" and \"there is not enough childcare\" and while I 100% agree with that, I hoped that our class discussions would have provided more nuance to that topic.",
                "Strengths include the format of the class on which students would lead the discussions. Weaknesses include repetitiveness at times.",
                "Maybe more structured discussion?\r\nI did like the student-led format though\r\nMore guidance on final project might've been helpful, as well as an indication of grades earlier on",
                "i really liked the format, the length of readings, the diversity in assignments, the extremely engaging conversations, and the small group work. from top to bottom i feel like this class was extremely well done",
                "INCREDIBLE course, loved it so much. I especially liked how students would lead classes! Nothing to improve.",
                "Strengths: Janna and Jessica. I loved them both: so kind, understanding, and knowledgeable. I also really enjoyed the readings and getting to interact with the guest speakers. I also liked how open-ended they made the prompts and assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish I got more feedback on the assignments. I didn't receive feedback at all on one of my assignments."

The workload is manageable, and the classroom environment is not stressful at all. It will be fun and interesting to engage with these topics.",

Child care is something that is left out of most other education and/or policy courses, and it's so so important. If you have the opportunity to take this class, you should!! Jess and Janna are the best, and you will get so much out of it, and it will cause you no stress.",
                "Absolutely do not hesitate to take it if it is of interest to you. The topic is fascinating and I am so glad that I was able to take my lived experiences/life goals to a low-stakes, high-reward academic space.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course because it was so eye opening to an issue we often overlook.",
                "Yes, really interesting and great professors, but you definitely have to take your learning into your own hands- you get out what you put in",
