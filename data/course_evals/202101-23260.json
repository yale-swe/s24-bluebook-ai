Lectures can also be entertaining, there's definitely a sense of community in this class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The length of each class can drag on. I think the system could be streamlined a bit so that we all watch each other's work outside of class and offer our comments during.",
                "The strength would definitely be the sheer growth I went through as a filmmaker. In the highly collaborative, productive environment that Prof Andrews made, the creative process flowed better than ever. I have a better understanding not only on technical logistics and terms, but also have gained the ability to look at the bigger picture and make strategic\/stylistic decisions that shape the entire film. The only weakness would be the time frame--the class does feel very long, especially under the zoom format. I guess this is inevitable since it is a production class, but I think it may be better if divided into two days."
