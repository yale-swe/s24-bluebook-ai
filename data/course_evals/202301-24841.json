                "The class was really interesting and it was great to get an overview of different topics. I would've loved to dive deeper into the fundamentals of electrochemistry to better inform research in electrochemistry. For example, learning about design of electrode materials and actually applying what we learn about electrochemical or general catalytic systems would be an interesting addition.",
                "Exams were long and not too similar to homework problems",
                "The level of the course was a bit confusing for me because some concepts were from basic\/beginner courses but then the reasoning was more advanced. I would probably focus more on the advanced concepts",
                "Strengths: lectures were very clearly explained, the content was very interesting and relevant, the term project gave us an opportunity to go more deeply into a topic of our choosing\r\nWeaknesses: not many that I can think of. Maybe there could have been an opportunity for revisions on the final paper before submitting (peer edits or something similar) but the graded checkpoints on the paper were generally helpful. overall great course.",
                "Strengths- wonderful professor, knew her stuff and taught well, helpful and caring. It was her first time teaching the class and she made sure to do periodic check ins to solicit feedback and make changes. Pace of the class was accessible for non-engineering majors. I liked the semester-long project. \r\nWeaknesses- it was hard for me to keep up at the beginning (as a non-major) but this got a lot easier as time went on.",
                "This course bridged the gap between theoretical principles and practical applications very well, with real-world examples. The homework assignments solidified the concepts, and the lectures were thorough. The exams were long, but well within the scope of the class.\r\n\r\nThe class was labelled as a mezzanine class, but tended towards folks who had no experience with the theory behind it. If it's open to graduate students in the future, it might be good to have this expectation going in. The final project was also open-ended, so not all of them connected to the course material; this particular assignment did not enforce the material particularly well."

                "Definitely if you are an undergrad interested in any type of chemical or environmental engineering - the topics are extremely relevant and important and I dont know of any other class that covers them. If you are a grad student with a strong background in chemical engineering and electrochemistry and this is your research area then you might not learn as much but still might be worth taking.",
                "Would highly recommend! Wonderful course with great TAs and instructor. Be aware that it approaches climate change solutions from a chemical conversion perspective, so you dont get into things like mechanical or geoengineering.",
                "I would recommend this course to any undergraduate environmental or chemical engineer. I would also recommend this course to graduate students who were not familiar with the material, but not necessarily to those who are already familiar with catalysis and electrochemistry."
