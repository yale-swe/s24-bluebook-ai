A really great skill I learned in this class is calculating spins of quarks, interpreting Schrodinger's wave function equation, the Heisenberg principle, subcategories of matter, antimatter, dark matter, etc. More importantly, though, I learned how to distinguish classical physics theories from quantum mechanics which involved reconfiguring my brain (which has always studied classical physics) to understand quantum mechanics. But it was fun.",

                "Strengths: the course material was interesting and the professor really listened to our suggestions\/feedback \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The professor and her lectures were sometimes a bit boring as we had already covered that content during the readings. The weekly meetings were more like lectures rather than seminars and it would be nice to interact with the other students in that class.",
                "Strengths were the professor and the lectures. Weakness is that it lacked engagement in class. The seminar-style for over 2 hours is hard to get through if you're just listening to the professor speak, no matter how well she does it or how interesting the topic is.",
                "Great course - more opportunities for feedback wouldve been nice",
                "Strengths- Content complex enough to not be boring, but not such that it wasn't able to be followed.\r\nWeaknesses- The seminar time slot is essentially used for a lecture, Prof Caines was very receptive to student questions, but there wasn't much or any student discussion. Might be better off as a biweekly 1 hour 15min lecture. Midterm harder than overall psets and course content.",
                "I think the strengths are the way Professor Caines teaches such complex material in a really digestible way that it's not too overwhelming. A weakness was the 5am Tuesday deadlines for psets.",
                "I would not take this course. Lectures are very long and not well explained. Course is quite boring even though the content should be very interesting. Also, since Its run as a leminar you have to go to class.",
                "strengths: the class is very well organized for students with little to no quantum background and was easy to follow along (especially with reading assignments due the morning before class allowing students to be exposed to the material beforehand) \r\n\r\nweakness: with the class only meeting once a week with ~2 hour lectures, I do wish there were more in-class activities\/discussions besides just the lecture in order to interact with my classmates and the material more"

                "Yes- good and interesring course to fulfill a science credit",
                "No. You will not understand any of the material, because they don't intend for you to understand it. You will get hand wavy descriptions of vague physics things. The seminar is a 2 hour lecture which is very boring and even if you want to listen you won't be able to because it's not taught such that you could actually understand anything",
                "Yes I would 100% especially if you want to have conversational knowledge about quantum mechanics and do a cool final presentation. Oo also you get to learn about quarks which are annoying to wrap your head around but cool (eventually). And this class is also fun if you watch Big Bang theory with Sheldon or a fan of MCU.",
                "Definitely not. Learned almost nothing and the lectures were very boring. Assigned reading were not great either - Wikipedia often did a better (and more detailed!?!) job if explaining.",

Especially as a non-STEM person, this course was a great science credit and was also pretty easy to follow along as lectures were well organized and the reading assignments were also helpful in taking in material"
