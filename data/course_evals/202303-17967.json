Professor Doerfler was an amazing professor to learn with and she gives you all the tools you need to succeed in college. Additionally, the works that we read were extremely interesting and have become some of my favorite novels Ive recently read. Even though Im planning to be a stem major, I still loved this class so much and am glad that I took it. The only people I wouldnt recommend the class to are those who cant handle a lot of reading. While the readings are fantastic, there are a lot with it not being uncommon to have a week or less to finish a full length book.",
