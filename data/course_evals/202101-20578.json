                "The course was amazing. A huge strength is that we covered a LOT of different topics from every subject of S&DS. We did a bit of math, a bit of theoretical, a bit of applied stats, and bit of coding, a bit of visualization, and it was terrific. I really appreciated how the professor was also incredibly understanding during the pandemic, and how she and the TAs made themselves available to help us whenever we needed.",
                "strength: really great workload with in-class activities",
                "The course (homeworks, tests, projects, etc...) all were set up for us to reinforce the learned skills. I felt as though I could actively engage with all of them.",
                "Thought it was an great course. Teacher helped answer questions and seemed passionate about the material. Couldve been improved if we went deeper in some of these topics.",
                "Strength: Super nice professor",
                "Strengths: Great course for learning. Lectures were organized for understanding and material was presented clearly. Elena is also a great lecturer that used images and other ways of presenting information to facilitate learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I generally prefer using R markdown for data analysis so it may be useful to have had both file methods. But, this is personal preference. Also, I am not sure how useful the in-class activities and how they could be adapted for in in-person environment. I found that breakout rooms worked best for the activities.",
                "Strengths: content is really important/applicable to many science fields (I was able to apply some of the material to my senior research), professor is really kind/understanding, and lectures are engaging\r\nWeaknesses: seemed to fall a bit behind in assigning homework in the first half of the course, how the final course grades would be assigned (ie. curved or not, cutoffs) was ambiguous for most of the course/until the last day of classes",
                "I think this course was really well designed! Elena's dedication to course showed through the lectures and examples she prepared, and it became clear through the course of the semester that she was invested not only in her students' academic success but also in their mental and physical well-being. If I had to name a weakness of the course, it's that I would have benefitted from slightly more frequent problem sets, which would have given me more opportunities to apply the concepts discussed in class and receive feedback on my work."

Coding online via zoom is also a terrific strategy - it's easier to share screen and see code in R. Another positive was the recorded lectures: having everything recorded means that we can go back and re-watch lectures from the content that was more challenging, and learn the material again before midterms and homeworks. Being virtual was honestly super helpful for this!",

I found many of the tools covered immediately useful and applicable, and the material is not too challenging, which encourages actual learning. Elena is also very patient and understanding. Overall a great course with a wonderful professor.",
                "Yes, it's a great class to take, especially if you're an older student in the S&DS major. It introduces you to some new concepts while reviews some old ones with a different, more applied approach. You walk out of the class with a more comprehensive understanding of data analysis techniques.",
                "Yes, I think that Elena does a good job of distinguishing between the goals of machine learning and the goals of data analysis at the beginning of the course. From there, I felt that the course did not repeat the same material learned in other classes even though they were techniques. For example, we spent a lot of time on regression in this class, but viewing it from the perspective of data exploration instead of prediction was interesting.",
                "Yes - the material is really useful in most science fields and the professor is kind",
                "Yes! This course was the perfect introduction to data analysisit wasn't too much work, but it still covered all of the important concepts. Would highly recommend for anyone looking to explore the field!"
