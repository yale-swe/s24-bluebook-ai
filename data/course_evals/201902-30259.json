    "I learned about Global Health and film and their complexities. I also learned about the histories, conflicts, and cultures of South Africa and Eswatini.",
    "A lot.\r\n-to take criticism and react to it (both positive and negative)\r\n-learning basic photography \r\n-learning a lot about film, story and structure \r\n-basic global health principles but more importantly, how to think critically when approaching global health questions.",

   "comments": [
    "The class was intellectually challenging. It required a great deal of time, work, and teamwork. I believe that these are strengths because I was forced to work hard and with others. \r\nAs for weaknesses, I think that sometimes the film portion of the class overshadowed the global health class. I learned a great deal about visual storytelling, but wish there was a bit more emphasis on health.",
    "Strengths:\r\n-dedicated instructor \r\n-lots of new skills developed \r\n-amazing locations \r\n-small group size \r\n-a huge sense of accomplishment after the mammoth final and film project \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-a little more clarity with structure\/a schedule. Even a loose one.\r\n-a lot of the work load seemed to be in 2 weeks. Maybe try and spread this in some way. Dont be complacent. The work amplifies.",
    "Strengths: beautiful place, get to meet amazing people, interesting to try something new if you havent done visual literacy or global health before\r\nWeaknesses: its so difficult to live with your professors and classmates for so long. It becomes confusing where the line is between professor and friend."
