Learned a lot about nonhuman primate research and early life adversity and its connection to biomarkers of chronic stress and inflammation.",

Particularly, I learnt how to analyze how the interactions between eating disorder symptoms and self-conscious emotions change over time using statistical tests such as the network comparison test.",

                "Weakness potentially that it is difficult to prepare for this course since no class really teaches you beforehand how to come up with your own experiment and coding and everything. So it would be nicer to have a more smooth transition from taking classes into independently having to come up with your own project, not really having any experience in research.\r\nBut the strength on the other hand is that you have your advisor to teach, guide, and direct you, so that you learn along the way of experiencing the whole process of designing your own experiment and analyzing and writing about it.",
                "i learned so much from this course and would recommend anyone to do a BS and conduct independent research",
                "Strengths: my advisor! super responsive and cared about my project, also helped me in finding post-grad opportunities\r\nWeaknesses: none I can think of :)",
                "The structure provided by weekly meetings was very helpful for me to be able to keep up with the work and not leave it all to the last couple weeks, and also allowed me to get constance feedback and guidance if I needed it.",
                "I received weekly feedback that helped me organize my ideas and analytical plan. Additionally, finishing the introduction and method of the paper in the Fall semester and finishing the results and discussion in the Spring semester allowed me to manage the amount of workload required for the thesis."
