I definitely did receive some exposure to musical concepts which were novel to me, but the lack of depth in any particular topic left me feeling like I did not develop any of those new skills/knowledge beyond what could be achieved through a wikipedia search.",

                "Strengths: once a week, hands on learning",
                "Strengths: the class size was kept quite small, which enabled a more individualized approach in which there was more time to work one-on-one with the professor and really work on what interested you most",

                "Hard to say... depends on who is teaching. But do know that if you are not comfortable with being put on the spot, proceed with caution.",
                "Absolutely! If they know a little piano already (especially chords and sheet music) this is a great class to improve improvisation and addition to music.",
                "Only for a very very easy credit. I think as a learning opportunity, especially if you already have some music theory knowledge, it was pretty worthless. And even if you don't have enough music theory knowledge, I'm not sure this class would be slow and focused enough to teach you. Either way I think it would be difficult to get a lot out of this course as it was taught this semester.",
                "Not if you want a thorough introduction to score reading - since the course meets only once a week, and you spent most of the lesson time working on 2/3 exercises, there is little room to master your skills in specific areas such as transposition. If you don't actively practice everything outside of class, you won't take away much from this course. That being said, this course meets only once a week and requires very minimal work - if you are looking for a simple music course, and know how to play the keyboard and have a background with harmony and harmonic analysis, take this class.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in music, this class provides a relaxed way to learn some important skills that can be applied to a variety of areas. The class generally helps you become more fluid and relaxed at playing things on the spot, ranging from realizing a harmony to improvisation.",
                "Yes, it is a great course, you'll learn a lot if you have some experience in keyboard instruments, but it would be hard for those without any.",
                "If you want an easy music gut yes, but you might not get too much out of it.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you have very little background in music. The instructor tried to accommodate students with a wide range of experience and sometimes it was not challenging or engaging for people who already knew the theory. If you consistently practice even 15 minutes a day you will do very well in the course.",
                "Sure, it's a light introduction to music topics such as improvisation and figured bass.",
                "Yes, but they should have a solid ability to play and previous understanding of basic music theory."
