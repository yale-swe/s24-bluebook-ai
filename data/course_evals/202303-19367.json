                "a good survey of shakespeare's work and the historical context surrounding them",
                "I felt I was much better at finding different avenues into analyzing literature after this course thanks to the short writing assignments. It helped my papers become a lot less formulaic, but I also got some good feedback on which parts of the essay formula I was neglecting.",
                "I learned how to read and think about Shakespeare's plays on their own terms, in the context of one another, and in the historical context of Early Modern England.",
                "Familiarity with Shakespeare's works, patterns across them, historical context for Shakespeare (and how that bears out in his writing), how to analyze adaptations of plays, exposure to lots of ways of thinking & writing about literature---not just close reading.",
                "This course surveys Shakespeare's dramatic oeuvre and teaches a variety of skills & lenses for approaching his work. prof. nicholson was especially good at framing the role of Shakespeare in his context and laying out the development of print and performance cultures in shaping Shakespeare's legacy. Strong use of adaptations and other materials too!",
                "I gained an appreciation for Shakespeare, his plays, and the time period and place in which his plays were performed, as well as an understanding of how Shakespeare's legacy continues to evolve today.",
                "This course is the perfect way to engage with Shakespeare's plays if you haven't read\/studied many of them in the past.",
                "This course gave me a better understanding of Shakespeare's writing, as well as how his plays fit into Elizabethan society. It also introduced me to a large number of contemporary interpretations and adaptations of Shakespeare's work. Above all, this class taught me how to approach Shakespeare's work as a performance and a production rather than just a text.",
                "I felt I learned a lot about the language and plot of Shakespeare, as well as analytical skills.",

                "Strengths: Cathy Nicholson! She is a great lecturer, very funny, and super engaging. However, although I understand why a class like this is a lecture (it's an intro Shakespeare class), I think that this class would be more enjoyable as a seminar with some lecture components. Just having section wasn't satisfying enough. I also think that the screen elements could have been emphasized more. We really only watched one movie adaptation. I also think this class would be better if there wasn't a Renaissance requirement for the major. I'm not an English major, but it seemed that most of the people in the class were only there to fulfill that requirement, which sucks, and definitely affected participation and attendance.",
                "Professor Nicholson is an amazing professor and a wonderful speaker\/lecturer. You will be entertained and gain new insight into each of the works she goes over, and you get a great new perspective on Shakespeare. \r\n\r\nthe grading scale is a little fucked tbh. they said that the grading \"Scales as time goes on\" meaning that if on your first short write you got a \"B\" and then got a \"B\" on the second short write, you actually improved, it's just that the grading was more difficult. HOWEVER--- the grade percentages of the assignments do not reflect this weight\/importance change, meaning that the grading difficulty scale does not reflect ANY of that improvement and both of those \"B's\" are the same in the grade book. \r\n\r\nif they wanted to make the grading harder\/assignments weigh more, they should actually just individually weigh these assignments in the percentages, so it would reflect that progression. \r\n\r\nalso all of the commentary on my written work (as of now) was grammar, I never got any commentary for the improvements of the actual content or arguments of my work. So, I would be receiving B's and A-'s with the only commentary being grammar fixes and no criticism of my actual argument.",
                "I really enjoyed the lectures, but seriously, the room was just a little bit too dark. It sounds like a weird complaint, but on days where I woke up a little slower, the dim light really didn't help matters much.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Nicholson is amazing; reading one play a week is the right amount of reading; the course picked up excellent rhythm and I felt like I was building my understanding of Shakespeare and his corpus with each new week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Section was lacking.",
                "Fantastic lectures! Plus the reading (mainly just 1 Shakespeare per week) was manageable and always interesting. Professor Nicholson went out of her way to include several fun events, like guest lecturers with unique perspectives on professional theater, or visits to see an original folio in Sterling. Well-structured writing assignments---a handful of short skill-building exercises and only a couple longer essays.",
                "For an English lecture, this course is pretty engaging. Prof. Nicholson is a good lecturer and the graded assignments were always easy and well-conceived. I especially enjoyed the fun & experimental & surprising turns our lectures sometimes took.",
                "This was an excellent course! The lectures were informative and thought-provoking and discussion section was great. There were a lot of engaging and fun activities--I really enjoyed the day Professor Nicholson brought Donut Crazy doughnuts for us and we went outside and practiced trimming scenes from the plays, so we could experience the way that almost all of the plays have to be cut down before they can be performed. Going to the Shakespeare in the Park performance was very fun, and I enjoyed watching the film adaptations that were worked into the syllabus. Seeing the original editions of some of the plays at Sterling's Shakespeare exhibit and at the Beinecke day were super cool! Professor Nicholson and the TAs were helpful and supportive. I really appreciated Professor Nicholson's office hours.\r\nA possibility for a future iteration would be to try fewer plays and spend three classes (a week and a half) on each play instead of just a week--or at least to give some of the longer plays three classes instead of two. Because we read a play a week, I felt that I was starting to mix up characters and tropes, and not getting to read as thoroughly as I would have liked.",
                "Lectures were often strong, but occasionally felt too removed from the text at hand. The syllabus was a strength -- great selection of Shakespeare texts.",
                "The course is wonderfully designed with a mix of different media on the syllabus and engaging lectures.",
                "This course was a fantastic exploration of the Shakespearean canon, and I really appreciated its emphasis on performance, production, and interpretation in addition to scripts. Lectures were engaging and insightful, and section discussions were rich and thought-provoking.",
                "I really enjoyed my discussion sections with Julia Chin, who really created an engaging and helpful atmosphere that I would recommend to anyone. Lectures were interesting, but sometimes got a bit complicated and I wasnt able to fully follow. I wish there was more section time and less lecture hours.\r\nA big downside for me was the quantity of writing required. In particular, the midterm essay was enormously stressful for me due to its length and difficulty. However, I really enjoyed the 3 creative assignments.",
                "Strength: Engaged and committed professor, you can read a lot of plays within a semester \r\n\r\nWeakness: At times section was not very engaging (students did not participate a lot and guiding questions were somewhat unclear\/basic), there was too little time spent on each play"

It certainly isn't a light course--there's obviously a lot of reading--but if you care at all about narrative, take a class that makes you read Shakespeare! And take it with Cathy Nicholson!",
                "sure! i heard this one was much better than the Shakespeare seminar being taught this semester and it's a great renaissance credit",

                "Yes, if you are interested in Shakespeare and want to delve deeper into a good number of plays. You basically get to read a third of his plays and discuss one each week.",
                "Absolutely! If you're curious about Shakespeare for any reason---you already like it, you've always found it difficult and want to give it another go, or anything else---don't hesitate. It's a well-run, very fun literature class.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to any English major looking for a Ren. credit (that is, if you're not sooo jazzed about the Renaissance overall). i also know lots of non-English majors who took this course just for fun and enjoyed it.",
                "Yes! This has been a lovely survey course in Shakespeare. I really appreciated the lectures and sections that were full of lively discussion. I highly recommend this class if you love Shakespeare and want a survey class that also involves modern interpretations of Shakespeare.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Nicholson is amazing. I feel like I have a solid foundation of Shakespeare now. The course was pretty fast, but I have a good enough understanding now that I can go back and revisit the plays I would like to spend more time with.",
                "Yes! If you want to read Shakespeare. But you need to do the reading to get anything out of the course. If you don't, lectures are boring and hard to follow. If you do, the lectures are awesome!",
                "I highly recommend this course to any Yale student regardless of their interests.",
                "This course can be really worthwhile if you have the space to truly commit to it. There's lecture twice a week + section and you're reading a different Shakespeare play every week...it's a surprisingly demanding course, and if you are already packing a high workload course schedule, please do proceed with caution, if you seriously want to get the most out of this class. \r\n\r\nIt was definitely one of the more engaging ways to get the renaissance requirement fulfilled as an English major, but I'm not sure now much a non-English major would enjoy it. I personally had a lot of fun with it, but I was also familiar with much of the material already. I did find myself, surprisingly (or maybe unsurprisingly) less interested in the plays that were new to me, and I wonder if that's because of the quick week-by-week turnaround.  \r\n\r\nI'd still recommend to anyone considering it. Some of my favorite moments from this semester were in this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in Shakespeare, theater, or English.",
                "Yes I would, but under the condition that you can fully commit to it.",
                "I would recommend this course as an introductory Shakespeare course. However, students should be aware that there is very little time spent in each play and only one section per play, which limits the depth of the conversations regarding the plays."
