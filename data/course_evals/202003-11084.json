I learned that I needed to study more on my own outside of the assigned homework in order to get the most out of the class.",

                "The strengths are the emphasis on conversation (as that is arguably the most important part of using language). I wish there was more time to learn hiragana and katakana; it is especially confusing because we learn one after another and the two systems represent the same sounds depending on context.",
                "The course is very intensive, but it's a great introduction to Japanese language study.",

                "Each class was really engaging and helped me learn Japanese at a very rapid pace. The biggest weakness of the course was that we didn't receive any grades for any assignments throughout the entire semester."

I also don't know if conversation shadowing is COVID-19 specific, but I found that memorizing the conversations before each unit were not particularly helpful. However, I do see the merits of conversation shadowing and letting students get over the initial embarrassment of blundering in a foreign language, so I don't know if that should change.",

It also teaches valuable studying skills and time management skills as well. The learning environment was very fun while maintaining productivity as well.",
