    "By taking this course, I have advanced my learning of the Mandarin Chinese language while improving my tone pronunciation and learning new grammar patterns.",
    "My vocabulary improved tremendously and I became a much better listener.",
    "Chinese 130 helped strengthen my Chinese foundations and has given me confidence to continue my Chinese language education",
    "Improved my written and reading skills for Chinese. Improved conversational ability. Overall my Chinese saw a huge improvement over the time I took this course.",
    "I learned a lot of new applicable vocabulary as well as sentence structure\/patterns. This class helped me strengthen my foundational skills in Chinese.",
    "Listening, speaking, reading and writing in Chinese.",
    "I built upon the content that I learned in CHNS 110, increasing the number of grammar structures and vocabulary that I knew."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course seeks to improve the student's writing, reading, listening, and speaking abilities through different assignments in class and out of class. The tutoring sessions reinforce the student's understanding of the lesson texts and other skills. The course also utilized additional materials to supplement the textbook, giving a glimpse of the application of Mandarin Chinese in the world.",
    "The course is too rigorous for ones abilities to recess, so improvement is guaranteed in return for completing assignments. The online exercises were unreasonably difficult and I learnt very little from them. I would rather they be more engaging.",
    "The online grammar homework (quia) was the only aspect of the class I didn't love. Otherwise, all other aspects were perfect.",
    "Strengths: high engagement, good workload, forces you to engage with the class\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't really like the Quia exercises. They didn't help me improve my understanding of grammatical concepts. Would prefer to have in-class exercises where we can ask the professor questions.",
    "I wish there was more guidance for writing essays and speaking with better tones. The tutorial sessions were useful, but more tones practice in class would be helpful. Im not sure how writing in particular could be improved, however, because we only have so much time in class to review grammar. It may help to watch more videos that allow us to see how certain words\/sentence patterns are commonly used.",
    "This course is SUPER organized, so one never feels lost or confused or unsure. The small class really helps to create a friendly learning environment, and an enjoyable one.",
    "As always, CHNS 130 was just as engaging as CHNS 110, and Xu Laoshi was an excellent professor with a great sense of humor, patience, and flexibility. The only thing that was different was that the learning curve at the beginning of the class was a lot steeper than with CHNS 110  a lot of the students in the class had trouble with the Quia tests in particular, as sometimes the questions on there didn't correlate with the content we learned in class. That being said, I was able to get the hang of it after a while and improve my score, as Xu Laoshi predicted."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. This course provides exactly what a language course ought to, and I had a lot of fun.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they want to improve their Chinese skills.",
    "Definitely, if they were serious about pursuing Chinese language and wanted to improve their abilities. Definitely not if they were looking for an easy A.",
    "Yes, definitely. This class was very engaging and set a strong foundation in all aspects of Chinese learning.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who's at the L3 level and is interested in improving their Chinese. The Yale Chinese program is one of the best in the nation, and this course reinforces that standard."
