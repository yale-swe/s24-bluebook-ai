                "Strengths: this class had a great sense of community thanks to our awesome professor Im Sonsaengnim, the students in the class who became friendly with each other quickly, and because the class meets every day. I felt like I learned a lot of Korean thanks to this comfortable environment even without a heavy workload. Im Sonsaengnim is a great professor who made class enjoyable and productive every day. Feedback on tests was helpful. Assignments were useful and fun. The weekly TA sessions with a native Korean speaker were also very helpful in getting a little extra conversational speaking practice every week. \r\nWeaknesses: are there any? Maybe the fact that Im Sonsaengnim isn't going to teach 130 next year :( that's about it.",

                "It would be great if the homework was small assignments once or twice a week rather than a big assignment every month or so!",
                "Strengths - clear grading, transparency in expectation\r\nWeakness - deemphasis on actual speaking",
                "No weaknesses. manageable workload with a very approachable and funny Professor.",
                "none",
                "Learning Korean with Professor Lim felt fun and not stressful. He knows how to explain grammar points well, and since he's studied other languages, he's familiar with and empathetic to the struggles of language learners.",
                "I really enjoyed the discussion-focused learning we had in class. The grammar lectures followed by partnered practice was effective because I was forced to use it immediately after or embarrass myself while attempting to do so. We were also pretty close as a class and it was fun to learn with everyone else."

It's also just a fun class that I looked forward to almost every day  it was fun to learn Korean, there was a good sense of community in the class (students became friendly with each other quickly) and Im Sonsaengnim is a really engaging, chill professor. If you need to take care of a language requirement, I would highly recommend Korean. If you want to learn Korean, I would recommend Korean at Yale as a good way to get started.",

                "Definitely! This class is extremely engaging and, while there were a lot of speaking practices which I often struggled with, it was worth all the effort. The focus is on learning by doing and it felt as we were allowed to make many mistakes as long as we improve. Prof Lim is also funny (and fun to pick on, and it goes both ways)."
