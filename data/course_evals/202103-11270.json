You are challenged with a high level of reading and interaction with course material along with extremely in depth class discussion. The discussions in this class were unlike any I have ever had in an academic setting, masterfully mediated by Professor De and full of rich insight from fellow classmates.",
                "Examining multiple facets of life in Bombay, being exposed to different perspectives, thinking in new ways (aided by peers)",
                "This was an intensive seminar, but one in which I learned a lot. I learned how to navigate a small seminar with up to 150 pages of reading for a night. At first I was overwhelmed, but slowly learned how to grasp the content in the time that I had. I also grew stronger in my writing and researching skills, especially for the final research paper at the end. I was lost at first in writing a paper on a city - Mumbai - in another country, and having to find court and other legal documents in a system totally unfamiliar to me, but it was a great learning experience. Also just sharing and conversing with my peers, and learning when to step up and step back and make insightful comments in discussion. Not to mention, I learned a TON about Mumbai!",
                "Besides learning a ton about the city of Mumbai, I really learned a lot about the way that the study of history is done, especially when done at the level of a specific place. I also learned how to read historical papers and journals well, and how to try and extract useful information from a potentially biased source. I probably learned the most from listening to my peers in class, who often made points that really struck me or offered really interesting insight into a topic.",
                "This seminar truly developed my writing and reading skills, as well as my ability to be analytical and thoughtful during discussions. I appreciated every discussion we had in class, and Professor De seamlessly guided conversations and pushed us to think critically. The final project developed my research skills and encouraged us to engage with a multitude of historical sources (films, newspapers, speeches, etc.), which was really valuable.",

                "Strengths: goodness I learned so much. There was so much content and I really learned how to think critically about  subjects like urban planning, colonialism, clashes based on identity, etc.  Prof de is also brilliant - you will learn so much just from listening to him speak Weaknesses: barely received any feedback. Literally first feedback received the day before the credit d fail deadline in December. Also, I would have loved some lectures from prof de instead of an entirely discussion based course. But this isnt a huge complaint since my classmates were brilliant and I learned a lot from listening to them speak.",
                "Professor De is AMAZING. \r\nI hope I can take a class with him again.\r\nHes so knowledgeable about everything and its a pleasure just hearing him speak.\r\nThe only negative is that we didnt get our feedback on time which made completing the final project a little hard. But other than that its a great class.",
                "Strengths: Coming to class every day was exciting and engaging. I never felt that the class lost momentum in any of its discussions or activities. The content is fascinating and will challenge you to think outside the bounds of western ideology (which it turns out we are much more influenced by than we think). Overall, this was by far my favorite class to attend each week.",
                "Strengths: Everything! Engagement was incredibly high, professor was excellent, interesting assignments and readings, loved that we engaged with media as well\r\nWeaknesses: None! One of my favorite classes I've taken",
                "The strengths were the discussion - I got a lot out of them, and most people cam prepared and we had a lot to say. Professor De was great in class, and made it engaging with film clips, newspaper snippets, etc. The main weakness is the lack of guidance and feedback. As of now, I have not gotten one grade back for this class! We got none of our past work back, which would have been helpful in making sure I was on the right track, and so that I could improve or work on any of the weaknesses found in my writing. I really wish, for example, I could have gotten my first film review back with feedback, before writing my second film review.",
                "Strengths: Great professor, readings, engaging discussions\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of timely feedback for writing",
                "I greatly appreciated our discussions in class. Everyone had something to add, and I always felt encouraged to speak.",
                "Strengths: Variety of sources from a variety of perspectives. Professor De connected in-class discussions to relevant historiographic and epistemological questions. A good amount of writing, with useful and detailed feedback on the first few assignments.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor De tried not to interfere in class discussions, which sometimes led to undirected or irrelevant conversations."

                "Absolutely. If you have the opportunity to take Professor De's course, you must. He is truly a brilliant mind anyone is lucky to learn from. He prompts his students to think differently than how they have been trained in the past. While the course does focus on the city of Mumbai, it also offers a wealth of valuable insight on humanity and urban dynamics that are applicable around the world.",
                "Yes! I learned so much more than I initially anticipated and Professor De was incredible",
                "I would recommend this course! It was a great environment and community, discussions were fun, readings were interesting, and the writing I enjoyed, but I would have to warn them that assignments can be a bit disorganized and no feedback, at least for me, was given.",
                "Yes, definitely. It was a really engaging and interesting class, especially if you like learning about the history of a specific place. Going in, I didn't know much about the city of Mumbai, but it still was able to pull me in. My family definitely started complaining about how much I nerd out about Mumbai :).",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is interested. This was such a valuable class for me, and I left it with so many strengthened skills. Its also a great intro to history, South Asian history, and urban studies. Im now hoping to take more classes in all of these subjects.",
                "Yes definitely. Super interesting and definitely improved my reading and writing skills. Worth the challenge if you're up for it.",
                "Yes, definitely. The subject is interesting, Professor De is great, and you will do a solid amount of reading and writing."
