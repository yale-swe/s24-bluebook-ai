    "Good survey of deep learning methods, learned much more detailed material than S&DS 365. Improved python programming skills as well, though the psets were on the repetitive side, and I think I spent more time on the 2nd pset than any other assignment I've done at Yale",
    "I learned a good amount of dimensionality reduction, and neural nets",
    "Unsupervised learning overview (dimensionality reduction like PCA, diffusion maps, PHATE; inducing graphs from data; k-means, spectral, hierarchical, Louvain clustering; autoencoders; GANs), implementation of some of these concepts in Python with three psets (PCA\/diffusion maps, graph signal processing\/clustering, autoencoders)",
    "I learned about unsupervised machine learning techniques and neural networks, with specific attention to methods that are commonly used in biology\/for big, messy data. Lectures focused on concepts - the purpose of different methods and how they work - and assignments focused on implementing those methods, often from scratch. The class was not very math-y except for some linear algebra. The methods covered included dimensionality reduction (PCA, diffusion mapping, MDS), clustering (spectral, k-means, hierarchical, community detection, Louvain), visualization (t-SNE, PHATE), graph signal processing, information theory, and neural networks (feed-forward, convolutional, GANs, autoencoders).",
    "This course goes through unsupervised learning including dimensionality reduction with PCA, t-SNE, diffusion maps, and a little bit of PHATE. Clustering is also covered, with k-means, spectral clustering, and Louvain. Graph signal processing with the Laplacian is also covered. \r\n\r\nFinally, a little bit of information theory is covered and neural networks are covered. Neural Networks are especially interesting because we cover all kinds of different ones, including generative models, where neural networks generate images and other data."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Interesting assignments + material, Scott is a great TA who actually cares, you learn some cutting-edge deep learning\/dimensionality reduction\/graph signal processing techniques with an eye toward real-world applications. Very cool.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures can be a little bit dry\/hard to follow. Also, I read this in the reviews last year and didn't believe it, but it's true -- it's the second day of reading week today and we haven't yet received back a single piece of graded work. So I guess if you're someone who cares about grades, this course might stress you out unnecessarily. I don't really stress about grades, so it's been OK for me, but we probably all put 50-60 hours into the three problem sets we've submitted through the semester, and they couldn't be bothered to do their jobs and grade them within a timeline where we could actually receive feedback and improve throughout the course. Fully understand that there is research to be done, and conferences to go to, etc, but part of committing to teach a class is giving students timely feedback, and that just didn't happen this semester. Please try to improve this in future years -- the material is too interesting to write off the class entirely, but no feedback all semester is certainly less than ideal.",
    "Material is interesting, however Prof. Krishnaswamy is terrible. She doesnt seem engaged in lecturing at all. For example, during lecture she would ask a question to the class, and while the students were thinking, would be on her phone. Nothing was graded until well after everything had been submitted, so there was never a chance to figure out what they really wanted from Problem set.",
    "Overall, this course gives a comprehensive overview of machine learning techniques, addressing common and also bleeding-edge developments in the field. If you are mathematically inclined, there is some coverage of the underlying theory. However, this course should probably be improved for future years: (1) lectures sometimes go too fast or too slow - I felt comfortable with early material up until diffusion maps but felt like the neural net material was unfocused and paced really quickly, (2) Prof Krishnaswamy is obviously a state-of-the-art academic with brilliant research ideas, but I often felt like she catered the class to the best students - in a class mixed with undergraduates and biology majors with less experience, it would have been nice if she made sure a majority of the class understood before moving on (I often felt like she was disappointed at our lack of understanding when many of us were still trying to digest the material), (3) instead of asking guest lecturers to teach her slides, it would be cool if they could share their own research and discuss aspects of their field they find interesting (sometimes, they understandably fumbled through Prof Krishnaswamy's slides that she would have had no issue with e.g. an unclear image about PHATE and whether cross entropy was symmetric) - in fact, the discussion about entropy was a guest lecture day but it was featured prominently on the exam, (4) giving feedback on psets earlier - we got our first grade in late December",
    "The material was truly fascinating, and the lectures were interesting, but the course itself was extremely disorganized. A lot of things could have been made better by having more course staff - the TA was amazing but he could not keep up with running almost the entire course. For instance, I didn't receive a single grade until after the end of the semester. There were only three assignments, so they were enormous, particularly the 2nd one for which the report ended up being almost 100 pages. The 2nd assignment should have been split into two and the number of repeated plots drastically reduced, and the assignments timeline should have been moved up because the first assignment wasn't released until after shopping period and was the assignment for which we had the most time, and the coursework was super back-loaded. I wish there had only been a final project and not a final exam too. I also think that Prof. Krishnaswamy, while brilliant in her field and an interesting lecturer, needs to work on being more approachable; most of us were too intimidated to go to her office hours or speak up during class.",
    "This course covers a lot of pretty cool material! Nevertheless, I feel that its structure could use improvement. \r\n\r\nThere are 3 problem sets, each assigned for 3 weeks. The first problem set isn't posted for a week after the class starts, if I recall correctly, and problem set 2 is released soon after problem set 1 is due. However, problem set 3 is released several weeks after problem set 2 is due. This makes little sense, as problem set 2 is very long, much longer than problem sets 1 and 2, and we could have used the extra few weeks to do problem set 2. \r\n\r\nI definitely feel that I was on a huge crunch for time with problem set 2. It was due right after break, and I spent the entirety of my break doing it. I feel like it would have really helped to have it due a week or two later, especially because there was so much time in between problem sets 2 and 3. \r\n\r\nIn fact, I feel that the best solution would be to split problem set 2 up into 2 problem sets, one due a few weeks after the other, making the structure line up perfectly with the release of problem set 3.  This would give 4 problem sets for the class, with each roughly the same length, and give a more reasonable timeline for completing the assignments. \r\n\r\nThe other problem of course, was the delay in getting grades. This course really needs an additional TA or grader, if not an undergraduate student, then perhaps someone else from Professor Krishnaswamy's lab. It was unfair for us to only get real grades for any assignment after the start of winter break. My actual grade for problem set 1 was in fact very different from the projected grade I received the week of the drop deadline. This practice not only leaves students in the dark come drop deadline but also inhibits student learning from instructor feedback in a class where this feedback could really be useful."

   "comments": [
    "Assuming you can credit\/D or won't stress about not receiving feedback all semester, would absolutely recommend to anyone seeking to augment their ML\/deep learning\/unsupervised learning toolkit. If you're gonna stress about grades, then hard no.",
    "No, do not take this class unless you want an unengaged professor and no graded work.",
    "No. You hardly learn anything in lecture that pertains to the psets, the psets take a while, and there are very few resources to help learn from.",
    "Only if you are ok with seeing your grades after the class is over",
    "As many who came before me recommended, though I did not heed their wisdom, I would absolutely recommend taking this course if you've taken linear algebra, can code in Python, and are interested in machine learning, BUT ONLY TAKE IT CREDIT\/D. It was perhaps the most interesting course I've taken at Yale, and I learned SO MUCH that I will use (hopefully) for the rest of my career. I feel like I really understand the methods we went over, having talked about how they work\/when they should be applied in class and then implemented them (numpy is your friend, please learn to use it) in assignments. But the back-loaded course work, disorganization, minimal resources for help (1 overworked TA), intimidation factor of Prof. Krishnaswamy (never wanted to go to her office hours or speak up in class), and lack of *any feedback on grading before the end of the semester* made this class very stressful and the worst I've taken at Yale in terms of structure. There are 3 LONG coding assignments\/reports, one final project, and one final exam. The first (& third) assignments took maybe 15 hours, which was a little much for the few days I left myself but not too bad, but the second assignment (which ended up being almost 100 pages long as a PDF from my Jupyter notebook) took much longer. The assignments themselves were cool\/useful but not very clearly-written and sometimes had repeated tasks that just took up time and pages. There was also terrible scheduling in that most of the assignments were due after a break, so there were no office hours. You would have to be either much faster\/more familiar with numpy than me or much better at starting assignments early in order to make this schedule work. The final project (in pairs, for undergrads) was a cool opportunity to apply the methods we'd learned to a new dataset, or create our own method, but I wish that we hadn't also had to worry about a final exam - on the last day of finals, the same day our project was due, no less. The exam itself was mostly reasonable but kind of long for the 75 mins, and the long answer questions were really out-there.",
    "If the student really gets a kick out of the material, I think the student will really enjoy and benefit from this course. If the student is one who stresses about grades, we did not get any grades for any assignments until the start of winter break. With that in mind, I would recommend the student be cautious when signing up for this class."
