I also definitely think that my writing evolved throughout the course of the semester, although at times it was very difficult to work with the blogposts' open promote. It really forces you to thing originally."

                "This was an amazing course on black independent and experimental film! Professor Forster structured the lectures carefully and we had a great balance of student presentations, discussions about the film, dissections of the readings, etc. We watched a large range of films and the readings supplemented the films very well!",
                "Strength: a great array of films to discuss that were all very different and writhing different genres.",
                "n\/a",
                "I really enjoyed the class, but it would've been great if we had more time for presentations and class activities.",
                "Despite the depth of its syllabus, the course never dives deeply into any piece of mediareadings or films. Many students would not complete the readings and give superficial responses to questions in class. This would make for lackluster discussions that often would not get to the heart of any argument unless the professor intervened. Instead of innovating pathways for students to access hard material, the professor would let the lack of student participation play out. Some of the readings were particularly esoteric, or referential, which wasnt accessible to students not versed in critical theory. To close read and really engage in high-level academia more hand holding is needed to make sure all students are included and interested.",
                "The professor was clearly passionate about the topic and everyone in the class was very engaged. As a result, I looked forward to going to class. The Sunday screenings were the biggest weakness. There was also a lot of readings and short films each week."
