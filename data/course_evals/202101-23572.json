                "I think a large part of this course was just about music in general. What makes music? How do we capture the phenomenon that we call music in writing? What limitations arise from different notation systems? What are we trying to capture when we write down music? Then, we also explore other musics and the formal or informal theories surrounding them such as kiGogo music from Eastern Africa, Classical Japanese music, Indian music, and others. Discussions around ethnomusicology and the study of music outside of our own were central to the course. There was a bit of aural learning too.",

                "As a class, we learned about a number of musical practices from around the world, and then I had the opportunity to explore Arabic music in great depth individually.",
                "1. A lot of stuff I'd call \"critical comparative musicology\" -- this was the more humanities-oriented part of the course. We would read papers by 19th-century musicologists, for example, and talk about what their methodology failed to capture, what assumptions they made, that sort of thing. A lot about the limits of music theory, etc. 2. The \"music class\" part of the course -- notation, singing, etc within the different traditions that we surveyed, learning to read music in Ian Quinn's funky invented universality-aspiring notation system. I thought the combination was very cool.",

In class, after the first few weeks, we spent a few weeks in discussions led by a graduate student on historical readings in ethnomusicology and world music theory, then didn't have much of a curriculum."

                "I wish there was a little bit more structure to the discussions which sometimes went on tangents, but other than that the course was really great.",
                "This course has a ton of potential - the material is exciting, and the music is fantastic. However, a little before halfway through the semester, the course took a turn for the worse. After that point, over half of the classes were cancelled, and I did not receive a grade on a single assignment. When class did happen, I found it engaging and intellectually exciting though.",
                "The midterm and final projects were excellent! I feel like there wasn't enough warning about the midterm project, but I started reading my book near the beginning of the course so I was fine. It would've helped to have had more deadlines, like a deadline to choose a book for the project. Overall, it was a fascinating course!",
                "I enjoyed the course content and the class overall, but there are a few things that I struggled with. \r\n\r\nThe first was the class environment, which may have had more to do with the student body than the course itself. This was the first course at Yale that I felt nervous to speak in, as the course was dominated by a few loud men, who were not afraid to interrupt non-men while they were speaking and disparage their points. At times, classes would go by where not a single non-man spoke-- other times, only a few of us would speak up and get immediately interrupted or shot down. It was actually quite shocking to exist in that environment, especially since I haven't experienced anything like it in an academic setting at Yale.\r\n\r\nNext, I wished there was more of a focus on people with lived experience with music and culture in the readings. Oftentimes, it seemed like we spent more time reading texts by white men with western music theory backgrounds than we did reading analyses of musics from the source. Since a lot of us mainly have experience with western music theory already, it felt like two degrees of separation between us and the music we were studying, because the authors were often white men. We had 11 authors featured in our readings throughout the course, and every single one of them was a man (or at least masculine presenting). Out of the 8 book options for the midterm, there was only 1 woman author, who was also white and frankly, racist. I understand that academics and music theory are male dominated, and this is an institutional problem, but I think that this course would be better overall with more non-male voices. There are a lot of women and nonbinary people who are changing the landscape of music theory and practice across the world, and I think it is disingenuous to portray music theory as both created and revolutionized almost exclusively by men.\r\n\r\nWith all of this being said, I want to reiterate that I learned a lot from this course, I appreciate all of the time, effort, and kindness of Professor Quinn, and I really did take a lot away from the experience. This was a very unique semester, but I hope that some of this feedback can be carried into the future of the course, because I think it is a valuable piece of the music department's offerings.",
                "I enjoyed the singing exercises that we did and would have like to continue them through the latter part of the semester. Extenuating circumstances made it difficult to meet for every scheduled course meeting, but we made the most of it.",
                "The course started very strong  Prof. Quinn had great ideas about how to discuss the material and what types of things we should think about. However, the course dropped off a lot after the very beginning it would have been nice if it had continued\/if we had had more material in the semester."

                "This really depends. If you're looking for an interesting class that will not be too much work and will be thought-provoking and cool, for sure take it. If you're not going into music or majoring in it or anything, this is probably one of the only opportunities you'll have to think like this. None of the work will feel like a burden -- there's not much of it, and all of it is thought-provoking and interesting. That being said, if you're the sort of person who will be frustrated by disorganization, this might not be the class for you. Ian is the sweetest man in the world, but he is a bit of a mess. A lot of that was due to the fact that this has just been a rough semester (COVID) for everyone and him specifically, but I think part of it is probably just who he is (there was never a real syllabus for the course, for example).",
