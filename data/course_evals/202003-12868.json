                "Strengths: There are countless opportunities (literally every day of class) to practice your Spanish skills with the professor throughout the semester. Maripaz gives thorough feedback every time a student says or writes anything in Spanish, which was extremely helpful in developing better grammar and pronunciation. The syllabus very clearly lays out what is expected each day. The homework was a good way to practice the skills we were working on and having two attempts on many of the assignments was great. Weaknesses: This is not so much a weakness as just something to be aware of, but the class moves extremely fast.",
                "Maripaz is an amazing professor, set up well for learning",
                "The course has a lot of busywork, especially over Zoom, making it really difficult to stay engaged and interested in the material. Additionally, the asynchronous days were really difficult to keep up with material.",
                "The whole course was very clearly structured before the semester even started. Every class, including work outside of class, was carefully described on the syllabus. This made following the material and studying much easier. This also helped with my time management, as I knew exactly when I need to do homework for this class. \r\n\r\nI can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "I liked breakout rooms in class so that we could have conversations in Spanish, and not answer one line questions.",
                "The strengths of this course was the syllabus and always knowing what homework was going to be due.",
                "In my opinion, the biggest strength of SPAN 110 is that we meet in a discussion style seminar three times a week. The frequency of our synchronous classes allowed me to improve my Spanish."

The use of breakout rooms was excellent and a great chance to practice Spanish skills in a smaller group setting.
