                "The grade feedback time was extremely lagged behind new assignments. So you don't really know how well you're understanding the topics before new ones come up.",
                "Strengths are that it's well-organized. Weaknesses are that the class moved slow in the actual session.",
                "I actually enjoyed learning math through the online format. I thought the course went a little fast and had too many problem sets, though they were necessary to ensure we keep up. I also didn't like how the final was worth so much of our final grade.",
                "Strengths- the pre-class work and videos were helpful. The practice exams were also great tools. \r\n\r\nWeakness- the nature of the summer session means the class was very fast paced. Office hours could have also been more regular.",
                "I wish the class didn't go as fast, but I don't really think that's possible without taking it during a normal semester. Most of my problems with the class came from the class being only 5 weeks long.",
                "I believe the recorded lectures were more informative than the in-person lectures. I think the structure of the class was one where I did 90% of my learning on my own and not a ton in class, which I didn't find exactly to my liking. However, I do think one of the strengths was the workshops and the workshop instructor.",
                "The strengths of the course were being able to have so many outside resources available to our disposal. For example, other than the textbook we had lecture videos, in class examples, more textbook work if we wanted and workshop practice on Friday. This allowed for a good amount of repetition to familiarize ourselves with topics. However, this course could be improved by switching the order of when we would watch lecture videos and when we would learn those same topics in class. I would have benefited more if new topics were introduced in class and then we got a chance to practice and further our understanding in the lecture videos, not the other way around.",
                "More personal instructions",
                "The course had a manageable workload and easy access to help. The lectures possibly could be improved (but they weren't bad).",
                "There were pre-class assignments that helped show what the content presented that class would be and they served as a good introduction to the material as well as easy points to help you maintain your grade which I found to be a strength of the course in terms of supporting students. A weakness would be the format of the \"workshop\" section of the course where we students were sent out into breakout rooms to work on a challenging question. These just seemed unorganized and students were left to work on the questions for way too much time and had to wait for the professor to verify our work before being able to move on to the next questions. That was a third of all the classes so that was not fantastic.",
