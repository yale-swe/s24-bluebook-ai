                "Strengths: Other people in the class are very knowledgeable, have a lot of different interests, and come from a variety of backgrounds. It's a great way to meet interesting people\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) Zero feedback: Received no feedback on the process leading up to our 30-page final paper. Prof. Dove never responded with feedback to me, and the TF seemed wholely uninterested in helping me and ghosted me on both feedback via canvas and on several email threads asking for help. The one feedback I got half-way through the semester was \"don't do this for your paper topic\" with no explanation for why it was a bad idea and no helpful suggestions.\r\n2) Poor teaching\/rudeness: In one class session we were told that the next week we would have to give 3-minute presentations of what we had done for our papers so far to the rest of the class. The prof and TF dropped this information like a bomb and tried to quickly move on; one student tried to ask them a question (what the presentations should look like) and both the prof and TF laughed at him. It was absolutely ridiculous and they owe that man a huge apology. Every interaction I had with the TF was passive-aggressive, and the prof did nothing to intervene or make sure she was doing a good job. Near the end of the semester, we got an email saying \"the final paper is due December 10th\" as a reminder. This was incorrect-one of the first things you can see when opening canvas is that the final paper was due Dec. 12 (also posted on the PDF syllabus). Shortly after, we got a follow-up email stating \"Your papers are due December 10, as given in class and in the previous announcement\". When most people make an error, they accept it and correct for their mistakes; they announced this late enough in the term that they should've owned up to THEIR error and moved the due date to the 12th, instead of sending a snide email and giving us less time. \r\n2.5) \"Bad judgment\" - to be frank, the prof used some outdated terms for several groups of minorities, that while they are not the \"most\" racist terms to be used, were done in poor taste. That, combined with several instances of racist characterizations and assumptions about groups of people as well as looking down on poor people, made for a very awkward class session. (As an FGLI & LGBTQ+ kid, definitely made me feel like the prof wouldn't have liked me if he knew these things about me. I can't imagine how BIPOC in this class felt :( ).\r\n3) The class itself - frankly, I didn't learn a lot from this class. The lectures were full of scattered thoughts and opinions, both by the prof and by other writers. While I understand this field might not be full of hard facts, you can't state everyone's opinions without telling us how they were formed or the context that they came from. The readings were really interesting; that's about it.",
                "The readings and discussion were excellent, however, the small group of students required to submit a weekly paper \/ essay always had a stronger understanding of the readings than the rest of the class and this was evident in discussions.",
                "I would have appreciated more checkpoints regarding the final paper. Maybe a deadline for a \"first draft\" (no feedback necessary, but just as a deadline) would be helpful. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, when the first proposals were due, I felt like I did not have enough knowledge to determine a specific topic that I wanted to focus on. For example, there were some things that we learned about near the end of the course that I would have liked to choose as a final paper topic but could not because I wasn't aware of such concepts in the middle of the semester. I guess this is mainly a problem for students who came into the class not having much familiarity with the field of study.",
                "I really appreciated the class discussions, they were at times just as elightening as the lectures themselves.",
                "Strength: Prof. Dove is one of thee most insightful professors I've ever had. He exposed holes in a lot of the ideas I took for granted before the course and really made me think about 'climate' in a completely different way.\r\nWeakness: Given the seminar format, being virtual definitely weakens the experience more than anything else",
                "Strengths: there was a diverse class, and most of the students were highly engaged; the professor knows a lot about the topic and most of the readings were interesting and eye-opening\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I had expected the class to be more of a discussion and seminar, rather than a lecture with a seminar size; the lectures were also often unorganized and it was hard to grasp the main ideas from the lecture at times\/to know where the lecture was going next."
