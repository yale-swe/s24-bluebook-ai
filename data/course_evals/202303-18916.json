                "In general, a little bit of error analysis and paper-writing skill, but really it depends on the labs you pick. The ones I did generally taught the basics of a particular lab instrument - not enough to do an experiment completely by yourself, but enough to know how and why to use the instrument. The lab on chaos, for instance, covered the basics of how to analyze chaotic systems (phase-space, Poincare maps, etc.). After taking the lab, I don't think I would be able to effectively analyze a chaotic system I'd never seen before, but I would absolutely know where to start, and understand many of the terms physicists use to talk about chaos.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the instructors and TA were very helpful in explaining different concepts and answering questions we had about the labs. There were many interesting labs, and I got to work with tools and materials that I would not be able to otherwise, like superconductors! Weaknesses: some of the experimental guides were challenging to understand (but explained well by the TA).",
                "Strengths: you pick the experiments you want to do - this alone makes it about 10x better than 205L. The experiments are also generally quite interesting, and I enjoyed learning the material and using the equipment. The lab guides are fairly clear about what they ask for. The TAs are knowledgeable and helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the lab guides need to be updated. My partner and I also wasted a lot of time dealing with faulty equipment. Things are going to break, of course, but it might be helpful to have a section in the lab guide which says something like \"The op-amp should preserve waveform down to 30 mV. If your sine wave breaks down at .2 V, something is wrong.\" Expected ranges are also just good information for students to learn.\r\n\r\nWriting lab reports is frequently tedious - my least favorite assignment this semester. I understand that it's supposed to be paper-writing practice, but it's really draining to write an abstract, introduction, and conclusion which nobody, neither you nor the TAs, is interested in reading. I don't really know how to fix this, though.",
                "Very little interaction with the professor, much more TA-driven. It would have been nice to have a defined office hour or even hour section earlier/later in the week to talk about the analysis of the experiment if we didn't have time to do so in the lab period due to long data collection times.",
                "Weakness: It wasn't always clear what was expected to be included in the lab reports and that would sometimes effect how a report was graded. \r\nStrength: Students have the freedom to choose which labs they do throughout the semester, so the course is centered around their interests.",
                "The labs were all very interesting and taught me a lot, I also had to learn latex and a decent amount of python for the reports. \r\n\r\nThe only thing to improve is that I wish I had been able to do more labs because there were a lot that seemed interesting but we had to pick 11.",
                "A strength was that the experiments were very cool to carry out. However, I felt that this class was poorly organized. The lab guides were often unnecessarily dense and impossible to get through in just the regular lab time. Also, the lab reports were exhausting to write and took up more time per week than some of my full credit classes. The things we needed in our reports were scattered throughout the guides and the sample report provided was really much shorter/less complete that what was expected. The TFs (for this section) were also not great. A lot of the times we would ask them a question and they would not have any idea how to help.",
                "Strengths: absolutely loved some of the experiments. I especially liked the Nuclear Reaction, Charge-To-Mass, Superconductivity, and even the Millikan Experiment. All of them were incredibly rewarding to work on and really drew me into why I chose physics in the first place.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it was very unclear on what was actually required of us to do in the lab reports. Sometimes the background information would be way too long for any of it to be digestible, and when the background section is filled up with lots of questions, it is impossible to answer all of them in the 5-6 page lab report limit that we were constrained to.",
                "This course introduces you to a handful of interesting experiments and applications of the theory learned in other classes. Unfortunately, the course can feel very pedantic at times."

                "This was quite an interesting course and I learned from it, though I don't know if I would recommend this course to another student if you don't have to take it for a major or other requirement. However, as a physics major, I would highly recommend the 205/206 lab track over 165/166. I feel like you get a lot more out of the experience.",
                "This is a major requirement, so you probably don't have much of a choice. I could actually imagine this being a fun class to credit/D, since you could just not do a lot of the tedious bits, but I kinda doubt anyone is taking physics lab just for kicks.\r\n\r\nI do think it's a decent lab class. It's better than 205L, and you get to do some really cool science (superconductors!). I would definitely recommend reading the lab guide before you do the experiments - nobody will force you to, but the labs will just go so much better, and you'll be able to get to the more interesting science.",
                "I would, mainly because it is required for the Physics intensive major.",
                "Yes, the labs are fun and engaging and teach you a lot about physics experiment.  If you pick a wide range of labs you also get a great understanding of different techniques and disciplines across different fields.",
                "If you're taking it, it's probably because it's required. But I had some fun moments within in my group, and the TA was awesome. You'll learn some cool things along the way, and it's not too much work (it gets less and less as you get more skilled with Latex and writing reports, which is the whole point)!",
                "I would not recommend this course to nonmajors. It is a lot of work for only a half credit and there is often not enough guidance. Some labs were way too detailed without being organized and often I would leave feeling confused.",
                "If you are a Physics major, I would recommend it. The experiments make 205L worth it and were really illuminating to do. I would recommend doing the Nuclear Reaction and Superconductivity experiments especially. Just be prepared to write Jupyter notebooks by yourselves to create figures and begin writing lab reports early: I found out the hard way that some experiments have so much new knowledge required that it is impossible to write it out in a day.",
