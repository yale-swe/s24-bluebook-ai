                "We developed a framework to study different religions and traditions. The papers were an incredible way to reflect on my life. The last paper made me introspect and discover my vision of a good life.",
                "I learned about religious and non religious traditions and the doctrines they advocate for living a life well, and what a life led well means in each of these traditions. I learned how traditions can be critiqued from within, and critiqued from without, as well as the overlap/intersection between some of these visions.",
                "I think the selling point of this class is to learn about religions/philosophies that are different from your own. But I also found it valuable, perhaps even more valuable, that we took the time to ask: what life philosophies do we adhere to, consciously or unconsciously? Because we all \"worship\" something.",
                "The course created a broader awareness of Buddhism, Islam, Jewish, and Indigenous views on a vision of a life worth living. We acknowledged how these were only small aspects of the teachings and focused on answering our main course questions of what life led well, life going well, and life feeling as it should look like for each unit. The discussions we had in class felt very communal and intimate. As an early class, I would leave the class thinking for the rest of the day about how the teachings were already embedded within my vision of a life worth living or wondering if I could apply those concepts to my life. My insights about my peers grew a lot during this course and I'm eternally grateful we were all so comfortable with each other.",
                "I gained many texts to explore the question of what makes a life worth living, made new friends, and learned how to better traverse the landscape of self-identity and self-worth.",
                "I gained so much from this course. It was such a valuable opportunity not only to reevaluate what motivates me and whether I am leading life in practice in a manner that I intend to in theory. It has been incredibly enriching to learn from my peers as they opened up about their lives and visions for the future. I'm so grateful for the window that this course has been into so many different ways to live life and for the sensitivity with which it was taught."

                "Lots of strengths! Very unique course, passionate teaching team, good opportunity to think about what we want out of life instead of just barreling through! But your experience in it is very dependent on who leads your section and what they are thinking about in this point in their lives. Also towards the end it felt very god-centric and just learning different ways about how god can change a vision of life worth living. Not quite sure what I got out of some of the later units. Beginning of the course was really good, and essays are short but really interesting!",
                "Strengths: Matt was awesome, you learn a lot about yourself/ classmates, discussions are very fun and engaging, you learn a wide breadth of schools of thought and receive specific feedback, overall great class \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings can feel like a lot by the end, esp because theres two classes a week, each individually with heavy assigned reading",
                "This was the best course Ive taken at Yale!!! Experiences vary per section, so do everything you can to get in Matts section. \r\n\r\nStrengths: structure of course, retreat with your section, weekly lectures \r\n\r\nWeakness: none",
                "The strengths of the course are accessible section leaders, interesting guest speakers from a wide variety of backgrounds, engaging readings, and clear feedback on writing assignments. It's a course where you're a lot less focused on the grades and more focused on what insights you can glean from the materials and the course was very much organized to stimulate engagement and critical thinking of the texts. The materials were recorded for the plenaries and there's honestly not much that could be improved about the course.",
                "Strengths: Matt is a phenomenal section leader. He is an excellent listener and does a great job facilitating our discussions. He also invited us to his house at the end of the semester for s'mores! Another strength was my classmates. I think this class is pretty self-selecting, and people who are interested in the \"big question\" this course tackles join the course. It is great to learn from everyone else's life experiences and perspectives. Matt and the class structure does a great job of allowing people to be vulnerable and share about themselves.",
                "Strengths: The readings and discussion sections were engaging, very accommodating with Zoom-in options for isolation or contact tracing, and feedback on essays was very helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe having backup questions for plenary sessions to cover for when students had no questions",
                "This course was great. Early start time but it was great. No changes and this class would still remain great.",
                "I think it would have been very helpful to have been given a brief overview of each tradition we encountered before we started reading about it so that we could orientate ourselves before we delved in (especially when we may have never encountered the tradition before). However, this introduction need not take up both sessions (or even the whole of one session), because I think one of the greatest strengths was that everyone was engaged and most of the class was conversation and hearing each other's interpretations!"

                "YES. TAKE IT. WITH MATTHEW CROASMUN. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. Best class at Yale ever, if you take it with Matt.",
                "Yeah but read about the different section leaders before deciding which one!",
                "I would definitely recommend it! Youll probably learn a lot about yourself and your own philosophies about life. The readings are interesting too",
                "100%! This course should be mandatory for all Yale students. It changed how I think about the world.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It's that quintessential Yale class that you're hoping for but not sure where to find - a seminar with a community atmosphere where people actually really get to know each other and everyone brings something different to the table in terms of religious and non religious backgrounds and life experiences. This course taught me a lot about effective ways to be introspective with regard to a life worth living and what it means to lead one's life well, obligations to other people, and it's a great entry point into religious study and comparative religious study without advocating any one tradition, religious or otherwise, as the right way to interpret a life worth living. This is a great combination of philosophy and religion, as well as traditions like indigenous ecological visions and expressive individualism. The readings are engaging, the feedback is clear, and the section leaders really care about what you have to say. It will make you think a lot about the way you're living your life right now both in general and with relation to your Yale experience.",
                "Absolutely, especially with Matt. He is one the best seminar leaders that I've had. He is a great listener and makes the class a very safe space, so people are comfortable opening up, being vulnerable, and sharing their insights. In terms of workload, it's super chill - only 3 papers that average 3 pages double-spaced each - and none of them felt like busywork. I especially loved writing the final paper and I will come back to it often to remind myself how I want to live my life. The more you put into this class, the more you will get out of it, but you can also take it super chill.",
                "Yes!! If you're the type to like big philosophical questions (examples include \"what does it mean to be human,\" \"what is forgiveness,\" and \"how do we define the self\") and are open to discussing and musing together as a class, I would highly recommend it!",
                "Don't recommend for students in their senior spring. really hard to stay engaged with a class that is supposed to be highly personal",
                "Yes. Do you want to engage with philosophical, religious, and native perspectives on what makes a life worth living? If yes, then do it!",
                "Yes! If you have the opportunity to take this course you should definitely take it! It provided space to challenge yourself and grow, to delve into your history and motivations but also to learn from others and from a slice of the incredible canon of thought on this topic. It was truly humbling to be exposed to the thoughts of so many before us who had thought so deeply and shared such wisdom on what a 'Life Worth Living' should be."
