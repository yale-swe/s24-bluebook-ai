                "This course taught me a number of terms that have helped me understand my personal experiences as a woman and a feminist (i.e. hermeneutical injustice). I also got a much better sense of what philosophical conversations about gender are currently taking place.",
                "learned how to read pretty dense philosophical papers, make sound arguments, and create argument maps",
                "I learned about feminist philosophy. Specifically, I was able to go in depth on issues of gender, sex, and patriarchy. I learned about many of the philosophical arguments surrounding feminist theory, from double binds and forms of oppression to epistemic injustice and multicultural approaches to feminism. I also learned how to become a better reader of philosophy, and I learned how to amp out arguments and write critical essays in response to those arguments.",
                "I learned a lot about feminist philosophy. Different conceptions of gender, sex, misogyny. We also discussed the origins of these concepts and whether it has a structural foundation or not. Finally we classified different types of injustices and discussed them.",
                "I learned how to approach argumentative writing more logically.",
                "I had been taking philosophy classes for the past two years, but this was the first philosophy of gender course I took. It was a wonderful introduction to the subject, and I feel I know so more about the current debates, the nature of our society and of feminism as an academic and cultural movement. We also learned to use a really helpful argument mapping software called rationale. I would 10/10 recommend this class to early students majoring in philosophy. I wish I had taken it sooner",

Broad focus, which includes highly important topics for understanding our society: the patriarchy in relation to capitalism, to racism, homophobia, ableism... Learnt a huge variety of philosophical and political terminology thats crucial for understanding misogyny and general gender oppression. Literally made me reconsider my own gender.",

                "HONESTLY I LEARNED EVERYTHING ABOUT HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE WORLD AND HOW IT IS SO STRUCTURED AROUND GENDER. i learned how to read and write philosophical papers, I learned some philosophical terms, and I learned how rooted our society is in gender and how gender is actually not an innate thing, but truly is societally structured. loved this class insanely much.",
                "I came into this class unsure about a lot of the terminology that is present in our current society dealing with sex and gender. I was definitely not expecting to gain so much information about gender in just this one class, but I am glad that I was proven wrong. I learned to analyze difficult readings in a short amount of time and also form complex questions to later be discussed in class. This is one of the few classes I have taken that has allowed me to be free to express my opinions without ever feeling like I would be wrongly judged. I can confidently say this class has made me into a much more understanding and well-read individual."

                "strengths: PROFESSOR DEMBROFF! what a person! loved how they lectured so well and i loved the TA, moya, as well. both of them did a phenomenal job creating a community and classroom over zoom. the range of texts, the lectures' clarity, the guest lecturers\r\nweaknesses: none (except maybe that if you aren't a philosophy student, the argument mapping is hard and the software is like from the early 2000s.)",
                "This is a very strong course! The structure is very clear and every reading is purposefully and deliberately chosen to help you think about issues of gender and sex. One strength is definitely Robin and Moya! They are some of the greatest teachers and people I have ever met! Not only do they provide insightful perspectives on the readings, they are also so kind and accommodating, especially during this crazy online semester. Another strength is the focus on argumentation. This course really taught me to analyze arguments effectively and break down complex philosophical works in a way that makes it easier for me to understand. Also, the guest speakers we had throughout the terms were incredible. It was so cool to read these incredible works of feminist philosophy and then actually get to ask the author questions about it. Definitely a highlight of the course! I'd say the only weakness was the time. The 50-minute lecture period would often go by so fast that we wouldn't have enough time to get to all the material. Moving from 50-minute to 75-minute lectures would greatly improve the course. Also, I wish lecture slides would have been posted before lecture. During lecture, I often found myself scrambling to jot down notes instead of actively taking in Robin's insights. Also, I would've loved the chance to go back to earlier lectures to refer to points previously discussed.",
                "The professor and the T.A Moya were the best part of the class. They were very knowledgeable and approachable",
                "This class has so many strengths! First, Dembroff is an amazing teacher who is obviously very passionate and knowledgeable about the topics discussed. One of my favorite parts of the course was the opportunity to meet and discuss with some of the authors we read on the syllabus. Even on zoom, this class was one that I engaged with the most, which says a lot about how Dembroff structures classes and the student-teacher dynamic that is cultivated. I loved the discussion board assignments.",
                "One of the strengths of this class was the reasonable reading load and accountability for the reading. As a result, this was the only course I took this semester where I genuinely read everything assigned to us. The weekly discussion boards were also really helpful in facilitating discussion with other students in a virtual context, and making me think a bit more about what I had read before lecture. The discussion session I had with Professor Dembroff was also run exceptionally well, with them doing a good job of drawing responses out of more hesitant students and helping us all collect our thoughts and connect them to one another. Honestly I can't say enough good about the class. Most of the weaknesses in my opinion had to do with the virtual format.",
                "Strengths included: high level of support from professor and TA's, engaging class and readings, guest lecturers from pieces we read.",
                "I thought the class was a great introductory class into philosophical thinking and how to write philosophical papers. The focus is primarily on assessing arguments as opposed to creating ones own philosophy in relation to already existing feminist philosophy.",
                "I think that this course could be better if more time was dedicated to teaching there students argument mapping.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Dembroff is an incredible lecturer, and the material is extremely interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: None really. Maybe that the class is too short. Would do better in an hour 15 time slot + section.",
                "Strengths: I learned so much and the lectures were incredibly insightful and engaging, even with the virtual format. Prof. Dembroff used polls to help ensure we were understanding the material and every lecture was so interesting!",
                "I think the extent to which students were encouraged to engage with and formulate their own opinions about the material was probably the strongest part of the course.",
                "This course only had strengths! I loved the material, the professor, and my TF. If I could change one thing, I would get rid of all of the argument mapping/Rationale stuff. It only confused me. Otherwise, this was one of the most amazing classes I got to take in my Yale education!",
                "This course provided many useful insights into gender oppression and made philosophy extremely palatable. However, I think it could have benefited from a more in-depth discussion about argumentation for those of us who came in with little or no experience.",
                "So many strenghts. All of it was a strength. the once a week short, but well thought out question was GREAT because it was more analytical than just a comment, and it made you really think about what you'd read. Honestly the only weakness would be maybe that the class didn't have much writing. If you're me, and you want to work on your writing, this is a weakness. if you don't want to write a lot, than the lack of writing is a plus!",
                "The classes were all incredibly engaging and informative. the constant reassurance you get from professor Dembroff and Moya was always encouraging and motivating. You also always get feedback and assistance on the written assignments which makes them less stressful. In addition, the weekly discussion posts were a great way for us to hear our classmate's thoughts on the readings, and formulating our answers to others' questions was great prep for the assignments. The only thing I would have wanted to change was the length of the classes. I felt that 5o minutes weren't always enough to discuss everything every week."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I had never taken a philosophy course before I took Phil of Gender, but Robin and Moya made philosophy so approachable and engaging that I was able to actively participate in discussion despite my lack of philosophy experience. In fact, many students in the class had never taken philosophy before, so if that's you as well, don't hesitate to take this class. It will be so worth it and you'll learn so much! I think everyone should take feminist philosophy. It is so important to examine how gender and sex function in our society and to understand how systemic patriarchal oppression pervades all aspects of society. You will let go of so many misconceptions you had (and even ones you didn't think you had) and become a more conscious person. Definitely take this class with Robin if it is offered again!",

                "YES! This has definitely been one of my favorite courses that I've taken. You learn so much and your perspective is both challenged and expanded. The readings are, for the most part, incredibly written (or purposefully aggravating) and often come in manageable chunks.",
                "I cannot recommend this course enough. While I especially recommend it to people starting out in the philosophy major, I would really encourage anyone who is remotely interested in the subject (or not!) to take this class. The readings and the subject matter were so engaging and made me rethink, almost every class, the conceptions I held about our world. The assignments are clear, manageable and open (which is honestly not a combination I have found in almost any other class). The discussion section I was in was well-facilitated, and I appreciated the fact that the class left space for student opinion while not being afraid to point out inaccuracies or discrepancies in contributions.",
                "Yes, definitely!",
                "I would. Especially if you are interesting in taking a philosophy course but are looking for something more relevant to present day discourse, this class is a great opening into the world of philosophy.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, absolutely. Take this course. You should take any course with Robin Dembroff. I came into this course being kind of confused about many terms and concepts regarding gender, patriarchy, feminism, etc. In some Yale courses, I feel like these concepts are kind of taken for granted. That is, had I taken a sociology of gender class (for example), I would expect to be told outright more or less that certain things are a certain way. In this course, you get a rigorous treatment of these concepts and go through the reasoning of how they get built up. Even though these topics are complicated and the material can be intellectually difficult to get through, you not only feel like you can ask hard questions, but you actively want to. Definitely one of the most useful and interesting courses I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes!!! This class was amazing and I learned so much about sexuality, gender, and oppression. I found myself drawing parallels between Phil of Gender and all of my other classes and using what I learned in this class to enhance what I learned in others. I am so glad that I took it and 100% recommend it to others!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in thinking about the way gender functions in our society.",
                "Absolutely!! I gained so much insight about oppression, about our society, and about myself. Take this course if you want to understand why you present yourself the way you do, why you and others act the ways they do, the subconscious factors affecting your mind, your thoughts, your way of perceiving yourself and the world...",
                "Yes! Any student in any field should take this class. It was a great introduction to philosophy but the feminist theory made everything more approachable. Also, anyone interested in feminism/gender equality should take this class to have a basis of understanding important ideas like oppression, intersectionality, and patriarchy. This course was amazing!",
                "Yes, especially for women and queer folks. This is an amazing course to learn about the bases of gender injustice, with a variety of readings and discussions about the role it plays in society and the reasons it is upheld.",
                "YES. TAKE THIS COURSE! whether or not you think you are interested in philosophy, or gender, or WGSS, or anything, this is a completely worth it class. It is so fascinating and extremely applicable to the world around us. It had me noticing things left and right in movies, relationships around me, how clothing is marketed, etc. etc. I was SO engaged, and while I took this class on a whim because I had a friend who recommended Dembroff to me, it is by FAR my favorite Yale class so far. TAKE IT!",
                "Yes! I feel that this class is incredibly for our understanding of gender. Everyone benefits from the discussions we've had in just the discussion sections alone, as they offer new perspectives that you otherwise wouldn't get anywhere else."
