We learned to organize this through affinity mapping and to create high quality slides. Some would argue we were doing a trial run of a (public-spirited, much lower workload) consulting stint and in that I found value."

                "The course was great but the lack of feedback from the client made it tricky to adapt the final product as needed. In the end, everything worked out, but it caused some unnecessary scrambling and stress along the way.",
                "Strengths: the opportunity to talk high-level officials in the UN system, especially in the WHO, and get their feedback on our work. Bina is a super kind and organized instructor who always prioritizes our input on important deadlines or deliverable content. It's also nice to work with other Global Affairs students in a team setting. Weakness: by way of this being a policy consulting project, the feedback from the client drove the direction of the project. They weren't always consistent or clear, and this greatly increased our workload in the later stage of the project. Also it's difficult to coordinate everyone's schedules and distribute workload evenly in a group project.",
                "I thought the question we were answering was quite useful and interesting. Having the WHO as a client and even being able to talk with and visit them in Geneva was amazing!\r\n\r\nOn this project, Bina was super nice, flexible, and understanding. She also provided a good structure to organize our work (joint governance, evaluation, monitoring, funding) as well as suggestions. I would note that ensuring the definitions\/expectations of the work align well with the client early on is important (and we didn't do enough of though), which resulted in a bit of a scramble and rework towards the end."

                "Yes. I learned a lot and it was useful to be in a work setting rather than a classroom one.",
                "Yes, I thought this was a strong capstone experience that taught me a lot about collaborations on a global scale",
                "Yes because it's the capstone, and Bina is a wonderful, caring instructor with lots of industry knowledge. It's a good opportunity to produce policy deliverables, conduct qualitative research, and engage with UN officials. But just heads up that the capstone project may come with some of the usual headaches of group projects.",
                "I would. This is one of the only classes that has you do work for real practitioners and the clients we get are amazing (in our case WHO). Getting to visit them as well is such a massive plus. Compared to written theses, the work was lighter and getting to bond with a group (rather than solo work) was very nice. That said, do understand it is *group* work with all of the caveats and intricacies that come with that."
