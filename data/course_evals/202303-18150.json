I came into the course after having taken several probability theory courses in undergrad (6+  years ago) and self-studying real analysis the summer before this course started. Candidly, I was nervous how much of the course I could follow, but I generally felt that I could follow along with all the concepts in the course (although it often also involved a decent bit of self-studying before and after each class). The final project showed me that these concepts are relevant and ubiquitous in understanding any kind of probability paper, and I feel more confident now than before that I can tackle a much greater range of probability papers than before I had taken this course.",

                "Problem sets can be unnecessarily tedious",
                "Strengths are Sekhar's lectures; the proofs are surprisingly clear and pretty well motivated, and Sekhar has a good sense of humor. The problem sets, while challenging, also helped to build upon the material we learned in class (and provided further motivation for things you might have learned in 241). Only weakness is that we didn't get to cover some cool topics (like Brownian motion and large deviations), but that's more of a consequence of being a 1-semester course. I hope to see Sekhar's \"Topics on Probability\" course approved in the near future...",
                "The lecture note is not quite readable for me",
                "I think this course attracts a diverse array of mathematical backgrounds, which can make it difficult at times to build a cohesive progression of material. That said, I greatly appreciated the current coverage of the course.",
                "My only complaint with the course is that there isn't a part 2 to the course. It was clear towards the end that there were still a lot of interesting topics to cover (e.g., large deviations), and we wouldn't have time to cover those. Otherwise, I thought the course was very well structured. We spent a roughly optimal amount of time on measure theory (as someone who self-studied real analysis and knew no measure theory coming into the class) to have all the tools we needed to cover the probability concepts, and while all the theory behind conditional probability was challenging, it was helpful that we immediately tackled martingales as an application for conditional probabilities. Otherwise, the problem sets were roughly the right difficulty/length/frequency. I'm not really sure how we could have improved on those. I will note that office hours were absolutely critical to working through the problem sets. I often found that my solutions coming into the office hours were not quite right, so they were crucial to making sure that I actually understood the concepts properly.",
                "Very useful course for theory statistics.",
                "The instructor is great, lectures are entertaining, TAs are knowledgeable and provide thorough feedback on assignments, which are challenging and numerous.",
                "Instructor is very good and able to really clearly convey difficult concepts. The course is almost all self contained in the sense that every result can be proved with things priorly shown in the course. This makes everything have a satisfying feeling of connectivity. The only \"weakness\" was the speed at which lectures moved which necessitated individual study ... but I do not think it is fair to call that a weakness in a graduate course.",
                "The course is strong in its speed and depth. While the notes are indeed legible, a scribe would be appreciated.",
                "Stregths are the choice of the textbooks, the content selection and the rigorosity.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are that some problem sets may be a bit too long. I learned a lot from them though."
