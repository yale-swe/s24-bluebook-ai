                "Learned more about how to research, analyze and evaluate early America. It was extremely refreshing to be able to focus on just one city throughout the whole course most urban studies courses try to do too much and jump around again and again, which is disorienting. In this class, we moved much more carefully through time and space, making it much easier to draw connections and feel like each class is building towards something rather than a dissociated vignette or theme.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of Philadelphia beyond whats commonly taught in other history courses (i.e. just Revolutionary War era), public history, and early urban development.",
                "I have developed many valuable skills in this course--- a deeper understaning of Early America, affinity identity histories then, Philadelphia's history and its relationship with the rest of the world and America. I have become a better writer as well because of the copious feedback provided by Professor Hankins. I have redefined my standards for a good class at Yale as I have never met a Professor and classroom dynamic I feel more comfortable in my time here.",
                "I learned a ton about the early development and progression of society, economic, and infrastructure in Philadelphia. Professor Hankins did an excellent job facilitating the material, guiding discussion, and creating an engaging syllabus that promoted learning.",
                "I gained insight into the early history of Philadelphia, how national memory intersects with physical space in cities, and the politics of historical preservation."

                "Strengths: Kristin is a great teacher and really cares about her students. Great readings that were just substantive enough to produce good discussion but not feel overwhelming. At the beginning of the semester Kristin led a very thorough discussion about class expectations and invited us to suggest ways to improve the course for our personal learning, which made me feel much more comfortable as a student. The projects are also great. If anything, I would have moved the timeline of the mini-projects up so we could begin formulating ideas for the final project earlier.",
                "Professor Hankins is one of the greatest strengths of this course. She takes time to get to know every student and is one of the most caring professors. Her commitment to the class is amazing and she left great suggestions on all of the written responses and drafts of papers submitted.",
                "The expansiveness of subject matter in the syllabus--- covering all decades in Antebellum Philadelphia, affinity perspectives, and connecting sources together beautifully. Another strength was the recall I was able to take away from revisions at the beginning of classes. The class could have had more engagement by having assignments/reading responses more often, but even that may not have been necessary.",
                "no weaknesses really, good material, good engagement level, good work balance.",
                "Professor Hankins selected a wide range of readings and online exhibits that revealed key moments in Philadelphia's history and raised questions about how history informs uses of public space. Class discussions were a really engaging combination of in-depth analysis specific to Philadelphia and more general discussions about the way history is remembered in museums, parks, schools, and specific locations in Philadelphia. I really enjoyed the way Professor Hankins grounded these discussions in Philadelphia's history, offering the city as a key case study in the development of the nation and of national identity. As an American Studies major, this class was essential in giving me a sense of the projects and ideas that the field of public humanities entails. I came to the class with the aim of filling the early Americas requirement and learning more about the city at the center of U.S. history, and I left an in-depth understanding of public history projects, American history in general, and questions that make me excited to learn more about about early America."

                "Absolutely, especially if it is taught again by Kristin. You should honestly just take any course Kristin teaches. \r\n\r\nI didn't really have any personal connection to Philadelphia and had only been there a few times. While we did learn a lot about Philly, I'm taking away much more about general ways to study a subject like a city or institution. This was a great way to fulfill both the Early Americas and junior seminar requirements.",
                "Yes! The class was interesting and an amazing way to fulfill the Early Americas requirement for AMST. Kristin was an incredibly engaged and caring professor, and Im so sad to see her go. She gave excellent feedback and created a great classroom environment. The course encouraged us to examine questions of how we can and should represent and engage with the past (which is never really past).",
                "Absolutely, if not for how well organized it is, simply for Professor Hankins.",
                "Yes absolutely, for the answers I have listed above but also emphasizing the growth in writing skills that I had not expected. I am more considerate of my reader because of Professor Hankins. She asked so many questions and gave so much valuable feedback that I had to start having better forethought before turning in papers.",
                "Yes, its a great class if you want to learn more about one of the earliest and greatest cities in america.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially American Studies or History majors. Professor Hankins offers a unique and highly engaging approach to history, designing a course that helped me understand how to marshal a case study of a specific time period and place to illustrate broader historical themes. This is an excellent class for anyone who is interested in learning how history intersects with national identity and how to express that connection through academic writing or creative projects (exhibits, map studies, artwork, etc.).  \r\n\r\nI would specifically highly recommend this class for an American studies major considering the Public Humanities concentration. I've struggled to find classes with assignments and discussions that connect directly to the field of public humanities, and AMST 333 was one of the first classes I've taken that felt directly connected to my goals as an American Studies major. AMST 333 is essentially a master class in public humanities, introductory enough to introduce context on the field and in-depth enough to push students to consider the complex politics of public space throughout history. The class discussions and assignments offered opportunities to engage with public humanities, and the final creative project gave us the freedom to chose to write an academic paper or design a more public-facing history project. This was especially helpful for me since I'm considering the Public Humanities concentration and completing a public history project for a fellowship this summer. In the final project for AMST 333, I was able to get a head start on some of my research for this summer and gain insight into how to create a public humanities project. AMST 333 was an amazing opportunity to learn about public humanities, gain research experience, and learn from Professor Hankins' academic expertise and her experience working in the public humanities field in Philadelphia."
