            "comments": [
                "This course did not facilitate learning very well and I honestly felt like the information was just thrown at the students and we were expected to fully understand the extremely complex content for the exams. This course needs to have a better method of trying to ensure the understanding of students and what is expected of them.",
                "Having the course switch up professors multiple times made it difficult to predict what sort of questions we would have on the exam, so it was difficult to know what sort of content we would need to know.",
                "A weakness of this class is that the entire grade is based on tests, so there is no chance to see how much you know before the tests. Another weakness is the fact that there was definitely lots of blatant cheating that the testing proctors just didn't seem to care about.",
                "It switched professors and so you never knew what the format was or how they would test on exams. With the already difficult material, it was unfair to have to become accustomed to a new professor and their teaching strategies every few weeks.",
                "Strengths: Engelman and Breaker were good professors, seemed to know the material well \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no problem sets, grade was determined only by 4 midterms. Professor Zhang who taught the last 5-7 ish lectures seemed to not know how to communicate the material well, making it very hard to learn and understand the last month or so of class. I wouldn't take the class if he is the 3rd lecturer, but Breaker/Engelman are pretty good lecturers. However, there is more memorization involved in studying than they lead you to believe, so don't be fooled by them saying that you don't need to memorize stuff, because you definitely do",
                "The strength of this course is the organization of the lectures (in particular the first two professors). You are likely taking this course as a pre-med requirement, and this is one of the better pre-med courses I have taken. The material is presented in an accessible way, most of the time. Another strength is that the only assignments are four exams over the semester with no problem sets or a cumulative final exam (which you do need to take if you miss one of the four exams). This could be a weakness, but if you learn some biochem every week regularly, you shouldn't have to do a lot of cramming before each of the exams. TAs are also a great help. A weakness might be that the three professors had very different teaching styles, which was difficult when studying for the third and fourth tests because we weren't sure what to expect on the exams.",
                "This course has many weaknesses. This is a very core course in the pathway of MCDB and of completing premed requirements. Thus the teaching quality of the course should be exceptional. It is not. The professors that teach this course need to show more passion and care because it does not translate. Furthermore, the 9:25 class time is not conducive to learning in class AT ALL. Change this to midday or afternoon and every student will show up to class and actually try to learn instead of cramming the night before.",
                "Strengths: I liked how there was no final exam, which freed up my reading period tremendously. I also liked the first half of the class, and the fact that there were no psets.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The fact that the grade was based on only four exams was a bit stressful, and I wish that the grading was a little less nit-picky given the fact that the lectures were already pretty vague on what specifics would be tested.",
                "While there course had discussion sections, having no psets was a huge challenge for this class. It would have been be eh beneficial to see how to apply the material",
                "Strengths: TAs. The content is interesting and synthesizes knowledge from previous pre mes courses which is cool\r\n\r\nWeakness: lack of consistency in terms of detail on lecture vs exams, it NEVER matches. Lectures were either too detailed or too big picture so exams often felt like surprises. The grade only rests on four exams no psets or extra credit so you dont have many opportunities to improve your grade. \r\n\r\nAlso many people allegedly cheated on exams and they did a bad job of catching that.",
                "The strengths of this course are the breadth of knowledge that it covers. The weakness is that we switch professors three times, so every time you have to adjust to new teaching and exam styles.",
                "The class could be improved by having only one professor throughout the course. It was extremly frustrating to have to adapt to the teaching and testing style of three different professors. Every exam it felt like we were in the dark because we did not know what to expect from each professor's exam. Professor Zhang's lectures were unclear and at times incoherent. He did not offer any review sessions and failed to provide any practice materials even though he was asked to. In the future, this course should just use one professor who is able to communicate and teach biochemistry effectively and consistently.",
                "The material in this course was in fact quite engaging, but I think restructuring this course would prove to be very beneficial for students and professors. I find that basing our grades off of four exams fails to acknowledge the effect the pandemic has had and continues to have on everyone. Instead, I would suggest incorporating PSETs into the course to help student's comprehension of the material and provide another metric in the grading system other than testing. There is much room for improvement, and I have no doubt that these professors can create a better learning environment for students. Additionally, changing the professors so much was quite difficult to keep up with, and I think only having one professor for the whole course would be much better in terms of testing and expectations for the class.",
                "Easy to do well in, just make sure not to start studying too late. The concepts feel quite fun if you appreciate their overall significance.",
                "Strengths - the faculty are clearly masters of the material, but they teach in a way that is not conducive to learning. It was unclear what were supposed to get from the lectures, they were extremely fast and it sometimes sounded like another language. The professors often skipped fundamental topics, saying Im sure you all already know that when I and my friends didnt know any of it. When I emailed the professors asking questions, I got no responses. It was unclear what we were supposed to know for the exams. Because the final grade is comprised solely of exams, its impossible to gauge if youve absorbed the material until you show up to the exam. The professors often stressed that there was no memorization and the exams would focus on key concepts and ideas, but this was not true. There were extremely specific questions on material that was skipped over in class, and often the key concepts we learned about were not even on the exams. How it could be improved - some kind of feedback other than exams, better lecturing, not misleading descriptions of the exam content.",
                "Not well taught at all",
                "Professors Breaker was excellent at explaining and walking through mechanisms, and Professor Engelman was as well. However, Professor Zhang did not explain his slides well at all. He also was clearly uninterested in interacting with undergraduates; he never held office hours. One time, I asked him when I could meet with him to go over questions since he didn't have an office hour, and he said he would get back to me but he never did.\r\n\r\nMost of this class is memorization; I felt like I was stuffing my head with facts but not really gaining any deeper or lasting knowledge.",
                "I thought it was unclear at times what information we were responsible for.",
                "Professors and exams. The style of teaching that Professor Engelman had was vastly different from that of Breaker and Zhang. It was a bit unfair in this way.",
                "I really didn't like that the class switched professors three times during the semester, the changing teaching styles made it really difficult to know what each professor expected you to know for the exam, which is important since the grade is based entirely on the exams.",
                "This course was really difficult to manage from the student perspective. The four exams worth the entirety of our grade was incredibly stressful, but also resulted in not having psets or quizzes on which we could depend for practice questions or checks of how well we knew the material. While the team teaching was interesting, I think having a single source of information about the course would have been really beneficial. Having quizzes or even problem sets to check the conceptual understanding prior to these huge exams would have been really appreciated.",
                "The lecturers switched several times, and they all lectured differently. This was difficult to adjust to and made learning more confusing. There was also a lot of unnecessary material that I felt did not really tie into the course well.",
                "Very comprehensive and holistic in its exploration of biochemistry \r\n\r\nAlmost too much information presented, unclear at times what we should actually be taking away",
                "The strengths were Breaker's emphasis of concepts behind metabolism rather than memorization and the non-cumulative exams, and Breaker's adding to styles rather than regurgitating them. Engelman also strengthened the course with his comprehensive slides, however a weakness was that he emphasizes memorization and just reads off the slides - the amino acids and pKas were hard to memorize. The biggest weakness was changing teaching styles on us three times and having three different instructors make exams  professor Zhang's teaching style was so confusing and hard to follow and weird to throw us into within the last few weeks of the course - it was poorly organized."

                "No. Unless you absolutely need this class, DONT DO IT. Your entire grade is based on exams which have extremely detailed questions after the professor said it would only be key concepts. There is no feedback, when I emailed the professors asking questions they never answered me, and overall I learned nothing. Im gonna take biochem online at another school because I need to learn it from someone who can actually teach.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student in its current iteration. I think having one professor the whole time ideally Professor Breaker  would be ideal. The current lecture format makes it very hard to pay attention and grasp what we will actually need to know for the test. This course feels like rote memorization. I think weekly problem sets would be a good addition so that we engage with material every week rather than simply cramming before the exams.\r\n\r\nThe peer tutors for this course were not helpful.",
                "No I thought there was just way too much information presented too quickly (I would say only take it if you're premed)",

                "No, not unless it was a prereq",
                "No, I think between the three options for biochemistry at Yale this is the one I would recommend the least. Putting all of the weight into exams where other students had quizzes to check their knowledge was much more helpful. The material presented in the other options will be likely the same, and while the time constraints on the science track at Yale mean that sometimes you have to take a course in a certain term, this one should be avoided for purely the mental health of the students. I was ultimately disappointed because biochemistry was so interesting, and I really enjoyed coming to class and learning the material, but the anxiety associated with testing/grades detracted from the experience.",

                "Yes, if you spend a TON of time preparing for the exams or maybe I was just anxious but the course is interesting in terms of learning about metabolism and biochemistry -- although usually you only take it to fulfill a requirement."
