I learned how to run a gel, how to run PCR reactions, how to plate bacteria on agar and select plaques, and how to use computational modeling softwares. The course was also organized in a great way through which we were focused on a \"research goal\" throughout.",

                "The course does not have an even workload. There were 2-3 weeks spread throughout the course of the semester that were loaded up with a lot of work. An improvement would be to more evenly space out the work such as making smaller sections of the lab report due.",
                "This course had wonderful teaching lectures and quizzes. Thank you, Professor Pawashe!",
                "This course could have more structured lab instructions, because they became confusing at times.",
                "Strengths: Professor Pawashe was wonderful, very kind and very helpful. She is a great professor, always taking the time to explain new concepts in detail and answer students' questions. She genuinely cares about her students' learning and wants to make sure that students are understanding the material. She really instills a love for biochemistry within her students. She is also a lovely and inspiring human, and I am very glad that I had the opportunity to take this class with her. The class was also organized in a really interesting and engaging way. Throughout the semester, we had a \"research project\" which stayed consistent throughout and we performed various experiments (we ran PCR reactions and gels and isolated mutant DNA etc etc) all with the same research goal. This consistent big-picture goal really made the work interesting and meaningful. The TA, Jummie, was also very helpful and very kind, and always available to answer questions. Weaknesses: None!",
                "Strengths: Prof Aruna is very lovely and TAs were great. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lab days could be shortened to exclude non-lab activities.",
                "I think the class was very strong because of the level of engagement of the students.",
                "Course procedure was very clear. I wished that introduction lectures were slightly shorter.",
                "The course is taught as a single research project with each week being a new step in the research. This helped to fit everything together so you can feel how it is to actually perform this research."

You will get to learn really key experimental techniques, which you often read about in textbooks and which will probably be super useful for anyone looking to do biology-based research.",
