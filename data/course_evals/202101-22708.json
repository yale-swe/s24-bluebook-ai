He was really great about synthesizing the feedback/questions everyone had for each other and asking interesting thought questions when people ran out of things to say. I do think it would have been fruitful to encourage all students to participate by turning their cameras on or incentivizing participation in some other way. Some students didn't say a word through the whole semester.",

I will say that given the limited expertise of students (especially those not in the same field as me), they could only offer marginally helpful/feasible changes on my project. Perhaps it would have been cool to also meet with fellow cogsci seniors doing projects of similar topics as either part of class or in addition to what was done this past term."
