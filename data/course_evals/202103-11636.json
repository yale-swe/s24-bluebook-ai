                "The textbook for this course is appropriately challenging, making it a good bridge between intermediate and advanced Japanese. The presentations also seemed like a good way to gauge learning progress over the course of the semester. Meeting with the TF was the best part of this course because it gave me real hands-on practice with spoken Japanese!\r\n\r\nOne downside to this course is that it seems unnecessarily time consuming at times. The vocab quizzes for instance require multiple hours of studying for a 10-minute quiz, and then the vocab words are forgotten easily as they never come up in class again. A lot of the time, it felt like learning vocab and kanji just to be able to do the homework and then most of class time is spent going over homework answers instead of practicing conversational skills or really going into depth on grammar points."
