                "Strengths: The awesome professors and material. All of the professors (not just mine) were EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the material. The material in and of itself was also awesome, from The Odyssey to Dante's Divine Comedy we covered quite a bit of antiquity. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is a sentiment echoed year after year person after person, but the speed at which the entire program goes is frustrating. You don't really get to go into depth with the texts and it can leave you feeling like you don't always have the best analysis or even understanding of the text at hand. I wish we had more time to spend on each work but I also understand that's how it goes. However, from the three classes, I feel as if Literature was the easiest to still grasp at this pace. \r\n\r\nImprovement: Professor Periano and Professor LeVen were incredible and my only real gripe is with the speed of the program. Lectures (which my professors don't have any control over) could've been posted earlier as it was difficult to watch them sometime throughout the week .",
                "Strength is that we can collectively explore a text through productive discussions, the seminars are always an open space where everyone can contribute and learn from. Individual feedback and office hours are also very helpful in getting additional help for papers or further insight into the text.\r\nA weakness is that the program covers too much text and we often spend too little time on the texts.",
                "One of the strengths of the class was the passions which both professors brought to seminar. They were both extremely knowledgeable on much of the material, and their enthusiasm for sharing this knowledge with us was evident; this kind of energy is contagious. I think the biggest weakness was that co-teaching sometimes led to the two professors stepping on each other's toes. Sometimes it was evident that they had not co-ordinated the lesson plan enough beforehand, which led to some awkwardness in seminar.",
                "The discussion format of this course was very enjoyable. It helped us better understand the texts we were reading.",

                "The strengths of this course were that the professors were very engaging and willing to help students understand how to better themselves. Like all DS courses, though, you're expected to write papers very well before entering the class, which can be hard."

Overall, I feel as if this course was excellently adapted considering the circumstances.",

The discussions are a strict discussion of ancient texts; If you find those boring, you will not like DS or DS Lit. If interested in the material, then I would definitely recommend! It's a fun course for someone who is interested in antiquity and\/or someone who has no exposure to the classics.",
