Specifically, that includes biological membranes, synthesis and transport of proteins (rough ER, Golgi apparatus, secretory vesicles, lysosome, etc.), actin and microtubules, and mitosis. Discussion sections are formatted as journal clubs and train students to read and understand academic papers. We also learned about many biological techniques, such as different types of microscopy, antibody assays, and biochemical assay (e.g., centrifugation, chromatography, SDS-PAGE, etc.)",

We also read some papers that connected to class. However, do not go into this class thinking that you will learn actual cell biology concepts at an introductory level. The course assumes that you have this already, and the lectures go through very specific and frankly non-useful examples of cell biology in conversation with the previous laboratory techniques. I do not think that I retained the knowledge that I learned during this course, just because Mooseker goes through so many slides during each lecture, and the course wasn't tied together cohesively with general themes in cell bio or key concepts like in BIOL 101.",

Most of the concepts were ALL about application rather than sheer memorization. Learned how to apply knowledge, think critically, and learned to read scientific papers a lot better than in 101",
                "I developed skills regarding the function of organelles within the cells, specifically the protein-related jobs of the Golgi, Rough ER, and beyond. Also learned a bit at the end about actin and filaments and stuff. We had to skip over Unit 2, so I'm not sure what that content was, but overall cool stuff.",

I feel like I will forget many\/most of the specifics that we learned in the course, but many of the underlying principles that I gleaned through learning about so many specific examples of cell biology will stick with me, I think. Like, I won't remember the names of the proteins that have to do with actin and microtubule regulation, but I will remember that pretty much everything that needs to happen in cells has a protein making it happen, and that these proteins are made in the rough ER if they need to be targeted to a specific place, and that vesicles with coats get them to specific places, and that the Golgi modifies proteins in many ways, etc.",

Lectures often focused not only on cellular mechanisms but also on experimental methods and conclusions which illustrated how each topic was proven, and the general steps of important processes (phospholipid bilayer fluidity and protein interactions, endocytosis, actin and microtubule assembly) were provided with a good level of detail. Tool kit lectures also provided helpful insights into microscopy, immunolocalization, fractionation, sedimentation, assay analysis, and more, providing a strong foundation for understanding experimental methods.

Also, having a study sheet or class skeleton for each class available like in BIOL 101 would be very helpful.",
                "Strengths: Fantastic, engaging lectures taught by an expert in the field; synthesized experimental evidence, detailed diagrams, and engaging live demonstrations to provide an excellent window into the key components of cell biology. Toolkit lectures were also extremely helpful, providing insight on many of the basic lab techniques often blindly followed out of convention, rather than understanding. The level at which I engage with biology and biological research papers has improved significantly. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Assignments frequently contained ambiguous, poorly-worded questions that seemed designed to trip up students, rather than test their understanding of the material (particularly on lecture quizzes, and also many pset questions). When faced with these inconsistencies\/ambiguities, instructors went to incredible lengths to wriggle their way out of taking responsibility for the mistakes, often providing lengthy, convoluted explanations that made little sense. The grading policy followed suit, with points taken off for things that no student could have foreseen without having the grading rubric sitting in front of them when answering the question. Given these items, along with the withheld lecture recordings, nonstop assignments, and high level of stress among us students, it seems inconceivable to me that the assignments in this course were designed with the goal of facilitating learning in mind.",
                "Weaknesses: \r\n-Discussion sections: Despite being essential for the quizzes and the PSETs, discussion sections were not carried out in a time-efficient manner (always running over by 10-15 minutes) and did not place enough emphasis on the explanations for figures or important points of the paper (frequently flashing the slides for only a few seconds or skipping them entirely [extremely detrimental to students who need to read or see something to process information]).\r\n-Lectures: Always extremely longwinded and the presentation slides, despite having access to them, were not very helpful as they were organized in a confusing manner. \r\n\r\nOverall, the structure of the class made it extremely difficult to learn anything.",
                "This course could be made an actual cell biology course as the title of the class suggests instead of a lab techniques course. It could also be slowed down as it is an INTRO course. The grading could also be sped up as I had very little feedback and thus did not know how to improve as I went forward with assignments.",
                "This class's biggest strength was the availability of office hours and enrichment with Professor Hartman, who is a saint. The biggest weakness is that no one could understand the lectures. Mooseker's lecture style indicates that he is extremely knowledgeable about all things biology, but completely lacks the ability to convey this information in a way that is understandable to anyone, sometimes including the TFs. He talks too fast and dives straight into complex topics without mention of the simpler processes invloved. I was so, so lost for the entire course, just like most other people in the course.",
                "Strengths  Professor Mooseker clearly cares about the material a lot and Hartman & the teaching team are all very accessible to get additional help. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses  I struggled to understand a lot of the course since it felt as though we were learning very specific, advanced experimental techniques without learning the basics of cell biology. It felt like a huge jump in understanding and I do not think the course sufficiently covers the breadth of foundational knowledge in cell bio that would be needed to understand the material it is trying to get us to learn.",
                "Strengths: I learned so much about cell biology by taking this course! BIOL 102 focuses on truly understanding the concepts and methodologies rather than on memorization. The lectures were interesting and the teaching team provides lots of support. The lecture quizzes helped me check my understanding of the course material and the PSETs gave me an opportunity to apply and practice what we learned in class. Weaknesses: None",
                "Strength is Mooseker being knowledgeable in his field and enthusiasm for the material. Weakness is the number of topics that are supposed to be covered. We skipped unit 2 and only got through 10 minutes of unit 7 by the end of the course. Mark stops for questions which is great, but the course is too ambitious on the amount of material. This also means he moves too fast for an intro sequence. Also the lecture quizzes were... interesting. They're multiple choice but sometimes the wording of the question made little sense.",
                "The workload jump from 101 was much too large and unexpected. Lecture seemed clear enough, but then the problem sets and lecture sets seemed to require much more detail and knowledge than was covered in lecture. In particular, the lecture quizzes seemed less like an assessment of our knowledge and how well we could follow the lecture content, but more a collection of confusing, badly worded true\/false questions so that the professor could trick as many students as possible. This was true for many other assessments, and felt like this class was supposed to weed people out. The TAs were great at answering questions, but the grading did also seem much harsher than in 101 on psets in particular. The peer tutors were also very helpful. Finally, since this is labelled to be a course on cell biology, there is a remarkable lack of the topic, rather focusing on research methods and landmark papers. I personally liked this approach as it seems more useful in the long run, but it is potentially worrying that we are not getting a good basis of cell bio for future classes or exams like the MCAT. To be clear, I believe that professor Mooseker and the bio 102 team are all very nice people and want to help and teach us, but the ways in which they do so are not effective. They should remember that this is an introductory biology course for many people whose high school classes did not have nearly the same workload or preparation, and this course should certainly not follow bio 101.",
                "This course could definitely be improved by adding more structure. I felt as though we dove into the specifics very quickly in this course, but did not really get a general understanding of topics. In other words, \"zooming out\" every now and again and really emphasizing the importance\/significance of what we are learning in big picture terms would have really helped orient me.",
                "Weakness: Prof Mooseker knows too much to teach this course effectively! Uses a lot of jargon, moves fast from one topic to another. Feedback on Lecture Quizzes could have been more timely, as correct answers can theoretically be released once the deadline is reached. (this is a weekly quiz on lecture materials on Canvas, true\/false & multiple choice only, small portion of the grade but it really helped me go through the lecture again.) Strengths: Apart from the mental struggle at every lecture, I LOVED the course! I liked how the questions on weekly problem sets forced you to think about experimental designs and the scientific method. Prof Mooseker is very humorous in lectures and his \"high-tech demonstrations\" are HILARIOUS. Profs Hartman and Mooseker are very available via Ed Discussion and email, and Prof Mooseker hosts weekly review sessions, which I have found very helpful. Feedback on problem sets is usually given ~1.5 weeks after they are due, so you'll probably only get the first grade before the withdrawal deadline (as it's a half-semester course), but otherwise, it's been quite timely.",
                "The course is taught far above an introductory level course. It is overly difficult to understand lecture content, and most students have to learn it by themselves--which comes easier for some than others. There needs to be a different lecturer and more streamlined information.",
                "I think the class is well-structured to give students lots of opportunities to engage with the material. In class, the professor leaves time to have students do pair-share exercises and strengthen their understanding of the material, and he also encourages students to ask questions. Additionally, the discussion sections are very helpful for building a deeper understanding of the papers that we read in class, and the peer tutoring and professor office hours make it easy for students to get help on the material they don't understand. \r\nI think the biggest area of improvement is the pace of the class. We cover over 100 slides a week, and the sheer quantity of material we cover on any given day can be overwhelming. I completely understand that all the concepts are necessary for us to develop a full understanding of cell biology, so my suggestion would be to try consolidating the slides such that there are maybe 40-50 slides per lecture. That way, the professor could spend a little bit more time explaining where we are in the cell at any given time and what exactly is happening in a specific organelle or process.",
                "Strengths: The TAs and the review sessions definitely helped to reinforce the large amount of content covered in lectures. Mooseker's skits during class also were very entertaining and showcased the information in a novel way. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The content was not cohesive, the lectures were taught too fast-paced, the lecturing was confusing, full of jargon, and not conducive to an introductory level class where many students do not possess previous extensive cell bio knowledge. The papers were also very old, which would be fine except I feel like it defeats the whole purpose of journal clubs being a way to showcase new research. The research that we went over was decades old. The PSETs also varied greatly in difficulty, and the questions were often too expository and not straightforward. The grading on the PSETs was also very harsh, which caused frustration for both the TAs and the students. There was also concerns of cheating, especially on the take-home exams, which was partly because some of the PSET questions were recycled from previous years. Punishment for cheating was that points would get docked, which is not harsh enough. Combined with the fact that PSETs were recycled, this encourages more cheating and is not representative of an honest or fair system. I think this was also an area of frustration for many students. This course could be improved by actually making it an introductory cell biology course, having better worded PSETs, and a more fair system in terms of cheating. I also believe that better communication between the professors, TAs and the peer tutors is needed, because often one or the other would give students inaccurate information for the PSETs.",
                "The lecture was rushed. Very difficult to keep up with concepts week to week.",
                "A strength of this course is that the material is very interesting. A weakness is that the material is not laid out very clearly in lecture, and because it is so specific it is difficult to find the information elsewhere without attending office hours. Another strength of the course was the collaborative PSETS, which I found very engaging and that they deepened my understanding of the material. The non-collaborative psets however were too difficult to complete without collaborating in my opinion, leading some to cheat. I did not cheat, and I felt that I was at a disadvantage. The lecture quizzes were also much too difficult. Professor Mooseker said in lecture that if you skim the lecture slides, you should get a 100%. This was simply not the case for me. I attended every lecture and took notes, and went through the slides painstakingly as I completed the quizzes, and my scores were still very inconsistent. They were not a good indicator of whether you paid attention in lecture and read the papers, and I think this is what someone was referring to when they called them useless.",
                "Horrible lectures, I fell asleep in almost every single one of them. Professor Mooseker is a nice person and seems passionate about biology, but lectures are very confusing and boring.",
                "This course could use a lot of improvement. I have never learned any cell biology before this so I was hoping to gain understanding of the parts of a cell and how they operate, but that was not the case. I felt like it was assumed you knew a lot of things before the course, even though this is intro bio, and I have never had any meaningful biology course before so I did not know anything. Prof Hartman's intro videos that were supposed to be background info were the best part of the course for me.",
                "Theres not a lot of structure, and I feel like the quizzes sometimes were unnecessarily hard. I feel like the balance between depth and range of topics was ideal.",
                "strengths: professor hartman, enrichment, well organized canvas page to facilitate student learning",
                "Weakness: did not transition well from BIO 101 at all. there was very little that transferred over and the class moved a lot faster. It was also very hard to get helpful assistance.",
                "Strengths: I learned a lot and the content was very in-depth. It covered a lot of ground, and it was very consistent in terms of expectations from students (quiz, pset, paper every week)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt very underprepared for this course, especially coming from 101. There was a stark difference in difficulty level that I and many others were not prepared for. The content moved very fast, and I felt like I was just \"searching for answers\" in psets and quizzes to get the questions correct rather than fully understanding the content. This course also assumed a level of understanding in many aspects even though students come from very different backgrounds but there was no point where we went over knowledge we were supposed to come into the course with. At times, it was very overwhelming and I felt I was not fit for higher-level classes in biology since this is a prerequisite and intro-level course.",
                "I just barely understood what we were even supposed to be taking from the lectures sometimes. It sort of just felt like one long run on sentence you kept losing your place in.",
                "A weakness was that the lectures contained quite a bit of jargon.\r\nA strength was the office hours.",
                "The strength of the course: Professor Moosekers perpetual enthusiasm and his kindness. The weaknesses: the very fast-paced nature of the lectures and the ridiculously long pset questions. The psets (and weekly quizzes) were doable but required hours upon hours of combing through lecture material for very specific details that were sometimes only covered in a slide or two. The lead-up for each pset question was also extremely long, often multiple paragraphs chockful of scientific jargon. In addition, during lectures, Professor Mooseker tends to use a lot of scientific jargon, which makes it very difficult to stay engaged, let alone understand what he is talking about. The topics in cell biology are also very specific and geared towards Professor Moosekers interests. (For example, we learned about different types of microscopes for the first one and a half lectures and about cell membranes for two weeks.)",
                "This course was honestly terrible. The lectures were mostly unintelligible, filled entirely with jargon, mumbling, and useless facts. The lecture slides were just 90+ pictures\/diagrams with minimal explanation that were gone through in less than a minute each during lecture. If you glanced away for half a second you would end up completely lost for the rest of the lecture. The worst part was that Mooseker is aware of many of these issues but chooses to ignore them.",
                "Strengths: -structure is conducive to learning; -there are a TON of opportunities for help (enrichment, peer tutor office hours, etc); -Prof. Mooseker seems like a great person who loves what he does\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: -the material is ridiculously challenging and Prof. Mooseker often talks as if we are graduate students who know this material well, be prepared to leave lecture not really understanding anything; -material is rather dry as well so lectures are sometimes hard to stay engaged with",
                "The teaching of the course was somewhat disorganized in terms of lectures themselves and the lecture content was not always taught very well. The discussion sections, however, were incredible and very helpful to further our learning.",
                "I thought it was very well taught. The material could be boring at times but Mooseker made it interesting.",
                "This class is not taught like an introduction course. In order to succeed, a student must have a strong foundation in biology. The lectures are often very fast-paced. I wish that the class would've started with a bit more of a survey of the cell before diving into very intricate detail. Professor Mooseker is a good lecturer, though I think he sometimes gets ahead of himself. A strength of this course is that it tries to really encourage engagement, which I think is necessary for the sheer quantity and intricacy of information presented.",
                "very confusing and seemed as if the prof was too smart for the class since he talked in a lot of jargon",
                "The discussion sections were the main strength, as they gave the greatest ability to ask questions and get a hold of the material. The biggest weakness was the speed at which the information was taught during the lectures. Too much information was covered in extremely little detail, and then we were expected to know that in formation to a much greater depth than was taught.",
                "The skits were helpful, but the papers seemed complicated with section being too short to truly understand it.",
                "Strengths include learning the material very thoroughly, but weaknesses include a difficult format to learn material, lectures could include more background information. I felt that for someone learning biology for the first time, even after taking BIOL 101 it would be challenging to keep up.",
                "Dr. Mooseker genuinely cares. He takes time to create props and demonstrate concepts, reply to students' questions and help students find opportunities at Yale. His enthusiasm for the course is easily viewed and greatly appreciated. Additionally, take-home collaborative and non collaborative PSETS were a really good alternative to examinations. I always felt I was on an almost equal playing field with students who had already taken AP bio or some other bio course before Yale because I could take my time on the PSETs and collaborate with my peers to better understand the concepts. I think exams would greatly diminish learning while promoting significantly more stress for students. I enjoyed the current format.\r\n\r\nBIO 102 is not an introductory biology course. Many TAs have even joked about the course's high level concepts, stating it was similar to the material taught in graduate level courses. Because of this, students just don't get the concepts. It's too complex and far outside our current scope of knowledge. Having never taken biology before coming to Yale, I feel as though I still lack basic fundamental knowledge about the cell, which Professor Mooseker simply never covered. The course must be simplified, or be replaced by a true introductory course. I would also get rid of the quizzes. The answers could be found by pressing ctrl + f without really learning the material.",
                "Strengths are the independence this course makes you employ. I did not always enjoy it, but it taught me how to learn on my own sometimes and find help from others when I needed it. Weaknesses is that the PSETS were extremely difficult and those that were not allowed to collaborate on were even harder. The peer tutors could not even answer questions about the subject during those non-collaborative PSET weeks.",
                "Very poorly taught.",
                "Strengths: Course has a ton of resources enrichment with Professor Hartman, peer tutors, Ed discussion, Sunday reviews with Prof. Mooseker. Also, discussion sections were great recaps of the weekly paper readings (depending on the TF... some were better than others)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the recorded lectures came out as soon as the lectures were finished. They were not released until after the lecture quiz was due, which I did not find a good idea at all. Professor Mooseker tends to go through the information like we already know what he's talking about, so I don't think it was a fair assessment to give a lecture based without letting us see the lecture; replaying and rewinding the lecture while doing the lecture quizzes allows us to synthesize the information MUCH better than just staring at semi-complete notes from lecture. Also, info in lecture was not always easy to grasp. It took a lot of effort to fully synthesize the material. The lecture content sometimes seemed way too in-depth and each week's lecture was not very interconnected. Bio 101 seemed a lot more organized and set up to facilitate student learning.",
                "Maybe it's because I've never been in a lecture on biology before, but I would fall asleep every lecture, 100% if I didn't have a cup with two bags of black tea twenty minutes prior to the course. I mostly ended up relearning everything during the open-note lecture quizzes which helped me go over the material in depth. Kinda made me want to not go to lecture since I would usually leave understanding none of the content. Strengths is that I would end up learning the content thanks to the lecture quizzes, but it made me feel like the lectures were a waste of time.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Mooseker is very knowledgeable. My teaching fellow was excellent and extremely helpful. I attended enrichment with Prof. Hartman and Peer Tutoring, and all of those resources, as well as the weekly discussion section, were vital to understanding the class material. Weaknesses: Problem sets were extremely extremely difficult (from someone who took a biology class every year of HS and planned to major in this), and grading appeared variable based on the TF. The non-collaborative problem sets were, frankly, hit-or-miss depending on if you actually followed the policy (while I did, many people did not, and they received better grades for cheating). This course is extremely intricate, lectures are at lightning speed, and the material covered seems impossible to understand for those who have not previously had a biology course. Much knowledge is previously assumed.",
                "Section was very helpful and engaging, however lecture was not engaging and could have used a few breaks or switch up in lecture style.",
                "There could be a lot more help with the problem sets. In other courses, you can go to office hours and receive a lot of help in figuring out the problem sets and teachers that will go through them with you. In this course, there was hardly any help and even questions could not even be answered about the pset. Also, the course lectures itself seemed very out of focus with the actual psets and gave barely any guidance towards answering the questions on the pset. Besides learning black and white facts about certain topics, the lectures barely gave any help to any students for outside work.",
                "The material was really interesting. That being said, for me it was difficult to watch the lectures in real time. There is a lot of content on each slide and Mooseker moves pretty fast so it's often hard to keep up. I found it a lot better to watch lecture recordings so I could pause when needed to read and understand the content. I would have appreciated the recordings being posted sooner after the lectures.\r\n\r\nI thought it was smart to make the sections journal club-style and I definitely felt like they were enriching and well-led. I also thought there were way too many people in my section (I think this was because a lot of people that needed to switch their section on a given week switched into mine) so I hope the teaching staff will be aware of that issue going forward.",
                "Lectures were hard to follow",
                "I think that the class should be completely restructured to actually teach cell biology. Additionally, the peer tutor review sessions end up just giving the answers to the problem sets, meaning that having an open spot in your schedule for them is often the difference maker between a good and poor grade in the class.",
                "I believe that this course is excellent for students committed to studying cell biology, as it gives an in-depth understanding of concepts central to that field. However, I believe this being an introductory course makes that strength become, to an extent, a weakness: some topics were difficult to understand, especially for persons with little previous study in biology. Though, as an intended bio major, I often appreciated the depth of information presented, I believe that an introductory class would be better served with more basic concepts.",
                "I enjoyed not having proper tests and think that the weekly psets were a good way to test student's comprehension of the materials. However, the collaborative psets were markedly easier than the two non-collaborative ones we had (which were basically stand in tests) and so I think reconciling the difficulty of these respective psets would be beneficial. I also found Professor Mooseker's lectures to be pretty all over the place and hard to follow. Professor Mooseker is clearly a kind and brilliant man but I do not think he is the right person to teach Bio 102, given it is an introductory course. Mooseker's lectures and psets were more on part with advanced cellular biology courses.",
                "The lectures were very jargony, which was nice in some ways because we got down to very granular levels of knowledge instead of speaking in broad general terms about biological processes, but it was also a bit disheartening during lectures when I couldn't follow what was going on. It was nice that new jargon was mostly explained the first time that it was used, but then it seemed like it was sort of expected that we would remember exactly what each jargony word meant after just one short explanation, which was definitely not the case. So the second time a new word was brought up, especially if it was long after the first time it was brought up, I wouldn't remember what it meant, and I would quickly feel lost and honestly quite sad and disappointed in myself during lecture, which impeded learning.",
                "It was confusing to understand and the professor frequently mumbled, the explanations were not always clear, and I did not like the psets and thought I didnt learn so much bio but more so how to efficiently look through my notes to obtain answers.",
                "This lecture moved SUPER quickly. By the time you've searched up one word that you don't understand, the professor has covered three new processes and has moved onto a different topic entirely. This made the course very challenging. I was super interested in this topic but I don't think I learned much from this course, because there was just way too much to absorb & understand that I was overwhelmed and did not end up internalizing much. This was very unfortunate. \r\n\r\nStudents don't have the time to spend hours doing extra work outside of class just to prepare for a lecture, without which you don't really make the most of the class because you won't understand what's going on. \r\n\r\nAs someone that didn't take AP Bio, I couldn't tell if I was just dumb or if this course was super hard for everyone (talking to others makes me lean towards the latter).\r\n\r\nBut I get that you can't really slow down with a course where so much has to be covered in so little. Maybe having more time-sensitive resources to reinforce material could be helpful? Quick youtube videos or other simplified explanations? \r\n\r\nThe material covered is super interesting and necessary to know. That is the principal strength of this course. \r\n\r\nThe PSETs were SO HARD. There was a lot of extra information in the prompts that you spent hours trying to understand and then in the end you didn't even need it. But the professors were very kind grading-wise and helpful when you took initiative and asked questions. \r\n\r\nThe LQs were very useful. They helped reinforce what was covered in lectures.",
                "Strengths:  The \"take home\" format of the assessments were vital, because Mooseker's lectures were so confusing that it took ages of looking over the slides to understand how to answer the questions on the Psets and non-collaborative Psets. Office hours with the Peer Tutors and Professor Hartman were VERY helpful -- could not have understood this course without them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were extremely confusing. Mooseker is a very nice man, but his lectures are incomprehensible on the first round of listening to them. We did not have enough time to go over the tool kits and the regular lectures.",
                "The discussion sections are very helpful to understand the content of the lectures. It was also very helpful that the lecture slides are released on Canvas which allows to pay attention during the lecture",
                "Taught slower and more at an intro level Since its an intro class",
                "TAs are great, but the professor taught very unfairly. PSETs graded incredibly harsh and specific. I don't know anyone who enjoyed this course...it is not an introductory level course and made me discouraged in wanting to pursue science.",
                "Strengths: Quizzes are open note, making them a little easier to complete\r\nWeaknesses: The class goes fast, and is packed with a lot of info that at a times can be difficult to understand. PSETs at times can be difficult to do without collaborating with other students, or attending peer tutoring.",
                "The course was well organized and there were many sources of outreach for help. The class was a big jump from BIOL 101 so the transition process is a little difficult.",
                "Too much material over too little time. This class cannot be fully taught in one quarter.",
                "Professor Mooseker is very enthusiastic about both biology and teaching biology. However, he does cover a large amount of material too quickly and I think that a more \"overall\" overview of cell biology would be helpful.",
                "The lectures were quite engaging and sophisticated. I wish there was a bit more consolidation and organization of material into pragmatic bites of material. At times it felt like there was a lot of information dumping without discussion of interconnectivity and relevancy which personally decreased my own engagement.",
                "The course structure was very confusing and the units seemed to be sort of disorganized",
                "Strengths: the professors \r\nWeaknesses: size of class",
                "Strengths: Hartman's organization of the course\r\nWeakness: Lectures lack direction at times and it's unclear what information is important to understanding the concepts vs. just extra details.",
                "Lectures were sometimes long and boring. Support from teaching team was good.",
                "weaknesses: the professor speaks as if we know what hes talking about and doesnt really teach at all. enrichment was the key to our success!!!",
                "This course was somewhat hard to follow during the lectures but I thought the extra help and the sections were a strong point to get me to understand the material.",
                "Good content and TA team, a bit understaffed though. Delayed feedback was the worst; causing problems with tracking and enhancing performance.",
                "The strengths were the resources outside of class such as enrichment and office hours. The weakness was the pace of lecture and the way the professor communicated the information on the slides.",
                "Since its supposed to be an intro bio class, but all we do is read research papers, I found it very hard to follow what was happening due to how advanced the research papers were. Whereas other students who had taken many bio classes may have found it easier",
                "Professor Hartman is the single greatest thing about BIOL 102 (and the bio sequence!). Without her support, guidance, office hours, and constant positive energy, I would not have been able to make it through this course. I say this because this course is not well designed to facilitate student learning. Each week, the lecture consisted of content that was way above the level of an introductory course (I say this as someone who has taken AP and IB Bio HL). There was a large focus on laboratory techniques, which was interesting, but I was often lost. The layout of BIOL 101 was much better as it was organized around Key Concepts, and the lectures were genuinely at the level of an introductory biology course. BIOL 102 would benefit from more structure and cohesion as opposed to its currently disparate strands of topics in cell biology. Professor Mooseker is incredibly knowledgeable in his field, and he injects a lot of humor into his lectures which was much appreciated. I just wish the content was more accessible.",
                "The course challenged the student to understand the specifics of scientific papers in relation to the subject matter being taught in class, which I thought was the biggest strength. However, I believe that there are several things that can be improved: in particular, I would find it easier if, instead of using a pointer, Dr. Mooseker could use an iPad and Apple pencil to signal things on diagrams that are worth nothing. This is especially true of the first half of the course, which (for me) was almost entirely memorization.",
                "The discussion papers were very interesting but at some times confusing. If the discussion section PowerPoints could be shared to students that could be very helpful .",
                "This course handles complex material in a very engaging way, and the lectures were extremely enjoyable to attend. They were always very dynamic and made the material easier for me to comprehend. A weakness of this course was that it focuses more on experimental methods than the biological principles that were being discussed.",
                "Strengths: In this course, you gain a strong introduction to experimental techniques and the course uses many interesting examples that make it easier to learn concepts. You read one scientific paper each week, and I think these were very helpful and interesting. The course is undoubtedly insightful, and I think it gets easier as the semester goes on. Also, the teaching staff is very understanding and will make changes if a significant number of students are struggling.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were not always organized, and it is not as \"introductory\" as you think. Professor Mooseker is really smart and kind, and he tries his best to make the lectures engaging, but I think he often forgets that this may be the first cellular biology course that some of his students are taking. He often uses technical words that students have never heard of or learned about and expects you to know some concepts that were not taught in BIOL 101. However, he has great reviews in higher-level courses, so I think this is a result of the fact that he engages with biology at such an advanced level in his research and upper-level classes that he doesn't always realize his students are only at the beginning of their journey of learning biology. Also, I think the course focuses too much on experimental techniques. They were important for reinforcing concepts, but I think there should be more direct explanations.",
                "The lecture was not engaging and I found the textbook to be unhelpful. I had a difficult time motivating myself to do work in the class and the lack of engaging material exacerbated that problem.",
                "More consistency with TAs",
                "The course is overly specific for a general cell biology class. Since everything was open note and all exams were take home, I felt like I learned nothing because everything was so specific.",
                "Strengths: The lecture quizzes and psets, while sometimes arduous, really helped cement the material. Often I found I didn't really understand the lectures until I worked on those. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course should really be called \"experimental methods in cell biology.\" We learned much more about the methods that have resulted in discoveries in cell bio than the processes and organelles themselves, which was just less interesting to me personally. I also think this class would have been really challenging without having taken AP bio or the equivalent.",
                "The strengths of this course was Prof. Hartman and her enrichment sections. She is incredibly helpful and cares about her students. Enrichment is organized and she teaches in a way that actually makes sense (unlike lecture) and then gives us very useful handouts at the end. She is very reachable and is always happy to answer questions and help her students. \r\n\r\nAnother strength of this course were the take-home exams. As we had all week, it greatly reduced the stress and we could take our time and and go through all our notes and handouts to solve the problems. Although these were challenging, the answers were always somewhere in the lectures notes.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course were Prof. Mooseker and his lectures. He began this course by saying that people often complain that he uses too much jargon and goes too fast. He then continued to use too much jargon and go WAY too fast. I would say that half the class was lost during lecture and had no idea what was going on half the time. Although we could clap if we wanted him to slow down, that wouldn't slow it down enough and we cannot clap the whole lecture, even though we SHOULD because he simply zooms through every slide. It is frustrating to not have ANY time to process the information because he is clicking through the slides and racing though the lecture,",
                "I think this course was very good at encouraging students to think very in-depth about biological concepts. We had to learn to discard the very generalized ideas we were taught to try and understand how things worked step by step. I think this course also did a really good job at putting us in an imaginary lab by asking us to think about how very specific changes would disrupt a whole biological process. I would say, however, that the course could be improved by recording the lectures for students to watch them at their own pace after the in-person lecture since some material easily gets missed.",
                "Strengths: The discussion section of this course was immensely helpful and engaging. I found that the small classroom setting and the slides used during section challenged me to think and apply concepts to real life experiments. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like the lectures for this course was confusing, and I wished we had more guidance during lecture. Although we had the \"clapping\" system, I felt like it was intimidating to clap in class and I wished there was another mechanism to ask for clarification during lecture.",
                "The course was quite the adjustment in pacing from BIOL 101, especially with the online lectures in 101. I think the course could be improved with an introduction that went over exactly what would be covered and how one could approach studying for the class. I also wish there were more opportunities for help on the problem set.",
                "The lectures were extremely difficult to follow (will elaborate under professor evaluation), and the quizzes and problem sets were very difficult. The problem sets can probably stay as they are, but making the lecture quizzes as hard as they were was a large weakness in the course because you didn't learn anything going through the slides to find an answer to a very detailed question. The lecture quizzes should be closed note, but easier questions to make sure that base level understanding is met. Not the in depth level of understanding needed for the problem set, because TF's can help with that.",
                "Lectures were hard to follow at times, but it was clear this would be the case from the beginning. A pro is that the class was very info-dense so I learned a lot.",
                "Recorded Lectures should be posted immediately after class.",
                "Strengths: very enthusiastic professor, fun research papers. Weaknesses: can be hard to keep up during lecture.",
                "The lectures seemed kind of unstructured and were hard to follow. The information seemed really specific and not that useful.",
                "A strength is how in depth we go into every unit, but because of the limited time, it might be too fast for some.",
                "Strengths: The class was well organized, and we were provided with many ways to interact with the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures often went fast. Many times, I didnt understand why one topic was related to another. Outlines helped, but I think spending more time on why each topic relates helps. I also think spending time on how the reading we did each week related to the lectures would have been beneficial as well.",
                "I feel the lecture content easily went past my head and assignments were on the harder side. I wish we were taught in an easier way to make the assignments manageable.",
                "One strength of the course was that the material provided was highly detailed and very complete, giving the students a full understanding of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness was the length of the lecture slides. I saw one  of the lectures was about 120 slides long, and given that the class is only about an hour and a half minutes long, this meant that each slide (on average) took less than a minute. This made it hard to follow the lecture slides, and many students resorted to attending the lectures, and then looking through the slides on their own time.",
                "Strengths: Mooseker is charming and funny\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were dense and boring, material was presented in disjointed ways\r\n\r\nCould be improved: lectures are less dense, things are better explained",
                "I appreciated how the course was detailed and covered a lot of information. While this could be a strength, it also comes as a weakness because much of the information (or at least the way it is taught here) requires a significant amount of prerequisite knowledge that you dont really get from BIO 101.",
                "Strengths: there are a lot of resources to get help: Peer tutoring office hours, Mooseker's review, Enrichment, office hours, etc. (you just need to know how to manage them), the lecture slides were clear in the expectations for what we should know, the lecturer prof. Mooseker was eager to give demonstrations and reexplain concepts, discussion sections we a good place to ask questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the change from asynchronous 101 to in-person 102 was difficult, somewhat hard to engage in the content and follow because it was complex, PSETS were hard but there were a lot of ways to get help, quizzes were supposed to be easy \"if you just skim the textbook\" but that was not true for me even with notes accessible, lecture recordings weren't made available until after the weekly quizzes,  Canvas Files were somewhat hard to navigate (there are a lot of different pdfs for the same content- organized by day and unit so it can be helpful)",
                "I think the fact that the professors used biotechnology as a means to understand microbiological phenomena was interesting. However, since I lacked prior exposure to many of these techniques, it made understanding the processes through the case experiments more difficult (rather than making them easier to understand).",
                "Strengths: Solid experimental focus with lots of general tools which helped understand how cells are studied in the real world. Lectures went through a relatively thorough outline of each cellular process studied and discussion sections were helpful in understanding key concepts each week. The course grading is formatted to emphasize problem sets and does not include closed-book, sit-down exams; the process of completing a complex problem set each week was instrumental in fortifying and internalizing content from the course. Two problem sets were non-collaborative \"take-home exams\", and having days to do these assignments while reviewing notes and making critical connections between concepts was more helpful to truly understand cellular processes than would have been memorizing cursory information for an exam. The content in this course is generally pretty interesting and researching cell biology seems like a compelling field to explore in the future. Enrichment, discussion sections, and office hours mean that course professors and the teaching team are available to students for smaller-group and one-on-one discussions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While lectures are theoretically organized by concept and process, the way that content is covered during each lecture can be somewhat confusing, as steps are often not clearly laid out or labeled (sometimes the focus is primarily on proprietary methods or interesting facts which seem tangential to the processes themselves). Thus, lectures can be somewhat hard to follow and significant energy is sometimes required when reviewing lecture slides after-the-fact to fill in all of the gaps. Reviewing content between lectures and while completing problem sets is really helpful, but just attending lectures without more review can leave students a bit behind in terms of conceptual understanding. Sometimes the grading on problem sets felt a bit uneven between graders, but professors were incredibly available and willing to hear questions and concerns. BIOL 102 is definitely more challenging than BIOL 101 in terms of conceptual difficulty and thought organization, but there are tools available to further understanding.",
                "A strength of this course was how we covered very specific topics in depth rather than covering general information about cell bio. A weakness was that sometimes we werent given all of the basic information and vocabulary to understand a topic making it hard to comprehend it fully.",
                "I think this course should be paced slower and cover a little less content. I love all the additional resources, such as enrichment and review lessons.",
                "- the course could be more closely linked to the textbook\r\n- lecture content tended to be so specific that the links between topics weren't always clear",
                "I had lots of trouble focusing in the lectures because they were so heavy and went so fast I didnt have any time to process the information.",
                "It was a little hard to keep up in lecture, as there were many new terminologies and concepts that were not very clearly defined. Looking back at the recordings of the lectures definitely helped, which I wish would have been released earlier in the week, not on Saturday after the Monday and Wednesday classes. That being said, it was nice to see a professor that enjoyed what he did and the good support that Enrichment and other things offered.",
                "Strengths: kindness of instructors! Prof Mooseker is very funny while also being really informative and Prof Hartman is very supportive and gives clear explanations of concepts. Sunday review sessions w Mooseker were great and super helpful. I don't know why everyone didn't go to them; they were very good to be in. Finally, enrichment with Prof Hartman was great! Instructors were super receptive to feedback. What you put in, you get out. The organization of the course was good, and instructors were always happy to receive feedback.\r\nCons: organization of lectures. There was one lecture that I vividly remember, around Week 5, that almost everyone walked out confused after. I didn't like that, because many lectures were like that. I wish lectures were crystal clear in their content and the expectation of knowledge for each slide. The lectures also had too much content, where not all of it was entirely relevant. I'd also say that the monotony of psets reached its peak quickly. I would appreciate more ways to engage with the material. Finally, I did NOT like how long it took to get back PSET grades, because you didn't get your grades back before the next PSET was due, meaning that it was really hard to incorporate feedback or get a sense of your grade for a while in the course. TO my knowledge, there were a very small amount of graders, and I wonder if that could change in the future. I would appreciate seeing more resources for each module beyond the textbook to facilitate understanding after lectures.",
                "The problem sets were engaging and challenging, but the discussion sections felt like little more than verifying we'd read the papers and clearing up any confusion therein. There were some efforts, but it could have been expanded upon to really challenge us or lead to critical thought on scientific methods and findings,",
                "102 does not flow very logically from 101. In terms of difficulty and the material covered it was a steep jump. If the intro bio sequence is to be labeled as such, 102 should be restructured in such a way as to expand on or give more detail to the broad concepts covered in 101.",
                "Strengths: the teaching team did a good job making lectures interesting by including visual skits, helpful videos, in class activities such as peer discussions. I also really appreciated the recordings made available because I often get lost during lecture so it's super helpful to be able to watch the recordings and go back to parts that were confusing. \r\nWeaknesses: it can be difficult to follow lecture at times because it is very fast and lots of information to cover. I wish the recordings were released earlier in the week. I think the tool kits were too long, I would have liked to learn more about the biological concepts rather than the research methods, because students can take a lab class if they are interested in research techniques and it seems that the tools kits took away time that could have been spent on learning more about biological concepts.",
                "The lecture slides and recorded lectures provided were very helpful, but the lectures themselves were not very engaging and the lecture quizzes did not help much to solidify mastery of material as they were open-note. The collaborative problem sets and the journal-club style of discussion section were also helpful.",
                "Professor is a weakness-lectures unclear and disorganized, hard to follow",
                "I think this course provides a very detailed understanding of cell biology, however because of this it often does not feel like an introductory course. There seemed to be too much information to cover, such that the professor claimed we were behind on just the second day of class. We were even forced to skip Unit 2 at the beginning of the course and then most of the last unit towards the end of the course. We were expected to learn information that was completely new and also gain a very deep understanding of it within just a few days before we were asked to take quizzes on it each week. There were enrichment classes that were offered in addition to the course for anyone who felt they were unprepared for the material being taught in class, however this seems to defeat the purpose of BIOL 102 being and introductory biology course. By the end of the course, even those who had taken AP and IB biology courses in high school were wishing they had taken enrichment because the course material was too much to keep up with. The amount of information we were expected to learn made it difficult to really retain any deep understanding of the concepts after we had submitted the weekly quiz and PSET. The course also included two non-collaborative PSETs that accounted for a large portion of the final grade. Rather than being an effective tool for assessing knowledge obtained throughout the course, these only put honest students at a disadvantage against the large number of students who collaborated despite the warning, the same holds true for the non-collaborative lecture quizzes. \r\n\r\nI think this course could be improved by limiting the level of detail we are expected to know about each concept we are taught, and instead focus on developing an understanding of the various biological mechanisms work and the importance of their function. This would allow the course to still be challenging and teach all of the concepts that are necessary to gain an understanding of cell biology, while giving students a manageable amount of information to learn. Making all of the PSETs collaborative while maintaining the non-collaborative lecture quizzes could also help remove the large advantage many students gained by collaborating on assignments that were worth a large portion of the final grade.",
                "Strength - loved the professor. \r\nWeakened  dont feel like I god great feedback and the grading system was different per TA.",
                "Strengths: teaches you that science is open-ended; teaches you to think for yourself\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures can get a bit long, especially considering that it overlaps with lunchtime.\r\nImprovements: change the lecture time",
                "Prof. Mooseker is the strength of the course. He truly enjoys teaching and the skits he performed were just a reflection of how much he cared that we understood the material. \r\nThe weakness is that the course cramps a lot of material, and one is unprepared for that coming from biol101.",
                "The large lecture hall was not super conducive to engagement with content, and communication with the professor was difficult. The discussions sections are excellent, however.",
                "engagement",
                "The strengths are the discussion sections. I found those to be the highlight of the course. Another strength was the depth to which we learned about these topics but a weakness was the lack of communication on what we were supposed to know for the course. It was not articulated that the course was graded on a curve or that it was taught at a level higher than what we should understand and that made it very stressful at times.",
                "The transition from Bio 101 to Bio 102 was tough as the expectations were much higher. With that being said, those higher expectations meant that a deep understanding of the material was gained.",
                "More topic sentences and organization of lectures. It felt like an avalanche of information (which is normally fine, as long as there is some through-line).",
                "The strengths would be the extra time that Professor Hartman and other teaching scholars took to help the material be more digestible. The weaknesses are the lectures have too much information on the slides and breeze by too much material without proper context and explanation, especially when this is an intro course. I found it difficult to keep up with the material during lectures because I had not taken adequate biology courses before and therefore was not equipped with the right vocabulary for the speed of the lectures. As an intro course, I feel like this should not be the case. The course weakened my interest for biology.",
                "This went too quickly and was very difficult",
                "One strength of the course is that it forces the student to truly understand the material, in order to succeed in discussion section. Additionally, Dr. Mooseker is a very engaging lecturer, keeping the class interesting by doing skits and demonstrations. One weakness of the course is that it goes into great detail for each of the topics in a short amount of time, which can cause difficulty in keeping up during lecture.",
                "You learn a lot about the research that changed the bio field, but there was limited engagement with real-life visuals of the research methods.",
                "The psets came out late in the day on Wednesdays, so I could not work on them as long as I would have liked.",
                "It was not the strongest class overall. Much of the content was interesting, but the lectures moved quickly and were nearly impossible to keep up with, especially because they used lots of jargon that I was unfamiliar with. As an introductory class that assumes no background in biology, I wish there had been a more thorough explanation of the terminology used in lectures. Though I appreciated Professor Mooseker letting students ask questions during the lecture, only a very few students actually did so, and their questions were (from my perspective) usually not indicative of the average student's understanding of the material - often, I and many students I knew did not understand the questions themselves, let alone their answers. While I'm sure such complicated and leading questions were interesting, regularly hearing them discouraged me and other students from asking more basic questions. \r\n\r\nThe content itself was impressively detailed for a class of predominantly underclassmen, but I think I would have gained more from a less detailed, slower, and more broad overview of cellular biology, especially because this is an intro class in the fundamental biology sequence. Even after taking the class, I don't feel that I have a strong grounding in cellular biology as a whole; instead, I have a shaky understanding of a couple of topics in detail.\r\n\r\nThe problem sets and quizzes were also very complicated and difficult. Though I paid close attention and took thorough notes in lecture, I struggled on the quizzes that often had questions hinging on subtle differences in vocabulary that I missed despite paying attention. For the problem sets, I spent a lot of time reading directly from the lecture slides, as that was the only way I had a potential of answering the questions, but I didn't fully comprehend most of the content they were dealing with.\r\n\r\nThe strongest part of the class, to me, was the use of biology papers for the discussion section. Though at first I felt overwhelmed with reading actual scientific literature for the first time, I ultimately improved a great deal at reading and comprehending papers even when I was unfamiliar with the subject. This was made possible though the help of my Teaching Fellow. One suggestion regarding the papers is that the very first one we were given was one of the hardest to understand, while some of the easiest were read later. It might be a smoother introduction to scientific literature if the first assigned paper were easier.",
                "During lecture, there is a lot of information given to us, but sometimes it feels like a lot of it is unnecessary and can be condensed or simplified. It made it difficult to pay attention during lecture.",
                "Weaknesses were the lectures and strength were discussion sections",
                "The strengths of the class were Professor Moosker and Professor Hartman. Both are really great professors and work really hard to make sure every student has the resources to do well in the class. Everything that you need to complete the problems sets and weekly quizzes are found in the lectures, with the occasional supplement from the textbook. The weakness is just how fast we have to move through the material, which is hard to remedy without sacrificing other important material. Also, though the lecture slides are extremely helpful when it comes time to review for the quizzes and problem sets, during lecture it is a little overwhelming having so many slides and content on each slide. I think it would be helpful to maybe have the lecture slides to highlight the main points of the lecture in a more succinct manner than the lecture outline documents.",
                "I think the quizzes were helpful because they forced students to review the slides. PSETs were a little too difficult in my opinion, specifically because we would often see questions about things we barely covered, if at all. I do think they were a fair length considering the amount we covered each week. \r\n\r\nI think the biggest weakness was the way the content was presented. It was really hard to keep up with the content because it seemed like if you didn't immediately grasp one small fact at the beginning of the lecture, the entire rest of it would not make sense.",
                "The course covered important lab techniques in cell biology. However, the course's pace seemed rushed at times.",
                "The strengths of this course are definitely the lecturer Professor Mooseker's contagious joy for biology and inviting atmosphere for any questions as well as the inclusion of research papers to young students who have probably labeled the research papers as intimidating resources reserved for \"real scientists.\""

                "I would recommend this course to other students on the condition that more organization is introduced into the course structure. It was sometimes impossible to follow along with the slides and presentation as they were being presented in lecture, and I think having a clear outline and study sheet with the main concepts\/red questions could solve this problem.",
                "Yes--but only if you have a strong background in biology\/research. The incredible volume\/speed of material covered, inordinate amount of jargon used and assumed understanding of high-level topics in biology and basic science research makes the course an unpleasant experience for those without prior background.",
                "Absolutely not. As an FGLI student, I struggle with an imposter's syndrome that makes it extremely difficult to be confident even with academic validation. This class almost felt as if it was meant to discourage student from pursuing a major connected to biology (I'm sure this is not true but it is how I felt throughout it). I honestly believe it is unfair that this class is a prerequisite for the biology related majors when it has such a poor structure and way of introducing biology. (Especially since it is promoted as a class in which a background of AP Bio is not needed but it is not taught in a way that is accessible to those who did not take AP Bio.)",
                "No. Unless you have to take this for your major or for premed, don't. Take some of the other bio electives instead.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. Unless it's required as a prereq, do not take this course! It is so hard to understand the content due to the way it is taught. Lectures are incomprehensible and experiment-based.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you have to take it.",
                "Yes! I learned so much about cell biology in this course. Although this course covers lots of material, the teaching team provides lots of support. The weekly assignments (lecture quizzes and PSETs) help focus your learning to the key concepts and help you master the course material.",
                "Well, you're likely looking at this class because it is a prereq. There are very few students who elect to take this course. I didn't mind it but I know some people who spent a lot of time on the psets and others who had a horrible time trying to pay attention to the lectures.",

                "I guess most of you here don't have the option but... Take it if you're ready to be intellectually challenged and REALLY put an effort into learning and thinking. It will be a big leap from BIOL 101, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
                "No. Only take this class if you absolutely have to..",
                "I imagine very few people are taking this course for the sake of it, so with that being said, I would say this is a fine course and you don't have too much to worry about. Mooseker is extremely sweet and funny, but it's almost impossible to follow his lectures. After the first week, you'll realize you can get through the pset by just reading lecture slides, and you might be better off. The psets are hard but really engaging and interesting. Probably most-all the learning I did in the class was through completing these. So I'd say don't be too worried about the class, you'll do fine, you'll just feel like you could be learning way more than you are.",
                "I would recommend the course to those that need to take it for a major or for the pre-med track, as it's essential, and it is possible to succeed in the class. I would just warn that there is a very high workload and there is a steep learning curve coming out of Bio 101. Just be sure to make use of office hours and spend time going through the lecture notes to make sure that you're really understanding the material.",
                "Only if you need it for your major or for premed requirements. Since this class is needed to take other classes in the MCDB department, I would say take another cell bio class like MCDB 205 afterwards to actually get a comprehensive understanding and foundation in the area. If you credit D fail this course, it would actually be a great techniques course, especially if you're interested in doing lab work.",

                "I would only recommend this course to another student to fulfill a pre-req. The topics that we covered were very niche, and though the class was doable, it did not feel like an introductory course at all. Im honestly not sure how much of the material I will be able to recall or apply later down the line.",
                "I would recommend this course if Hartman had more of an active role than Mooseker. Mooseker is nice, but he takes off during the lecture. The lecture is solely review, not for learning. Hartman was great. The course would benefit from having Mooseker explain the toolkit (the laboratory material) and Hartman lecture on everything else.",
                "I would definitely not recommend this, especially if Mooseker is teaching. Miserable time and I learned next to nothing. If you need it as a requirement, try to take it with a different professor.",
                "Yes, it is a good cell biology intro course. I learned that I definitely don't want to go into cell biology, but it was a good class. The material is super nuanced and I often wasn't sure what I needed to know for the PSets. That said, there are a ton of support systems in place to offer clarification on content and help with assignments (seriously, go to peer tutor hours).",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in any stem related field!",
                "I would recommend to someone who is interested in biology. If they werent interested in bio, it would be a very dry and strenuous course.",
                "I think I would recommend this course to students who have a strong foundation in biology and are very committed to it. It is not for those who are not willing to commit time and energy to this course.",
                "if you have to complete the bio sequence then sure - its doable",
                "The answer to these are always the same. If you need to take the class, then yes absolutely, but if you don't need it for a requirement, please don't.",
                "Yes, as it is required for many majors. You learn a lot in this course, I could see my improvement over the semester.",
                "Yes, if you're required to take it for your major \/ pre-med. It's mostly enjoyable.",
                "Yes if you are thinking about majoring in something that requires it.",
                "No for 102 specifically. Not well taught.",
                "Yes, if you have an interest in bio.",
                "I would, of course, for pre-med\/science-affiliated people. If you get past the lectures and actually get to understand the material, it's pretty cool. But there's a bunch of support I think for students if you are struggling. Also please please please go to discussion section and take notes.",
                "You likely need this course anyways for premed or major, so no choice. But it is very much a challenge.",
                "Unfortunately, I would not recommend it, but many have to anyways because it is a requirement to their major, but the class itself is extremely hard to follow and students are not prepared for the extreme change in difficulty from moving from Biol 101 to 102.",
                "Sure, it was pretty interesting but also pretty hard concepts-wise so just be prepared for that.",
                "Maybe not",
                "Unless this class is required, do not take it. There are far more engaging classes on biology that you will find easier and more applicable.",
                "I would recommend for anyone considering a career in the life sciences.",
                "This course is a pre req for lots of STEM majors and so oftentimes students have to take this course either way. I think that Professor Mooseker's lectures are hard to follow and so for that reason, I would recommend taking this course with a different professor.",
                "Yes, but perhaps less enthusiastically than for most of my other classes",
                "Yea if u need to take it but if not no",
                "Yes, as long as they have an interest in cell biology, otherwise not super interesting to go through",
                "this is a must-take course because it goes through the basics of what a cell is and how it is made. but be warned: it is FAST. there will be a lot of words you don't understand. put in the work outside of class to make the most of it. pre-read the lecture slides (which I did not do and therefore was lost during the lectures). ask questions without restraint.",
                "Take it if you have to. It's certainly not the worst course ever, and if you put time and effort into the course, you can do well. Take with Hartman if you can.",
                "If you are a STEM mature absolutely, if not take another SC Credit",
                "no",
                "I would recommend this course to another student that has to take the biology sequence as a prerequisite. However, this is not an introductory course, as you dive headfirst into many advanced biological concepts. The class is a big change from BIOL 101",
                "Only if it is required for their major.",
                "I would if they are willing to put up with the challenge!",
                "I think this course does a fairly good job of relaying the skills any student planning to engage with biology will need. The cell is the fundamental building block of life, so understanding its structures at a collegiate level (as taught in 102) is useful. The sophistication and commitment to the class, however, prevents me from recommending the course to students that do not plan to major in a natural science.",
                "No, I was often very confused about what I was supposed to know.",
                "no, unless you have to for a major or something",
                "-Yes. Biol 102 was more enjoyable and better organized than Biol 101.",
                "Yes, if you need it, but it is a step up from BIOL 101.",
                "Yes, it is overall a good course.",
                "not unless its required. it is NOT an intro biology class!!",
                "Not unless they are fulfilling a major requirement. This class was quite challenging for most people I talked to. I wouldnt take it unless I had to.",
                "Yes if you are interested in cell bio in the first place.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student if it was not necessary for their major.",
                "good intro to biology",
                "Yes if they need it for a requirement, but no if not. Everything is graded very harshly and it is quite difficult.",
                "Not particularly, only if you are pre-med or if you are planning on majoring in a biological\/chemical STEM area.",
                "Yes, it was very well taught and extremely useful.",
                "Yes, this course was very interesting and engaging and I enjoyed it far more than Biology 101. I would recommend this course to anybody interested in biology or scientific principles and research.",
                "If you're willing to make the commitment or need the course as a requirement for a major or pre-med, then sure. I wouldn't say it was the most enjoyable experience because the class is advertised as an introduction to cellular biology, but you are expected to know things significantly beyond the scope of what I would consider a general understanding of cellular biology. In fact, the class focuses heavily on teaching students cellular biology through experiments, which makes the process even more confusing for students that haven't gotten the basics down. I personally took more than one biology course in high school, which made it easier to work through the course, but I had several classmates who understandably felt that the course expected you to know way too much, and I'm not sure why an introductory biology course is so heavily focused on experimental techniques rather than thoroughly giving students an understanding of the biological concepts. I think the experiments were interesting and undoubtedly reinforced several of the course's concepts, but they should not be the only medium for introducing important concepts. In other words, your experience with this class will vary heavily on how much biology you already know.",
                "I would recommend it if there was a different lecturer.",
                "Yeah",
                "If you want a harder bio class, sure. Or if its a prerequisite. Otherwise, no.",
                "I would likely not recommend this course. It is required for the bio majors, so you probably don't have a choice. The class was not very engaging and I did not learn cell biology well from the course.",
                "If you have reason to take the intro bio course, for sure. I took it not because I'm premed or a bio major but because I wanted to give science another chance after poor high school teachers -- I'm not sure this was the course for that!",
                "Not unless it is required",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless you have to take this for you major or you are pre-med. If you are someone who is just interested in biology, but do not have to take it, TAKE ANOTHER COURSE. This class is filled with stressful pre-meds.",
                "Yes, this is a necessary course for anyone considering studying biology or any related field.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Biol 101 was a great course, but in Biol 102, you have to be a bit more independent, which I personally think is a good thing.",
                "This would depend on the individual. For someone that does not want to study biology or need the credit, I feel like this is not a great class to take. This is because much of this class is very specific and geared towards those interested in molecular biology. However, for someone that is certain they want to study biology, I think that this class is helpful for gaining a basis in understanding the field as a whole and learning how to read scientific papers.",
                "All of the students taking this course likely must to satisfy pre-requisites, so even though I wouldn't particularly recommend this course to other students, other students will inevitably take the course for their major requirements. I would, however, recommend this course to someone with a solid foundation in cell bio who hopes to learn even more of the minute details about particular organelles.",
                "No I would not. It is a very difficult intro level class and the problem sets and quizzes are extremely difficult. You also have to do a fair bit of self teaching (not studying) to understand the content of the class well enough to get a decent grade.",
                "Yes, Im overall a good course.",
                "Yes",
                "Not particularly, unless its required, and the research methods might be useful.",
                "I would to students able to put in a lot of additional time outside of lectures. I would advise that students schedule time each week to take advantage of multiple sources like office hours and textbook readings, in addition to lectures. I think solely relying on lectures wouldnt work well.",
                "No, unless it is a requirement. The transition from 101 to 102 is extremely stark, 102 being significantly more difficult.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in general biology because it is important to understand how life works at the cellular level. If someone is a biology major (or is interested in biophysics), then they have to take this class in order to progress through their course plan.",
                "Not particularly. I came to Yale planning to major in biology and so far the intro bio sequence has turned me off the subject.",
                "It depends on the friend. If they are genuinely interested in biology and want to make it part of their study I would absolutely recommend it. If theyre just looking to fill a DR then I would not.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is a prereq for a lot of majors and programs. Although 102 is harder than 101, there are a lot of ways to get help and do well. The content is interesting albeit sometimes difficult. This course will also help you become a better scientist and researcher as we work with scientific papers each week. Taking this course and evaluating how you feel about it will tell you a lot about what you hope to do in the future.",
                "If a student was unsure about whether or not they wanted to pursue bio, I would recommend this course. I'd take the first two courses in the sequence and re-evaluate whether or not they still have both an interest and the time (to do a lot of review outside of class, especially if they haven't taken AP Bio).",
                "BIOL 102 is an interesting but relatively challenging course, with lectures which can be hard to follow but a grading organization which rewards spending more time with content to fortify your understanding of cellular processes. This course is definitely more challenging than BIOL 101 in terms of conceptual difficulty and thought organization, but there are tools available to further your understanding and the emphasis on problem sets makes doing well in the class a possibility with sufficient investment. Professors are available to discuss concepts and general questions with students, and I feel like I have a better background in experimental methods than before I started the course.",
                "Yes I would because I was able to get better at reading and understanding journal articles in addition to experimental design relating to topics we covered.",
                "Yes, this course allows you understand more than just the foundations of cell biology. You explore the research techniques necessary to study it.",
                "Yes, if required for your studies. Otherwise, I'd say to try a different sequence of courses to quench your desire to learn about biological sciences",
                "Not unless you need to take it (which is required if you're pre-med or a prospective BME\/MB&B\/MCDB major). I didn't feel like I understood cell biology any better than when I first started. Prof. Mooseker himself said that this course is only ~25% cell biology; much of it was focused on training us to understand and analyse scientific papers. If you really want to take a cell biology course, consider one in the MCDB department.",
                "Only if you need it, it's not a very fun course because it is so easy to get lost in lecture and then you're just sitting there with no clue what the prof is saying.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who needs it as a pre-requisite for upper-level biology classes but probably not someone who is just looking for a general introduction to cell biology. I think that if you are engaged enough with the course, you can gain valuable skills for future courses, but for people interested in biology, a broader course would probably be more appropriate.",
                "Maybe",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student because it does feel like an introductory biology course. It is extremely difficult to actually gain a solid understanding of the biologicaly concepts because there is so much information to keep up with that you can only try to understand however much is necessary to complete the lecture quizzes and PSETs.",
                "I wouldnt. I am not a biology major and this class made me super stressed and was super time consuming. I found it hard to find time to work on my economics homework.",
                "Yes as you are here because the bio sequence is a requirement and there is no need to discourage you :)",
                "Not a bad course. I did legitimately learn about many exciting and curiosity-piquing features of cells. You have to be interested in biology and willing to put in a fair bit of work to enjoy the course",
                "yes as a pre-requsite",
                "I don't know if I would. I do think it's interesting and vital to those who need it as a prereq but otherwise I don't think I'd recommend it.",
                "I would only recommend this course if its a prerequisite for another class. This isn't what I would call a \"fun\" class or a class I would recommend to a non STEM major student, but given that this class is required, I guess I would recommend it.",
                "I would not unless you need it for a prerequisite.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, because it begins to build the critical reading skills needed for reading scientific literature, and introduces research techniques that will be important in practical application in a lab.",
                "Yes, this class really teaches you to think like a scientist.",
                "If they would a premed student I would.",
                "Definitely a helpful course",
                "Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this course, even understanding that it's required for biology majors.",
                "Yes, it's a great course if it is required for your major. If not, the material is so specific I don't think it would be of much use to someone who doesn't need it.",
                "Yes",
                "I can guess that nearly everyone taking this class has to because of different pre-requisites, but as far as mandatory classes go, this one is very enjoyable and not that difficult to manage. You get a lot of real world experimental techniques that I have already found invaluable as I'm starting to get into research. You hear a lot of things from past students about the intro bio sequence, but in my experience, the professors do a really great job of offering a perspective into biology that is much more engaging and useful than AP Biology. It is really easy to do well in this course if you just stay on top of the letures.",
                "I would recommend this course for students interested in learning about the tools and experimental designs used by biological researchers.",
                "Yes, it really focuses on the aspect of learning to understand, rather than learning to achieve a certain benchmark, and the professors keep you engaged to increase confidence through the accumulation of knowledge."
