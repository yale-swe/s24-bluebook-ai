                "Strengths: very flexible style that allowed for students to be creative and interact freely with the texts. The selected texts were all amazing and the discussion was very friendly and encouraging while still presenting an intellectual challenge.\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: Professor Connolly is great--one of the most encouraging and kind professors i've had! Reading list is great survey of major works of prose poetry.\r\nWeaknesses: The structure of the seminar meetings--presentation, mini-lecture, individual discussion in breakout rooms, and regrouping--got a bit repetitive over time, though. I think the course would benefit from some more variation in structure.",
                "Pretty much everything was great; the one weakness is that at times there was too much reading. The books are great, but the few times where we were asked to read 200+ pages of French poetry in a week was a bit much. However, to Professor Connolly's credit, nothing about the class is structured to punish you for not reading enough, as long as you've read a decent amount. So he is likely aware of this fact.",

The material is absolutely beautiful to read and engage with. You have so much support from the professor to do well and succeed in all your papers. The small size of the section really helped to have a hands on engagement with the books as well as with the professor and your peers. My favorite class at Yale!",

Even if you are unsure as to whether you are interested in the prose poem in particular, I still highly recommend it because you will become familiar with some major figures in modern French literature.",

                "Yes I absolutely would! It's a very laid-back course and you don't need to have a background in french literature or poetry to learn and participate actively. The course is also very flexible and you have a lot of freedom on the assignments to add your own interpretation. Overall a great course!",
                "Yes--great course. I don't think prose poetry is necessarily for me, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the course readings and discussions!",
                "Yes! If you have an interest\/ need the credit for a major or certificate, Prof Connolly is a great professor and not to be missed.",
