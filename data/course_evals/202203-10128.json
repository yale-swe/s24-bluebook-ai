                "Strengths: The labs were very fun and I loved how we could see how they connect to real-world BME applications! Overall the teaching staff and fellows were extremely responsive and helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The labs were sometimes quite overwhelming and unclear - a good example is the EMG and respiratory labs. Even when the protocol was followed, sometimes the data would not be clear and would be very hard to analyze, which made completing the lab reports difficult. Addtionally, for the respiratory lab, the questions in the lab report were quite unclear which resulted in many points being deducted due to misinterpretation of the questions.",
