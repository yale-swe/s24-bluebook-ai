Essentially, I got more comfortable with the ability to structure complex ideas in the target language (spanish) both in convention and thematically.",

                "Strengths: Diversity in homework assignments, ample opportunities to showcase your understanding of the material, engaging, fun asynchronous days, creative projects\r\nWeaknesses: Too much time spent on Unit 1 about witches",
                "I feel strengths of the course were the unit topics. Each unit had very informative and powerful topics, I liked how students were able to learn and reflect on really important topics. A weakness of this course is the grading process. Having no leniency for late work, no way for students to improve grades, no extra credit, and no test corrections does not allow for students that deeply care about the class to improve. I do not feel as if the grading process fairly reflects effort, dedication, and care that students dedicated to SPAN 140.",
                "Having work everyday is annoying but its doable",
                "Focus more on the mechanical components of the language and less on the cultural units.",
                "Strength: very discussion-based course requiring students to work together on texts constantly. \r\nWeaknesses: I don't think I learned anything new. We were touching on different themes but we not making progress on vocabulary, grammar, or all the other things that matter in Spanish. I feel like at least some new concepts could be introduced but all we did we spend an entire semester going back to the same themes.",
                "Sometimes the class can be overwhelming due to the fact that class meets everyday, and there is not much wiggle room for error or tardiness. Though there is some, I believe this course should be more forgiving because the sheer number of tasks, assignment, and overall commitment required for this course.",
                "There were many opportunities to practice my skills in class with the writing activities and class discussions. The homework assignments were also very effective for improving my skills. I think there could be more units throughout the semester because the topics became repetitive once we discussed them so deeply.",
                "The course felt a little random. The topics were interesting, but we spent a lot of time on witches, which turned into conversations about feminism. We then completely switched gears into talking about Indigenous communities. I got a little lost on some of those topics (indigenismo, for example.) We then switched gears again into an extremely short unit on fake news, and then read a play that didn't seem super connected to the idea of fake news. I think more organization and cohesion between the units would have been helpful. There is also a lot of group work, which can be a fun and educational experience, and it was fun to work with other students, but because we had limited freedom over who we could work with, group projects often ended up being stressful."

Before enrolling, I was planning to continue Spanish classes and receive the Spanish Proficiency Certificate. After taking the class I felt discouraged because there weren't many resources for students to improve after assignments were graded. Unfortunately, I felt as if improvement and effort were not reflected well in the course.",

                "Honestly, I wouldn't. This is not only because of this class. But I have yet to have an experience in any Spanish course that I have taken at Yale that I would subject another student to. In comparison to the Japanese courses that I took, I did not enjoy my time in any course underneath the Spanish department. It is not well-structured.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I know I improved my skills through the many tasks and assessments.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. I found the lack of accommodations extremely frustrating. The late policy was the harshest I have ever experienced, and it often felt as though I lost points on assignments not from her critiquing my language use, but for factors not related to Spanish, for example, length of exams or designs for projects."
