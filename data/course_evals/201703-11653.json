   "comments": [
    "I learnt how to write a grant as well as many important hallmarks of cancer.",
    "I learned a whole lot about the cellular mechanisms behind cancer while still reviewing the basics of Biology. Gained valuable skills on interpreting and analyzing research papers and writing my own grant proposal. This whole class is strucutured to prepare me to apply for research in the future.",
    "I learned how to effectively read a scientific paper, and I learned about each major area of cancer research. This class was excellent in that it takes you through the history of cancer; you begin reading older papers and work your way up to more recent research. With this structure, the material is more interesting and it makes you appreciate the long history of cancer research. The most important skill I gained in this course was learning how to write a grant proposal. As a future scientist, this is an extraordinarily important skill that I was very happy to attain.",
    "I learned so much about cancer biology that I did not know before. I also developed my abilities to read and interpret scientific papers (even poorly written ones!). I also learned a lot about being a science\/STEM student.",
    "I learned an incredible amount of cancer biology over the course of the semester; I never imagined that I would learn so much in such a short amount of time. I learned so many things relating to biological processes in normal human cells, as well as changes that lead to cancer cells. I have always been interested in cancer, and this course just increased my interest and fascination every single day. I also learned many valuable skills that I will use throughout my academic career at Yale; I learned how to critically read scientific research papers, apply knowledge of various topics to understand a new concept, and write a research grant proposal. All of these skills will be very useful to me, since I am on the pre-med track, will major in science, and continue to take STEM classes throughout my time at Yale. This class taught me so much and I wouldn't trade any of the knowledge or skills that I developed over the course of this semester for anything.",
    "I gained a greater understanding of cancer biology and learned how to read scientific papers and write a grant proposal.",
    "I learned as much as a person can learn in a semester about cancer at a biological and molecular level. I learned to reason my way through causes of cancer and possible cures and experiments that could lead to a cure. Also, I learned how to write a grant.",
    "learning to read biomedical research and clinical papers, also Sandy teaches you how to write a grant! He also talks a lot about MD\/phD if that sounds remotely interesting",
    "This course taught me about the mechanisms of cancer while reinforcing general biology concepts. It also prepared me to read scientific papers and write in a scientific manner.",
    "In this course, I developed the skills of critical, scientific thinking, reading a primary research paper, writing a research grant proposal, and I gained a lot of knowledge on cancer.",
    "I learned how to apply my knowledge in a different context and how to read really challenging scientific papers.",
    "I learned a lot about cancer biology, the history of cancer, and developed a mechanistic understanding of many cancer pathways.",
    "I learned how to analyze scientific and clinical papers as well as gained insights into the complex mechanisms of cancer."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved this course and the professor's engagement, as well as how much he cared about his students. I think the only thing that could be improved is for the final paper, there should be a more clear and descriptive document outlining what is expected and how to write the paper, since the example papers varied so much, students became a bit confused as to what the grant should look like.",
    "The class was well-organized and structured. Even for a student like me who has a very poor Biology background, I can easily catch up and understand what the professor was saying. The professor ensures that all the students understand the concepts.",
    "This is a very strong course. It is difficult, but 100% worth the time and effort. The biggest strength of this course is the professor, Dr. Chang. He is an amazing professor and engaging lecturer.",
    "This course is nearly perfect.",
    "This course did a phenomenal job in presenting a variety of topics that are very prevalent and important in cancer biology. I loved how the course was able to connect a lot of the topics presented in a fluid way so that we could easily put a lot of our knowledge together and see how everything was connected, rather than learning everything in disjointed pieces. I also love the integration of scientific research papers throughout the course; I think it was very helpful to have to read a paper and do a problem set each week, because it not only helped to solidify the material learned in class, but it also developed our skills of being able to read major scientific research papers. If there is one thing that could be improved, I think that it would be helpful to have a lecture at the beginning of the course giving an overview of important biological concepts and terminology so that all students would have a similar level of understanding going into the rest of the course.",
    "Strengths: Professor Sandy Chang is great and really takes the effort to get to know each and every one of his students. You get a great introduction to cancer biology and have the opportunity to read and analyze scientific literature. The course is well-organized and you will learn a lot! Only weakness is probably the fact that the class can be fast-paced and a little difficult in the beginning for those who have not had a ton of exposure to biology.",
    "It is a very difficult course if a student has not taken a more advanced course in biology, but overall, I see nothing but strengths for this course. It was entertaining, interesting, and the small environment made it really easy to work together.",
    "good course",
    "This course does an excellent job of providing an overview of cancer and some of the many ways it develops and attacks within the body. It challenges students with reading scientific papers and balances lectures with class discussion. It was a great course.",
    "I only see strengths. This was a very fun course with an amazing teacher. This course wasn't about memorizing information; it was about really understanding the material and being able to discuss.",
    "I thought the class was excellent. Some strengths include the emphasis on learning how to read papers, the engagement of Dean Chang with his students, and the overall structure of the class.",
    "Strengths: Course was well-structured to teach the different hallmarks of cancer. Dean Chang was an excellent instructor and helped clarify confusing things in office hours.\r\nWeaknesses: The scientific literature can be really dense and hard to understand if you are not comfortable\/familiar with the molecular biology lab techniques."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I strongly recommend this course! Also, a tip, if you are not placed into this course by the lottery, email the professor ASAP and he will add you to his waitlist. People will drop, so it is highly likely you will get into this course as long as you email him quickly.",
    "Totally recommend this class to anyone interested in STEM becuase it not only prepares us to become a literate science researcher, it also prepares us for our future career in the science field.",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to anyone who is interested in science, particularly if you plan to go into research. Dr. Chang is a wonderful resource who is able and willing to help set you up with labs and fellowships. The class is amazing both for its material and the opportunities it supplies.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It is absolutely amazing. Prof. Chang is the greatest. You will learn a ton and have fun doing it.",
    "I would absolutely, without hesitation, recommend this course to another student! This was the best course I have ever taken throughout the entirety of my academic career! I loved every single minute of class, even when I didn't understand the material being presented, and I always looked forward to coming to class because I knew that I would leave knowing something that I did not know before. Any time one of my friends asks me about this course, I always tell them about how interesting everything is and how rewarding this class is in a variety of ways. I am so incredibly thankful that I had the opportunity to take this course and to learn everything that I did, and I would highly recommend this course to anyone in a heartbeat.",
    "Yes! This is a phenomenal course for anyone interested in science. You will develop skills such as reading scientific literature and writing research grants, and you will also learn a myriad of lab techniques. All of this will be directly applicable to working in a biology lab. Furthermore, Sandy is an incredible professor and is always trying to find and provide as many opportunities as he can for his students to gain a greater exposure to scientific research.",
    "Yes, especially if they are interesting in Molecular Biology or anything of the sort. It is a super interesting class, and even if they are looking to challenge themselves in science, this is an excellent course.",
    "great course for those interested in cancer! honestly my favorite course my first semester by far. not for people who don't have a foundation in biology; he talks about a lot about the core biology behind cancer mechanisms. sandy also is really receptive to meals and just talking about life, so he really makes the course great.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The material is interesting and is presented in such a way that it requires you to think in different ways. The course could seem challenging, but it is extremely rewarding.",
    "This course was extremely helpful, highly informative, and incredibly interesting freshman seminar. I highly recommend it to any first-year interested in cancer, research, or a future in medicine.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is interesting and relevant to everyone because cancer is so extensive and touches everyone in some way. Dean Chang is a great professor and lectures are in-depth and well prepared.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Although this course was challenging, I enjoyed it very much. Dr. Chang is an amazing teacher and knows the material very well.",
    "Yes. If you are at all interested in science of cancer, this class will be one of the best classes you take at Yale. I thoroughly enjoyed every single class period.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in molecular biology and reading scientific literature."
