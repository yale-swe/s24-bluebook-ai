It was clear from the bonus project that he also cares about your understanding of the material and encourages interest in how heat transfer applies to the real world. The workload is also not bad at all, there are no weekly psets (8 psets I think?) and the exams are fair if you review practice/recitation problems (as someone who didn't do too well in the midterm)."
