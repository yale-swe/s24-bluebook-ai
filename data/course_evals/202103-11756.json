I also learned to look for image patterns and concrete writing techniques in personal, profile, and humor essays from publications like The New Yorker, The Atlantic, and the Washington Post.",
                "I learned what exactly makes a modern essay, how to write about personal experiences and draw larger conclusions from them, how to better critique peer writing, and how to both close read and draw out larger themes from essays.",
                "I learned how to slow down and closely read pieces of work to identify the subtlest of effects someone's words can create. I also learned different styles of writing to induce certain effects on the reader.\r\n\r\nThis class helped me to develop the skill of writing so that people can better understand the point I am trying to get across.",
                "In this course, I bettered my ability to perform close readings of passages that corresponded to the unit's theme, learned new techniques that aided my ability to write better essays, and bettered my overall writing ability through a few different formats of writing, and improved my ability to pull pieces of a work that corresponded to a theme or complex question that was related to the content of the passage.",
                "Learned more about the flow of writing and how to better articulate what I want to say",
                "By taking this class this semester, I improved my writing skills immensely. I truly learned how to \"show rather than tell\" through the assigned essays. In addition, I developed a deep interest in creative writing and look forward to take more classes in the future.",
                "Throughout the semester my writing drastically improved. Not only did my work improve, but so did my confidence. I learned to have fun on the page and use it just as an artist would a canvas. I also learned to be a better editor, and thoroughly enjoyed the workshop periods."

                "One of the biggest strengths of this course was the way Professor Shirkhani conducted workshops. I really enjoyed receiving feedback from each one of my classmates through email beforehand and then being able to discuss specific points in greater detail in class.",
                "I thought the selection of readings was great, the classroom dynamic was engaging, and the amount of work was perfect. I thought the breakdown of the types of essays we practiced writing was comprehensive, and I felt like I was exposed to a broad variety of styles of essay writing. I also always looked forward to the days dedicated to discussing peer writing.",
                "As far as I could tell, there were not many weaknesses to this class. I thought the pieces that we read as examples for each unit were good educational tools to demonstrate different ways of writing to get certain effects. We wrote a good number of essays as well. I think being reviewed by the class on different essays was a great way to decipher where everyone's writing was and how it could improve. The draft being reviewed before the final essay is due is a great way to help me review my work to make the first drafts even better because it helps me learn to look at my essays with a critical eye.",
                "Strengths: Some strengths of the course include the depth and breadth of examples used to portray the different units of the course, the great feedback from the course, the peer-review workshop process, and the conversations about the works that better everyone's understanding of the content. Weaknesses: A weakness of the course is that grading seems unclear at times because there's no real rubric or expectation and that not a lot of writing practice is actually performed in class.",
                "I think this course works really well as it addresses the modern essay by both reading and writing. This way, we read examples of essays for homework, discussed them during class, and then had to write our own essays. This way, we had clear examples and guidance on how to approach the prompts/units.  I think the workshop style of this class also allows its students to become better readers in order to provide good feedback along with becoming good listeners by taking other people's advice into consideration.",
                "Overall, English 120 was fantastic. As a foundational course, it really set the tone for English courses at Yale and has made me feel much more prepared for the coming semesters. My only critique would be how long we spent in class focusing on certain short pieces - I wish we had been able to get through every item of material."

                "Yes, its a good course to improve the students modern/personal essay writing both in quality and efficiency in writing essays, as we wrote a ~1500 word essay nearly every other week.",
                "Absolutely. This class taught me about so many different genres and styles of writing all in one semester. Through reading many different authors' exemplary works and through editing my own and my peers' essays through collaboration and discussion, I was able to improve my writing techniques in a supportive and rigorous environment. It was a very intense but productive course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, whether they were planning on majoring in English or not. I think that everyone can benefit from and enjoy this class. It was engaging and interesting and bettered my writing.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in becoming a better writer. I think, almost regardless of where someone's writing is, there writing can improve after this course, purely from the peer review type process people's essays undergo. Plus, it is a very enjoyable class. The material we read as homework was interesting, and the class dynamic was lively.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student if they're looking to engage with readings from well-known writers, improve their essay writing, and learn new techniques that allow the student to better express themselves in different varieties of writing. It's a good way to get a WR credit and while the readings can be long and it is not an easy class by any means, it's worth your time.",
                "yes absolutely, as a stem major this class was so refreshing. definitely challenging but would 100% recommend",
                "Yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a good class to choose as a writing requirement and will improve their writing and reading skills. Class discussions were always interesting. In addition, the writing assignments also felt therapeutic in a sense, allowing you to reflect on past experiences and translate them into a narrative.",
