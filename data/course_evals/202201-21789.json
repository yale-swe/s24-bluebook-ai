                "Professor Moscarini is the best. He is hilarious (instead of consumption versus leisure, it's studying versus partying), and he is an expert in the field. Macroeconomics is one of my favorite areas of study now thanks to him. The way he builds up the course material from micro foundations is so logical and compelling. His slides are exquisite as well. Also, he always provided more graduate-level material if we were interested (for example, for monopolisitic competition with varieties, instead of taking large sums like we did, you can think of it as an integral over a continuum). Furthermore, our TF Ziqing was great. Her sections are the only ones I have ever voluntarily attended while at Yale.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting material, and even though it was math-heavy, it was illuminating to see how it could be applied to the real world\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "I think some of the lectures, particularly on money, could be clearer. While the course teaches theory, I think more time could be spent on going to examples and responding to critiques of models. We did spend some time on this in class and I enjoyed those moments the most.",
                "Strengths: I felt like the course was very structured and student-friendly. I had moments. wehreI didn't know how to apply lecture concepts to problem sets, but both Professor Moscarini and the TF's (Ziqing's) office hours were really helpful and instrumental in my understanding. I also gained a lot from Ziqing's discussion sections, in which we went over past problem sets and extensions of in-class concepts.\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like the lecture material moved really fast sometimes! I would have preferred writing on a blackboard, because when the professor did end up doing that, I followed the material a lot better. It could even be a thing where the concepts themselves are on screen, but the actual workings of math are written out on blackboard rather than on iPad. I also felt like the first part of the course was a little bit fast and a bit of a diving in deep immediately... which was perhaps a little intimidating for some people. But overall I felt it was a really enjoyable class!",
                "Weaknesses - no student support at all, teaching was fast and slides were often 60-70 slides long, really hard to follow",
                "Professor Moscarini is a wonderful guy who's always willing to help answer your questions. But, he could improve his teaching style by writing on the board and showing/writing-out the steps behind how we arrive at certain economic and mathematical and graphical conclusions. He uses the slides as a rough script, but just takes the information on the slides as given, never showing how we arrive there. Professor Moscarini could also improve by recapping the day's lessons at the end of class, and reviewing the previous class's material at the start of the next class, because he moves through content so quickly that it's easy to lose the bigger picture and retain information. The lecture content is very minimally related to the problem sets and exams -- the lectures are more abstract and economic, the psets/exams are more mathematical. It would help if there was more of a connection between lectures and pset/exams; the TF tries to do so in section, but most of section is taken up in reviewing past homework.",
                "Great class. Upset with testing (probably biased though!)\r\n\r\nI studied so hard for exams and felt I wouldve done the same without any practice (and better if I hadnt been sick). I did not feel they reflected the course material.",
                "I think we learned a lot, but I would personally prefer not to learn off slides."

                "Yes, absolutely. If you want to walk away from an economics course with an actual sense of how economists think about the issues, take this course. You'll appreciate the insights that economics has to offer and understand the nuance and care it takes to actually use economics.",
                "no",
                "Yeah, I'd recommend it! I'm an Econ-Math major who is thinking about grad school though, so there's some perspective involved. I felt like this course was a lot more logically focused than what I'd heard about intermediate macro, so it would be good or someone who wants to logically be able to reason through shifts and their effects on the macroeconomy. I also think that it's nice to just have a smaller class where you can easily get your questions answered by either the TF/professor. The problem sets are doable and don't take up too much time, but I would recommend doing them always and on time because a) you can't drop any and b) it saves you a LOT of time during exam season. I would recommend studying a little bit every week because elsewise it's easy to forget concepts from a few weeks prior.",
                "If you can, take the intermediate sequence",
                "Yes, I absolutely would. This class is more mathematical and advanced than ECON 122, but it isn't unmanageable. The course is fascinating and Professor Moscarini is an amazing instructor.",
                "Absolutely- learned a lot of macroeconomics. The class is well-organized and the notes clear. The small size of the class as compared to 122 also really improves the experience.",
