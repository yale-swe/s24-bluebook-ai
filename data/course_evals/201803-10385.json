   "comments": [
    "Class time was always used efficiently. Also, the instructor made us feel comfortable during class because a military environment can be very stressful at times. If we didn't know a procedure, we were helped through it instead of yelled at.",
    "One strength is that this teaches interesting materializing slides, hands on activities, and videos.\r\nOne improvement could be to make each class time longer. We are almost always going over class time, making me late to me next class.",
    "Lt Col Snow is a good lecturer, but the topics themselves were a bit dry.",
    "Strengths: great and applicable information to first year cadets\r\nWeaknesses: faulty technology impacted some lesson plans",
    "The course was good at easing in First Year students into the AFROTC curriculum.",
    "Strengths: \r\nThis class was helpful and engaging.  Lt Col Snow is easy to understand and helpful with answering questions. \r\n\r\nImprovements:  \r\nThe tests and quizzes came straight from the text, which was helpful, but sometimes, tested my ability to read the texts more than my understanding of what we were learning.",
    "Better access to course materials and readings",
    "The course was engaging, organized, and well-taught, and the information was very applicable to our future. I also liked that we could get feedback from our peers after presenting."
