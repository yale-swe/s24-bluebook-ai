    "Strengths - lots of course content, enjoyed doing french media and stories\r\n\r\nweaknesses - less focus on grammatical rules, more on immersion (which is hard when you don't know the rules in french). would be useful to have english resources as supplements to enable you to learn the rules as a complement to everything else",
    "I greatly appreciated the daily exercises and weekly quizzes. They were very helpful.",
    "Strengths are the comfort achieved in the class\/ ease of speaking, the diversity of the course material, the number of practice exercises available, \r\nWeaknesses is the workload\/ demanding nature of the course; sometimes the professor can be condescending or not foster a positive educational environment, we never really went over tests\/ quizzes, many assignments got lost",
    "weaknesses: class meets every day, not much clear feedback on how to improve writing . strengths: emphasis on discussion",
    "I really enjoyed this course! The teaching was good and class discussions were interesting. The books\/movies were explained well so that we could understand them. I learned a lot in this class. However it is challenging and the work load is pretty heavy.",
    "I enjoyed this course. I am not sure on how it can be improved.",
    "I think the structure of the course works really well. A student is set up for success if he or she simply sticks to the curriculum and studies the tools provided. Additionally, the course is a lot of fun, which is a big strength. A highlight of the semester!"

    "Yes ! Yale french is challenging but amazing. L3 is incredibly difficult but you read books\/ watch movies that are at the very least helpful, insightful, interesting.",
    "Yes, the course is great for those who truly want to learn French.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The course is engaging and conducive for student learning. While the workload is quite significant, classes are very enjoyable and I took a lot out of this class.",
