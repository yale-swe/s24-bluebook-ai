                "I learned about the methods in historical research, especially the limitations of the archives and how limiting it can be to stay bound to \"traditional\" historical research i.e archival and research essays. I learned about critical fabulation in this class and the roles of emotion and other sensations in thinking about histories and historical impacts, as well as the importance of centering not just change, but continuities in histories of the slave trade and medicine. The class also made me think about the transatlantic slave trade not only as a historical event, but a process by which anti-Blackness became the foundations for global capitalism and for much of medicine and public health as practiced today."

                "No weaknesses, at all. The most important strength of the course was how it was set up to have many small assignments that build to a large project at the end. It really lets the students delve deeply into one topic that they are passionate about and learn about medicine & race in parallel.",
                "Basically all strengths: community, format, content, and discussion were all excellent. Assignments were not at all arduous, but very well-designed to facilitate learning and personal growth in engagement with the class content. Dr. Roberts is the best teacher you'll have.",
                "Only strengths because this course and this professor are absolutely amazing!!! Wonderful and insightful and engaging readings. Thoughtful discussions during class. Course work related to the readings and helped guide us to our final project so no one felt left behind or rushed to complete it by the end.",
                "Strengths: 1. Professor Roberts, 2. readings were intentionally curated and made shorter than an average seminar to encourage engagement with not just the text, but with other students as we used Perusall which is an online annotating platform. In lieu of traditional weekly reading responses, we posted questions, comments, and annotations in conversation with each other, 3. Assignments were made such that they led up to the final project, allowing us to spend the semester to think through our projects, and 4. we spent the last two weeks of class presenting final projects-in progress and crowdsourcing suggestions on how to improve our work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none !"

                "Absolutely. It was one of the best classes that I have ever taken at Yale. You learn so, so much about medicine & race in the slave trade. And, in the process, you learn the process of crafting a major historical project.",
                "Yes. Believe the hype. If you can get in, take it. There aren't many other teachers (or scholars) out there like Dr. Roberts.",
                "Absolutely! Before you graduate I highly highly highly recommend taking a course with Professor Roberts! She is amazing and the content in her classes is so important for people to learn and understand, especially if you are interested in health and medicine. Race deeply intersects the medical world and she really educates her students on this during the period of slavery.",
                "Yes! Professor Roberts is an incredibly compassionate, kind, and intelligent person and leads discussion\/replies to student comments and work with an immense amount of care. The energy she brings into the classroom facilitates a very welcoming environment to learn and unpack histories as atrocious as the tranatlantic slave trade with the understanding that learning these histories is essential to undoing and healing the harms they have caused today. The structure of the class was also a welcome change from a typical class with weekly reading responses etc; the emphasis on close reading and interaction with peers before and during class was a great way to facilitate learning and discussion."
