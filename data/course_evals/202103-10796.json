                "Strengths: Prof Kapustin is a fantastic lecturer, and really made the concepts come alive. I'm not a huge political philosophy person, but I got a lot out of the course and I'm glad I had to take it for the EP&E major. Weaknesses: We were always 1/2 - 1 lecture behind, which made preparing for course more difficult than it had to be, because I was never sure which readings to do. Future students would benefit if Prof Kapustin really stuck to the syllabus. Another weakness was lack of a collaborative seminar environment. I left the seminar not knowing the names of many other students, which is frustrating. More time should be spent at the beginning establishing a friendly intellectual environment, learning what people are interested in within the EP&E major, etc. These are two quick fixes. The biggest weakness of the class is the complete lack of diverse perspectives. We read 8 white men. Did no women or people of color really have nothing to contribute to interdisciplinary thought in the last 500 years? I know the EP&E major has created alternatives to Classics, and I'm sure those are great. But please, let's bring this course into the 21st century. I really believe we could have replaced Bentham or Ferguson with an alternative who happens to not be white or male.",
                "Professor Kapustin is a fantastic lecturer.",
                "Boris is absolutely fantastic, and I could listen to him speak for hours on end.  That said, sometimes the 2 straight hours without a break could be tough on a Monday afternoon, and even a quick break would help the class stay engaged in the second half.  Additionally, Boris loves to talk which is great, but we ran out of time to cover all of the material  I really liked hearing Prof. Kapustin answer everyone's questions, but not necessarily at the expense of covering the material on the syllabus.",
                "Prof Kapustin has a lot of insights to the readings and is wonderful at teasing them apart. He makes convoluted passages understandable. However, some classes felt more like a lecture than a seminar, so those sessions felt less engaging.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kapustin was an absolutely fantastic teacher. Every session of the seminar was extremely engaging, and class discussions were always riveting. Weaknesses: honestly nothing major except that we fell behind towards the end of the semester. Professor Kapustin offered a make-up session during reading period which I really appreciated.",
                "Very good lecture style seminar, deep discussions",
                "Boris has obviously been teaching this class for a long time and has an exceptional understanding and passion for the course's thinkers. The highlight of the class is what happens in class as Boris offers his own interpretations and insights. That being said, as an EP&E major this course is required, but really just feels like a philosophy class rather than a truly intersectional course. We discuss the thinkers, their core ideas, and sure they relate to political structures, but I didn't get that much intersectionality as one would have wanted. (Also, not the biggest fan of ancient/pure philosophy, so the readings and thinkers were honestly a bit of a bore.)",
                "strengths--Kapustin is great in office hours, and he really really cares about the materials. his mini lectures are super illuminating. weakensses-- 1) discussion is not great. very few threads ever get developed. its always just like \"how should we interpret this one thing?\" and then 5 students give different answers. not a ton of interesting back and forth. 2) slightly odd to have classics of EPE course with no adam smith or marx, but that does include hegel and hume? 3) super broad overviews, to the point that I'm not sure what the question is that any of these thinkers are trying to answer. so I can't see how the views really are supposed to relate to each other. is the question \"how to manage conflict/maintain order?\" is it \"what's the ideal state?\"? is it something else? and because it's not clear what the questions are, I'm never sure how to actually analyze the views. they're just absorb like a random selection of Thoughts On Politics.",
                "A prime strength is that Prof Kapustin is a very strong lecturer. He is very engaging and directs conversation well. I also think the readings that he chooses allow for us to get a good sense of the philosophers we read without spending crazy amounts of time -- he directs us well to the essence of the issues. It is in general a very engaging atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOther strengths include the fact that students in this course tend to be a bit older, which I think lends itself to a (perhaps slightly?) more sophisticated discussion. (Basically it isn't a seminar full of freshmen who are just trying to make comments for the sake of saying something). \r\n\r\nI think one improvement could be spending more time putting thinkers into dialogue with each other. Questions like these are asked on the midterm and I wrote my final paper contrasting two thinkers, and I very much enjoyed writing both. My experience thinking through and crafting those papers makes me think that perhaps even more insights could be gleaned if we spent more time on this in class. We do spend some time discussing this in class (e.g., the state of nature in antiquity vs Scottish enlightenment), but for me thinking about the ramifications of these differences was a key part in my personal enjoyment / intellectual exploration of the course.\r\n\r\nAnother possible improvement (this is solely personal opinion) would be to spend less time on Hegel. In large part because of their density, I found his writings harder to analyze and therefore felt like I did not get quite as much out of them. While class definitely illuminated the issues discussed, and his thoughts are certainly interesting and novel, I still did not feel I gained quite as much intellectually as I did in other discussions (e.g., those focusing on Aristotle).",
                "I really enjoyed the two paper assignments and their flexibility and Prof Kapustin is extremely eloquent during class discussions (I liked how he gave both students time to speak, and shared his own thoughts). The main weakness is the course typically ran a week behind the syllabus, so it was hard to maintain the reading schedule.",
                "Kapustin is clearly very engaged in the class and excited to discuss these topics. He gives great overviews of the philosophical writings and helps provide clarity for particularly difficult sections of the text. As a result, I felt like I left the class with a deeper understanding that I could not have gotten by reading the texts alone. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of the class is time management. We fell very far behind in the syllabus and were therefore unable to fully discuss a couple of authors towards the end of the course. Falling behind sometimes made it hard to prepare for class effectively; we needed to re-read old readings that were not covered, but also prepare for what was originally intended for the week. This made the workload both unclear and too dense. It could be improved by sticking to the syllabus, and sometimes allowing some things about the authors to go un-discussed for the sake of pacing the class."

It was my lightest workload class of the semester, and so some weeks I slacked off when I had to, while other weeks I absorbed all of the readings and really enjoyed the seminar. Prof Kapustin is a fantastic lecturer, and will really bring these concepts alive. Go to office hours, that's when I learned the most!",
                "I highly recommend this class. The readings are incredibly interesting, and the lectures are well-organized, informative, and engaging. By the end of the semester I felt as though I had truly learned quite a bit, and I am grateful to Professor Kapustin for the amount of time and energy he dedicates to his students. If you get a chance to take this class with him, or if you are considering one of his other classes, I think you will find him to be a very great professor.",
                "I would not recommend this course.",
                "If you enjoy moral philosophy, theories on capitalism and politics, then yes! The readings are interesting (although there are many to do, so start early), and Professor Kapustin is great at breaking them down and connecting the philosophies of different authors.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Well obviously every EP&E major has to take this seminar but it was truly a fantastic course that did a great job synthesizing topics in ethics, politics, and economics. The interdisciplinarity of the content allowed me to approach some of the texts from a totally new perspective. And Professor Kapustin was such a gem.",
                "Yes, recommend for every EPE student",
                "Took it for an EP&E requirement. If you just happen to love ancient and political philosophy, then you'll love Boris and the class.",
                "If you haven't read any of these thinkers ever, its not bad to hear some cool things about their views. but like don't take it if you have other options or have read this stuff. very broad and not particularly comparitive--so it's just not clear how to pit the views against each other.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. Prof Kapustin is a terrific lecturer, one of the most engaging I have had over my few years at Yale. If you are an EP&E major, you are likely taking this as a requirement, so to those for whom it is not required: take this class. (I am not an EP&E major and taking this course was a great decision.) If you find questions such as the following interesting, you should definitely at least shop this course: what is (political) justice? Why does the state (or nation) exist? What is the origin of its government? How does human nature affect our political life? How should one balance pursuing their private, personal interests with a sense of public duty? How do differing economic structures work for or against the stability of the nation?\r\n\r\nThese are the types of questions put into dialogue throughout the course, so if a semester reading and thinking about differing perspectives on them seems like fun, take the class.\r\n\r\nOne brief word: if you are looking for a class where you want to just debate / argue about your personal political beliefs, this is not that course. The focus is on philosophical exploration and on dealing with ideas in a serious, intellectual manner. Sure, these conversations will occur occasionally but it really isn't the emphasis of the course.",
                "Only if you are an EP&E major. It is a relatively stressless way to read the classics, though, so others might take it for this reason.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students in the EP&E major. It is obviously a requirement, but it does also provide a solid philosophical foundation that will be helpful in other courses. Kapustin is also a joy to take classes with; his passion invigorates the classroom."
