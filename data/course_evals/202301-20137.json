I also learned to write about translators themselves and to explore the relationships between translators and the authors they translate.",

                "Strengths: great survey of topics to discuss and texts to translate, small class size allows for everyone to have a chance to translate, interesting midterm and final project topics, consistent and useful feedback from Prof. Kaplan and Jeanne, seeing primary documents at the Beinecke and getting guest lectures from people actually working in the translation field put the theory in practice \r\n\r\nAreas of improvement: I'd actually enjoy having more translations as assignments instead of just readings so that students have more time to sit with the text they are translating and also have chances to peer review or edit translations with classmates; I enjoyed the readings but I would've also enjoyed more hands-on practice outside of the atelier each class",
                "Strengths: Profs. Kaplan and Sauvage are extremely knowledgeable and passionate about their work. They clearly loved teaching this course and made an effort to get to know all of their students well. The course is well-organized, with each week focusing on a different ethical or theoretical aspect of translation. The texts are really interesting and vary in form. I also really enjoyed the in-class translation workshops.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness is that sometimes the presentations got in the way of actually discussing the texts as a class."

                "Yes! Professor Kaplan is a great professor, translator, and author. She is so kind, I highly recommend taking this course and learning from her (and Jeanne). I really enjoyed that it was co-taught!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who is interested in translating! I've rarely had chances to discuss a lot of the big, and potentially unanswerable questions regarding translation, so it was really helpful to hear about different solutions and perspectives my classmates and instructors had toward questions of translating dialect in an ethical way or learning how to balance interpretation and translation. While previous translation courses I've taken focused a lot more on the actual practice of translation, I felt this theoretical and methodological course was needed to justify and understand the logic behind the choices I was making in my translations.",
                "Absolutely! If you are comfortable speaking French and have experience or are interested in literary translation, this is the class for you. I will say, though, you might better appreciate the syllabus if you already have some foundation in translation theory, like FREN 191.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in working on their translation skills while developing their knowledge of French literature.",
