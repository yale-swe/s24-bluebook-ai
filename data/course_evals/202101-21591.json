I also learned to analyze and present large amounts of data, propagate error, and draw conclusions based on my results.",

I learned about molar changes in enthalpy of vaporization and sublimation, heat capacity ratios, Joule-Thomson coefficients, molar changes in combustion and formation, and NMR theory. Although theory was useful, it was reviewed in the lab readings and in-lab. I also learned how to manage my time more effectively and how much work a one credit class can be. This class also taught me how to manage both a thesis and lab reports at the same time."

            "comments": [
                "Despite the fact I still think this course was a 5 for workload, I understood why we did almost everything we had to do. I thought the experiments took a reasonable amount of time, the teaching team was responsive and clear, and the requirements of the lab reports made sense. One of the only weaknesses that I noted was that I am not sure how productive it is for the students to tabulate all the measurements for each experiment, as I have rarely seen this done in an actual scientific paper. Also, we sometimes did not get feedback from a previous report before turning in the next one, which definitely hindered our ability to improve on our reports.",
                "I felt very supported throughout this course, and there was always someone I could reach out to with questions. Professor Cooper and the TAs were super accessible through email and lecture time. I also enjoyed learning about the physical-chemical concepts from an experimental perspective- the course material was often engaging.  \r\n\r\nI think this course naturally has a high workload as there is a lot of material to cover. The main weakness I noticed was that we often received feedback on previous reports after the next ones were submitted.",
                "The strengths of this course were its instructional staff. The weaknesses were its incredibly high work load and the how long it took to receive feedback on assignments.",
                "This course enabled a lot of flexibility with assignment completion and allowed students to fit assignments around their schedules. The progressive buildup to composing full length lab reports was helpful. The course TAs were always accessible by email, and having time during Friday lectures to discuss data analysis was really helpful. I really enjoyed the final presentation as opposed to a final exam.\r\nI felt like the labs themselves were very repetitive across the weeks. We did not gain exposure to many different tools or measurement types. I feel like I just turned a gas knob for hours week after week. I would have appreciated exposure to more tools and applications.",
                "I think the streamlining of this course from The Old Days has been very effective at the expense of quite a small amount of depth. That said, it was still *very* time intensive, almost entirely because of the data analysis, even as someone with a knack for automating routine tasks with real programming languages. I would certainly recommend that students in the future come up with a single framework to calculate 95% CIs\/make I think close to 80 plots that are 8-12 points with error bars and a trend line\/plot residuals. Even so, lab reports take ~10 hours. The last big change I think needs to be made to bring the class down to the \"normalized at every other institution\" level of workload is to do away with the requirement to include tables of all of your raw data in the reports. Just let us submit our excel analyses. All those tables can take 20+ minutes to format, especially with having to manually go into each data point and type the little confidence intervals in parentheses. It's all in the name of complying with \"journal requirements,\" though for all the time I've spent reading physical-chemistry-adjacent journals, I have seen more Excel files with raw data in SIs than non-copy-pastable pdf tables. It's 2021.",
                "The strengths of this course were the teaching staff, including Dr. Cooper. The data analysis lecture replacing the pre-experiment lecture (which was recorded and you watch on your own time) was much appreciated, and helped in analysis of data for the report due the following week. Another strength is that we were able to do final presentations, rather than the traditional final. This final presentation was, I think, a better way to understand the material more thoroughly, and provided great experience in scientific symposium talks. Weaknesses in the course, although improved from previous semester, still permeate through this semester. The amount of data analysis and attention to detail needed to complete the lab reports is something I (and everyone else) was not used to. I cannot imagine how to improve the lab report writing, since the purpose of the lab reports is to be technical reports, and therefore are inherently long and tedious. I think Dr. Cooper and the teaching team did their best in mitigating the weaknesses, especially with the data analysis lecture. The only thing that could be improved is being more explicit in what was expected in the lab report, since it was sometimes a guessing game. Possibly doing consistent recaps at the end of the pre-recorded lectures would be quite helpful (it happened often, but it was not consistent)."

That being said, I think this course could be a very productive experience in terms of research presentation and work ethic for any Chemistry major if you come in with the right attitude.",
                "I am assuming that people have to take this for the chemistry major. The way that the course is formatted now, I would recommend this course. Students will learn how to properly report scientific findings, conduct data analysis, and have hands-on experience with concepts covered in the lecture course (CHEM 332). The workload can be a bit intimidating, but it comes in waves (when lab reports are due), which makes planning manageable. As long as you start the reports early, and make sure to go through the lab guideline\/instructions for the requirements, you will be fine.",

(if you are using excel make a good graph format and then save it as a template. I made a template for the first report and used it on every plot on every report.)\r\n3. Find a good source of caffeine  (steep cafe is open 24\/7 and has starbucks double shots in the vending machine in the basement)\r\n4. and for when you feel like your body cannot handle any more caffeine, try some hyper pop music (100 gecs will keep you awake)\r\n5. copy and paste as much as possible (table and figure captions, appendices, tables, you can copy paste tables from excel into word with relative ease)\r\n6. figure out the keyboard shortcuts for common symbols (the delta symbol \"\" is control J on mac and \"\" is alt shit +)\r\n7. keep in mind that you can do it because you can.",

This course should not be taken by those outside of the major, because this course will suck the should out of you. Although better than previous years, physical chemistry and the lab reports for this class are just inherently tedious and soul-destroying. However, I highly recommend talking to Dr. Cooper and the teaching team (including peer tutor!) if you are having difficulties, or need assistance in writing lab reports or doing the experiments. Please, save yourself a semester of pain and do not take this course unless you absolutely have to. Also, if you are a senior, I am so sorry but you should have taken this earlier... you really messed up, like I did."
