            "comments": [
                "To be honest, this was the single worst class I have ever taken.  \r\n Strengths: I learned how to (try to) work around terrible classes. \r\n Weaknesses: Firstly, the grading in this class was miserable. Problem sets were graded so harshly that it was near-impossible to get a good score. Proofs were nitpicked to the extent that it became less about learning and more about strategizing to not get points off. For instance, minor notational errors (or even preferences!) could cost half the points on a problem. Imperfect grammar was unfairly penalized as were preferential choices. On top of that, the feedback on problem sets was quite poor. It was often condescending, sometimes rude, and rarely helpful. My proof writing did not improve whatsoever; I only learned the best ways to appease the grader. \r\n The grading on the exams was just as painful. The score distributions felt entirely arbitrary; grades on the midterms ended up entirely clustered around the median despite clear significant differences in performance. It felt incredibly unrewarding to do significantly better on one exam than another and receive almost identical grades. \r\nRegrade requests were handled terribly. Both the professor and the grader refused to give points back for any and all grading errors. It was very frustrating to waste so much time on asking for regrades and then to be consistently dismissed (and disparaged) despite mathematically correct answers. \r\nThe course was also pedagogically dreadful. The professor's lectures were almost verbatim out of one of the supplemental textbooks (Munkres), which isn't an issue in and of itself, but he was unable to clearly (or correctly) answer questions regarding the material, both during lecture and at office hours.\r\nAdditionally, the problem sets took an inordinate amount of time and became excessively difficult at the end of the course. This was, as mentioned, due to the unnecessarily stringent grading. However, a large part of the problem also stemmed from the organization of the class. Psets were due on Mondays during class, with a grace period till midnight. It was not uncommon for the content to be covered on Mondays right before the deadline, or even a few days later. A significant portion of content was covered during a \"marathon\" 3.5-hour class on the last day. Then, a quarter of the content on the final exam was from that marathon lecture, which many could not attend due to its poor timing. \r\nFinally, the worst part was the blatant favoritism. The professor granted extensions on problem sets to some but not others, requiring dean's excuses for some people but not from others. It is incredibly frustrating to know that the grading of this class is entirely in the hands of an incompetent professor who chooses favorites and has not been transparent in the slightest.",
                "You do learn stuff about point-set topology and algebraic topology by taking this class. However, the class was organized very poorly. The professor covered a quarter of the content in a 3.5 hour lecture on the last day of class. Sometimes the topics on a pset were covered on the day the pset was due. We had pset due during reading period (Monday, on topics covered on Friday). The grading and feedbacks were sometimes arbitrary, such as the grader having issues with which variable you used.",
                "This course was very well-paced for the first half of the semester or so, but became very difficult to keep up with for the remainder of the semester.",
                "Strengths: Professor Douglas was extremely knowledgeable and his lectures were very thorough and interesting yet easy to understand. He always made sure that we had a good explanation of every topic before moving on. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the course started off a bit slower for the first 80 percent of the semester and then rapidly accelerated at the end when we began algebraic topology. This sometimes made it feel like we didnt have enough familiarity with certain concepts before needing you use them on sometimes quite involved homework problems. There was also a massive jump up in difficulty of the problems when we switched to Hatchers algebraic topology over just the point set topology notes. I think it would have been better if we had taken more time with algebraic topology, even if it meant getting through less total material.",
                "Strengths: Clear and engaging lectures, reasonable difficulty on homework, interesting subject matter.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Poor organization of course. New information to help with homework problems was regularly posted within hours of the deadline, discouraging students from working earlier in the week. On the weeks of the (two) midterms, we also had weekly psets due (on content not covered on the midterm); this made it difficult to find time to study for the midterm that week as well. The algebraic topology section of the course was crammed into the last three weeks (despite being 50% of the final exam), so the pace was very rushed. I also would've appreciated a list and tentative schedule of topics on the syllabus, even if that schedule would be updated as needed through the semester."

                "not with DD",
                "Possibly. 98% of the reason why this class was so bad was the professor and the grader (see strengths\/weaknesses). Thankfully, the professor will no longer be at Yale after this semester and chances are the grader will not be grading this class again. The content itself is fine. Granted, the textbook is pretty bad, but with a good professor the course has a chance at being semi-interesting. Hatcher is nearly incomprehensible; if it's a different textbook (such as Munkres) then there is definitely potential. Point-set topology is a little dry and feels like analysis but more useless. Algebraic topology is pretty cool, but the way the course was organized this semester left only a few weeks for it.",
                "Unless you really really love topology and have never learned about the subject before (and you don't plan on taking Math 544). The arbitrary grading makes it so that you spend most of your time on psets making sure that the grader can't take points off your proof instead of actually doing math. All the content of the class can be learned by reading textbooks, and the professor is unable to answer any question asked during lectures.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students with the following caution: the first few weeks are not an accurate sample of how difficult the course might become and it will likely be most difficult in the final weeks of school.\r\n\r\nAnother important note: the course was organized such that the easier part (point set topology) spanned almost 80% of the class while the difficult part (algebraic topology) was in the final stretch of the course. To some extent this makes sense because one needs some (but certainly not all) of what we learned in point set topology to be able to understand the algebraic topology. I think it would have been better if the gap was reduced.",
                "If the organizational weaknesses I discussed are addressed, then yes; it's an interesting subject, the lectures are good, and anyone looking to take the graduate algebraic topology course would benefit from a foundational course in point-set topology. But if the organizational issues are not addressed, it may be a frustrating experience."
