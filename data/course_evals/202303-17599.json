I also learned about the ways that people in various parts of Latin America across centuries used the court system, witnesses, petitions, protests, and rebellions to fight against oppression. The readings for the class discussed a wide range of topics, including pre-colonial and early colonial Mexico, plantation slavery, the post-independence period, and 20th century cold war history. Through my final research paper, I was able to study an area of particular interest to me in more depth.",
                "This course really gave the perspective on how to analyze readings and have discussions like a historians. The way in which we analyze the weekly readings allow me to have a deeper perspective on gender in latin america and the Caribbean.",

                "The course was really well structured around course themes and all the assignments emphasized engaging with readings' arguments about gender and sexuality rather than just the facts of the topic covered in that week's book.",
                "This was a fantastic course and one of the best that I have taken at Yale! Professor Eller is one of my all-time favorite professors that I have had at Yale, and all of our class discussions are very interesting and engaging. We spend each week focusing on a particular text in-depth, so we get to engage in nuanced discussions about different historical analyses. We also learn about a wide range of locations and time periods, so there are many options for our final paper. There are no major weaknesses for this course. The one thing to keep in mind is that the weekly writing responses can take a while to complete, but the substitution options are helpful and the workload was manageable.",
                "The structure of the class is amazing and while it might be a lot of readings, you only have the class once a week so if you spread out the readings then you should be good. Prof Eller is also amazing and makes the class such a comfortable environment.",
                "Very organized, Eller is incredible, and the course is conducive to you engaging with the material in a way that matters to you.",
                "Strengths: supportive classroom environment, and seminar setting, encouraged participation and enjoyable learning setting, papers were amazing. Weakness: wouldve appreciated clearer feedback on grows for papers"

The structure of the class is amazing and while it might be a lot of readings, you only have the class once a week so if you spread out the readings then you should be good. Prof Eller is also amazing and makes the class such a comfortable environment. I also appreciate the content in the class, especially with the focus in the caribbean and countries in latin america that are often not discussed about. The workload is also very manageable.",
