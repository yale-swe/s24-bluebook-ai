    "Yes! I took it as a junior STEM major to improve my writing and because the readings seemed fantastic, both of which turned out to be true. I'm not even considering pursuing an english degree but this course set me up for academic success and was fulfilling.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, I feel that I both grew as a writer and gained a better understanding of myself from this course.",
