                "We discussed the key theories of ancient philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Stoics, Epicureans, etc.",
                "I learned about reconstructing philosophical arguments and coming up with appropriate examples to better demonstrate arguments.",
                "A very systematic and chronological understanding of Ancient Greek philosophy. This class further depends my interest in inquiry about philosophy and my own life.",
                "I read some seriously illuminating and existential-crisis-provoking philosophers this semester. Plato taught me that my soul is immortal, while Aristotle and Lucretius taught me that no actually, it isn't. I learned how to not fear death from the Epicureans (I'm still scared), and that Seneca would be very angry with me if I ever expressed anger over something (...wait). I learned that Epictetus would probably agree that my anger was unwarranted if it pertained to something outside of my control, and if he saw me shouting expletives I'd probably be met with a lot of head-shaking and blushing from his direction. Sextus taught me that I probably know nothing, but I might know something! Of course, I'll never really know for sure. But also never say never? #SuspendJudgement. I learned what the word \"teleology\" meant and will be using it to sound intelligent for the rest of my purposeless life. I learned that Maimonides and Alfarabi had serious crushes on Aristotle and that if it weren't for all that moon juice they were drinking, I might actually be a little bit inclined to subscribe to their views of God. I learned that Augustine was doing his best to make Christianity make sense, but the mental whiplash I went through trying to reconcile God's foreknowledge with human free will was not enough to convert me. I learned that Anselm was a sneaky guy for his ontological definition of God and that nothing is more mind-bending than reading the phrase \"that than which nothing greater can be thought\" hundreds of times. \r\n\r\nIn all, I learned that I probably have a soul (fingers crossed), there might be a God (unless there are many, or none!), and that I should stop reading these books looking for answers to questions, because it's getting pretty obvious that I'm not gonna find any.",
                "Complex understanding and critical thought about philosophers from antiquity.",
                "I learned how to think more analytically and form more sophisticated and organized arguments. My papers in the course had an upward trend, and I greatly improved my writing skills.",
                "I didn't have any real knowledge of philosophy before taking this course, so I think I learned what the study of philosophy might entail. I also developed an understanding of how to write a philosophy paper and undertake philosophical analysis.",
                "I learned how to reconstruct and evaluate the philosophical arguments in a text ; I learned about some of the fundamental questions of western philosophy, and the ancient philosophers best attempts at answering them ; I learned that I could disagree with some of historys most august geniuses, and that no matter how smart you are posterity can make you look like a clown ; I learned that the dialogue is one of my favourite literary forms, but that even it is nothing compared to philosophy written as epic poetry ; I learned that death is nothing to me ; I learned that there can be no solid basis for any kind of knowledge, really ; and many more insights of as great or lesser import. I learned a lot, basically.",
                "I learned to read and analyze philosophical arguments, as well as how to think about their implications and possible objections that could be raised. I learned to be more precise in my use of language and became more aware of assumptions that I brought into the class."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the breadth of the syllabus and the fact that we went in chronological order. It was interesting to see how the more recent philosophers referred to ones we had studied earlier.\r\nWeaknesses: the discussions often went on long tangents and we were thrown in the deep end when it came to writing papers. We received little to no guidance on the structure and argument reconstruction and evaluations.",
                "Strengths: relatively inclusive approach to examining philosophy\r\nWeaknesses: discussions were often low energy",
                "Strength:\r\n1. All the reading material are very interesting, though I would appreciate if DS didn't asked us to read so much Aristotle lol. But overall it's a great intro course to Ancient Greek and some medieval philosophy. As a person who has never been exposed to any religion before, I really enjoyed all the reading of Augustine, Aquinas, Maimonides and Ibn Tufayl.\r\n2. The DS philosophy lectures are amazing! The lecturers always explained complicated Ideas in very simple language and greatly helped me to understand the material.\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n1. The seminar can be a bit disorganized sometimes and at the end of the discussion I didn't really feel like I gained much new insights or my problems got answered.\r\n2. I think the course would be greatly improved if instead of close reading a short paragraph in seminar and trying to figure out what it means, we discuss the big idea of this writer: should we accept their philosophy, why or why not? what are some good arguments for it and against it? what does it mean to accept their philosophy? what counterargument could we propose? etc. It feels a bit waste of time to clarify some obscure argument in class, a job that can definitely be done after or before the class through email communication or internet searching. Given that we only have two seminars per week, I think it is really important to use it in the most intellectually challenging way.",
                "This is a strong course. I will say, a little too much Aristotle for my tastes. Very heavy on the Aristotle. I wish we had spent more time on the Epicureans, Stoics, Skeptics, etc, even the Christians. It felt a little silly that we spent so long going around in circles with Aristotle, reading things like Categories (where all he does is categorize stuff...super riveting) but we had to crunch like three authors into one day later in the semester. I am aware and acknowledge Aristotle's importance, but I think the pacing was a little off.",
                "Weaknesses:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\nAbility to ask infinite questions\r\nPlenty of classroom discussion\r\nLots of well thought out examples",
                "Strengths: strong sense of camaraderie with fellow students and Professor Pittard. Classroom climate was relaxed, warm, and engaging. I learn a lot in every single class. No class is ever boring. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of.",
                "I thought it was a great introduction to philosophy and made me really want to study it more. I feel that we spent a bit too much time on Plato and Aristotle, so the end of the semester felt a little rushed. I would've loved to have a full discussion of the later philosophers.",
                "Overall, this class was great, and I learned a lot from both the discussions and the essays. My only criticism is that we moved through the texts so quickly that I think we missed a lot of interesting topics for discussion, but I think that is inevitable in a class that covers so much content.",
                "Strengths: The lectures were always extremely helpful in getting at the key ideas and positions of each text/philosopher we studied. - The different texts we read had clear connections (agreements, disagreements) between them that made the study of each text much richer. - Seminars were usually interesting and thought-provoking.\r\nWeaknesses: I understand this is a survey course, and as such there will inevitably be weeks when it seems like not nearly enough time is being spent on the texts. Still, I feel like slight adjustments could be made to the syllabus to focus on what I felt (and I know this is, of course, a personal judgment) were the more interesting texts in the syllabus. In particular, I thought too much time was spent on parts of Aristotle which I really struggled to find interest in. The more important parts of De Anima and Metaphysics could probably be condensed into a single week, and more time could be given to the Hellenistic philosophers (doing the Stoics and Epicureans in one lesson each was especially frustrating).",
                "Strengths: amazing selection of readings and good organization of syllabus- it was cool to see connections between different philosophical texts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes didn't discuss a lot of the readings"

                "Yes, but your experience is heavily dependent on the professor you get. The readings are usually long and pretty dense depending on the philosopher, which may be discouraging to students with no prior experience with philosophy.",

                "If you are ready for DS, then do it! You might struggle or be frustrated during the semester due to the insane amount of workload and DS can sometimes feel disorganized, but I promise if you do your reading and engage in seminar with heart, you will learn more than you realize at the end of the semester. I'm more than happy that I took DS this semester. If you want a community that is always willing to talk about free will, justice, good, God, etc, this is your course! Also, read the syllabus before you decide whether or not to take it.",
                "Yes! It was hard to keep up with everything but a lot of really interesting conversations have come out of this class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I thoroughly enjoyed the materials as well as the classroom discussions.",
                "110% YES! I honestly don't know what I would've done if I didn't take DS this semester. The intensity of the scholarship and workload is made more fun with the sheer talent and sense of community fostered in the DS cohort. The books, the discussions, the lectures, the essays, the exams, the learning -- all were amazing.",
                "Anyone who is even remotely interested in philosophy, the classics, or even just intends to study the humanities would likely benefit from this course. It was intellectually rigorous and provided a great foundation in philosophical thought. The readings were pretty dense though, and I think you really get out of this course what you put in. If you don't want to do the readings and participate in discussions, you might not find the course very valuable. I think it's worthwhile to put in the effort though.",
                "If the subjects covered in DS are your thing, or if you have an inkling that they might be some of your things, then yes, absolutely, Id recommend it. In this track, youll get a really solid overview of some of the most important philosophical questions, and learn to think about them in a philosophical manner. Even if you dont end up pursuing philosophy later on, much of what youll cover in DS Philosophy are interesting and important subjects to think about. Besides, youll start to learn a manner of thinking that holds you accountable for all of the dodgy assumptions you make out of laziness in arriving at a conclusion or opinion. And thats useful regardless of where you go.",
                "Yes, absolutely! It was an excellent survey of big philosophical ideas, and has definitely changed the way I think about these questions in my everyday life."
