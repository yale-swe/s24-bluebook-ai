                "I gained valuable insight into the transition from antiquity to modernity in Greece over the past century. I also improved my writing through the weekly discussion posts.",

The class also taught me to think more in depth when it comes to identifying important societal themes and topics embedded within the Greek films and novels such as what family dynamics within Greek culture represent.",

                "The strengths are the in depth discussions we had and how organically the discussions flowed. Professor fosters an environment where people are encouraged to contribute and share their opinion. At times, it seemed that a more clear structure of the course would have been more helpful, however, this allowed for more flexibility in a sense.",
                "The strengths of this course is that the stories we cover are very interesting. An improvement that could be made to the course is that it the time could be cut down a little.",
                "Strengths: fascinating discussions and usually fascinating (if very strange) texts, a lot of points of analysis are quite relevant for everyone not just Greeks. I liked the weekly short writing assignment format\r\nWeaknesses: The only time we actually wrote a long formal essay was the very end, which felt a little new because we hadnt done it before (perhaps by design)"

                "Yes!",

Class discussions are genuinely interesting and engaging, and Professor is more than willing to take the time out of his day to discuss course material, engage with his students as human beings, and help students improve their writing. Lastly, the literature and films we looked at in the course were very interesting and intellectual stimulating.",
                "Yes, absolutely. It's a small class which allows for close connection and togetherness while learning about some really interesting topics through a diverse selection of literature and films. The once-a-week schedule while being almost 2 hours allows for genuine and detailed discussion among students and the professor.",
                "Absolutely!! This class was unique from all the ones I took this semester and it was fun, engaging, and definitely worthwhile!",
                "Yes, the discussions alone make the class worth it but only if youre willing to commit to the oddness of the texts. I feel like if you are constantly refusing to take the texts for what they are because youre disturbed by them you will not get much out of the class."
