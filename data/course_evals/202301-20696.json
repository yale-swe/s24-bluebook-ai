                "This course covers a lot of topical energy issues. I learned a lot about different energy problems around the world, how to solve them, and the scientific knowledge behind them.",
                "I learned a lot about looking at the whole picture of clean energy and thinking about all of the inputs\/aspects into\/of anything issue in society more generally. I learned about the entire processes of producing various forms of energy and the practicality of implementing those forms of energy, which is not often examined in energy\/climate discourse. I gained the skills of looking at issues through a multidisciplinary lens that included science, public policy, politics, and economics.",

                "I learned a lot about energy sources and how they have changed through time, as well as energy policy. I now have a pretty solid grasp of how energy (oil, gas, renewables, nuclear) works."

                "The course is a lecture despite being framed as a seminar. This is not necessarily a drawback since the professor has an enormous amount of experience. It should just be marketed as such for students to know what they are signing up for.\r\nThe field trips, guest lecturers, and final presentation make for an excellent class structure.",
                "More emphasis on overall themes and takeaways rather than throwing so much content at us during every lecture. Guest lectures were wonderful and I'm grateful Prof Prober put so much effort into inviting so many interesting guests.",
                "It could be less reliant on the midterm and final presentation.",
                "Strengths: Broad range of topics in energy, engaging field trips to Kroon Hall and Yale Power Plant, and very caring Professor, often bringing in solar cars for us to build and keep, interesting guest lecturers, and snacks!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The every day class format was not as engaging, as it would consist of presenting Powerpoint slides. However, I still learned a lot, as the slides covered many different topics every class!",
                "I hope there could be participation grade to force participation.",
                "A strength of the course was the content we studied. It was very thorough and of appropriate depth depending on the subject. The multidisciplinary way we approached issues was also a major strength. The guest multiple lecturers were engaging and added their unique perspective to the issues discussed in the course. The main weakness of the course was the lack of clear organization of readings from the book lining up with topics discussed in class during the first half of the course.",
                "Strength of this course would be the final project and research! \r\n\r\nThis course could be improved by having more in-class discussions in a seminar setting.",
                "Strengths include a good \"leminar\"-style (the professor basically talked for the entire class and paused for questions), good organization, and a fun final project. One weakness was that the course was very intense for the first half, until the midterm, and then fell off dramatically.",
                "The course could be greatly improved if the slides were provided before class (without paper) and the class time was used for discussion of current events or historical breakthroughs. I greatly enjoyed the concentration of guest speakers in the second half of the semester, but also wish they could be slightly more spread out throughout the class schedule."

                "This is one of the best survey science courses for non-science students. Incredibly informative, relevant, useful, and filled with expert perspectives.",
                "Yes; Professor Prober's lectures are very interesting and he has great insights into the field of energy and public policy. He explains how innovations and policy initiatives show promise while also being critical of greenwashing and fake solutions. The guest lectures are also interesting and the lecturers are very impressive. I enjoyed learning about a range of topics but felt that the material could be organized better. The p-sets are pretty straightforward, and the project was a good way to take a deeper dive into a subject, but I think it would be helpful if we discussed the project deliverables before deadlines come up. If you're interested in energy, this class is great.",
                "If they need a science credit.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in energy or is completing Energy Studies Certificate. It is a great introduction to a broad range of topics in energy and you get to meet many distinguished professionals in the field through Professor Prober's guest lectures!",
                "Yes! I am a hardcore humanities major, and I really really really love this class. The workload is gutty, but the courses are actually super interesting. The course covers a lot of topical issues about energy and environment issues around the world, the scientific knowledge behind it, and potential solutions to the issues. It is both scientific and policy wise practical. Professor Prober is passionate, humorous, and always brings tools for cute demonstrations. Overall, I really loved this course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially to a humanities person such as myself. The way in which environmental and energy related issues are examined from a scientific as well as political and economic perspective is highly engaging. For those looking for a science or QR credit, this course is actually very engaging to the politically-minded. You will receive appropriately detailed scientific knowledge that informs public policy in relation to energy and the environment.",
                "Yes, I would. If you are a humanities student who wants to understand the basics of energy and energy policy (and needs a science credit), this is the course for you.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who would like an introduction to energy units, conversion, and understanding of domestic energy supply lines."
