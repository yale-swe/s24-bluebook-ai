The intersectionality of this course really made it valuable to me, as we could talk about race, ethnicity, education, gender, class and immigration in a single setting.",
                "Yes, it is a lot of work but it is a really thorough and insightful class. You really learn as much about the racial and ethnic formation of Latinidad in the U.S. as you do about the current state of education, which is really helpful for anyone interested in either of those general areas. Professor Cordova-Cobo also does a great job of guiding us through the course material.",
