    "new perspective on ways to approach global challenges.",
    "I learned a lot throughout this course including new learnings methods as well as many new topics that I had not studied before. \r\n\r\nI further developed my participation skills in class, by trying to bring new perspectives to the class discussions. I found that the more involved and engaged  I was in discussions, the more I learned. \r\n\r\nThe topics covered in class were new to me. I have learned a lot within the area of environmental health and more specifically pesticide use, the issue of plastics, palm oil and livestock. These issues pose a great threat to human populations, and I find it very important to do more research in these areas. \r\n\r\nWithin groupwork, I learned that cultural differences are important to take into consideration when putting together a project. Each individual has different values in regards to a presentation and these differences need to be taken into account in groupwork.",
    "I learned how to analyse complex and global-scale environmental problems through myriad lenses such as a legal, environmental, health and social perspective. I learned about the interconnected nature of various problems.",
    "the skills of doing research into an unfamiliar topic, doing presentation in English independently, and writing academic English essay"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths:\r\n- individual and group meetings with the professor.\r\n- case study approach\r\n- opportunities to propose solutions\r\n- group-based learning\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- emphasis on developing individual research proposals earlier on in the semester\r\n- clearer expectations of submitted work",
    "One strength of this course is the structure. It was clear from the beginning, that the professor had an idea about what we were going to cover during the five weeks. We were given a syllabus, which we could use as a guide for the progress of the course. I found this very useful. \r\n\r\nAlso, the size of the class was a major strength. The fact that we were only about 13 students created a great learning environment. It was possible to involve everyone in discussions and get different perspectives on all topics. Also, the professor was able to recognize each individual and support everyone in doing their very best. This makes a big difference since I as a student felt acknowledged. \r\n\r\nThe professor's interest in the subject made a big difference as well. It was very visible that his passion is within the area of environmental sciences and that he wanted to share his knowledge with us. The professor made it interesting by incorperating his research experiences.\r\n\r\nThroughout the course we were given the opportunity to develop solutions to real life problems. Many of the cases we discussed in class were directly relevant to current events, which made it even more interesting. \r\n\r\nSometimes we did not get to finish certain lectures because of lack of time due to questions in class. One thing that could be improved is to stick to the time schedule more regarding the lecture classes.",
    "Strengths:\r\nThe presentation and research paper components were well thought out to allow us to put into practice what we had learned and write on a topic of our choice.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nFew weaknesses, simply that we could have drawn on the set books to read before the course more deeply."

    "YES!",
    "I would definetely recoomend this course to other students. In this short period of time (5 weeks) I have learned so much and I feel like I have been able to go into depth with the various topics, even though there was limited time. \r\n\r\nThe course encourages critical thinking and new proposals for environmental issues.",
    "Yes, for those interested in knowing more about environmental issues and the limits of environmental law, and who are open to having their assumptions and preconceptions challenged.",
    "Yes, I will. Because this course is challenging and interesting."
