                "I thought that the lectures were great and informative, but I wish there were more practice problems available to do.",
                "Some strengths of the course involve the possibility to drop an exam. I believe that relived much of the class's emotions and anxieties around these tests. I think a weakness of the course is having assignments on Acheive and not inputing those assignments on Canvas. There were times where I forgot to check Acheive and I would be late on assignments. By inputing the links to the acheive on Canvas, I would've been more easily able to complete assignments on time.",
                "Strengths: Lots of opportunities through assignments and quizzes to boost your grade and reinforce knowledge from lecture, discussion section format of practice problems in groups was very informative and helpful in reinforcing class concepts\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough reminders and notifications regarding homework assignments, have to pay for homework system out-of-pocket in order to complete classwork",
                "I think that Prof. Cooper is a big strength of this course. He is well organized and the schedule/structure of the class is laid out clearly. His lectures are clear and made sense to someone who had basically never taken chemistry before. We had no review sessions for the final, and I think that would be a big improvement.",
                "Time management was definitely a weakness of mine and I can improve that by making a better schedule for myself. I also just do not find the class super interesting or engaging which is no one's fault but mine.",
                "Professor Cooper tries to make the material as approachable as possible and offers plenty of opportunities for students to receive help.",
                "Strengths were the discussion sections and the quizzes that were in two parts. Weaknesses were no final review and no practice exams for the final.",
                "Overall, because the instructor of this course ensured student understanding of the course material was efficient, I felt as though I knew the conceptual teachings of the course very well. However, when it came time for exams, I felt extremely underprepared when it came time for testing and wish more practice material was offered.",
                "While the teacher was incredibly sweet, and the lectures did an okay job of teaching, the discussion sections felt weirdly designed, and didnt really help me learn. First of all, you needed to complete a quiz before every discussion section (on your own-which was graded even though the material was pretty much completely new), and then you would do the quiz together for another grade. Why couldnt we just start off doing the quiz together? Or we could have study groups which encourage group collaboration while we are doing the quizzes, especially since this is all new, it was quite stressful trying to figure it all out in a short amount of time without help. Additionally, the tests themselves did not give nearly enough time for completion. I handed in almost every test having to skip a question or two since I knew I wouldnt have enough time to think through it and there were other easier points to get (even though if given enough time, it would have been possible to figure it out). It felt like a test of your quickness in reading and writing instead of a test of my learning. The homeworks on achieve were surprisingly helpful, especially since it will walk you through how to do it through hints, but we did not get enough tries (3 tries to get it wrong when we are still new to the material is preposterous). It should have been 10 tries, or at least enough to learn through our mistakes without getting stressed about not getting the points.",
                "I truly admire the way this course is designed, with this professor. I love the way Achieve weekly assignments are set up because they truly help a lot in learning the course material. I also feel that each aspect of the course is very fairly weighted. However, I think adaptive learning quizzes should remain available until the end of the semester (deadline should be end of semester) so that students can continue using them to practice.",
                "Strengths: The lectures are 50 mins long so it doesn't get boring and the syllabus is well structured. The professor is also really good at explaining stuff and tells you what to expect in midterms and exams. The midterms are great because its divided into topics so you dont have to study alot for one midterm and the online portion is open book.\r\nWeakness: The recordings are the worst quality and if you miss a lecture because you were sick or smth you cannot catch up untill the end of the weak when the recordings are posted",
                "Strengths: homework and adaptive quizzes and the practice questions for the exams \r\nWeaknesses: tests were difficult and didnt have enough support with regards to questions and review sessions",
                "This course definitely seems to be designed more for students who have some sort of prior experience with chemistry and calculus.",
                "A strength of the course is that the material covered is relatively simple  you just have to put your time into it.\r\n\r\nA weakness is that at times, the material on the lecture does not align with what is tested on the exam.",
                "The lectures are pretty boring.",
                "Strengths: this course is very well structured and provides many resources for students to practice their skills and challenge their understanding prior to the exam. Professor Cooper is an excellent lecturer, and his lectures were supported by sections that allowed students to gain confidence with concepts. The combination of individual work, small-group activity, and lecture-wide teaching made this course more engaging, and the variety of assignments provided many opportunities for student growth.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: if there is any way to upload Achieve assignment reminders to canvas, that is the only big change I think would help students remember to complete their assignments on time.",
                "very good class. one weakness is that the final was unlike any of the midterms. i loved the weekly quizzes.",
                "Great course!",
                "The strengths are the way this class is set up by Professor Cooper! He was always willing to help and always understood certain circumstances!"

While the material is interesting, the tests are too short on time to think through appropriately, and the homework is quite a time commitment every week. That being said, Cooper is an incredibly sweet teacher, and he will explain everything to you if you ask. But he isnt the one at discussion section, making it hard to get a hold of him since youd have to either ask in class or make an appointment. I would only take it if you need to, its not worth it if you simply are taking it for fun.",

                "I wouldnt really recommend because the lectures werent engaging and I kinda just learned everything while doing the homeworks last minute.",
                "Depends on why- if you are generally interested or a STEM major looking to understand why things work the way they do at a basic level, this course is a must in developing a fundamental understanding of the physical world.",
