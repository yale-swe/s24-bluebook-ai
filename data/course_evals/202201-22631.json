It was also fascinating to not just learn about communism in the US (which was a relatively small movement in itself) but also how it influenced and shaped American society in significant ways.\r\nWeakness: I know this is how history department seminars are structured, but the length of each class period (almost 2 hours) made it a bit exhausting, especially towards the end of each class.",
