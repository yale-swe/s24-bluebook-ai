Although French is a lot of work and at least 2 -3 hours of work each night, it didn't feel like at work at all because Madame Skorupa did such an AMAZING job in teaching me. She also made it fun as much as it was academically rigorous. I actually think the content I remembered the most was because she was so animated or sung or brought a prop to class.
