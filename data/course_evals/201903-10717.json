   "comments": [
    "I learned how to back up my arguments more thoughtfully and also how to think more critically about my initial assumptions and chains of logic.",
    "I come from a debate background, so I thought the philosophy section would be the easiest one for me. However, I quickly found that the debate mentality made it much harder to view philosophical arguments charitably. This course greatly helped me view arguments in their best light instead of just consistently straw-manning them in my papers.",
    "Philosophical analysis, close reading",
    "Reading, comprehending, breaking down, and building back up philosophical arguments from seminal pre-Renaissance thinkers. How those thinkers compare to and build off of each other.",
    "I learned a lot about writing papers and about the philosophers we read in this course",
    "A large insight into philosophy between Plato and Aquinas. Really excellent course.",
    "This was my first philosophy class so everything I learned, both skills and content, was new. Preparing for our final exam really helped me see how much I had learned throughout the semester.",
    "I learnt to analyse arguments in premises and conclusions. I learnt about the First Cause and the Original Sin, which gave me a better understanding of religious thinking. I also learnt more about the Sceptic's modes."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths were that the course included some foundational works to western civilization, and led to some really interesting class discussions. It's hard to go an entire semester without reading any works by female authors and not see myself represented whatsoever: I would love for that to change in future semesters.",
    "This course's biggest strength was just the fact that it was a discussion section - it is so much easier to understand philosophical concepts when they are thoroughly discussed by people that are trying to figure it out with you instead of just being lectured by a professor. The biggest weakness was probably how little time we were able to spend on each concept because of the DS syllabus.",
    "Some of the lectures were not as rigorous as I would have liked, with the exception of John Hare, David Charles, and Verity Hart",
    "Most people will come into DS with no philosophy experience and, after a lot of difficulty, will leave with some familiarity with a discipline that is unlike anything theyve studied before and bears almost no relation to the other DS tracks in terms of both content and methods (most of the time). That familiarity is absolutely worth gaining, even at the steep price it comes with. People already comfortable with philosophy (very, very few people) will fill in some holes, deepen general understanding, and gain exposure to thinkers they almost surely havent studied. These are all strengths  the only true weakness I can think of (other than the amount of work, which is almost surely necessary in the end) is the lack of assistance given to students who dont understand the methods of philosophy at the beginning of the year. This varies a lot from professor to professor, but my section was given a single handout explaining the concepts of validity and soundness, and then left to go at the first paper more or less alone, leaving me thinking that philosophy writing should be approached in more or less the same ways as H&P and Lit, which is 100% not true. It would be nice if some kind of guide-to-the-methods-of-philosophy handbook (e.g. basic logic) was part of the summer reading, because it took me way longer to understand how to do philosophy than it should have.",
    "Professor Hare was a great teacher!!",
    "If anything, I wish we had a better or more engaging translation of Plato's Republic. But John Hare was excellent and this was my favorite DS class this semester!",
    "This is an excellent introduction to ancient philosophy and is great in conjunction with the rest of the DS curriculum. I found this to be the most difficult of the three DS classes, but I did not have much of a philosophy background, which may have contributed to that.",
    "I think the pace at which we move is both a strength and a weakness of the course. It allows us to cover a lot of material, but it also means that we have very little time with individual texts and theories. That is just the nature of the Directed Studies curriculum. I do think it would be helpful to have more help understanding the philosophical ideas before beginning our class discussions. Since members of our class were approaching the material with varying levels of prior knowledge and familiarity with the ideas, our discussions were often dominated by the members of the class with a stronger grasp of the material. I think that if there was designated time at the beginning of each class to go over the main points of the text and ask questions it would have been more helpful and help class dynamics.",
    "Strengths: Amazing professors and amazing texts to read with a great cohort of students; I definitely had my philosophical mind well worked through the semester and gained in my thinking.\r\nWeaknesses: Some things just went very fast, but that's the nature of DS. If you want more, definitely take another philosophy class afterwards!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, as long as they have sufficient time to devote and are confident in their abilities, as this course tends to really challenge one's foundational ideas and beliefs. Also, a lot of reading.",
    "I would absolutely recommend directed studies as a whole to another student, and I in fact already have. Even though it is very difficult and a lot of work, I have found it extremely rewarding and I feel like I have learned so much that there is no question as to the value of the program.",
    "Yes, John Hare is amazing",
    "Yes. Everyone should take DS!",
    "Yes",
    "Highly. Sincerely, I think John Hare made this class. He's such an excellent instructor.",
    "I have truly enjoyed my DS experience thus far, and especially so in philosophy (which I did not expect). If Professor Hare is still teaching this course, then I'd highly recommend him; his explanations, examples, and general experiences are all balanced perfectly with class discussion and lend themselves to highly informative and philosophically deep seminars.",
