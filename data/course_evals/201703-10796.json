    "Pretty chill class, I would say it's less work than 162\/163 but takes more intuition. One final and midterm-- midterm is vocabulary testing and then a longform essay but Sulaoshi gives you a dictionary to work with. Good introduction to Chinese fiction, which I've never read before!",
    "Writing, speaking, literary thinking in Chinese.",
    "Professor Su's suggestion of \"tasting Chinese\" really helped me this semester. I not only read sections of many different famous works of fiction, but also improved my Chinese writing skills. Moreover, I added to my vocabulary and learned how to use new grammar structures.",
    "Much improved my Chinese language skills, especially writing and composition. Also learned much about culture and society in modern China.",
    "I learned how to apply those close reading skills I use when looking at English literature to Chinese literature.",
    "Knowledge of trends and schools in contemporary Chinese literature and a lot of knowledge about contemporary Chinese culture."

   "comments": [
    "Extremely fulfilling classes. Learned a lot about Chinese fiction and Chinese authors. Learned many new vocabulary words and grammar patterns as well.\r\n\r\nDid not get to practice speaking too much.",
    "This course is a great survey of Chinese fiction, but does not give students many opportunities to engage with the professor or practice oral communication. This is, in some ways, appropriate for a language course at this level, but could be seen as a weakness for students such as myself who are not heritage speakers.",
    "I think the course was structured very well as individual modules. Su laoshi also did a good job tying the individual modules together and explaining their combined significance.",
    "This course was intensive and Professor Su was excellent and a very interesting lecturer. He always made class engaging and made me passionate about the material.",
    "Su Wei's stories are amazing and really interesting and the readings are really interesting.\r\n\r\nThe homework assignments are tedious and oddly graded"

    "The course content is fascinating, and Professor Su's style made me look forward to every class. It's challenging from a language standpoint but also does not require a lot of hours in preparation before class.",
    "Yes.",
    "For anyone looking to take their chinese abilities to the next level, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yes I would recommend. The readings are really interesting and su wei is an amazing professor to have"
