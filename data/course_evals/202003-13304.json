We also got to explore the relationship between Yale and New Haven, which is very interesting and something every Yale student should be more informed of. The case study research assignment allowed me to learn a lot about the specifics around immigration, policing, and public health inequity in the city.",

                "This was a fantastic course where I learned the basics of reading case law and dealt with some questions in law that I didn't really have the time to ponder before this class. Each student added insights to our discussion using their own perspectives about how the First Amendment should be applied to modern-day cases and we spent a lot of time focusing on how the internet could change First Amendment law."

                "I think the course is expertly laid out. The content flow from seminar to seminar was very conducive to learning the material. I also loved having the freedom to write what I was most interested, in some form or fashion, on all four of our paper assignments.",
                "We could have less cases to study to focus more on a few",
                "A major strength of the course is Professor Goodrow's deep background in the judicial system that helps the class weave together different cases and understand not only the result, but also the cogs of the machine to produce such a result. An improvement of the course could be integrating more engaging methods of discussion. For example, the one time the class picked roles and prepared for a debate amongst ourselves was entertaining yet informative.",
                "The course is designed to foster great discussion and there is emphasis placed on debate and engagement. Professor Goodrow does an incredible job of ensuring that everyone is able to ask questions, push back respectfully, and understands the cases.",
                "This was one of my favorite classes at Yale because there were so few limits on the questions we could ask and how we approached writing our essays. I loved having prepared discussion questions and also the opportunity to meet up with classmates (online) before class to discuss our assigned cases or questions. The students selected each had a unique perspective and we were not afraid of challenging or offending each other, which I think is quite rare. Though by the end of the course some of the conversations became repetitive, almost every class taught me something new. I think what would be useful, however, would be to take half of a class to discuss the basics of case law, and legal processes just so that the cases made more sense. Also, in terms of the questions asked, while they allowed us to discuss new, interesting ideas, it would be helpful to have a couple of classes discuss specifics of ethics."

                "I really appreciated that the class wasnt backloaded in terms of work and that I wasnt dying due to final assignments at the end of the semester like I was in other classes. The case study research assignment was a lot more achievable to do with virtual reading than I thought. The instructor was also very understanding and flexible considering the circumstances of the semester, which I really appreciated. In terms of things that could have been improved, it would have been nice to get to know the people in my class a little more, even over Zoom",

The combination of her practical experience and the interest she has in the topic makes for an extremely excited class. She also acts as a mentor for students in ways that you don't always expect so I think that makes her an incredibly invaluable teacher."
