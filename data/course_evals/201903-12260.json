    "I learned critical thinking about poetry and about the topic of poetic influence. We also gained experience deconstructing and analysing poetry in our two final papers.",
    "The modes of poetic influence and metaphysical interpretation undertaken by English poets during the Romanticist and Victorian eras; introduction to the writing style adopted by the Yale English department for poetry.",
    "Content-wise, I really enjoyed seeing how the Romantic poets interacted with each other over time, and Professor Brisman was extremely knowledgable about every single one. It was a tradition that I knew little about before beginning this course, and I came out with a much better sense of how these poets were in conversation with each other, as well as how each of them had a different expression of common themes.",
    "I developed so many insights from Professor Bloom, and his teaching style differed so strongly from professor Brisman that I found it difficult to learn and progress in the latter half of the semester."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the small class size. I think the course was strongest when it was a mix of lecture and discussion. The challenge of a course with such a difficult and complicated subject is that students were often unable to understand the poems we read, and so discussions occasionally were less helpful than lecture, although they were simultaneously also a crucial way for us to break things down and learn from them. Finding a balance between those two aspects is difficult but important.",
    "The course does a great job of facilitating student learning through student discussion and additional insight from the professor. The content, itself, is also very interesting in its exploration of poetic metaphysics and how such interpretations are shaped by literary minds that came before. The only weakness is that I did feel, at times, that discussion may not have been completely focused as I left certain sessions unaware of what I was to take away.",
    "Professor Bloom conducted the course almost entirely based on student conversation, while Professor Brisman spent more of the seminar lecture-style to explain the context of each poet and highlight key passages of the text. I think, moving forward, I would prefer a better blend of the two, with more opportunities to speak during class. I felt myself working harder to understand the texts individually in Professor Bloom's class, and with Professor Brisman I felt I left each class with a more concrete sense of what I'd learned. I think this was partly a result of the class only meeting once a week, and I think splitting this seminar into two sessions a week would encourage a higher level of engagement throughout the whole class.",
    "Professor Blooms class was perfect: he facilitated a great discussion, only interjecting when necessary. Whereas, Professor Brisman would often take over the class with a lecture. I think it would be improved for him to allow the students to speak more."

    "Yes, it's a fantastic introduction to some of the great works in literary history. The seminar style also creates a very welcoming atmosphere. Like any humanities course, however, grades are uncertain, so that is an added level of stress.",
    "Yes, it is a great course to develop knowledge, understanding, and love for poetry."
