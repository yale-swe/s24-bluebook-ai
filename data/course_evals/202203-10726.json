                "I learned how to think of learning in different ways - beyond the round wooden table seminar or the distant lecture hall. I learned about my relationship to food and how it impacts so many overlooked parts of life. And, ultimately, I learned how to be more mindful and kinder to myself, especially regarding my relationship to food, identity, and desire.",
                "I learned more about the relationship between food, identity and desire and how the intersectionality of these topics might impact my own lifestyle.",
                "Exploration of how food, identity, and desire all connect.",
                "I learned a lot about the complex and fascinating role food plays in our lives and the ways in which it can define our sense of self.",
                "So many-how to interact with food, identity and desire on a complex level",
                "This class provoked so many interesting lines of thought related to the three ritual subjects. I gave new consideration to various topics in food, including Chinese American cuisine, indigenous foodways, unruly bodies, and more. It was great to give consideration to these somewhat quotidian ideas in a classroom setting, though the classroom was a progressive, casual one. I also learned to engage meaningfully with classmates in relaxed round-table discussion that was not merely about parsing a text or winning a debate.",
                "I learnt a lot about historical and cultural processes linked to food through a refreshing humanistic lens.",
                "I learned so much about how food plays a role in shaping my relationships, sense of self, and daily life.",
                "Such an incredible class that taught me to view food in a much more meaningful way. Taught me the importance of food to inclusion and appreciation.",
                "This course is split into three major segments: one third in which we held conversations over \"embodied practice\", one third based on the reading for the week, and one third with guest speakers. The classes with the readings were my favorite. It prompted me to think deeply about the three themes of the class: food, identity, and desire. I've always loved Hunger by Roxanne Gay, and so the opportunity to take a class that expanded upon the themes of the book was so rewarding. This is very much a class in which you'll get what you put in. I didn't put in my all, but I was satisfied with what I learned, and the class really opened my mind to new ideas.",
                "Interdisciplinary background in food",
                "I learned about a variety of food cultures in the U.S. and abroad. In the past, I only ever considered the ways in which food and identity intersected. It was fascinating for me to add the third element of desire. Looking back at it now, this all seems self-evident, but only because Professor Trumpler opened my eyes up to the way in which all aspects of our identity--from our gender and sexuality to our jobs---can impact how we consume/prepare and think about consuming/preparing food.",
                "This class completely expanded how I think about food (our relationships with it, its role in different cultures and between different peoples and as a mechanism for hurt and conflict as well as a source of joy, etc) and our understandings of food impact the way we think and interact with one another"

                "I loved the three-part division of the syllabus into food and cultural identity, food and stories, and food and work. All the material we covered enhanced our understanding of the topic and the papers were fun and (nicely) challenging. I think some more 'whole group' discussions (most discussions were small table discussions) would have taught us even more, but overall it was such a wonderful class!",
                "So great - just wish the speakers could have all been in person",
                "This class was the absolute highlight of my week. The texts were engaging, the professor was amazing, and the subjects were interesting. Professor Trumpler was definitely the greatest strength of the class. She understands students well, is empathetic, and is very clearly deeply passionate about the material. A small weakness is just that grading was sometimes unclear, and I got the sense that the grading is not proportional to effort. Instead, I think your grade kind of comes from the topic you choose for your papers.",
                "Strengths: GREAT GREAT CLASS. I loved hearing about food and the food industry in so many different ways. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish we could have focused a little bit more about gender issues in relation to food",
                "In many ways, I wish this course was a year long. There is simply so much to cover in these topics; yet Professor Trumpler did a wonderful job providing us with a broad and in-depth approach to food studies.",

                "YES!!!! 100000%",
                "Yes, we did do a lot of work but because the work was interesting and engaging it felt like a light course load.",
                "Absolutely!! And I already have -- I feel so lucky to have found out about this class. I recommend this to anyone. It doesn't require any specific acquired skills, and students' life experiences take center stage. It's a unique pedagogical approach, but I left every session feeling that I had materially learned and engaged, which is more than I can say of most lectures and even many seminars.",
                "Yes. It's a great fifth class, though it's not as 'low workload' as Course Table suggests - we do read three whole books and write two challenging papers! It might feel like less work because of the calming environment and alternative format, and that's a really good thing.",
                "Absolutely. One of the best classroom learning environments I have ever experienced at Yale. The readings are so interesting, the projects are unique and exciting, and you will learn so much!",
                "Yes, everything about it from the readings to the in-class assignments, to the way the class was conducted was phenomenal. I really felt I grew as a result of being in this class.",

                "Absolutely. I would go as far as to say that every student should take a class like this at one point in their time at Yale. This class was refreshing because it was structured in a unique way, and will definitely balance well with a harder workload schedule.",
                "Yes absolutely!! Its an amazing experience, and Prof Trumpler is clearly passionate about the subject matter",
                "YES it's a must",
                "Absolutely! Everyone eats, yet many do it uncritically. It is a beautiful privilege to be able to talk about why each of us relates to food in a certain way in a classroom that so clearly is set up to facilitate student learning, even though these topics are difficult.",
                "Yes! This was the only class I have taken at yale where I felt like the students came out of it as more reflective, less judgmental, and kinder people. I thought about this class (the books we read, discussions we had, food we tasted) all thru the semester. It was an amazing class that I wish I could take every semester. It has changed the way I think about my relationship with food and my relationship with myself"
