                "not enough room to write all of the strengths of this class! it is by far the most engaging class I've ever taken at yale - the whole time you are paying attention, moving your body, learning new signs, and that makes it so easy to learn. compared to other classes (especially language classes) there's very little work outside of class, but if anything I learned more. it's also just a fun class to be in. this was a class that I had every day at 10:30, and there was not a single day where I wished I didn't have to go. even days when I was stressed about other classes, or tired, I knew this class would make me feel happy. you get to know the other people in your class and the instructor so well, as well as the whole deaf and signing community at yale, which is so welcoming. if you get the chance to take this class, you definitely should!!",
                "Strengths: Engaging, exams are done asynchronously and on one's own time, classes do well to reinforce old learning and introduce new learning simultaneously\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The final project process was somewhat disorganized, but that is to be expected since it is a pilot project. The slides shown in the class are published to canvas, but are largely unhelpful because the vocabulary is signed in person.",
                "The expectation for students is to show up with an open mind and interest to learn American sign language. The workload is really manageable and allows students to explore deaf culture and language in a really welcoming and stress-free environment.",
                "The instructional aspects of this class were very strong, as the class was engaging daily and I felt that I walked away from class with new knowledge every single day. The only weakness would be slight confusion around projects and assignments, which is understandable considering that the course is still being developed as it is a newer course offered here.",
                "Could be a little more structured but is very good manageable workload and I learned a lot. Could also be a little more emphasis on students signing rather than understanding."

                "This course has been my favorite at Yale so far. I would absolutely tell everyone to take it. It was incredibly enjoyable! You learn so much and it taught me so much about the Deaf community. I'm a far better person after having taken this.",
                "Yes, I absolutely would recommend ASL 110 to another student. The workload is light and it is a low-pressure environment, but is incredibly engaging. It was so rewarding to realize how much I had learned by the end of the year.",
