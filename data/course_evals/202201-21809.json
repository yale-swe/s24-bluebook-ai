                "I learned the importance of early childhood education and the value of emergent curriculum. Child education is most valuable when it centers childrens questions, curiosities, and explorations rather than focusing on memorization and procedural activities. I also learned about the importance of play in a child's learning, the role of the teacher, the moral development of children, and how children develop their literacy skills.",
                "I learned so much about childhood education in this class!!! It changed my perspective on what I want to do with my future.",
                "I learned a lot about the developing brain, how play is learning, how to teach, and act around kids.",
                "This course directly builds skill sets that are often overlooked by courses on child development. I was able to develop direct observation skills of young children, interpreting their actions, understanding the way they think,etc. This course also provided a profound amount of knowledge in terms of curriculum design.",
                "I definitely improved as a writer and as an observer.",

                "Strengths: the child observation was definitely one of the most rewarding things about this class because it helped me witness first-hand what we were reading about and discussing in class; guest speakers were interesting; readings were short, relevant, and engaging; the journal entries were rewarding because they allowed me to put together the readings, my child observation, and lecture content; materials exploration project was one of my favorite things about this class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there had been more engaging activities in class rather than what felt like just lecture",
                "This is a wonderful class.",
                "So many strengths! Loved the guest lecturers!!!\r\n\r\nMaybe more feedback on the writing to help improve writing skills",
                "Only strengths! The way this course is structured and its pace puts student learning first and it really shows.",
                "The child observations were super meaningful and complemented our class discussions really well.",
                "Strengths: One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Readings were manageable, incredibly interesting, and often counterintuitive (you learn things that go against common conceptions related to early childhood). Prof. Horowitz gives highly detailed feedback. The opportunity to observe a child is indelible. The guest speaker presentations were among the best I've attended at Yale. \r\n\r\nOnly weakness was the insane technical difficulties, which had to do with us switching rooms... and having so many journal entries due at once was hard to manage. The personal reflection essay at the end seemed unnecessary with the amount of reflection given in the journals, and added to finals week stress.",
                "strengths - amazing guest speakers, opportunity to connect and observe kids, opportunity to develop lesson plans using what we've learned in class\r\ni loved the readings in this class! short but with so much information packed in that I learned more than I have in any other class from the readings alone\r\nweaknesses - sometimes seminar became a bit like a lecture so the class could use more interactive group work during seminar sometimes"

                "Yes!! If you are interested in education or children or both, this class is very rewarding and insightful. While it may seem like a lot of writing, it is all reflective which makes it easier and more fun to write. The materials exploration project was one of my favorite things we did in the course because we were able to develop a lesson plan for children using the skills we had learned in readings/class discussion.",

                "Absolutely. Combining class with observation was such an amazing opportunity to directly see the class material in action.",
                "Yes! One of the best courses at Yale will teach you as much about yourself as it does about young children.",
                "Yes! The journals took longer than I expected but were a really rewarding opportunity to tie in together the observations, readings, and class discussions. I definitely learned a lot in a meaningful way.",
                "Definitely! I would feel as though I was committing a crime had I gone into education, or raised children, without taking this class first.",
                "Yes!!! Excellent course for all. A valuable opportunity to connect to your own childhood as you observe another child's development."
