She was so engaging and energetic during our long Zoom sessions and always made herself available to answer our questions. She is easily the best math professor I have ever had. She was incredibly kind and understanding and super passionate about calculus. The material was not always the easiest or most intuitive, but she explained everything really well. I would definitely take another class with her in the future!!",
