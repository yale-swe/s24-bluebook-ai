The class focuses a lot on themes in martial arts films like sexuality, honor, masculinity, etc. I also learned how to write a film analysis paper for the midterm and final.

                "The biggest strength of the course would have to be how engaging the live virtual lectures are Professor Gerow is AMAZING!! A weakness would be having weeks where we would have to finish an entire novel + additional discussion\/written assignment.",
                "I really enjoyed the breakout sessions that we had often during the lecture. It broke up the monotony of lectures and allowed for ideas and concepts to be discussed. I did find the two movies a bit much however as we were only able to ever discuss one during the section. I loved watching so many movies but I did feel the sheer number of movies made it difficult to really dissect them in section.",
                "I wouldnt say there were any real weaknesses, but I think there are ways it couldve been more interesting. I think the in-class surveys were a nice touch and the overall structure of the class was good.",
                "Class was amazing, really loved it! Take it if you get the chance!",
                "Strengths: you get to watch cool martial arts movies as your assignments. Weaknesses: the course is not very structured. Besides a midterm paper and a final paper, there isn't much in-between besides watching the films. It was fun watching the movies, but I feel like watching them didn't actually help me with writing my papers. I also ended up not watching a few of the movies, and it didn't really affect my ability to attend classes or engage in discussion sections. As a non-film major, I also would have liked to learn more about actual filming techniques and styles instead of focusing so much on themes like sexuality. Going into the class, I also expected to learn more about the origins and backgrounds of different styles of martial arts, but we didn't really get into that much.",
                "Strengths: A VERY knowledgeable professor, a fun curriculum, small class size for a lecture course \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sections could use more structure. The level of engagement really depends on your TF and the participation of your fellow students. Also, this class has more movies to watch each week (2-3) than a typical Yale film class. It was fun over quarantine when I was happy to watch movies at home, but keep in mind its a bigger time commitment.",
                "The progression of the films was brilliant. Professor Gerow put a ton of thought to curating the list of movies and ensuring that each week's movies related to the next. The workload was very  heavy at times in that we were expected to read a full novel between lectures and also assigned two movies to watch.  I think that the course would've benefited from diving deeper into a few assigned movies and readings rather than attempting to cover all of them.",
                "The lectures were very short and there was a lot of material to cover. It always seemed like there wasn't enough time to go over anything in depth. If the classes were longer in duration, it would give more opportunities for discussion and questions.",
                "The lectures were informative and entertaining, and the films were really good!",
                "This course was amazing! It was so much fun and so interesting, I am not sure that there are any weaknesses.",
                "This was a very interesting class. The lectures were very insightful and we got to watch a lot of cool and fun movies. Some movies were slow and confusing but they are important to martial arts history.",
                "Professor Gerow's lessons, covering each film we watched, provided very useful insights into the film and allowed me to learn how to analyze martial arts films, both within the film and connecting the film to external topics. Throughout each lesson we would review clips from either the film being discussed or clips from other films that helped us to understand the film being discussed and also to have a refresher on the film. However, if you do not have a particular interest in martial arts film beyond a general appreciation for movies like Kill Bill or Kung Fu Panda, it may be a bit hard to stay engaged with some of the films covered in class.",
                "Great class! In-person screenings on big screens would be great (but not an option in this COVID environment, unfortunately)",
                "A great strength of this course was the flexibility of its final, which encouraged student creativity. \r\nThis course would be improved if it included the film Rush Hour.",
                "This a very fun class with an interesting topic. It can be tough at times to watch all the films on your own, but I imagine this is always better when the course is taught in person. The professor did a good job at keeping lectures engaging but it would also be more helpful if lectures were recorded because it was difficult to take notes at times because of the speed he lectured at\/ whenever individual wifi went out.",
                "The movie catalog for this course was really good, and every film offered something different to talk about in discussion sections. The in class lectures where we analyze clips from other films also offered in sight from the readings so we could apply it to the film. The only problem with all of this great content is that sometimes it makes it hard to get all of the readings and all of the films watched and read before each session. Since I'm a freshman still adjusting to life at Yale, it made it a bit difficult to keep up with the content. However, we covered a lot of the content from the readings in lecture so I didn't feel like I was behind not anything.",
                "Loved this course. No weaknesses.",
                "The variety of martial arts films that we watch over the course of the semester is really interesting. The assigned readings are also very interesting and help us understand where a lot of common martial arts literature tropes come from. Sometimes, the readings can be a bit long, especially when we have to read entire books."

But sometimes the lectures were a bit dry. I also felt like there was not much motivation for me to watch some of the films that I wasn't interested in seeing. Perhaps if there were some guidelines or questions to consider before watching each of the films, I would be more engaged. A lot of times, I didn't really know what I was supposed to be paying attention to in the films. A more structured curriculum and an explanation of what each unit is about might have helped.",

                "Since this course had a strong importance of discussing the content from class, we held zoom discussion sections every week, which all went really well. The discussions were always well organized and went smoothly, except for a few technology hiccups here and there.",
                "The professor did a great job of utilizing the media library during lectures. We were able to watch videos and discuss them without the buffering on zoom. Overall, the course was well adapted for remote learning due to the emphasis on individual screenings.",
                "Generally, the live lectures and discussion sections worked pretty smoothly. Sometimes, the audio would cut out or distort due to connection issues, but those moments were usually brief. I also like the asynchronous lectures as I am able to access their recordings for reference."

Also, if you are an East Asian Studies major or study anything related to East Asia, this is a great class to take because it is a fun way to fulfill major requirements. \r\n\r\n Also, we watched and discussed Kung Fu Panda, which is a reason in itself to take the class.",

                "I would recommend this course to anyone only if this class is taught in-person. I had a hard time staying engaged with the material but only because of the virtual format of classes. Otherwise, the material is actually quite interesting, Professor Gerow and the TF's teach it very well, and watching these films in person with other people would definitely be a fun part of the experience. However, for an online class, I struggled to stay engaged, and given that I don't have a particularly strong interest in martial arts film beyond a general appreciation it was hard for me to keep up.",
                "Yes! Very interesting, I got to watch a lot of movies from cultures across the world. I learned much more than I expected, there really is a lot of depth to these films.",
                "100% recommend. Professor Gerow really knows and appreciates this side of cinema, and the course is built such that you'll walk away with much more than you had going in no matter what your prior experience with film studies or East Asian MA cinema. Although the movie screenings can take up a lot of time (2-3 films a week), they're all interesting and enjoyable films in one way or another.",
                "One of the most interesting courses at Yale. Would definitely recommend.",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in cinema, as this class covers a lot of ground in East Asian martial arts films.",
                "Yes, one of the best Film classes especially if you enjoy martial films.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about East Asian Culture, Martial Arts Films, or just wants a fun and interesting class in general. I came in to this class interested in learning more about Martial Arts films because I love to watch anime, which sometimes is also based on Martial arts. I never took a film class before this one, and through time, I fit right in as we also bring up the fundamentals of film analysis, so you don't have to worry about not knowing about film analysis.",
                "Absolutely. Engaging and fascinating study on martial arts film.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to students who are interested in martial arts film or even just film. I think the course provides a lot of interesting insight into international film industries and their histories, as well as how the martial arts genre grew in popularity in the west."
