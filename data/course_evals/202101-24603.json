            "comments": [
                "This course is highly effective in showing that Japan's economic challenges do provide an effective framework to evaluate the vulnerabilities of the global economy today. Students get to learn about a wide range of macro and policy issues, and Prof. Roach structures the class extremely well and focuses it on the theme of the \"Lessons of Japan,\" but also ties it to relevant, present-day topics (i.e. economic policies during COVID-19, Biden's infrastructure bill, etc).",
                "The course was probably one of the most interesting economics electives I've taken and Professor Roach's facilitation of the class was firm but fair.",
                "Good balance",
                "Strengths: Professor Roach is a really nice person, and the course material is very practical. Drew is also a fantastic TF. They definitely are there to help answer any questions you have, and they provide really detailed feedback on everything you work on. The grading was very fair, especially if you put in the work.\r\nWeaknesses: I feel the grading breakdown was weird. The student presentations we worked on took so much time, but it only counted for 10% of your grade. The readings also became very repetitive after a while, as were some class discussions.",
                "Strengths - Professor Roach structures the course very well. Readings are intentional, organized and very manageable. Lecture/discussion style mixed with student presentations work well, and offer a unique opportunity to present and receive (very) detailed feedback. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - If any, were probably just the Zoom format this year; but, that's unavoidable. Given the format, I still think the course was very rewarding.",
                "It is the perfect economics seminar. Prof. Roach arms you with the confidence and the substance alike to think critically about policy in Japan and beyond. Feedback is extensive, engagement is wonderful (we are expected to genuinely master each week's readings, and this truly enriches our discussions) and assignments are fun, especially if you take the time to start them with time to spare before they are due."

                "Yes, if you are interested in financial crises, this is one of the best courses at Yale for it that is not in a quantitative context. With the lack of interesting electives in ECON to begin with, don't pass this up.",

                "Yes! Prof. Roach has a very well-organized and uniquely structured class, and you'll definitely learn a lot and be supported, even if you feel out of your depth sometimes with the material. If you want an interesting/worthwhile senior seminar without psets, I strongly recommend this one",
                "100% yes. Prof. Roach is a brilliant economist with a deep set of experiences and skills, yet still manages to turn large policy topics into very accessible opportunities for learning and exploration. You get out of this course what you put into it - make sure to stay on top of your readings and you will be rewarded with fascinating, data- and analysis-driven insights into one of the world's most interesting economies, as well as others like it."
