    "I think the most valuable thing I gained from this course was how to approach abstraction from an observational lens. Sophy put a big emphasis on how all painting, regardless of how \"realistic\" is an act of abstraction, and how just because something is done from observation does not restrain you to a particular interpretation of local color or composition."

    "Great observation sessions on Thursdays. Good site selection. Its the right amount of time and a cool way to approach works, typically going from start to finish in a specific observation section. \r\n\r\nCould maybe use a little more structure especially first half of term. Also more feedback\/ crits. Maybe one addition could be more directed workshops on Tuesday classes for technique",
    "I think this course would benefit from more structured in-class exercises toward the beginning. It was a little disorientingly freeform from the outset"

    "Yes! Take it with Sophy if you cangreat person & painting teacher. Youll get lots of time, space, and freedom to grow as a painter. Thursday field trips are a great way to activate yourself as a painter (and also explore some less-trodden parts of campus & New Haven).",
    "Depends on whether you thrive in a really open ended and often on-site creative environment. If you require a bit more of a sterilized and structured painting experience then no."
