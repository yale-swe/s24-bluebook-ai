                "Appreciation of literature, the tools to reflect on love, marriage, and family. Passion for performance art. Ability to *feel* in literature.",
                "This course taught me how to read literature from a human perspective. We never lingered on complex literary theories or academic jargoninstead, we discussed the characters, the psychology of the characters, how they loved each other, how they failed to love each other. I also think I learned a lot about love, in real practical terms. This course genuinely affected the way I pursued relationships; halfway through the semester, it helped me navigate a complex romantic relationship and consider it in a new light. Truly wonderful, truly life-changing. I'm so glad I took this course.",
                "This class was a beautiful, peaceful, and overall wonderful opportunity to read, enjoy, and discuss some of the best literature and art ever created with a group of dedicated and fascinating people. Professors Spitz and Bloch create a classroom environment that is both supportive and challenging, and they push all of their students to engage deeply in all of the works. Although I didn't come away knowing the special secret for a perfect marriage, I learned so much about the human experience through the lenses of the works we read.",
                "I expected this course to be more an opportunity to experience\/enjoy art than to actually come away with tangible knowledge, but I was wrong! I learned a lot about the relationship between love and understanding, the role of love testing in relationships, the many forms of love (platonic, romantic, familial, etc.), and the power of forgiveness.",
                "This course will make you a better thinker and a better person. It will deepen the way you think and feel about life and love. And it will expose to you great literature. Anyone who can take this course absolutely should!",
                "This Yale course, \"Love, Marriage, and Family,\" has affirmed my conviction that humanities seek to comprehend human connections and self-improvement through literature and art. Delving into Anna Karenina emphasized the significance of cherishing someone in everyday moments, surpassing grand romantic ideals unsustainable in the long term. Love demands laboran active, challenging investment in another person. The course resonated with David Foster Wallace's perspective on the essential sacrifice for genuine human connections and a better society: \"The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and effort...\" (David Foster Wallace, May 21, 2005). Characters finding happiness in the novels embraced the unglamorous facets of their partners and reciprocated the same. Professors Bloch and Spitz illuminated that love transcends beautiful moments, encompassing struggles and despair. By embracing all human emotions, even the unglamorous ones, we evolve into more complete beingsunited.",
                "Comprehensive overview of the themes associated with love, marriage, and family, as depicted in the arts. Fidelity\/infidelity, trust\/betrayal, knowledge\/secrecy, etc.",
                "I learned about the different ways that human relationships can and have been depicted over time through the lens of literature, art and film.",
                "I feel like I am coming away from this class with a renewed sense for life and humanity. I learned many lessons about love and relationships that not only affirmed my own experiences but also instilled wisdom for my future experiences in life. Furthermore, this course gave me the opportunity to hone my discussions skills, as well as my analytical thinking."

            "comments": [
                "I absolutely LOVED this course. Strength is the professors, the course material, the fact that this course is popular and known to be very good so all the other students were immensely engaged.",
                "The most wonderful and thoughtful professors!",
                "Strength: Prof. Spitz and Prof. Bloch are SO caring and amazing. Each class touches upon something so deeply human as we peel away ideologies and dive into the arts.\r\nWeakness: there was a lot of text to cover in little time and I felt like in each class we weren't able to dive very deeply into some of the texts (especially in second half of the semester)",
                "Brilliant course. Spitz and Bloch were phenomenal. The syllabus was the most thematically cohesive I've ever seen for a literature course not about an individual author. What I mean is that every week, we talked about the readings of the week, and the conversation naturally incorporated readings from previous weeks. I've taken English courses where each week you read a new thing, and you talk about it, and that's that. In this course, every week built on the last. \r\n\r\nAnd the readings are incredible! I got to read some works I've loved before, some classics I'd always meant to read, and some gems I'd never heard of. This is the only class I've taken at Yale where I got the sense that everyoneor almost everyonein the room had done the readings every week. There were no superfluous readings, either; the page counts were comparatively light, which gave everyone a chance to go deeper on each week's topic. Everyone spoke, because the professors guided conversations in such a way that contributing was easy and rewarding. There were emotional moments, and emotional days. There was an undercurrent of good feeling in the room that started up around week 3 and never went away.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses I can identify.",
                "Strengths: So, so many. This class meant a lot to me this semester, and encouraged me to think about my relationships with my friends, family, and partner more deeply and in a new light. Many of the works we read were familiar, and many were new to me, but regardless of whether I knew something before I would inevitably think of it in a different light after Professor Spitz's comments, Professor Bloch's wry jokes, and my peers' points in class discussion. \r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of. One warning I will give to potential students is that you must be prepared to take this class seriously and dedicate time to the readings, essays, and coming to class. Professors Spitz and Bloch do not tolerate absences, and expect students to not only do the readings, but personally engage with them and think about them deeply. This is not a class to take for an easy A, or for fun (it is fun, at times, but it also requires serious emotional and intellectual investment).",
                "Strengths: Professors who really, really care about the content and discussions. Great reading list (especially Fun Home and A Raisin in the Sun). Classmates who really care about the material. Writing assignments that truly deepened my engagement with the texts. Not any weaknesses that were really worth mentioning, although I think maybe asking more pointed and difficult questions would lead to a more enlightening discussion. I personally prefer questions like \"Why did character X doY\" to questions like \"What did you think when you first read this passage?\" The former type of question came up plenty in our class though, and I felt like those questions often stumped us, leading eventually to a deeper insight.",
                "It's perfect! Amazing books and great conversation with two extraordinary and caring professors.",
                "The strengths of this course is the passion and wonderful dynamic Professor Spitz and Bloch have, the unbelievable works we read throughout the semester, and the one-of-a-kind opportunity to discuss some of the most important aspects of our lives: love, marriage and family. This course has no weaknesses. Every student in the seminar left the final class with tears in their eyes - Professor Spitz and Bloch created a classroom that echoed the content whereby we became our own version of a loving family.",
                "Absolutely no weaknesses. Perfect course.",
                "I absolutely loved this class!! It's incredible, and I wouldn't change anything about it.",
                "I thought that the class discussions were the greatest strength of the class. Collectively, we came up with a number of insights about love that I anticipate carrying with me throughout my life. One weakness of the course was the abundance of material. While the works themselves were very interesting, I found that we often were not able to cover each piece in-depth since there was so much reading to do. I think the course would've been more effective if we had really focused in on a few key works."

                "Absolutely. This is the best course I've taken at Yale. I'd recommend it to anyone who has love in their heart, but that would be silly. So instead I'll recommend it to everyone, and particularly those who are English majors and don't much like being English majors.",
                "YES! If this year was any indication, it is very, very hard to get into this class, but if you can, TAKE IT! It is a relatively light workload on paper (two 8-10 page papers) but intellectually and emotionally necessitates an investment, but an investment that truly pays off because of the joy of learning in the environment that Professors Spitz and Bloch create.",
                "Yes I definitely would! I changed multiple opinions about love, marriage, and family throughout the semester, and I consider that a great return on my investment of time and effort. Also, Professors Handler Spitz and Bloch, aside from being all-around stellar professors, are true lovers of art and great guides on this artistic journey. I won't soon forget the literature, film, and visual art we studied this semester.",
                "Yes! You will enjoy your readings, walk away with an expanded mind and heart, and make new friends.",
                "I have already recommended this course to everyone I know. Love, Marriage, Family felt sacred to me, and anyone who has the chance to take it will immediately understand how special it is. Ultimately it epitomizes a liberal arts school at its best.",
                "Yes, absolutely. This course felt like the perfect addition of warmth and softness to my semester. Having lost the desire to read for pleasure during my college years, this course truly reinvigorated my love for literature.",
                "Absolutely take this class if you have the chance!! The professors are amazing, and so knowledgeable and friendly. They really make an effort to build a sense of community with the students, which made coming to class such a joy. You really get to know your fellow students, and it's just amazing. It's been one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Not only was the content engaging and applicable, but Professors Bloch and Spitz were a delight to learn from. I feel like I learned a lot not only about love and relationships but also about life itself."
