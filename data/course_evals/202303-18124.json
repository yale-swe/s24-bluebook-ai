                "Learned very practical methods to approaching, breaking down, and solving data science problems. Not really a course for learning new theoretical concepts (other S&DS courses cover that), but a good course to learn how to take a new problem involving data science from start to finish.",
                "How to develop an entire data science project from start to finish",
                "I learned how to follow a project timeline and how to make R-Shiny apps. We programmed entirely in R and worked with a variety of different data sets such as gymnastics data, cyber security data, and Yale football data."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Brian!! He is one of the best stats professors we have, and the required office hours were very helpful. The diversity of datasets between case studies also makes for a really interesting course, and the practical\/applied nature of the class is fun and helpful for developing job skills.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the deadlines felt off (like we needed a lot more time to do things than we were actually given, because they ended up being extremely hard). Additionally, most of this class revolves around group work. If you get a bad group it will be significantly less enjoyable for you. Grading was sometimes unnecessarily harsh and the feedback wasn't always the most helpful. Having the final capstone project AND the report for our final case study both due at the end of the semester was quite stressful  that should have been timed better for students' sake.",
                "Sometimes I wish there was a little more structure to the course, but overall it was structured in a way that encouraged us to learn how to work as a group and to figure things out and make things work.",
                "Strengths: this course does a good job of filling in the real world gaps of other S&DS courses. Said courses typically ask students to solve bite-sized problems, focusing just on data cleaning, focusing just on modeling, etc. 425 does a good job of teaching students how to approach a messy problem from start to finish, where youre dealing with incomplete data, insufficient computational power, and other real world limitations. Teaches you where to take acceptable shortcuts. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some case studies were definitely stronger than others. Gymnastics case study was very strong, engaging, and educational. Yale athletic data one felt a little directionless.",
                "The course is great for its practical focus but this year the case studies we did weren't necessarily the best choices. We spent over a month on one of them because it ended up being much more challenging and tedious than I think Professor MacDonald expected it to be. I imagine that in the future with better case study choices the class would be better though.",
                "This course gives very good experience with completing several data science projects from start to finish. It helps you gain proficiency in everything from data cleaning and data manipulation, through machine learning and applications. Sometime the course was a bit disorganized, but overall runs very smoothly.",
                "The course was very project driven which was very beneficial for everyone's development in R. One weakness was that some projects took much longer than initially expected and so we had to work on them outside of class (even though we weren't supposed to). This took time away from our capstone."

                "Absolutely! You get lots of hands-on experience working with data and an opportunity to dive into research with the final capstone.",
