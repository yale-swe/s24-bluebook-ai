                "Strengths: The lab setting of the course allowed us to get a great overview of the subfield. Professor Wolin was super knowledgeable about the field. Great course. \r\nWeaknesses: Didn't have enough time to get through the material in most classes. If taught in the future, would recommend that class time be longer (probably similar to the length of the intro to archaeological lab sciences course). This extended length of time would also allow for more case study since about half of the course was dedicated to foundational skills and so time for actual case studies was limited.",
                "A strength of the course was that class time was divided between a short mini-lecture and in-class labs where we got to directly apply what we had just learned. Another bonus was having time for class discussions on the weekly readings, which helped situate the material in real world contexts. \r\n\r\nFor a new course like this, I could find no weaknesses. The syllabus was well organized, so expectations were clear as to what was expected every week. The bonus office hours session offered by the TF allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of human osteology. Maybe one area of improvement would be considering making this course in the future twice a week rather than once a week. Even though the class met from 1:30-3:20 pm on Fridays, time would fly faster than expected. There were times when we would be short on time and would have to wrap up labs and lectures quickly.",
                "Very thorough course and very interesting, but time management was a bit of a problem in that we didn't always have time to do everything the instructor wanted.",
                "The course was extremely well-organized with pre-determined readings, lessons, and labs. Professor Wolin was incredibly supportive and knowledgeable throughout! No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: seminar was very engaging and lab exercises really helped with learning and made course content more fun and applicable",
                "This was a great introduction to bioarchaeology! It felt very accessible to someone who didn't have too much of a background in biological anthropology/ human anatomy.",

                "Yes, if interested in Bioarchaeology as a subfield. If not, then this could potentially be boring for you. Additionally, since bioarchaeology is the study of human remains in archaeological contexts, it is important to note that photographs of human skeletal remains are shown and discussed and as such, students need to be okay with this in order to enjoy the course.",
                "Professor Wolin did a fantastic job drawing the connection between the casts of human bones and the real lives these people once lived. Especially towards the end when we were talking about the troubled origins of the field, the discussion on ethics and the responsibility due to descent communities whose ancestors' bones may be housed in a museum collection was done sensitively. Even though the bones are no longer attached to living people, they still offer an important window into how people once lived if you're interested in how disease, nutrition, or violence can become \"etched\" onto the bones themselves.",
                "Absolutely! Professor was amazing and the course was very well organized with LOT of student engagement. Very good time to be had.",
                "Absolutely; among the best courses Ive taken as of sophomore year. I am considering Anthropology as a second major because of it.",
                "Yes! Especially if you're interested in bio anthro, archaeology, osteology, bones in general",
                "Yes! A great introduction to bioarch, regardless of your background in human biology/osteology, etc. The in-class labs and optional osteology review sessions offer a really helpful hands-on component, and the papers-based assessments put less of an emphasis on memorizing key skeletal indicators (most of which can be easily reviewed, even in the field) and more of an emphasis on the underlying theory.",
