                "Strengths: wide range of views on Latin America (e.g. critique of capitalism & globalization)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: could mention more about Latinx populations & ideas in the U.S., should include more time for everyday discussion instead of just talking about heavy, weighty academic subjects",
                "Strengths - Small format leads to lots of speaking in class\r\nWeakness - Little focus on grammar and spanish proficiency. We spent a lot of time learning about things in Spanish, but I think a lot of us needed language help in conjunction with the learning.",
                "Strengths: lots of cooperative activities, chances for engagement with peers, etc\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some activities were more based around the content (in English) than the language itself. While the content was interesting, my main goal in the class was just to improve my proficiency, and sometimes I felt that I was not getting better at the language despite showing up to class.",
                "There's many opportunities to use spanish, but not learning anything new in Spanish. And all the material is very basic and meta so diminish returns in learning the language hits very easily, the material can be interesting sometimes but it's repetitive and you lose interest. Most of what you do is busy work, and its a lot of busy work that is annoying.",
                "This course was pretty grueling, sometimes in a slightly unproductive way. Some assignments felt very much like busy work and did not benefit my learning or practicing Spanish. I think this course could be improved by directly incorporating the review of some of the more complex grammar concepts. Every language course is separated by at least a month of not engaging with the language, so any sort of review at the start, or throughout the semester, as a group could be beneficial.",
                "The course was very well organize. There were a variety of activities and I fell very engaged. I would love if the course had a component that allowed students to engage with the greater New Haven community, given its high percentage of Spanish speakers.",
                "I felt that writing essays, in-class discussions, and reading texts that were at my reading level were all very useful to me. These things helped me really get involved in the Spanish language, practice achieving fluency, and use the language in the way I would like to use the language in the future. \r\n\r\nI did not find group work useful. Usually in group work, we would split up the work in English, so instead of working on something that felt cohesive and which I felt connected to because it was my idea, I was working on something that I wasn't attached to and where I had a hard time seeing the bigger picture. I know group work makes grading easier; I would have preferred to get feedback on less assignments than to do group work. \r\n\r\nI found the curriculum somewhat odd. The units felt very disengaged from each other and somewhat random. I often struggled with having learned about the topic in significantly more depth elsewhere but not having the language or course structure to talk about the elements of the topic that I found interesting. To me, it would have been more interesting to focus more on Latin American and Spanish history, because I know very little about that, so there are not-that-complicated readings in Spanish that I could learn a lot from, and I would like to learn more about that. \r\n\r\nI struggled a lot with Oc y Nechca because it was so far above my reading level. I felt like I was seeing the words but not processing what they meant, even when they were words that I would know under other circumstances. I would have preferred to read a simpler text so I could have gotten into the flow of reading like I do when I read in English.",
                "The strength of the course was how clear the work was assigned. Weaknesses would be poor student engagement and low morale due to the teaching style.",

More focus on grammar, conjunction, and engagement with the language itself would lend itself to being a better course. I can say with confidence that I didn't really get better at Spanish this semester.",
                "If you have to take this, then yes, but I enjoyed L3 more.",
                "You kinda half to take it if you are completing the L4 requirement. If you want to eventually take L5 or Spanish electives then those might be interesting but this is a pre requisite to those. If its a requirement, take it and get it over with, preferably in a non-rushed semester. It's same grading as L3, but L3 is just more engaging and interesting.",
                "I am not sure I would recommend this course to another student. I really enjoy learning languages, but L4 was not a fun class to take. There is little in-class support, so it is easy to fall behind. It is also a pretty intimidating course with a wide variety of Spanish-speaking abilities. Many people I have talked to have deemed this course the worst they've taken at yale -- not necessarily difficulty-wise, but spirit-wise.",
                "I would recommend this course. The class was well organize, the professor was accommodating and the workload was very reasonable. I felt engaged and challenged.",
                "Yes, this course was a good way to practice Spanish, and I enjoyed taking it. It felt like we were at a level where we could have a good class discussion in Spanish.",
                "I would not recommend this course --- it was my least favorite Spanish course I have ever taken. The professor was responsible to a departmental agenda she very clearly did not want to teach. In addition, the grading policiesespecially for in-class essays where we had very little time to completewere the harshest in my 12 years of Spanish learning.",
                "I think Jackson needs to find another way to satisfy the language requirement and rely on the under grad course. It doesnt line up with the MPP program. The curriculum of the course is fine, but I dont see the connection with global  Affairs. P"
