    "Learned a lot about fMRI and neuroeconomics (duh!)",
    "I learned a lot about neuroscience. I did not learn a lot about economics.",
    "Basic neuroeconomics, thinking about neural basis of economic decision making",
    "Got a really great overview of how neuroscience intersects with Economics; also know more about fMRI techniques, research design, brain structure, and how patterns of activation can predict behavior",
    "I learned how to interpret MRI data, as well as how to construct and analyze neuroeconomic experiments.",
    "I learnt the techniques necessary to get the juice out of fairly dense research papers. I also became a lot more accustomed to how research in both neuroscience and economics is done, and how to write a research proposal.",
    "None",
    "Learned how to read Neuro papers",
    "It was a very interesting course and allowed me to gain an understanding of how neural processes affect decision making",
    "how to read neuroeconomic papers, how to write a research proposal",
    "This course taught me how to read neuroscience papers and scientific papers in general. It also exposed me to a new branch of economics that I don't think I would have learned about in any of my other courses in the major.",
    "Not really many. The course was not very engaging and failed to create a course that challenged individuals to think differently.",
    "A comprehensive understanding of neuroscience and its application to economics.",
    "Interesting lectures and papers discussed, Learned about some of the key pieces of research on neuroeconomics and the findings of fMRI studies",
    "Really learned a lot of new approaches to behavioral science, as well as a number of different models of valuation that I wasn't familiar with before.",
    "I learned a lot about key concepts in neuroscience, learned how to read (neuro)scientific papers, and began to explore how this dynamic field will shape the discipline of economics going forward."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Problem sets were somewhat arbitrarily graded.",
    "The course becomes quite boring after the first few weeks. The main focus of the course is neuroscience, not economics. I found it really hard to even see the relationship between what was taught in the classroom and economics. Students' main focus throughout the semester is their research proposal and the lectures are completely unrelated to this, so after a while they become pretty boring.",
    "Strengths: chill workload, if you get your work done you'll be fine in this class, Prof Levy obviously knows a lot about this field, the material is also just inherently interesting\r\n\r\nWorkload: can be a little hard to engage in the class sometimes, not sure if just because my class was filled with spring semester seniors trying to get their 400 level credit",
    "I really liked the course!! Halfway through, they made the psets less technical and more comprehensive, which was really the right choice for a course like this (only a few people know anything about neuroscience). I would say maybe assigning small groups to present on the papers we read each week, instead of discussing in a giant group, would perhaps be best; I know the course was larger than expected, but that would be my suggestion for the future to let everyone engage.",
    "This course had a lot of potential, however, since it is listed as an economics class, there is too much science. If this course was able to relate more to economics, it would be more engaging for the students taking the course",
    "Material was much too dry. The problem sets did not help my learning at all. And they were not graded fairly.",
    "Overall a good course. It might benefit from being slightly smaller to foster more discussion.",
    "You will learn how to write effective research papers and also how to read them. You will also become a lote more familiar with how research is done (techniques, methods etc.), which is great. I think the lectures could have been a little more engaging, but I was overall very interested in the course. I also got a lot of feedback on how to improve, which was great.",
    "Professor Levy is wonderful. Material is a bit dry.",
    "I liked that we worked on the same proposal idea throughout the course of the semester. But I wish more economics concepts were integrated into the course",
    "I really liked that the main project of the course was a neuro-economics experiment of your own design. It really helped you apply what you learned and increased engagement with the project because you had a lot of freedom in choosing a topic that interested you.",
    "Really interesting class. Very well structured to explore the cutting edge of the field.",
    "Interesting material, Manageable workload, Professor is extremely nice\r\n\r\nFelt like the discussions of the papers in class could have been shorter\/did not need to take up entire lectures",
    "I thought the course was overall very interesting, prof levy is great and the lectures are good. The readings were a bit hard to understand sometimes but that comes with the territory. Thought it probably would've benefitted from a no-laptop policy, seemed like most everybody was just on their ;aptops constantly, not paying attention at all.",
    "This course features really interesting lectures and a very creative final assignment.  The only weakness of this course might be that some of the problem sets (based on often opaque neuroscientific papers) are pretty challenging."

   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in neuroscience, take this course. If you are interested in economics, do not take this course.",
    "Yes- easy enough as an advanced Econ course. You get out what you put in. Use the TA and Prof Levy as resources",
    "YES! Take this course! Best econ seminar ever! However, you should be interested in behavioral econ or neuroscience, or else you might find it boring. It's a really reasonable workload - readings, about one pset every week and a half, and three paper proposals with a presentation - but reading the papers takes a couple hours if you don't know anything about neuroscience. Dr. Levy is also amazing! She really cares about everyone, and is probably the only Econ professor I've ever had that actually listened to our midterm feedback and improved the course (the psets were wayyy too technical for people with no science background, but she adjusted them accordingly so that if you took time on them, you could do really well). Overall, really amazing course! If you're at all interested in neuroscience, even if you have no prior experience, you should take it!",
    "Yes, if they are interested in science science, and not just econ.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they have a deep and passionate interest in neuroscience. There isn't much a of connection to economics.",
    "Yes take it! So interesting",
    "Definitely. I think this course has more work than it seems from the syllabus or the past reviews, but overall it is super manageable. It is really interesting and very different from most classes in the Econ Major. Professor Levy is great. She cares a lot about the material and is super approachable.",
    "Yes. As a cognitive science major, I thought the course gave me great insights on how to conduct research and how both economics and neuroscience come together. You may sometimes get lost during lectures, but if you pay enough attention all the material is manageable.",
    "No, unless you're really interested in neuroscience.",
    "If youre interested in learning a little bit about neuroscience and a lot about neuroscience studies\/papers about economics stuff, then take the course!",
    "If you want a relatively relaxed course that is also interesting",
    "yes!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone pre-med, psychology, economics, or cognitive science student. This course truly captures the essence of interdisciplinary study and is accommodating to all, regardless of what your background is.",
    "No. I would not recommend this class as I dont see any benefits it had on my Yale education. I went in to the class knowing as much as I left the class with.",
    "Absolutely. Very fascinating class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Professor Levy is so knowledgeable and a very effective lecturer, and she is incredibly patient as well. One of my favorite classes at Yale, hands down!",
    "Yes. Great class, professor is fair and approachable, Interesting material, would recommend if you need another econ credit or just want to take a cool class",
    "No, this class was hard to sit through. I never felt like I left the class having learned anything interesting or useful.",
    "Great senior lecture. It's light on work, but the material is challenging enough to keep you interested. You get a good understanding of how the brain works (at least when it concerns decision making). The final paper is very interesting to write.",
    "Definitely recommend. Super interesting stuff about valuation and choice, as well as neuroscience.",
    "I would.  It's much more of a neuroscience class than an economics one, but it is a great way to gain exposure to a field that will dramatically impact the work of economists going forward."
