                "I improved my ability to take facts from literature and art and actually elaborate on them to form opinions and insights.",
                "During this course I learned how to read literature that I was not familiar with to understand its underlying themes and the way it relates to the Belle Epoque. I learned how to ask questions I hadn't asked before, and I learned how to understand these works on a deeper level.\r\n\r\nI also learned how to evaluate artwork on a deeper level, and understand more of what is being depicted in the images. I was able to connect the themes of the works to the Belle Epoque and the way they were impacted by the period.",
                "I came away from this class with a vast knowledge of the literature and art during the Belle Epoque period in France. From reading authors such as Proust, Zola, Alain-Fournier and so many others, I got a real sense for the writings during this time in history and therefore felt as though I were a French citizen myself reading about ideas that were important to me such as the economy at the time and how it was changing  with the addition of the department store, the idea of social class interactions, how the system of education worked, when families took vacations, how the social circle worked, etc. I also learned how to identify works of art as Impression or as one of the surrounding periods of art history based on its characteristics, from segregated colors and one of four proper subjects from neoclassical art, to bright vibrant colors and shapes in fauvism, to visibly small brushstrokes and a dreamlike quality and a focus on regular people and their everyday work and life events that wouldnt have been allowed to be shown in the salon during Impressionism. From making personal connections with these works, I will never forget many if not most of them.",
                "I developed a better understanding of the historical context of Belle Epoque France, as well as the literary, artistic, intellectual, and stylistic movements that defined it. I was exposed to literature and art from a place and time period I had not previously studied in-depth and gained a newfound appreciation for the significance and beauty of those works.",
                "Learned a ton about some aspects of French history, and developed strong literary analysis skills. The course also provides the opportunity to gain insights about the world and how it has been driven by human thinking and attitudes from the characters we learned about in the books we read."

                "Strengths: good variation of activities, both professors were excited about the material \r\nWeakness: could be more participation in powerpoint presentations, i.e. open ended questions",
                "strengths: content, professors, organization of course (Literature + Art)\r\nweaknesses: organization of the readings. I believe we should have been given more time to complete the readings (have the WS due on Thurs instead of Tues)",
                "I felt that even though the class was on Zoom, the lessons were delivered very nicely and I understood all of the information. Given the current circumstances the class was still very informational and I was able to read the books and view the images well. I received plenty of feedback on my work and I felt that the comments were very helpful!\r\n\r\nI did not find any weaknesses with the course, I thought that the lessons were all very informational and interesting. I am very satisfied with the content of this course and the way it was delivered.",
                "In all honesty, I wouldnt change a thing about this course. The readings given were the perfect length to match the pace of the course, the artwork translated well to the online zoom format (I was able to view all the art on my screen, for example), the worksheets assigned really helped with my comprehension of the literature and allowed me to practice writing for the final paper and also allowed me to recognize deeper insights and details of the works.",
                "The syllabus is a strength of this course. I found all the works to be engaging and worth reading. Each one brought something different to the table and gave me a new perspective on the Belle Epoque. The seminar format was well-suited to discussing the literary works, and I gained new insights from both my peers and the professor. I also greatly enjoyed the artistic works we looked at. Their grouping by genre enabled me to see the development of artistic techniques and styles throughout the period and how each movement either built upon or repudiated those that came before it. Visual art is more difficult to discuss in a seminar format, but the description of each work and its artist by the professor was highly informative and interesting.",
                "The strengths are definitely the professors. They are absolutely amazing. Improvements could be perhaps lesser amount of readings, although I would say it was quite manageable."

                "I would: it covered a wide range of belle poque art yet was able to go into immense detail about  the artist's life and the details of their work.",
                "Yes! Beautiful topics and the loveliest professors.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it provided great insight on many aspects of the Belle Epoque. Despite being a French history course, it offered great insight in literature, art history, music, and more. The course covers such a wide range of subjects that I think anyone would enjoy it. My professor left very helpful comments on my work that will help me in future classes, and I think other students would gain valuable insight from this course.",
                "Most definitely yes. The Belle poque period of French history is so rich that I couldnt think of a better time to study. The art history portion wasnt stressful with memorization which allowed the students to really appreciate the art more and remember even more by default. The slides review at the end is very fun. The novels and plays and short stories chosen for reading cover a nice range of themes and topics to address. I think that the syllabus had the perfect content choices.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is enthusiastic about French culture, and even those who appreciate studying art and literature more generally. This period is called the \"Beautiful Epoch\" for a reason and produced countless works worth studying.",
                "Yes, absolutely take this class. As a STEM major, this was the best humanities class since it was very accessible and the professors were great."
