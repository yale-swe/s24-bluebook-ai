                "The daily assignments and class was useful for learning material, but the quiz format of the daily assignments were extremely stressful and brought down grades  I felt that I learned more with the format of last semester, when we got detailed feedback on the assignments instead of the generic canvas answer key.",
                "The course is a very strong language course.  It is rigorous, featuring daily homework, daily class times, and is fast paced.  This can sometimes be difficult, as the course is very time consuming, but also very rewarding.  I strongly feel that the course has improved my Russian language skills immensely.  Furthermore, the instruction style of the course is very interactive and features a lot of opportunities to respond to questions in both written and oral form, which is very fun and skill-building.  The course is also very structured and organized, and I feel that attention is given to each student in the course.  We were provided with clear feedback from instructors, as well as easy access to instructors outside of class through office hours if we desired additional practice or instruction.",
                "The course is very very strong, with the professor and teaching fellow being amazing. I dont know how it could be improved much."

                "Absolutely. Russian is a really complicated language and L2 is a lot more complex than L1, but it is so so so worth it. So rewarding and really fun, even if it got a bit overwhelming at times",
                "Absolutely. Although L2 is definitely a leap in difficulty from L1, its still a well-organized and well-facilitated class. Challenging but never too overwhelming.",
                "Yes, definitely. Professor Titus is a wonderful person who genuinely cares about her students. She will not penalize you for missing class and will help you catch up on work missed. One of the TAs - Alana - is also extremely helpful and caring.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in leaning Russian this class will definitely do it, and the professors, TFs, and classmates were all very interesting and helpful.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who wanted to learn Russian, because this course does an incredible job at helping students to build that skill.  Not only is the course super effective and useful, but the class becomes to feel like a community for students.  I personally feel that having a community of other students also interested in learning Russian was an instrumental aspect in my growth in the language.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Its challenging at times but very rewarding and interesting. The teaching staff is great and very supporting, they made class a joy to attend everyday."
