    "This course was structured so that students had weekly oral assignments (one-on-one, 15-30 mins) and a weekly lecture class (1.5 hours). During these orals and weekly classes, Professor Aletheiani gave us short articles and grammar worksheets to practice our writing and gain new vocabulary. I felt that the class was well-structured (free-form style) and learned quite a lot through current films, academic resources, and excerpts from newspapers\/media. As someone who lived in Indonesia, I felt that Dr. Aletheiani's class also focused on building cultural awareness\/cultural competence among students. Furthermore, she hosted several out-of-class meetings (a picnic with Indonesian food) and also helped to coordinate the visitation of the Sultan of Jogyakarta (a wonderful event!).",
    "More about Indonesia culture and history, kept up language skills",
    "Grammar and sentence structure, more fluidity in my speaking and writing!",
    "More about Indonesia and the country's history, culture, and religion."

   "comments": [
    "Very free-form. This was a strength and weakness. For students who were driven to learn more about the Indonesian language and culture, many opportunities in class and out of class were provided. Others who were not very interested seemed to do fine in the class as well  there weren't too many homework assignments and the maximum length of essays was 1-2 pages. I think it is ultimately up to the student to gauge their own contributions to the class. Dinny served as a facilitator, more so. This class could perhaps be improved by establishing a set time for orals  my oral assignments kept changing date\/time weekly, and this made it very hard to plan my week.",
    "Strengths: interesting material, lecturer, weekly chat.",
    "Bu does a great job of communicating with the students and helping the students communicate with each other. Every class we speak in Indonesian to each other to gain conversational skills, which then help us to feel comfortable supporting each other's learning development throughout the class.",
    "Perfect class."

    "absolutely",
    "I would! I view the merit of this class to be in the content  Dinny specifically sourced the content of this class from participant responses at the beginning of the semester (i.e.what we were interested in). Thus, it was highly specific to our interests and questions. And I feel that Dinny is a great professor\/resource for anyone studying in the CSEA because of her vast wealth of knowledge of scholarship opportunities, other research, etc. She and this class were great resources in helping me maintain my understanding of the language and continue to delve deeper into Indonesian culture.",
    "Yes if you are interested in keeping up your Indonesian.",
    "Yes! It's so fun and Bu is a great teacher. She loves teaching her language and that makes the students want to learn it! Very engaging and not very time consuming, so overall a good course to take!",
    "Yes it has been the best class I've ever taken."
