I gained a through understanding of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, from both a scientific and sociopolitical stance. I also gained experience in reading critical journal articles from policy, public health, and basic science sectors.",

Content is delivered in a variety of formats, from lectures to readings to documentaries. The content of the class is also quite interesting. \r\n\r\nWeakness -> I wish the class had slightly more time for discussion between students.",

                "Strengths: a great bridge between STEM and the humanities, the class was very much driven by student input (we'd review texts, videos, reports and then come to class discussing what was most prominent to us). Because of this, I think we were able to explore sensitive topics in a careful way\r\nWeakness: N/A",
