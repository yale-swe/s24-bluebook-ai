                "The daily homework was the biggest strength of the course. It helped me reinforce my concepts, and without it, I may have not been able to remember a lot of the language.\r\n\r\nI felt like the in-class time was not used the best, as we rarely were taught a concept; rather, the class time was used to go over the homework. In my opinion, it would have been even more helpful if we used daily class time to learn the concepts that the homework would test us on.",
                "Strengths include small class number and group work. Weaknesses include abrupt change in level of difficulty.",
                "The course would have been better if it was conducted in Arabic more often. I feel like I came to class ready for the discomfort of more immersion, but explanation usually was in English. I also really would have liked to have a native Arabic language partner to practice with. A strength was definitely the instructor who was a pleasure to spend time with four days each week. She did her best to create a comfortable space for all of us."

                "I would recommend this class to students interested in studying Arabic for the beauty and richness of the language. I would not recommend this course to those interested in being in the military. It was extremely emotionally challenging to share a space with those people who want to use the language in these ways. There was a stark contrast between Muslim students and students who are of Arab descent and those students who were studying Arabic for military or political ends. If you are in the latter category, please think carefully about the way your presence effects those around you.",
