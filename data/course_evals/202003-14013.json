                "I received an extensive introduction on the theories of Afrofuturism, queer speculation, and posthumanism. I also learned a lot about specific artists and authors and their various approaches to futurism. And arguments against Afrofuturism.",
                "I learned how broad Afrofuturism can be, ranging from extremely fantastical and sci-fi imagery to \"mundane\" Afrofuturism, as well as the revolutionary potential of Afrofuturism beyond being just a genre. I also think that I am a little better at reading theory now.",
                "I learned a lot about the cultural aesthetic of Afrofuturism as well as the history of it. I also learned new philosophical approaches. I got to practice the skill of analyzing manifestos and other forms of writing and applying their opinions to real-world experiences. I got more insights into the racial biases found in technology and society. I was also introduced to many black authors, artists, and film makers who use Afrofuturism in their work.",
                "I gained a grounding in the genre of Afrofuturism and how its works and artists fit into a broader message of black imagination and liberation. We talked about the genre highlighted potential societies, and occasionally utopias, that departed from the status quo and in doing so highlighted the steadfastness of our current culture. Many of these themes centered around technology, and we learned a lot about how blackness and technology are linked in everything: cultural imagining, critical analysis, and present systematic oppression. Additionally, we discussed themes of symbiosis and colonialism--and how the two could be used in Afrofuturist work to highlight present power structures. The works themselves comprised a broad spectrum of media--music, fiction and non-fiction literature, film, and other fine art.",
                "I developed research skills, writing skills, presentation skills, and analytic skills.",

                "I learned about the genre of Black speculative fiction Afrofuturism and its use within different types of media like books, film, music, fashion, etc.  I learned how it is a tool for liberation for Black people, and used to analyze our past, present, and future."

                "Really interesting material and the energy in the seminar fostered a safe community to explore. However the amount of material that we are expected to read each week is way too much. This is was difficult because the readings are very convoluted and usually took me a couple times to understand what is being said. This made it impossible some weeks to get through it all on top of my other coursework. Not fully engaging with the readings means that some days I couldn't fully engage in the discussion, despite wanting to because I truly loved this class. There were also I lot of topics or ideas in the readings that I did not understand and I wished were taught in class. The students do a lot of talking in the seminar but I wish some time was used by the professor to explain things.",
                "A strength was that it was just so interesting! I constantly felt challenged to think about things in a new and different light, and I enjoyed so much of it. Maybe a slight weakness was that the amount of reading we had to do could be very heavy at times, but this was balanced by lighter days.",
                "The discussion form of the classes on canvas were extremely successful and allowed us to get a better understanding of our readings. Zooms were mostly student-led and allowed for real open conversations which were also a strength. However, sometimes the readings were so long and dense I couldn't make out the complete messages and motifs. I felt like I was missing part of what I was meant to gain from the readings.",
                "I'd say the greatest strength of the class was its seminar style format and the discussions therein. The readings\/viewings\/listenings themselves were very interesting; however, class itself was when I learned the most through the insight of my peers and the professor. Additionally, discussion posts made before class even started helped clarify our thoughts and prime us for class itself. Finally, the overall themes of the class remained constant throughout, and it was easy to watch the work we did build upon itself over time. \r\nOverall, the class doesn't have many glaring weaknesses; however, I think it could be improved by going more in-depth on some of the readings. There were a couple occasions where we  read a novel-length piece over the weekend and spent the exact same time as we would a short story. I think it would have been valuable to go more in depth on those pieces. Additionally, there were a couple of short readings we did that received hardly any discussion in class. However, these were few and far between.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tavia consistently kept the class engaged through materials that spoke to the interests of those present in the class as well as extremely enlightening conversation.\r\nWeaknesses: Work load and difficulty of reading sometimes made it difficult to engage.",
                "Too little people. Other than that this course was perfect!",
                "The strengths are you get to learn so much from the other students around you and their perspectives on things. It built a strong community. The professor is also really flexible and accommodating. \r\n\r\nThere were no weaknesses."

                "I would recommend it simply because it is interesting and exciting content. However it was a lot of work and requires a high level of engagement to gain even a general understanding of what is being discussed.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The readings have such an incredible range and really make you think. There is also a lot of freedom in what to talk about and do the projects in the class about. Overall, this class was just a really pleasant experience.",
                "YES as a first-year seminar you're introduced to a topic that you would probably never be introduced to in other courses. Either to explore are very interesting and very niche writings which makes the course uniquely fun. The professors great and very understanding and all of your major assignments are actually fun to complete. He offers many office hours in meetings with the tas if you feel like you're not understanding the material or there's another grievance you would like to talk about.",
                "Absolutely. If you would like to learn about a cultural genre whose works simultaneously abstract and critique society through the lenses of black liberation, science fiction, and imagination, you will enjoy this class. It will grant you societal and literary perspective, expose you to really cool, and occasionally wack, authors and artists, and present a new mode of thinking about art and black existence.",
