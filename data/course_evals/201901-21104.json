   "comments": [
    "General knowledge about the history and trends of the Hellenstic world, as well as specific information about numerous more specific aspects of the period.",
    "That ancient history is not for me.",
    "slight knowledge of how to write history essays",
    "The development of the Hellenstic world after Alexander the Great's death until the rise of Rome.",
    "Analyzing sources in depth!",
    "HIST 300 was a great introduction to this period in the ancient world. I learned about the types of sources available to historians studying this time period, how to approach those sources, and when to doubt them.",
    "I now understand the significance of the Hellenistic period for the ancient Mediterranean. The course explored in depth the long-term political, social and cultural impacts that Alexander the Great's campaign had on the eastern Mediterranean.",
    "I learned a great deal about the historical events and trends from 340 BC to 31 BC, the Hellenistic period.",
    "How to analyze different historical sources",
    "Good writing techniques and formatting a clear essay.",
    "I learned more about Hellenistic time period and the overall concept of periodization that helps me to better understand other areas of history.",
    "I learned a ton about a period in history rarely covered in your typical textbook, and really gained familiarity with analyzing ancient primary sources.",
    "Throughout this class, we covered major people and events from the time of Philip II of Macedon to Cleopatra VII of Egypt, focusing on the Antigonid, Seleucid, and Ptolemaic Dynasties. Emphasis was placed on trends continuing from before the start of the Hellenistic Period as well as trends that were unique to or begin during that time. The use of primary sources was instrumental to the class, helping us develop skills in identifying, interpreting, and placing documents in their historical context."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course effectively covered the key events and trends of the period without getting bogged down in the complexities of specific moments in Hellenistic history. The readings in Austin did a good job of conveying more specific information about the period, although some of the non-Austin readings could sometimes be a bit overwhelming.",
    "Strength:\r\nLearning about alexander was fun. The rest was kinda dry.\r\nWeakness that could be improved:\r\nMore relavent lectures. The lectures were kinda all over the place.",
    "the lectures try to cover so much information without and assumes you know a lot about the background of the course",
    "This cours is very interesting and the material is presented well. However, the course seemed to jump from different time periods often, which made it difficult to keep the events and their dates in order.",
    "The course has a great reading list with a good mix of primary and secondary sources. In order to improve the course, I would like to see a little more structure in the lectures over the course of the semester. The first half was primarily chronological, then we switched into thematic, and it was somewhat hard to keep events in track when studying for the exam.",
    "The course is very detailed while also covering a range of topics. However, this means some topics were given only a brief survey when they warranted more discussion. A significant portion of the course was devoted to Alexander and his generals. This period was very important, but the emphasis limited the time available for discussion on other topics, such as Ptolemaic Egypt and Seleucid Asia. The writing section was very interesting and highly worth taking. Essay topics were very engaging and enjoyable.",
    "The courses strengths are section and reading. I learned the most from section and the readings. The only issue with the lecture would be the topic of discussion. I felt like in lecture it would have been more helpful to brush over the readings and the time line to help me get a better grasp of everything that was going on. Also, I felt like the amount of readings assigned was over the top. There were a lot of reading assignments that I felt were unnecessary. If there were less readings that were more course specific, I could have spent more time analyzing them.",
    "No one showed up to class but lectures were fun and interesting.",
    "I found the timelines of events to be confusing at times",
    "I think that this courses strengths were how it centered what they wanted you to know and put it on the exam.  This course isn't meant to trick anybody it's more about knowing the bigger themes and being able to bring in smaller details to prove points in this age.",
    "The lecture portion was very interesting, but some of the material was hard to follow because it was not organized chronologically or by region.",
    "The strengths of this course lie in its fantastic subject material, engaging readings, and passionate professor.  It could be improved if Professor Manning re-ordered the lectures to better follow a single timeline.",
    "At times the professor can go through slides a little too quickly, which can make it difficult to listen and take thorough notes simultaneously. However, the powerpoints are posted on canvas, so it is possible to go back and fill in any information that was missed. At times it is difficult to keep track of everything that is happening relative to each other because of the hybrid regional\/chronological order of the lectures. I think this could be easily fixed by having students keep an overall timeline and having a 2 minute overview\/reminder of what was happening during the time covered in that day's lecture in the regions already discussed. Otherwise, I think the powerpoints are very thorough and the lectures bring even more detail. Some of the older secondary readings have parts that have rather questionable biases, particularly against women (most obviously in Forster's handling of Cleopatra VII). This is fine in and of itself, but it would have been more beneficial if there was a conversation addressing those biases and how our society shapes how we view the past. Despite this, I think the course was overall very strong: the readings were always clearly applicable to what we were learning, with context given in lectures, those lectures were very thorough and detailed, and the material pointed us towards making connections and finding trends and patterns that helped us gain a richer and more nuanced understanding of the Hellenistic Period."

   "comments": [
    "No",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in Classical history, as the Hellenistic period represents a key bridge between the Classical Greek and Roman periods.",
    "No. I THOUGHT WE WOULD BE LEARNING ABOUT ALEXANDER THE WHOLE TIME, AND HIS LEGENDARY CAMPAIGN... ....... BUT NO.......WE LITTERALLY SPENT 2 WEEKS ON HIM, THEN SHIFTED TO literally the most boring topics I have ever sat through. Please don't take this class. Just don't do it.",
    "no, the lectures did not teach me much, and without any background knowledge of Alexander the great or The hellenistic world, all the readings were hard to understand, and the average amount of reading per week was 200 pages",
    "I would recommend this course to whoever is interested in ancient history.",
    "Yes it gives you an interesting background to hellenistic history!",
    "Absolutely, particularly if you have no exposure to ancient history. The Hellenistic world is fascinating and so many of the themes from this epoch are applicable to moderns. Prof. Manning is a star who really knows his stuff and has an infectious enthusiasm for this period in time.",
    "100%. The course is very interesting and the workload is not too intense. Regardless of whether you take the WR section, you will learn a lot about the Hellenistic Period.",
    "Yes.  It explores an interesting part of history most students have little to no knowledge about.",
    "If the student is looking to be an ancient history major then definitely yes. Also, if the student needs to fulfill a writing or history credit, it was a good course to take. It definitely had moments of a lot of work but overall not terribly tough.",
    "Yes because it is a good history of Alexander and the creation of the post-hellenistic Mediterranean world.",
    "I would recommend this to a student if they are comfortable with reading a large amount each week",
    "I would.  This class is interesting and helped fill a gap for me from the time of the Greek Empire to the uprising of the Roman empire.",
    "Yes, the course was very informative for both history-oriented students and those not typically inclined toward this subject matter.",
    "I would.  It's a great introduction to the \"decline\" of the \"Greek world\" and the rise of the Roman one.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially if you are looking for a WR credit. The material is presented in an interesting way and you develop critical thinking and evaluation skills. Whether or not you are very knowledgeable about history, the topic is just tangential enough from more mainstream history that someone casually interested in history has a frame of reference, while the more deeply invested still has something to gain."
