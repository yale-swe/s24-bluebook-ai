                "Thinking critically about historic events not just as distinct entities, but as a progressive sequence. Thinking how modern events relate to empires at the dawn of civilization.",
                "I definitely learned a lot about ancient history through this course. Specifically, I learned about the climate of the ancient world and how that climate affected ancient civilization. I also think that we learned a lot about modern archaeological research, debates within the archaeological community, and how to best read archaeological research papers.",

                "I cannot stress this enough, but this course was amazing!!!! On top of having a light workload in comparison to most other classes, the topics covered in the class are absolutely fascinating. Not only do you get insights into the historical/archaeological record, but most classes are punctuated by Professor Weisss stories from his digs in Northern Iraq.",
                "The strength was the professor's passion for the material. He was very knowledgable and spoke extensively about his work and how it relates to what we know today about these civilizations. The biggest weakness was a complete lack of discussion. I was hoping for discussion-based class and it was instead more of a lecture with the professor asking occasional questions. There was no discussion between students during class and no opportunity for it. The other biggest issue was the repetitiveness of the class. There were a few instances where entire lectures felt like they were repeated.",
                "Strengths--Professor Weiss is very knowledgeable and is very passionate about the course material.\r\nWeaknesses--Though the class is structured like a seminar, I wish students were prompted for input more often.",
                "Strengths - very interesting content\r\nWeK eases - not conducive to class discussion",
                "I would say that some strengths of the course were that the workload was relatively light and the content itself was very interesting. Some weaknesses were that there was minimal discussion in class since the class was taught almost in a lecture format. It was also challenging to know what you're grade was during the semester because 1/3 of the grade was the midterm, 1/3 was the final, and 1/3 was class participation (which was difficult to assess). I think perhaps some more class-wide discussions about the content and its implications could be very rewarding and improve the course, but I still think the class was good overall.",

                "I would not recommend this if you're looking for an engaging seminar/discussion class. The content itself was interesting but I found the format of the class incredibly dull.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as it was a fascinating exploration of the origins of civilization as well as the modern history (WW1-present) of the region of Mesopotamia.",
                "Probably. This class seems like a banner for the first-year seminar program. I'm not sure if anyone in the class took it to major in NELC, but we were all exposed to a line of study that is different from our own. The class was a little messy at times, and sometimes instructions were a bit unclear. However, I found myself engaged in it class after class.",
                "Yes - but not if you are really looking for a seminar. Much more like a small lecture.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Even though there are some weaknesses, I think the topic was fascinating and the workload was light. I think this a good class for both history majors who want to explore Mesopotamian history in greater depth later in college and other students who just want to take an interesting class about history.",
                "Yes. Unique knowledge, a very experienced professor."
