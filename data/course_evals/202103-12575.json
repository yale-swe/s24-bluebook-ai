                "After talking about the definition of the Right, each class focused on the Right's views on a different topic, such as time, space, race, violence, gender, religion, etc.\r\nI was exposed to a lot of thinkers from the last 200 years, and I gained a better understanding of the history of various currents of thought on the right. Most of our readings, and most of our conversations, focused on the past, but it was never very difficult to see the connection to the current day. \"GLOBAL right\" feels like a little bit of a misnomer, because all of our readings were European or American, with the exception of one about ISIS.",

                "macro view of the Global Right",
                "This was a truly excellent course, and one of the most engaging classes I have taken at Yale. The course is structured as a discussion, with readings that each week interrogate the intersection of the Global Right with different themes -- space, religion, gender, racism, etc. -- and consequently contends with some very difficult themes. Professor Stern treats each topic with sincerity and seriousness, while building a culture of respect and discourse within the class. \r\n\r\nIn this course, you will build a strong understanding of the Global Right and its history, origins, and rhetoric. You will read and critically analyze the works of some of the most influential right-wing authors, make sense of conflicting themes, and shed light on the historical evolution of the right from the French revolution to January 6th. The course additionally features some of the most luminary scholars of the global right as guest speakers.",
                "This was a great class with fascinating discussions. I gained an extensive knowledge of right-wing thinking with the readings, and it the guest lectures were always facinating."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: I found most of the readings very interesting, especially the weeks about capital, time, gender, and religion. The course touched on many themes that I already had some awareness of, but hadn't really understood until we talked about them explicitly, and I feel that I understand the Right better after having taken the class.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, our discussions felt a little intellectual, more focused on the right-wing intelligentsia than on mass right-wing movements. I think it would have been nice if we sometimes more often had supplementary readings from modern politicians on the right that we could compare to the historical sources we were reading. Part of this is that we ran out of time and had to condense the last two weeks, when we were talking about religion and science.",
                "This class had great readings and Professor Stern brought in great guest speakers. The class was solely based around discussions though, which were enjoyable, but I did wish there could have more some more activities or assignments that allowed us to engage with the material in a different way.",
                "The course was slightly unstructured but the readings were informative. There could be more information shared in lecture.",
                "Sometimes it was hard to follow the professors lectures (sometimes lacked a solid throughline and could be hard to take notes at time) and students would often bring in outside knowledge that made it hard to fully understand what was going on in the class discussion because of this seemingly esoteric knowledge.",
                "strengths: prof stern\r\nweaknesses: can feel disorganized at times (this improved as the semester went on), the party of the right kids talked about stuff no one else had read which was annoying",
                "I think our professor's teaching style and engaging presence helped maintain class discussions, but I thought that there were a few reading sources that didn't seem to fit the subject of the class (or how they fit was explained), especially with Ernst Junger's book. I also think that discussions could profit from more structure. We had a habit of going off on tangents away from the reading material and towards subjects and sources that only the professor and a small select group of students were familiar with. I think that the constantly changing location of the class was extremely confusing and I would have preferred that we stay in the classroom. Also, we only reviewed western \"right\" thinkers and movements and I had expected the course to have a global perspective.",
                "The discussion was often quite aimless",
                "The biggest strength of the course was the excellence of Professor Stern, who was so thoughtful and engaging. Another very significant pro was its clean-cut organization, where each week focused on a different -- but interrelated -- theme. The course undertakes the Herculean task of making something as broad, amorphous, and changeable as the 'Global Right' into an understandable concept. \r\n\r\nOne weakness is that the first meeting of the course was very philosophically-focused on the French Revolution, which may have scared off some people by coming across as a bit more dense or 'in-the-weeds' than the class truly was. That being said, it was a fantastic class, with very productive and constructive dialogue. I would highly recommend this to anyone.",
                "The Strengths were definitely the readings and the discussions, and the assignments. There were no real weaknesses",
                "Very interesting material, but very loose in terms of the structure and order of the curriculum."

                "Yes. When I read the news, I now have a better understanding of the historical basis for the philosophy of the Right. We had a lot of really interesting discussions, and I enjoyed reading some of the very extreme views of some of our readings, such as Evola. I am on the left, so I wasn't expecting to agree with many of the readings, but they were presented in a way that felt reasonable. The course didn't seem to biased either way (except when we had overtly racist readings, with which everyone disagree, of course), which I liked. The reading load was reasonable, although it varied from week to week, and there were one or two weeks when we had more than 200 pages.",
                "I would recommend this course. Professor Stern definitely has a very specific teaching style that can be a little daunting at first but he really looks out for his students and wants everyone to be able to participate and engage with class materials. I learned a lot of the complexity of the global right and its philosophies in new ways that challenged many of my preconceptions about what the right really is.",
                "prof stern is great and makes you really think through your positions. he isnt afraid to challenge you in class and classes can get derailed (in a good way imo) if he gets going on a subject, so if youre not into that, or youre not willing to consider the thinkers of the right as serious intellectuals as he does, the class isnt for you. but if you are, definitely take it",
                "No - the readings were interesting but class discussion not helpful",
                "Yes! I would very highly recommend this course! If you are seeking to develop and understanding of the historical and intellectual underpinnings of the Global Right and how they manifest today, this is an excellent class for you. This class provides the opportunity to critically analyze and rigorously interrogate the different philosophies of the right-wing and its evolution from the 18th century to present. The class provided invigorating conversation and constructive dialogue. If you are willing to engage with the material and with your peers, you will gain so much from this class. I would go so far as to say that this has been one of the most memorable classes I have taken thus far.",
                "I would Absolutely recommend this course! professor stern is a great professor, assigns great readings, and assignments. Be prepared to do a good amount of reading if you want to get involved in the discussions."
