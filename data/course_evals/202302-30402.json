                "The course was poorly organized, and the instructors showed a lack of consideration for students' time. Professor Barnes spent almost 30 minutes of the first day of class trying to figure out the basics of Canvas and Zoom. For over two weeks of the five week class, the course page had the wrong syllabus posted on Canvas with assignments that showed due dates of previous years, and had the wrong assignment days (\"ex: Final Paper Thesis Post Due Wednesday, June 29th by 12:00 Noon, June 29th was a Thursday) for several assignments, making it very confusing to submit. Professor Barnes refused to answer emails as a matter of policy because she was \"on vacation\", and insisted on Canvas only, a fact which was also not posted anywhere on Canvas. I would estimate that 30-40% of class time was spent in breakout rooms, which were usually silent. \r\n\r\nWhen I took Howard Foreman's policy class, I walked away with a very solid understanding of the mechanics of healthcare policy  how things are funded, where that funding goes, what is covered by certain policies, and which organizations are in charge of what. When I asked similar basic questions of Dr. Barnes, I got an \"it depends\". \r\n\r\nEach time the lecture covered a particular school or housing policy, the focus was on the many ways that policy perpetuates systemic inequality or racism. When I asked what policies are effective at promoting equity and achievement, or at least less harmful, Professor Barnes gave an \"it depends\". When I asked if any particular school or residential districts had been effective, or less harmful, in promoting equality, she said \"I don't know of any, and I think that's very telling\". \r\n\r\nI don't disagree that education and housing policy in the United States is systemically racist and deeply unequal, but I already knew that, and I'm sure my classmates did too. I did not take this class to get an easy credit. I took this class because I sincerely wanted to learn how this country works, and because I believe it is every student's responsibility to be an informed voter and citizen. If it is the position of the Yale Education Studies Department that education and housing policy can *only* be harmful and can *never* be a force for good, then I would argue the subject is not a good use of five weeks of students' time. I was very disappointed with my experience in Education Studies S255E.",
                "One major strength of the course was the thorough feedback Prof. Barnes provided for all of the writing assignments. Another was how Dr. Barnes wove such a variety of readings together to create a really comprehensive overview of such a wide topic in just 4 weeks. The multiple final-paper assignments helped me manage and plan for the final paper (which initially seemed daunting to me). The one weakness was, I think, inherent to the online medium- people didn't engage much over Zoom compared to in an in-person seminar. However, I do think the student facilitation helped with that for some of the class sessions.",
