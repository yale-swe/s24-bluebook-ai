A healthy dose of humility and grace was my main take away from this experience."

                "All answers for this course are hugely dependent on your relationship with your advisor. In my instance, working with Kyle Dugdale was a total treat. He required a level of discipline, rigor, and seriousness that enabled me to feel proud of my work.  Strength of this course, when working with Kyle, include 1) weekly meetings with him to discuss progress, 2) strict stylistic standards (hand-type your footnotes, please; have a standard typesetting style for all thesis related documents), 3) his wealth of far-reaching, niche, esoteric references that make for a wonderful academic, rhetorical playground! I also think that Brunno and George did an excellent job with my casual drop in visits to their MED desks this semester. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses of this course include 1) wishing I had established a relationship with Kyle last semester in the middle of colloquium, 2) not having a communal workspace for HTC students (I felt like I benefitted from having my design friends pop over to my desk and share their ideas with me as I was working through concept/layout/ideas. It would have been great to have a communal workspace for non-design students, so I would--selfishly--be encouraged to work on my project earlier in the term) and 3) the overall connection between Colloquium and the actual thesis writing. \r\n\r\nIn hindsight, I realize that colloquium was most helpful to me because it gave me extended time to thing about something. By the time I was in crunch time, I had written very little, but I felt oddly confident. Somehow most of the information had been figured out in my brain because of the sheer amount of time it had sat there. I am not sure what precisely my criticism is of colloquium now that I have completed the second half of the sequence, but I think there is room to improve the first semester of the 2-term thesis sequence. Maybe this would be encouraging students to reach out to advisors and incorporate them into the colloquium process earlier in the year; maybe it would be dividing the Urban Studies and Architecture students (the difference in type of work was apparent during the first semester, and became more obvious at the final presentation); maybe it would be providing a communal, physical workspace."

                "The architecture thesis is an opportunity to explore something that interests you. Because architecture, as a major at Yale, is kind of a free for all (at least in terms of the types of approaches it celebrates/encourages/teaches), your thesis is fundamentally different from nearly every other department. My encouragement for future students is to continue to keep all of these modes of knowing, representation, and analysis active as you plan your project. During the colloquium, I often felt like I was being encouraged to follow a more tradition essay approach. I wish that I had stuck to my original ambition and done more of a creative project that involved more making. This is all to say that the architecture thesis is incredibly open ended, and don't lose sight of that during the colloquium where you will be invariably surrounded by students from a similar, but different discipline (Urban studies) and the pedagogy lean towards traditional thesis essays. \r\n\r\nI also would encourage you to select an advisor who you think you will enjoy working with, whose opinion you respect, and whose ideas excite you. They will be one of the few other people involved in your project, and you want to enjoy it!"
