Coming from a background in other ER&M classes about Asian American history and critical refugee studies, I really wanted to learn more about Korean history, U.S. imperialism and militarism, and how these two have deeply intersected and impact the experiences of Korean people. This class allowed me to learn/think about all of these and far surpassed my expectations. It was lovely through and through and I would recommend to anyone. I hope Yale has more classes like this in the future, and I know that my classmates would agree. There just are not enough classes about specific Asian ethnic groups and their experiences via an ethnic studies lens.",
                "I learned so much by taking this class. Even while coming from the culture that is mostly discussed within the course, I felt that my knowledge of the subject matter improved vastly throughout the course of this class. It is nuanced and tackles many different methodologies and perspectives, which really allows you to generate your own thoughts from the readings and discussion.",

                "Strong historical understanding of the Korean War and how to critically interrogate its meaning, but basically taught me how to ask more incisive questions (both specifically and generally speaking). Better understanding of how to comparatively examine a subject across mediums and disciplines, as well as how to engage in archival research."

Madeleine was also a great instructorshe was really supportive and offered a lot of really valuable insight!\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more feedback throughout the semester. That's not to say Madeleine should get rid of ungrading, but perhaps a midterm report where we got feedback about how we were doing and anything that we could improve upon would have been helpful.",

                "Yes! Super engaging, learned so much with little background knowledge about Korean and American history.",
                "Yes! I wish this was a course that is taught regularly but if it ever gets taught again, I would highly recommend anyone who is interested in East Asian history or American Studies to take it. Even if you aren't within either of those majors, I believe there is so much to take away from this course and it's not just focused on Korean history either, but gives a really good perspective on events like the Cold War and World War II as well.",
                "Yes.",

I'm still blown away by how engaging and generative they are to my understanding of the Korean War, how I tackle ethnic studies, and of course, the broader themes of this class such as militarization, Cold War critique, etc. I will be thinking about the discussions and materials of this class for a long time."
