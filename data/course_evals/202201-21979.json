                "After taking Professor Goldsby's course, I feel like I have a sense of the evolution of Baldwin's social criticism over his decades-long writing career. I  have a greater appreciation for Baldwin as a novelist as well as an essayist.",
                "I got the chance to study Baldwin's thoughts on the state of Black and white Americans, the Civil-Rights Era, homosexuality, being away from home, and love, among other things. I got to observe his attitudes change over time and track how he uses fiction to try to change the world.",
                "This was a fantastic small lecture on Baldwins canon and broad, recurring ideas. Ive gained huge amounts of experience and familiarity with his nonfiction and fiction (and the way that fiction exemplifies or reflects his nonfiction). Critical reflections helped me practice consolidating my thoughts. Some highlights include queer and interracial relationships as transgressive, futuristic social connection in Another Country and Baldwins definitions of sensual living, blues, prisons of categorization. This course simply successfully helped students understand and contextualize Baldwins interpretation of art, race, and mid 20 century America.",
                "I learned so much in this course, as Baldwin's literature is not solely a text an individual reads and then moves onto their life outside of it, but instead provides many learning lessons/lenses for how life should be lived. Baldwin's embrace of sensuality, love, and the critical need for each individual to self-reflect changed my prioritizations in my day to day life where I tried to celebrate the world as he does. I also learned so much more about the Civil Rights Movements and the tough relationship Baldwin (and many Black Americans) have with America which I never possessed beforehand.",
                "lots of practice close reading; comparative analysis skills for different works by the same author",
                "This course thoroughly engages with the essays, fiction, and literature of James Baldwin.",
                "An amazing breadth of knowledge about different themes in and ways of reading James Baldwins life and work! Also honed the ability to write close reading essays.",
                "I learned so much about Baldwin's philosophy. I learned about the role of the artist in society, what it means to live sensually/in the moment, and Baldwin's views on love and Black resilience and community. I learned how to dig deeper into fiction and nonfiction works, and I loved everything we read.",
                "A broad but in depth overview of James Baldwin's life, fiction, politics, essays, aesthetics / style, etc.",
                "This course definitely required me to polish up my literary analysis and writing skills.",
                "I loved the depth of commentary and extraordinary insight this course provided me. Absolutely one of my favorite classes at Yale, ever.",
                "The most useful skill I learned in this class was how to keep up in a class where we read almost constantly. I have never had to read so much for a class before, but it was a great skill to learn. I also became really familiar with Baldwin's writing, and became a huge Baldwin fan in the process!",
                "extensive review of jame's balwin's canon, practice in interpreting literary works in the context of history",
                "How to build communal love, self-acceptance, and the moral energy that it takes to free myself from the prison of the social category, how to analyze quotes with intriguing prose",
                "I learned a lot about James Baldwin and the world as he saw it. We read both his nonfiction and fiction, so I gained a lot of insight about his life and his perspectives on race, sexuality, music, art, religion, and so much more. Throughout the class, we worked on close reading and making connections between texts.",
                "This is an incredibly comprehensive course. Studying one author deeply is such a unique experience and I am leaving feeling like I actually know James Baldwin and definitely have a firm grasp of his literature and fiction."

            "comments": [
                "This was the first time the course was taught as a lecture. I appreciated that towards the end of the semester, Professor Goldsby solicited more engagement from students during lecture. I think it would be great to do that throughout the course.",
                "Strengths: Great readings. Great professor. \r\nWeaknesses: I don't love lectures, but they can be much worse than this one.",
                "One issue I had with the course was that the syllabus changed a lot over the course of the semester (in terms of due dates for big assignments and overall course policies), which was frustrating for me because I had planned out my semester around when big assignments were due for all my classes and it changed somewhat last minute and ultimately gave us less flexibility. However, this is the first time the class has been taught as a lecture so that may not be an issue in the future. Other than that it was a good class, Prof Goldsby's lectures were super interesting, and reading Baldwin was really special.",
                "Professor Goldsby is a huge asset to the class  her lectures are extremely thoughtful, intellectually stimulating, and executed with care. The reading selection was really great and felt manageable. \r\nWeaknesses: The critical reflections were graded very harshly  Im talking comma before or after a quotation mark. These reflections require a good amount of intellectual labor. For its amazing literary exposure and connecting, this classs assignments made the experience much more stressful.",
                "This course was excellent. I found the lecture to be a perfect balance between Professor Goldsby sharing her brilliant ideas on the texts, while she also integrated a really nice discussion with the students as well -- valuing each students' ideas and excitedly expanding them herself. I also loved the opportunity to discuss Baldwin's texts in more intimate discussion sections, where I could explore my own experience's with his readings with my classmates in a way that allowed us all to gain a wider appreciation for his genius. I also found the workload to be perfect, where I had the opportunity to read enough of his works that I got to know him as an author super well without feeling overwhelmed by the workload. There is really nothing in particular I would change about this course!",
                "I thought overall it was a very strong course; I would recommend skipping one of the books so the class can spend longer on the other ones.. it moved a bit too fast",
                "If this course were taught as a seminar instead of a lecture, it would be much better in my opinion.",
                "I loved this course! The lectures were highly engaging, and it was amazing to be able to spend so much time with one author. I only wish we had more time to spend on each textsometimes the reading load could be extremely large, and although I wanted to read everything, I didnt always have time to!",
                "The strength was the material. Everything we read changed the way I think, and Prof Goldsby's lectures and my discussion sections were so generative and insightful. This class changed the way I think and in particular the way I approach art. The weakness was that after reading Another Country, we went back to Baldwin's essays for a few weeks and lost a lot of momentum so the 3 weeks after spring break were hard to say engaged since they didn't seem to have an overall arc.",
                "There were a lot of changes being made to the syllabus as the course progressed. This was challenging. Otherwise, the course is excellent.",
                "This was a course with fantastic author and fantastic professor / TA's which really struggled because of its format/design. The best parts of the course were the readings and often the actual process of writing. \r\n\r\nI do not think this kind of course is meant to be a lecture. We met with the TAs only once a week, for 50 minutes, compared to a seminar, which would have 75*2=150=3 times the amount of discussion. The infrequent seminar meetings meant that discussion never really got the chance to take off - I didn't learn everybody's names, it was often silent / awkward because we would be trying to cram too much text into one session. The instructors tried to turn the lectures into a discussion, but it was too late in the semester / we were in a giant lecture hall so we didn't get much traction.\r\n\r\nThe lectures were really, really good, but they should not have been the heart of the course; student exploration of those ideas in a seminar should be. The lectures consistently ran 10+ minutes over, which a lot of students took issue with because they had other commitments. Especially because the lectures were recorded, a lot of students just consistently did not go to lecture. In a pandemic it's important to have a remote option, and I'm not suggesting that this be taken away - I only mean to point out that by design, a literature course which is 75% recorded lectures is going to be disengaging. I took other seminar classes which used zoom / etc to help students in isolation to participate and it worked well. Especially when we were doing another country, which took 4 lectures, I felt that the balance of the course was too far off and the lectures were somewhat repetitive. Genuinely though these lectures were fantastic and enlightening and, independent of the context of the rest of the course, always a bright part of my day.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to assignments, I think the course could benefit from more focused structure. We only wrote one essay, and it was very late, so there wasn't any chance to grow within that form. In a 182 level English course students are already going to be familiar with longform essays, so I don't see the reason to \"build up\" to them with the critical reflection papers. This isn't the only way, but I really like the format of 3 long essays over the course of the semester. Because the form is the same, students are able to take criticism and apply it to the next assignment. Re the critical reflection papers, I was a little confused what to do at first. We didn't receive instructions / a rubric for what these were supposed to be until after the first one was due, so I went of my TAs suggestion to not worry about it, and I wrote a relaxed, discussion-post style response and got a 2/3. Once I learned we were supposed to make an organized argument / a short paper, I was fine for the next two, but I wasn't told anything about what I was supposed to do until after the first assignment. Additionally the syllabus repeatedly changedon the original syllabus we were supposed to have 4-6 critical reflections, 2 critical essays, but the deadlines /requirements were constantly changing. I think the course would really benefit from having a simpler structure decided on at the beginning of the semester. Re the final: I personally don't like quote IDs - it was fine cause it was open book and we could read for context and write that important context into our responses, but the implication was that normally these are in person, without the book - I don't think quote IDs are representative of text comprehension or writing ability. I did really like the final, though, given that it was open bookit allowed me to reflect on the texts on a large scale in a way an individual final paper wouldn't.\r\n\r\nI really respect all of the instructors / TAs as people and every student I know loved the material; I think that with a little more focus on syllabus / course design this course would absolutely shine, especially as a seminar.",
                "I honestly felt like I did not gain a lot from the lectures in this class. The prof was very kind but I didn't find her insights terribly meaningful. So really what it offered me was an opportunity to read and write about a number of Baldwin texts, and discuss them for 50 minutes once a week. But all told that didn't really feel worthwhile to me.",
                "I think the professor isnt afforded enough time to pay attention to the separate works of students, but I also think this is maybe the nature of the lecture course. The strength is how strong of a course it isabsolutely worthwhile for any major.",
                "I think this course's strengths are rooted in its foundation -- Baldwin's writing is so rich and politically and culturally complex that it creates a whole world to look into and explore. \r\n\r\nThis course's main weakness was engagement with the students -- there were times when I fell behind on reading, and I had to realize that I just had to skip some stuff and prioritize which pieces were going to get read. Sections were pretty big, so it was easy to fly under the radar if that's what kind of student you are. It was such a large class, too, and I think it probably would have been better as a seminar.",
                "strengths-- prof goldsby's lecturing is amazing. i really loved this course. i don't have many criticisms.",
                "Strengths: material was AMAZING and drew upon different sources (essays, literature, films); material pushed me to new boundaries of thinking; opened my heart to the goodness of the world; the many writing assignments allowed me to sharpen my analysis and gave me many opportunities to write about subjects that I thought were valuable\r\n\r\nweaknesses: a visit to the beneicke might've been cool",
                "I really loved all of the material we engaged with, especially Baldwins writings. I had not read any of his work before, and this class was an amazing introduction to his clarity and wisdom. Professor Goldsbys also an amazing professor  shes really encouraging and open but also has very insightful remarks about all his work. \r\n\r\nI wonder if the lecture format works as well as the seminar format did. On one hand, having a lecture is really helpful because Professor Goldsby can just share all her knowledge in a more streamlined way, but on the other hand, these texts definitely felt like the kind that would become richer with more personal, in-class discussion and engagement.",
                "Strengths: Professor Goldsby is amazing, she knows the material inside and out. Also, the essays and novels are so amazing and engaging. Doing work for this class does not feel like work it is genuinely so enriching and interesting. \r\nCons: The course lost some of its momentum toward the end of the semester, specifically when we returned to nonfiction before Beale Street. It started to feel a little more disorganized and I was struggling to find the thesis of those lectures.",
                "I don't think that James Baldwin is an author that should have his works read consecutively in such a short span of time. This, of course, isn't a critique of the class itself, but I felt like I started to get tired of reading his writing because they all focused on similar themes such as sexuality, religion, race, etc. If I were to read these texts with time in between, it wouldn't have felt so repetitive and at points unenjoyable. The amount of reading assigned for this class was also generally ridiculous, I started to feel like I was putting in more than I was getting. I think that Professor Goldsby should switch this class back to the seminar format because discussion sections were largely lacking, and I felt like the lectures weren't the best either. There were also constant syllabus changes, which might have been due to this being the first time this course has been a lecture, but it became really annoying when every other week a new syllabus was posted.",
                "Strengths: the professor and the readings she has selected \r\nWeaknesses: the format of the course (lecture), the lack of clarity with assignments/the way assignments would be graded, the engagement of the TFs"

                "If you like to read, definitely take this course. You get a good mix of fiction and non-fiction, and all of it is pleasurable to read. Baldwin was a really interesting man during a really interesting time, and this class puts you right in the middle of all of that. Prof. Goldsby is incredibly smart and kind and thoughtful. I imagine this course being way better as a seminar than as a lecture, but the lecture was still pretty good.",
                "Yes! Getting to focus on Baldwin is fun, and Prof Goldsby is a wonderful lecturer.",
                "Yes, for Professor Goldsby and for the content, but I would seriously warn them about the course/grading structure.",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student, and I already have recommended it to many of my friends. This Baldwin course does not solely enable a student to access some of the most beautifully written literature of all time, but also have a much wider appreciation for how ahead of his times Baldwin was with his discussions on police brutality, queer love, and revealing the intimacies of family dynamics. There are not many classes where I feel that the way I live my life is shaped by what I learn in class, but this class was definitely one of them.",

This course isn't perfect - you'll skip some lectures, you'll skim some readings - but spending a semester with Baldwin's writing and Prof. Goldsby's insights will transform you and the way you see society.

I think the class serves well as a dual-function course, and the content that we consume for this class is incredibly historically prominent and important. It's a lot of reading, so for anyone who struggles to keep up, this might not be the class for you.",

Baldwin is an incredible writerSonny's Blues and Beale St. in particular were crazily goodbut by the end I was a little burnt out by reading only a single writer. Would probably be better as a seminar rather than a lecture (or something in between?).",
