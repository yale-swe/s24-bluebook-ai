The focus was on parties specifically, and how their power or lack thereof influenced the political system. We also read a lot of different views from experts and professors on these subjects so it was interesting to learn about different theories in the topic.",
                "This class was really interesting! I learned a lot about parties in Congress and how we think they function versus how they might actually function. Comparing various theories and ideas over time really helped put things in perspective as to how much parties have changed and how the past informs the present.",
                "A better understanding of how political parties were formed in their American system. Also learned insight into how parties are run and maintained.",

                "I enjoyed the smaller class size but I think the section aspect could be improved by decreasing the amount of readings required by the teacher. Sometimes I felt overwhelmed by the amount of readings required.",

                "This course is extremely well organized; each section seems to flow logically from the previous, and this makes it extremely easy to follow the progression of the three units of the course. However, there is entirely too much readingto the point that it genuinely precludes your capacity to understand the readings in depth. In my view, it's simply not possible to read everything if you want to understand the arguments actually being made. Instead, you have to focus on the core readings and ignore more tertiary topics.",
