   "comments": [
    "I gained many tools for composing music across all genres. I also started learning how to use a digital audio workstation.",
    "I gained experience composing, and got feedback from an excellent YSM composer every step of the way. I also learned what kinds of composition the leading composers of today are writing, and what their approach to composition is.",
    "This class definitely helped me have a creative outlet during the semester. The lectures weren't particularly useful, but I learned a lot from the guest speakers, who were really interesting.",
    "I improved my ability to compose quickly and intentionally.",
    "This course helped me with ear training and musical analysis, mostly through the private TF lessons every week.  I feel a little more confident in my own artistic choices because of musical exposure and discussion.",
    "I developed my abilities as a composer and learned the fundamentals of composing for certain instruments (strings, mallet percussion)",
    "I learnt to compose. I completed my best piece yet and learnt to use modal harmony, as well as extended third chords. I also learnt to use Logic and scored my first scene from a film.",
    "This class helped me develop critical thinking skills related to interpreting others' music, not just my own. I have a better sense of when music is well-written\/structured than I did before I took this course, and given the short amount of time I've composed, I think those skills increased quicker than my composing abilities.",
    "As my first introduction to composition, I learned the finer points of composing a piece in theory with the different diatonic modes and motivic development in tandem with the more practical hands-on composition lessons every week.",
    "Developed a deeper appreciation for certain fundamentals of music (ie. the motif), and got a look into the process of professional composers",
    "I was given the resources (computer lab, private instructor)"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "What we did in lecture didn't always seem super related to what we were working on. Also the portfolio assignments are a bit oddly timed and it seems like there should have been another one. Composition lessons were definitely the highlight of the course. There may have been more students than usual, but it was a bit weird how I never really got grade comments for assignments past the beginning of November.",
    "Being exposed to such a diverse range of compositions, from both faculty composers and other students, was an incredible experience. Having one-on-one lessons with accomplished TAs was also something I greatly appreciated from this course. My main issue with Comp Seminar was that Kathryn, as wonderful a leader as she was, had pretty dry and disengaging lectures. Almost every student I talked to had a hard time maintaining focus as she went over lecture slides for an hour and fifty minutes.",
    "This course could be improved with more frequent feedback from the instructor. I did not receive any grades for any of my work after the second week of class. The strength of this course was in its guest lecturers and its opportunity for working with a teaching fellow from the music school.",
    "I think the course could do a better job assigning TA's to students. While I loved my TA, there simply wasn't much he could help with regarding my compositions, since I was composing in a DAW he was entirely unfamiliar with. I would have loved to work with a TA who was familiar with Logic and had more experience composing more modern pieces.",
    "The private lessons are extremely helpful, but the all-together meetings are less helpful.  I think that in-depth lectures would be more useful than some of the composer presentations.",
    "The one-on-one lessons were amazing.",
    "The strength of the course is undoubtedly the weekly composition lessons. Lessons provided a very valuable setting in which to get extremely valuable feedback on compositions. The weakness of the course might be the actual seminar meetings, as sometimes they don't seem particularly important or educationally valuable. The caveat there of course is that what some students find valuable others might not, so I don't know if that's actually a real weakness or not.",
    "The composition lessons are fantastic. The work is slightly disorganised (its sometimes hard to know what assignments are due when, and the workload is increased dramatically in the last few weeks). Overall, a great class. The class lets you proceed at your own pace (you arent compared to the other students), which is very useful.",
    "Some of Dr. A's lectures about writing for different instruments could show more examples of good\/bad writing for those instruments, especially examples of what not to do. I think I would've gotten way more out of those lectures with more musical examples with good\/bad aspects highlighted. It also would've been nice to have more than 1\/4 of the assignments graded by the end of term.",
    "I think the class was informative with some of the theory, such as diatonic modes, but it gets really slow and boring when it comes to instrumentation. The lecture-style format for these theoretical concepts in mostly a vacuum made me lose interest. I really engaged with some of the speakers that came to give talks during seminar.\r\n\r\nI found the most value in my composition lessons with Laura, who is very well-versed in navigating DAWs like Logic and Ableton while helping me learn best practices in composition overall. I had so much fun getting my hands dirty with the various tools and composition techniques during said lessons!",
    "Generally good -- guest visits facilitated by school of music are great, and one-on-one lessons are super helpful. Only problem is that feedback comes less and less often as the semester progresses.",
    "This course has far too many guest lecturers that produce similar music, aren't particularly engaging, and didn't really add to my learning.\r\n\r\nI wish there was more practical teaching on the actual writing process; what does the workflow of an experienced composer actually look like, and how do I get there? How do I get musical ideas from my head and onto the sheet? What about transcribing exercises? I often felt lost and frustrated while writing my own piece, even though I had great support from my TA. Practical teaching in class was mostly limited to pandiatonicism and instrument properties, which, considering the course was a semester long, felt like a scarce amount of content.\r\n\r\nI also received virtually no feedback on my assignment submissions, and had limited 1-to-1 interaction with my Professor, even though the class is a seminar.\r\n\r\nThis course would also greatly benefit from optional homework on how to increase\/improve DAW or notation-software workflow, for example by practicing keyboard shortcuts. That would have saved me a lot of time in the writing process.\r\n\r\nThis course would greatly benefit from optional homework to exercise technique. I enjoyed the short composition assignments because they pushed me outside of my comfort zone and broadened my horizons as a composer."

   "comments": [
    "Yes absolutely. You can basically do whatever you want and at any level as long as you know basic theory.",
    "Absolutely. More than most other courses, Comp Seminar made me feel like I was making the most of my Yale education. It exposed me to so much incredible music and gave me the opportunity to receive feedback from accomplished instructors. Plus, I got to meet numerous phenomenal composers and see what amazing music my classmates were creating.",
    "This course was a lot of fun. I worked with a teaching fellow from the school of music, which was a really cool opportunity. You get to compose almost anything you want, and then present it to your peers. And you get to hear what your peers have composed, which is great too. I think the reason I liked this class so much was because I took it Credit\/D. The instructor didn't give any grades for most of the year, so if I was worried about a grade this might have been frustrating. But as a creative outlet, I would definitely recommend.",
    "I'd recommend it for students who are interested in developing their composing skills",
    "Yes. This was definitely one of my favourite classes, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in composition.",
    "I came into this class with only a performance background and very minimal music theory. I would recommend taking MUSI 110 first if you have the time, but even if you are trying to take this class ASAP you can take composition seminar off-sequence so it doesn't really matter anyway. Music theory is helpful, but if you are willing to take on the challenge of starting fresh like me, I would recommend taking 110 in tandem to cover the basics of music theory. Expect to not have a clue what's going on when you first learn about topics like the Greek modes or motivic development though.",
    "Yes, this is a very helpful course for anyone interested in composing. The one-on-one lessons are fantastic and super helpful.",
    "Yes, primarily for the access to a private instructor, the computer labs, and a community of other composers."
