The book was also difficult to acquire at a reasonable price. In the end, I bought a supplemental French for Reading textbook, which I used predominantly to learn the course material. Strength of the course was the feedback on translation assignments, which was consistently thorough and helpful.",

                "The course sort of is what it is, I think. It's an online course that keeps you honest about reading and translating French enough that you gain working knowledge of it. It was identical in structure to the German for reading class, so I doubt any major structural changes are in the future for it either way. Obviously, many students were unhappy with certain passages in the textbook, but personally I found it to be valuable preparation for reading primary sources."
