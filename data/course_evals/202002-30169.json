   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about French grammar, sentence constructions, patterns, idioms, and vocabulary.",
    "Great for basic reading comprehension and translation skills",
    "I learned some basics about French conjugation.",
    "I learned how to navigate an unknown academic French texts with a new set of tools to help me achieve a practical level of understanding. I also learned that navigating a foreign language text does not necessarily require fluency in speaking or listening, which has given me more confidence in approaching French language sources.",
    "Comprehending french across a range of fields and time periods",
    "Since I am an international student, which means English is not my first language, I initially thought that learning French from English might be hard work; nonetheless, this course shows me that it is actually much easier to learn French from English. In the five intensive weeks course, we learned the basic grammar of French and practiced lots of translations, which assisted me to get familiar with what I learned every day. I have to admit that I do use a lot of online language tool, such as Google translation and lots of dictionaries, but now I can understand the structure of the French and know what the mistake happened in the online translation. I would not say I am good at French reading, but through this course, I think I can slowly read French academic articles by checking word by word on dictionary, which is something I really need."

   "comments": [
    "There was little feedback provided, and the method of grading confused me (e.g. receiving no comments or a comment that is positive but still not receiving full points on an assignment). I received no feedback on the sentence translations, the midterm\/final, and the work submitted for last week of the course. Some more guidance and interactive feedback from the instructor and teaching assistants would have been helpful.",
    "Best to use a newer textbook, one with readings that are less troublesomely racist and full of outdated science, or pull articles from online to increase our literacy with modern French, as the teachers wisely did at the end of this course",
    "Maybe more tips on how to actuallt do translations and not just on reading comprehension",
    "The strength of the course was the relatively well-designed curriculum that allowed for manageable independent study and the guidance of the TFs as well as an engaged community of students. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were the use of an outdated book, which contained a range of materials that, while appropriate for its publication date, are today considered offensive which was an unnecessary hurdle to navigate. And while the older book used did have a number of very interested texts and was very well structured, a more up to date book would also presumably provide more relevant material. \r\n\r\nWhile the TFs were great in responding as well as they could to the assignments, the assignments were graded days and initially more than a week after submissions, which was challenging as the students did not get early feedback on how well they were doing. The course instructor Karim did not respond any emails I sent, and from communicating with the TFs, I understood that to be a more general problem.",
    "The course was fantastic. The professor drew on both older material and recent news articles for our translation work and the course lectures were straightforward and digestable."

    "No",
    "Absolutely. This was a great way to get my language skills up to par for my degree.",
    "I would definitely not recommend this course if they do not have prior knowledge of French and if they would have to pay for this course.",
    "Yes. It is great for basic knowledge and to fulfill the language requirement.",
    "Some of the sentences we had to translate had typos.",
    "I'm afraid I would not necessarily recommend this course to another student. While I am happy to have taken it, and did gain new skills and knowledge that is relevant to my program, the level of day to day organization was very chaotic, which was difficult to navigate and at times quite stressful. There were a lot of typos in the presentations and exercises, which was an unnecessary hurdle when trying to navigate a new language. I think this could be a fantastic course, but it needs an updated textbook and a more engaged and accountable leadership.",
    "Yes. Great for improving french comprehension and also for learning about different topics (in french)"
