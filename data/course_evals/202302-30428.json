It provided me with some base knowledge about Congress that I did not have previously. Additionally, we got a little bit into some debates about how Congress could potentially be improved or altered to become more effective.",

                "The way the course was designed, between in-class discussions  and the opportunity to be discussion leader on a chosen topic was definitely a strength of the course.",
                "Strengths: Well-structured with an engaging TA and Professor. It was clear they were passionate about the subject, and made the material more interesting to learn. Workload was manageable overall, and readings werent overwhelming. If youre at all interested in Congress/US Politics, this is a great intro course!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The summer class schedule made assignments have a very quick turnaround; if you have family engagements or a summer internship it can be quite difficult to write a well-structured paper in 48 hours. Not a huge deal whatsoever, though just make sure to manage your time well!",
                "Prof. Fairdosi and our TF, Ramon, were both very knowledgeable and engaged with the class. It was fun to learn from them. The biggest weakness was probably that the class was somewhat split in that half the class was quite engaged, while the other half was not. This meant that a lot of the same people ended up speaking much of the time, which might have decreased the variety of perspectives that we could have gotten if everyone had been more engaged.",

                "I would recommend this course to a student looking for an introduction to Congress, but not a deeply philosophical or introspective look at Congress. The meat of this course is at the surface/knowledge level, with a dip but not a dive into deeper learning.",
                "I highly recommend this course to any student looking for a comprehensive, introductory course on the US Congress and a highly-engaging political science course to take in the summer. Professor Fairdosi makes a really strong effort to make the course engaging even online and the discussions we had we always enriching, especially because we had multiple people who had strong experience working for Congress. Ramon, the TA, was extremely knowledgeable and keen to provide key insights into the discussion. The feedback for the essays was extremely clear as well. Thank you for an amazing summer course!",
