I gained some insight from hearing what news she pays attention to, and what articles/sources she reads. \r\n\r\nI also learned the skill of being concise. Dr. Young would give us essay prompts that had very broad (but also excellent) questions, and we would have 5-7 pages to respond. And she expected nuance and policy proposals! I am so grateful for this; I am used to the Yale tradition of writing 30 pages on specific questions; what Dr. Young had us do is much more similar to what those creating briefs/memos would have to do.",

                "It is very well designed for student discussion with very engaging readings. Perhaps there could be less focus on the US.",
                "I do think we spent a little too much time discussing current events, which made the class discussion at the end feel rushed. There is so much to talk about in a course about geopolitics! Other than that, I can only speak positively about this class. Dr. Young's feedback on our essays was remarkable; I have never felt so closely-read by a professor.",
                "Professor Young is a great professor and is incredibly knowledgeable about the subjects we discuss. Sometimes I hope she would push back harder against other students and myself when we provide controversial opinions or factually dubious claims.",
                "It is a very engaging class. I think it could be improved by slightly more guidance of discussions from Dr. Young.",
                "I would assign fewer readings and structure class discussions around them a little more",
                "The strengths are really interesting, if overly long, readings for every class and interesting essay questions. The main weakness was the unfocused debates in class that revolved mainly around contemporary domestic politics."
