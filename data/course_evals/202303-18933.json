                "In this class, I enhanced my proficiency in advanced research methodologies, gaining valuable experience in conducting and managing large-scale projects. The course provided ample opportunities for honing my presentation skills through interactions with other labs on campus and culminated in the design and delivery of a poster at a symposium. Moreover, I gained more practice in effective workload management, successfully balancing the demands of my coursework and research commitments. Overall, the experience has not only deepened my understanding of the subject matter but also equipped me with practical skills essential for future endeavors in academia and beyond."

                "This course was amazingly structured.",
                "They asked me to do too many things at the end of the semester. I had to make a presentation (for the math and physics major), a poster, and a final written report. One or maybe two of these three things would have been more reasonable.",
                "The course is very hands off. Students are expected to be able to find a research advisor entirely on their own, and there is no official system in place for researchers to disclose if they have open spaces for undergrads in their labs or anything like that. It is therefore more challenging than necessary to complete this requirement, since there is no guarantee that there will be a lab position available. I don't think it would be too much of a burden on professors to create some kind of sign-up sheet ahead of time to facilitate the process of finding a lab. As it is, it was a significant burden for me to have to work it out on my own, and I ended up doing research where I had zero background knowledge because it felt like I didn't have a choice.",
                "The poster session was badly organized. There was almost no communication throughout the course as to expectations, timelines, etc, and the \"example poster\" was highly questionable from a scientific standards standpoint. None of this is a problem if you're already an established member of a research group who has experience presenting, organizing a study, and writing a report, so on that front, the course is fine, but I felt bad for people who were just starting out and had to deal with the total lack of organization.",
                "A strength is the flexibility that independent research gives. However, I did feel constrained to continue with a project that didn't seem to have much going for it just to have a cohesive poster and report at the end of the semester.\r\n\r\nI think going back to the presentation format as opposed to the poster is a better idea--the poster demanded way too much time.",
                "This course suffered a bit from lack of communication (not finding out we needed to submit a written research report as well as present a poster until almost the end of the semester was fairly stressful). \r\n\r\nOther than that, I appreciated the required check-in elements, particularly since my project was mostly self-directed, to keep me on track as to milestones I was aiming for.",
                "Strengths: You get to do research for a letter grade which is awesome! Weaknesses: A big part of your success is determined by the research group you land yourself in/the organization within it.",
                "nice that it was on canvas this year and thought it was important that the deadlines were semi-flexible depending on individual lab/research situations",
                "This course is very self directed, and centers on the student-PI relationship. This is quite valuable in simulating the research environment students will face in graduate school. However, deadlines and expectations were not always made clear. In future variations of this course it would be helpful to provide a more structured outline of expectations, as they seemed to change a lot throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: The only deliverable is a final poster and report - allowing you to distribute your work whenever you have time in the semester. Weaknesses: None."

                "This course is required for physics majors, so this question is somewhat moot. For students who already have a plan in place with a research advisor in a topic they're interested in learning about, this course would present very little additional difficulty. For students who do not have a plan, it can be difficult to find an advisor. The workload and quality of the research experience also vary drastically between labs, so you could end up with a course that's easy where you learn very little, or a course that's extremely demanding where you learn a lot, or, if you're especially unlucky, a demanding course where you have no support and learn very little. Pretty much everything hinges on finding a good advisor, which is totally up to you. Don't expect to receive much of any support from the physics department. For me, the experience was very good overall -- the graduate student who was my mentor was very helpful and attentive, so I did a lot of work and got a lot out of it.",
                "It's a requirement to graduate... so yes.",
                "Usually you have to take this course for the major, and there is no way around it.",
                "Independent research is really what you make of it. If you're in a group already, yes this is great because it forces you and your PI to create a bit more structure around your work and think about concrete goals since you have to write about and present on your work. If you're not in a group and you're creating something on your own make sure you communicate with the course instructor a bit more because they can be a great resource for helping you direct and develop your project and also keep you grounded in realistic goals.",
                "Yes! It's great to do research for a letter grade, it's super useful, and you probably need it for the major anyway. The workload of the course itself is pretty chill but depending on the research group you work with, the workload can be a lot more intense. It's a very flexible/research group-dependent course really...",
                "if you need it for your physics senior project, yes. Or, if they are still doing a poster presentations and you are taking this class as a junior then I would recommend it as a good way to get experience making a research poster.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this to another student. It's a graduation requirement for the major, so you don't have much choice, but it's a valuable way to learn how to balance your research workload with coursework.",
