                "This course began with an introduction into the field of \"political economy,\" one that was probably long overdue for a junior in the EPE major. This framework is so so helpful in understanding political dynamics, economic policy and social movements in the US. I was grateful for this introduction, particularly since it set up the rest of the class so well.\r\n\r\nThe weekly seminars and guest speakers covered a super broad range of topics: drug pricing, the food industry, AI and more. We covered so many topics across \"Healthcare Business Ethics,\" that I now feel like I have foundational knowledge in most areas of the healthcare industry.",
                "I learned a lot about the issues within our healthcare system from a moral\/political\/economic perspective. We talked about a lot of different topics, ranging from the food & beverage industry to private equity.",
                "i learned a lot about the US healthcare industry, including the pharmaceutical industry, health injustices, and much more. we stuided each topic in the perspective of ethics, politics, and economics.",
                "I learned about healthcare as an industry that is impacted by business and political decisions. I also learned about how these decisions affect recipients of healthcare directly.",

                "I learned many aspects of the structure of the healthcare system, including how it is funded and the process to create new medicines. I am now more skilled at researching a healthcare relating topic and being able to understand and critically anyone it more effectively.",
                "This course helped me to better understand the incentives which underly the behaviors of key players in the American healthcare system. It also allowed me to explore possible ways to alter these incentive structures, while maintaining a balance between equity and efficiency."

                "Strengths: The speakers! Professor Benavides found such incredible speakers for us -- they were all brilliant, engaging and attentive. I'm so grateful that I had the opportunity to hear many of them speak. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We didn't have much opportunity to discuss the readings. Professor Benavides gave excellent presentations as introductions to each guest speaker. However, most of the class engagement was in the form of responding to the presentation or the guest speaker. I wish we had more time to discuss the readings, especially because so many of them were fascinating.",
                "Strengths: interesting range of topics, not a significant workload but the work that you have to do actually feels relevant and conducive to your learning. Interesting guest speakers. Revision option for midterm essay, which definitely helps you as a writer. Weaknesses: It would have been nice to receive clearer feedback.",
                "i thought it was very interesting to have guest speakers come in to speak about various topics every week, but i never felt like i learned a deep level of any. i think a learned a lot of more surface information, and the times we went into detail about topics it seemed biased based on what the guest speaker studied or believed.",
                "The guest speakers were amazing, very meticulously chosen, and gave very insightful talks. Professor Benavides's lectures were also very enriching and engaging. Feedback clarity could have been improved, particularly for the midterm and final papers. However, this wasn't much of an issue if you were a student that regularly attended office hours. Professor Benavides truly cared about her students and was very passionate about the subject.",
                "I loved all the guest lectures. They were super interesting, but I feel like the second half of the course it was every week and it didn't leave that much room for us to discuss the content. Also, the readings were never discussed.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Very passionate and engaging instructor, open to helping students.\r\n- Interesting topics covered.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- There were too many Zoom guest lecturers. Would be better in person or no guest lectures at all if that is not possible.\r\n- Readings could be more refined--there were lots of readings I hoped this course would have assigned that it didn't.\r\n- The moral political economy framework wasn't fully made clear yet played a central part in the course. A greater emphasis on that would be helpful for students to have a firm idea of what it actually is.\r\n- I felt like there were too many students in the class for a seminar. I think it would help if there were fewer people to facilitate more discussion.",
                "Strenghts -- great topics and course guest speakers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- could provide better feedback on assignents",
                "weaknesses are that there is no grade transparency and visitors for every seminar meeting.",
                "Strength were the guest speakers. Weakness is that we did not work on active applications of solutions",
                "The workload of the course was reasonable and the guest lectures were fascinating and engaging. I would have enjoyed more diversity in classes in engaging with material beyond papers and articles.",
                "One strength of this course was being able to hear from esteemed guests each week concerning their work within the American healthcare system. This was incredibly interesting because each guest had their own unique perspectives on which areas of the healthcare system need to be addressed the most direly, as well as strategies for addressing such areas. One weakness of this was that each guest lecture was ofttimes different in style. For example, one week a guest lecturer might spend the entire time presenting and there would be no time left for questions, while the next guest lecture might be quite short with plenty of time for questions. It is worth noting that this element of organization was largely out of Prof. Benavides control and she certainly did the best to accommodate each guest lecturers' presentation style."

I always came home telling my roommates about what I had learned that day. Take this class!!",
