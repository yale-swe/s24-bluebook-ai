Discussion sections were somewhat difficult to have virtually; as is the case with most STEM course discussion sections, sometimes a few voices are louder than others and certain students will speak up more, making it difficult for others to participate, which is only amplified when courses are held on Zoom. However, the teaching fellows made the discussion environment comfortable and were very helpful."

There was a lot of practical information taught in addition to theoretical, which was very helpful and engaging. However, the material does not really build from one week to the next, and there are no exams, so this is the type of course that requires you to be self-motivated if you want to get a lot out of it."
