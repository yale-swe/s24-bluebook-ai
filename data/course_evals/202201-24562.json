Beyond this, I also learned about doing art historical research through the final paper, while developing a catalog of known artists and works through the weekly lectures and two exams. Overall, I learned how to analyze art and articulate my ideas verbally, while also being exposed to the ideas of other artists, scholars, and classmates regarding a great variety of unique artistic technologies."

                "Structure good be better",
                "I really enjoyed the pieces and the sections especially when they were at the yuag. The readings could have been better.",
                "Maybe one comprehensive review session before exams would be helpful",
                "Fantastic lectures! Prof. Lee covers a really interesting breadth of artwork and the readings are very interesting and generally important to the field.",
                "Well organized and interesting, some of the guest speakers were not as great though",
                "It was a lot of memorization",
                "Strengths: PAM LEE and the TFs; lectures were engaging, organized, and recorded; art objects and concepts were interesting; exams were fair\r\nWeaknesses: it would've been better for the guest artist lectures to have been sprinkled throughout the semester, rather than all at the end",
                "I think this class engaged very interesting topics, however, I think that lectures could cover fewer works. I think it would be more engaging to discuss 3-4 works per class in depth.",
                "This was probably my ideal course",
                "Exams are difficult with the slide Id. Overall course structure is good, learn a lot of interesting art and technology information in a short amount of time. Engagement Roa supported by your ta",
                "Lectures were interesting, though moved quickly. I found the term sheets hard to keep up with, and they made it difficult for people who wanted to take notes by hand (either had to print out the term sheet the night before or take notes blind, without knowing which concepts were going to be tested on, whereas people using computers could take notes on the sheet itself).\r\n\r\nI thought that the paper assignments were interesting and provided a nice degree of flexibility to write about something that interested you.\r\n\r\nI thought that the grading system for the tests was not clearly elaborated beforehand, which was frustrating. The grading felt somewhat arbitrary and it was hard to get a clear answer about what was needed for full credit on a question, particularly on the terms portion of the tests.",
                "The course is great. The material is super interesting and clearly presented, guest speakers are great, and visits to the YUAG during section perfectly align with the coursework.",
                "Fascinating material and linkages that the professor makes.",
                "Strengths: Really enjoyed the material. I thought the syllabus was really well-constructed and gave students a good foundation in order to understand and engage with art and technology in a meaningful way (ex: Benjamin and reproduction, cybernetics, cyberfeminist texts, etc.). Guest speakers were wonderful, I especially loved Legacy Russell and Zach Blas' talks. Trips to the YUAG during section were also a highlight! I feel so much more equipped to engage with art next time I visit a museum!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think lectures could have been more engaging at times (especially those on Zoom). The midterm also required studying essentially every term that was ever mentioned in class, which meant a LOT to study and memorize. This feedback was incorporated for the final though, and we were given a list of terms in addition to the artwork IDs.",
                "Strengths: Friendly and helpful professor and TA's\r\nWeaknesses: topics did not all feel super interconnected",
                "Pamela was a fantastic lecturer.\r\nI think that we could've focused more on the current times given its technology.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Lee's lectures and the guest lectures are very interesting. Exams are straightforward if you spend time studying. Weaknesses: Expectations for papers were not always clear.",
                "The strengths: incredibly interesting subject material, thematic syllabus (as opposed to chronological) that allowed us to really see themes\/threads through art and society, straightforward assessments (two visual analysis papers, two exams) \r\n\r\nthe weaknesses: this was a very difficult class for an introductory level course - the class lectures were complex and esoteric, and Prof Lee introduced very advanced theories and concepts that we were expected to grasp and be tested on;  the midterm exam was graded very harshly; a big gripe I had was that the sections were not held in the YUAG, but in classrooms focused on theories and readings (with the exception of two or three) - an introductory class should always have sections in the museum, we are so lucky to have the YUAG and people who are taking their first (and maybe only) art history class at Yale should be in the museum and admiring it in order to really feel close to the art and analyze it in person.",
                "Good content. Good essay prompts. Too much memorizing.",
                "The seminars could be more structured; the lectures were excellent",
                "This course asks that you think quite deeply about technology and social theory and is intellectually robust. That being said, I'd almost prefer that the course were a 200-level lecture for that reason - Professor Lee is immensely knowledgeable but can imagine being intimidated by the content if I were a non-major.",
                "Strengths: great lecture, interesting content \r\nWeaknesses: a lot of memorization required for exams",
                "Very strong teaching core",
                "I genuinely don't think this course has many weaknesses. I love the class lengths, the professor was great, and I enjoyed my TF (though section was dry). Professor Lee does move extremely fast through the material, and I would say that things only really started to cohere for me around the machine age. So perhaps tightening of the syllabus on the very early material, in particular highlighting the art-technology link in those early art pieces, would be helpful, but by the conclusion of the course those concerns didn't linger with me. The biggest course design flaw to me is that the midterm and final ask students to rely a lot on the readings yet the classes themselves draw very little on the readings (or if they do draw on the readings, it is not as though you need the readings to understand class or vice versa). Of course, if a student is keeping up with the readings this isn't a problem, but that personally wasn't feasible for me (and I was taking this course as a fifth class) and I also felt no incentive to engage with the readings other than these two assessments that were very spaced out over the course of the term.",
                "Strengths: Prof Lee is an EXCELLENT professor!!! I enjoy every single class, and she's always so well-spoken about the topics. I like how we move chronologically and topically and ending with NFTs.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I do wish we can get to NFTs earlier on, and sometimes class material can be a bit difficult to understand for someone who have never taken art history before. The papers are REALLY CHALLENGING!",
                "I found the recordings very helpful and her slide sheets were pretty clear. I appreciated the pedagogical style and how the professor would explain the readings for that week, because they were often pretty dense works. The material was also just very interesting, so it was natural to pay attention and want to discuss it.",
                "The main strengths of this course were the excellent curriculum and organization, the engaging sections, and the flexibility of writing assignments, in particular the final paper. Every aspect of the course felt very well thought-out, and I really enjoyed the topics\/media chosen for each week. Moreover, the basic structure of the informational lectures, complementary readings, and discussion\/activity-based sections worked well for really learning each topic. Finally, the assignments were quite open, with the first paper being a pure visual analysis (with two artwork options) and the final paper allowing for just about any topic relating to the course content. Overall, these aspects created a fun atmosphere for learning without an overwhelming amount of work, while presenting a really unique and engaging view of art and technology.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the main weaknesses were the lack of participation in lectures, the sometimes confusing or jargonistic readings and lectures, and the initial lack of openly available lecture recordings. While a lot of information was crammed into each lecture, I think more consistent opportunities for participation (even if it were just a few questions or discussion points each lecture) would increase engagement and decrease awkwardness compared to the scattered participation in the current lectures. Furthermore, while somewhat natural for some subjects, a lot of the readings were a bit tricky to follow, which sometimes spilled into the lectures; this could be improved by providing some sort of summary or distilled versions of more complex concepts. Nevertheless, these minor tweaks would merely serve to make an already great class even better!"

                "Yes! You learn a lot but its not a gut. The midterms are hard with memorizing 40 + art works and dates",
                "I think that is an interesting intro lecture, particularly if you need one for the major. I appreciated having some art historical background knowledge for the course, and think that it might be difficult\/intimidating for someone with no art history experience.",
                "Absolutely. The material and discussions in this class are incredible accessible--the class is interesting for both art savants and people who've never studied art. Very interesting contemporary questions but also super interesting histories.",
                "Absolutely. So interesting, low workload, brilliant professor.",
                "As someone with a deep personal and academic interest in both art and tech, I found the lectures a bit surface-level at times. The questions that the lectures asked where interesting, but never went deep enough to get to compelling arguments. The assigned readings were interesting and diverse.",
                "On the whole, I'd recommend. This was my first art history course, and I know it was for a lot of other students as well. This mix of academic disciplines, from tech-based majors to the humanities made section discussions pretty interesting! The syllabus is well-crafted and I found the readings really interesting. Lecture was good on the whole, though I was more engaged in some classes than others. Section sometimes met in the YUAG, which was really nice. I also feel so much more equipped to engage with art next time I visit a museum!",
                "Yes! I learned so much and it was all really interesting. The course spans from like 30,000 BCE to the present, so you get a pretty thorough overview of the history of art and technology. The class is well organized by time period and by theme. I've never taken an art history course before, but this class did not create an intimidating environment at all - the exams and papers were pretty easy and section discussions were very open and non judgemental.",
                "Yes. Accessible and fair. Interesting and relevant content. Great lectures.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in art history! It's an introductory art history course, so no prior background is assumed. If you're only interested in the new technologies component, the first half of the course may not be very interesting to you.",
                "Yes! Was very interesting and informative, especially as my first art history class.",
                "I thought the course was highly interesting and I learned about amazing art. Prof Lee is clearly incredibly brilliant and the course was intellectually inspiring and demanding. My main objection was the fact that the class was not set up (in terms of the subject matter) on par with the other introductory classes I've taken at Yale - it was much harder. Take the course for the awesome art and the fantastic professor, but be prepared to work hard and do all the long, theoretical readings.",

The vocabulary used and prior knowledge assumed of students is rather complex\/high, and the class is theory-dense. That being said, if you're in the major or interested in a comprehensive, historically-informed understanding of the relationship between art and technology, you'll very much enjoy the course!",
                "Definitely! Lecturer was incredible and the selection of artworks were very relevant and interesting",
                "Yes good course",
                "Yes definitely, but be prepare to put in work.",
                "Yes. I took this course after really enjoying the intro survey History of Art course offered in the department and I was not disappointed. I am not a HSAR major so I took this course purely for fun and due to my own interest in the intersection of art and technology. I think the course description really sells NFTs as a major talking point in the course and I wouldn't take this course if that is what you are purely interested in (since we really only spent the last week talking about NFTs). That being said, this was the one course that allowed me to nerd out over the course of the semester, and I would love to take more courses that focus on the present digital tech-art age as I found that movement most conceptually exciting.",
                "YES - this is my first art history class and changed my way thinking about art and technology, how they are actually complementary. But be prepared to CDF this class because the papers are worth a lot and they're really difficult to get a good grade on if you don't know how to write visual analysis papers.",
                "Yes! I felt like it was a very approachable and relevant way to take dip your toe into art history, which has been notoriously dry and white-male dominated field for a long time. The material, professor, and discussions distinctly and consciously moved away from that reputation.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in the intersection of art and technology in any way. Moreover, I think it would be a good fit for students purely interested in the history of art, as they would be exposed to a different way of thinking about their primary focus in the context of technology, and those from a technical background of any sort, as they would discover ways to recontextualize their work as art. As long as a student is willing to do some weekly readings, pay attention to lectures, and think openly about technological art, I think they will greatly enjoy and take a lot away from this course."
