                "- I learned how to write an ethnography book review.\r\n- I learned the classical way that anthropologists write their ethnography.\r\n- I learned how public health and anthropology are usually mused in fieldwork.\r\n- I learned how knowledge in one field (P.H.) can help better understand the other (A).",
                "Introduction to the field of medical anthropology and key thinkers\/terms\/concepts; ability to process and analyze ethnographic work; a much broader paradigm shift to thinking about the world in terms of the structural and social forces at play that I know will stay with me long after this summer.",
                "I learned how to read an ethnography and write a book review.\r\nBy discussing the books with my classmates and instructor, I gained a deeper insight into the methods, main themes, strengths, and weaknesses of the books. I also learned how to express my thoughts in an organized way.",
                "I learned so much about the medical, economic, and social barriers that people face around the world. You also get to see the amazing individuals and cultures that face off against these barriers, and learn about the forces that motivate culture and cultural change. Ethnographic research is a fascinating and informative lens of study, and introduces you to so many different perspectives.  Through book reviews and discussions, we also got much better at articulating our perspectives, both in writing and speech.",
                "I learned a lot about the political, ethical, cultural, and social factors that affect disease and pandemic response. Throughout the course, we read many ethnographies focusing on a variety of regions, medical diseases, and themes. Overall, this course gives a brief overview of the field of anthropology and the methods\/ethics of anthropologists. \r\nThe main skill you learn from this course is writing good book reviews and writing succinct summaries and analyses."

            "comments": [
                "- One of the most important strengths is that the class offers great opportunities to \"push\" students finish reading books & write book reviews. That's lack when you're self-learning.\r\n- Also, the course offers professional perceptions to common questions like anthropologist's positionality, ethical issues, etc.\r\n- However, one weakness might be that the reading time is not sufficient to be fully prepared, at least this applied to me.",
                "Lots of strengths are coming to mind -- fantastic books, great feedback and class discussions, and an excellent class overall. While I wouldn't say this was a weakness, it's definitely worth thinking about the pace and intensity of summer courses. There is a lot of reading and writing to do in 5 weeks, and the classes themselves are long!",
                "The books chosen for this course are all very informative and thought-provoking. Our instructor and Teaching Fellow are very kind and knowledgeable. This course is also reading-intensive, which helped us develop our reading skills. In addition, writing the book reviews and answering reading response questions helped us become better writers. Our writing fellow also helped me greatly with my writing.\r\nThe course will be even better if our instructor can provide us with some basic information about medical anthropology and cultural anthropology at the beginning of the course, as most of us havent taken an anthropology course before.",
                "Strengths: The book selection, class discussions, and writing assignments are all great. With one exception (out of 8-9), the books were literally all among the most amazing books I've ever read. The reading workload is a lot (~400-500 pages\/week), but writing assignments are very manageable and well-structured. Marcia Inhorn is also an outstanding (and approachable) teacher, wonderful person, and a global leader in anthropology. Her own book is wonderful as well (interesting and inspiring but also very saddening and relevant today). She shared her insights also through interesting interjections into class-driven discussion. Finally, despite the heavy (but fascinating) themes and substantial reading load, the class felt low stress. Assignments were mostly book reviews, and she set up a friendly class environment, so the course sometimes felt like a late-night \"book club\" with amazing books and people.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None noted, except 3hrs can feel a bit long on Zoom. It's impressive that it didn't feel more long... I really looked forward to the biweekly classes."

                "If you're up for the challenge of carefully reading and analyzing two books per week (including one between Tuesday and Thursday), this class is incredible and more than worth the intensity. Class discussions were excellent and thought-provoking, and Marcia and Rachel are great. If you have any interest in public health, the global role of the U.S., and the intersections of health, gender, race, and class, this class and its examples of viewing issues through their social and cultural contexts could be an excellent fit.",
                "Yes. This course can help students dive deeper into the field of medical anthropology by reading ethnographies written by renowned authors and discussing the books with their classmates and instructors. Students can also learn how to summarize a book in limited words and critique a book by writing book reviews. In this course, students have the chance to lead a seminar discussion and develop their leadership skills.",
