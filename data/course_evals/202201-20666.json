That is, complex themes and ideas need to be presented in such a way so as to allow students who haven't studied philosophy before or taken a few philosophy courses to be able to grasp Kant's arguments. In fact, even for philosophy majors or enthusiasts, I think it is sometimes difficult to understand what is going on in the text. Perhaps, giving more concrete examples to explain Kant's claims would enhance students' learning  and love for the material.",
