                "I learned so much about the history of the university, the university as a site of cultural capital, questions about the university and religion/gender, youth as a constructed narrative and how the coming-of-age narrative both reflects and defines youth. This was a beautiful class and our engagements with the text always felt like they had real stakes.",
                "Ability to read novels on a macro and micro level while also applying the historical frameworks learned from other campus novels.",
                "I learned more about how to write a real English paper  as well as how to read a series of books for a specific theme. I think this class was really inspiring for me; the subject matter, the theme subject of growing up  it was not only intellectually interesting but personally and creatively inspiring.",
                "I learned about the history of the Bildungsroman and campus novel in the English tradition and in translation. Its a great course to take if youre interested in this kind of literature and/or want to reflect on your experience as a college student!",
                "I developed a better understanding of the bildungsroman genre and the types of themes interwoven through seminal texts within the genre. I also developed a stronger ability to discuss literature in a seminar setting.",
                "I learned about the bildungsroman, the kunstleroman and the campus novel, and how the writers we studied both utilized and subverted these genres. I also developed my ability to write English papers with a more careful choice of language and sentence structure as Professor Cleary gives excellent feedback. I feel like my ability to critically analyze novels has also improved.",
                "I received a great survey on the Bildungsroman or, specifically, the 'campus novel' from the early 19th century through to the contemporary era, covering a wide variety of authors in and outside of the anglophone world.",
                "This class helped develop my critical reading, writing and speaking skills, pushing me to make critical judgments about the novels we were reading and the genres of the bildungsroman, the kunstlerroman and the campus novel. It also made me think deeply about the aims of education, as well as the history of the university as a cultural, social and economic institution.",

            "comments": [
                "The strength of this course is its syllabus. The books that we read were all very diverse and engaging. The discussion style wasn't my favorite, but I still had a good time in the class.",
                "This class comes with an excellent syllabus of must-read novels. There is definitely no lack of intellectual fodder. Often, with the heavy reading weeks, however, the discussion of novels feels short and I wish we had more time to unpack each of them.",
                "Strengths. Professor Cleary is an excellent discussion leader; he guides students through central themes and also allows us space to engage on our own terms. I appreciate that the register of literary analysis in this course ranged from political to philosophical to emotional. He is also kind, warm, and willing always to go above and beyond to help with writing assignments.\r\nThe other seminar members were extremely engaged as well, and the syllabus was excellently crafted, one of those syllabi in which you feel gratified by themes returning throughout the course. I also appreciated our discussions of contemporary literature. \r\n\r\nI cant think of many weaknesses for this course.",
                "The syllabus was incredible but we read through novels too quickly and often didnt have enough time to properly reflect through more personally chosen canvas questions.",
                "Basically no weaknesses. I know in class that we discussed a better integration of secondary sources; this would be nice. I also wonder if maybe, so as to ensure some subjects are covered, there might be a poll or something before each class so that students can vote on what part or theme of the novel they wish to discuss most.",
                "Excellent course. Only additions I would suggest are on the writing front: doing peer critiquing of essay drafts to get further feedback on our writing and introducing a writing assignment where students get to do some reflection on their own educational experiences.",
                "The main strength of this course is Professor Cleary, who also comes to seminars prepared to lead a thorough and engaging discussion. He not only gives great feedback on essays, but takes the time to read through canvas posts and comment on them too. The syllabus is very well-selected and covers the university experience over a range of continents and historical periods. The only weakness of this course that I can think of is the reading load, which can be 400 pages a week, not to mention the critical readings. To improve the class, I would maybe cover Jude the Obscure in just one week and make more room for class discussion on the critical readings. I personally found 'Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man' and 'Disgrace' the least enjoyable to read and arguably focused the least on the university novel, so I would suggest cutting those too. In addition, as so many seniors take the class, I would love to see some of the reading responses encourage seniors to reflect upon their own university experience and relate the novels to Yale today. Finally, it could be interesting to incorporate other forms of media into the class, maybe as optional reading response prompts, such as the television series of normal people or The Chair.",
                "I thoroughly enjoyed the course. The readings were fascinating and felt especially pertinent to a graduating Senior looking back on both my time in University as well as my decades of 'education' in and outside of the classroom. Professor Cleary is a great and engaging teacher, and I always looked forward to class discussions.\r\n\r\nMy only main pieces of feedback (really already covered in our last Canvas post) would be to reduce the reading load on some weeks and to consider ways to sometimes vary up assignments, perhaps looking beyond the novel form and/or allowing students to try out a creative assignment. Besides that it was a wonderful course!",
                "The discussions were great--students were very engaged, and Prof. Cleary facilitated the discussions in such a way that they were open to student input but also felt purposeful and built toward a deeper understanding rather than going in a bunch of different directions. The novels were great individually and in connection to each other--it was interesting to see how texts from a variety of places and time periods dealt with similar themes. The only thing I think could be improved would be to reduce the volume of reading/written responses on Canvas a little.",
                "The classes did not vary but the reading and the information provided was interesting and informative."

With just two essays, the productive workload is relatively easy, though there is a lot of reading. This class spans from the 19th to 21st centuries and theres definitely a little bit for everyone!",

                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this class! Professor Cleary is a generous, brilliant professor who cares amount students' engagement with the material and development as readers and writers. The syllabus is well chosen and the course is a great chance to reflect upon one's own Yale experience while reading other university novels.",
                "Yes! The course is a perfect way to reflect on your own time in college while reading a great series of novels alongside peers and a fantastic professor. Asides from learning about the evolving tradition of the 'campus novel' form, I think the books themselves and the discussions we had taught me so much. Be warned that it is a heavy reading load, but if you're up for it you should absolutely take it!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course--the novels were fun to read and discuss, Prof. Cleary is a great professor and it's a nice way to reflect on our own education and participation in the university system.",
