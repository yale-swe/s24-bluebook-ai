   "comments": [
    "A huge amount about the technical processes behind the execution of a work of art and behind its analysis.",
    "An understanding of modern conservation techniques as well as what techniques were used historically.",
    "466 was a broad overview of the different materials that are most commonly used in art: what their properties are, how they're applied, and how they degrade over time. I learned about topics as diverse Italian panel paintings, early 20th-century plastic sculptures, minkisi figures from the Kongo, and abstract expressionist art. Each subject came with a close looking exercise, which taught me how to look at various objects, assess their conditions, and deduce in part how and from what they were created. This course helped me consider more closely the art object itself, whereas other art history courses have emphasized the culture\/time the object comes from and what theory can be applied to it.",
    "This class has changed the way I look at art and experienced museums! If you have an art background this class will help you tie some of that practical knowledge to art history in really interesting ways."

   "comments": [
    "This is a great class and there were no real weaknesses to its teaching structure and style - it suited the material really well",
    "The class is a great hands-on opportunity to interact with the YUAG collection and learn more about art and art conservation. I loved being able to view objects up close and personal.",
    "Strengths: I loved that this course was taught by a wide range of museum professionals, who were each able to lend their insights on materials as diverse as parchment and plastic. Unlike most art history classes at Yale, everything about 466 was hands-on, and being so close to the objects we were studying made the course particularly effective. The professors were both approachable and really great instructors; the readings were super manageable; and the workload was evenly distributed and fair (one short close looking\/writing assignment per week plus a midterm exam and 12 pg. final paper).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are honestly so few flaws in this course. If anything, I think that there could have been greater structure in building a glossary of important terms?",
    "I liked how varied the class structure was and how Irma and Anne brought in different musuem staff as guest lecturers, as it gave a really cool behind the scenes look at the gallery."

    "Yes. This is the only class I know of that lets you explore art history from more of a technical\/ scientific angle and it has been so valuable to my understanding of art",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, if you enjoy art and want to learn more about how art is conserved, this is the class for you. Anne and Irma are great professors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone, regardless of their major\/background in art. 466 was fun, super informative, and (definitely the only class at Yale that I would describe as) relaxing.",
    "Yes! Regardless of your major, if you are interested in the more material side of art this is a fascinating class and allows a lot of really cool hands-on experiences."
