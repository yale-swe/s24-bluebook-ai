    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they want to learn more about the field of journalism from an instructor who is an expert in the field. The fact that there is no exam (grades based on responses, papers and a presentation) was not only less anxiety-inducing, but also extremely helpful since it allowed me to focus on truly grasping and thinking through and beyond the class materials (not learning simply to memorize for an exam)."
