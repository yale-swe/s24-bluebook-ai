The course also included philosophical skills, like argument reconstruction, concept clarification, and the resolution of competing textual interpretations.",
                "This course discusses ideas including what is good and what God is. One effect reading these texts had for me was to lead me to think in terms of \"insofar\" (e.g. if a person is a doctor and heals themselves, insofar as they are a doctor they are performing medicine, not receiving it, whereas insofar as they are a patient they are being healed--a doctor in the precise sense is not healed) and overall I found the course developed the sophistication of our philosophical thinking.",

                "The strength of this course is how it demanded a high level of engagement with the lectures and the texts, through writing assignments, lecture questions, and challenging topics of in-class discussion. I think at times, however, the seminars focused so much on interpretation and argument about the ideas within the text that I felt confused at times when these texts were more complex  dedicating some time just to basic review of the texts' ideas would have been helpful to make me feel prepared to enter the higher levels of discussion.",
                "I am particularly grateful that this class was taught in a small seminar format because I was able to actively participate and work through arguments in class, as well as listen and respond to my peers. I also enjoyed having class three days per week instead of two because it created more continuity for the class each week. The only improvement I would suggest is that the long-form lectures be offered synchronously so that we can ask questions in real-time as they come up during the lecture.",
                "Of the three DS courses, Philosophy felt the most reasonably paced. It exposed us to a wide variety of writers and philosophical areas.",
                "The writing assignments are very thoughtful and useful. The greatest downfall of the course for me was that there were many good resources (guided reading questions, lectures, and guided listening questions) but I did not have time to do any more than read the texts so I missed out on getting as much as I should have out of the course. Perhaps it is possible to do all of these things in addition to the mere volume of reading but I didn't manage to.",

                "The virtual seminars were very engaging, and managed to recreate a real classroom experience. I think using breakout rooms a bit more often would have been helpful, however, because on the rare times that we did use breakout rooms it seemed to facilitate more engaged and personal discussion.",

I also enjoyed being able to work through arguments in breakout rooms. As I mentioned in the previous comment, it would be helpful if the lectures were offered synchronously, so that we could better engage with the material of the lecture as it is presented.",

It seemed to allow us to better explore more aspects of a week's content by dividing each week's seminar into three distinct settings, and it helped with managing the reading load (the reading was spread out over three seminar days instead of two, which made apportioning easier; also, with the 3 meetings per week, even if you were behind on reading for two days you still had one more chance).",

                "Although this course had a much higher workload than the other DS courses I took, and tackled complex ideas that often left me initially confused, I think it was a great course as an intensive introduction to college-level philosophy. It really managed to develop my skills in discussing, reading, and writing, and I feel like I have learned so much over the course of the semester.",
                "Yes! After taking Professor Werner's class, I now look at the world through a more logical and critical lens. I didn't realize this would happen, but I even weave philosophy into many of my everyday conversationsciting Aristotle or Plato when contemplating with friends why certain things in this world might be the way they are. Professor Werner's class has left a large impact on me and has inspired me to consider majoring in philosophy.",
