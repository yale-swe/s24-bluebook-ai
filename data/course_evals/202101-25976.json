                "This class taught me to think analytically about contemporary Indigenous issues across the globe, and to discern commonalities and differences. I also learned how to incorporate art into my academic study, which provided me with critical and creative thinking skills I have not received from other courses.",
                "I gained knowledge about the experiences, works, and insights of Indigenous communities and individuals throughout the world, as well as resources to continue to engage with and learn from Indigenous creators.",
                "I learned so much about different Indigenous cultures around the world, including their histories, their art, elements of their culture. I have not learned more in the field of Native studies in years, and this was such an informative and fascinating class",
                "I developed an ability to seriously and respectfully engage with Indigenous cultural and social movements from a variety of regional focuses throughout the world. This general survey course, although perhaps not incredibly specific by its nature, allowed me to flexibly and meaningfully introduce these movements into an academic space.",
                "This course allowed me to reconsider my personal concept of Indigeneity. Throughout the course, we investigated the complex histories involving Indigenous people from around the world. The global context aspect truly illuminated the ways in which the US education system lacks an understanding of Indigenous peoples.",
                "Learned about indigenous people all over the world and how they interact with the non-indigenous society around them. I was exposed to a wonderful variety of culture, design, music, and language."

                "The variety of materials covered in this course meant that I was never overwhelmed by the content. The assignments were all interesting and aided my understanding of the concepts in different ways. Class discussions were always insightful and respectful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Onco-Ingyadet is intentional in every selection of readings, listenings and multimedia materials. Her syllabus is life-affirming and her instruction is patient and generous. We had engaging guest lectures and flexible assignments that truly helped accommodate pandemic learning.",
                "This class had a lot of content for each class, which was once a week, but much of it wasn't readings, but music and art and website to fully learn more about the culture, which was wonderful. The assignments allowed for a lot of creativity and engagement with the work and Indigeneity in general. It was a wonderful class",
                "The biggest weakness of this course was the sheer breadth that it attempted to cover, coupled with the limited amount of time we had to thoroughly delve into each regional focus. It sometimes felt as if we weren't able to do each region complete justice, despite our best intentions as students and faculty, as a result of the time constraints we had to work with. That said, I believe that, in spite of the ambition of the course, Prof. Onco-Ingyadet managed to make the course incredibly accessible and easy to approach. Her commitment to highlighting alternative sources for learning and legitimizing them through our own academic engagement is commendable, and she clearly cares deeply and personally about the subject matter being taught. In many ways, her encouragement allowed us to begin building connections between the various sources we encountered. That said, I think narrowing in on the focus of the course would serve it well in the future, to make sure that we don't sacrifice too much depth in our commitment to breadth.",
                "Weakness - the course only needed one assignment to serve as a final assignment. Either the Expressions or Final paper. \r\n\r\nStrengths - the speakers incorporated into the syllabus, a highly motivated instructor, engaging course material.",
                "This course was very strong. Its use of multiple forms of media to teach was refreshing and wonderfully efficient."

This is one of the first courses taught by Indigenous person about Indigenous issues across the globe, which is a total rejection of regional bias. I think every student should have to engage in a course like this, especially as it reorients students to consider contemporary Indigenous people and their communities' historical struggle, as juxtaposed to only historicizing Indigenous people.",

                "Absolutely! As this course continues to be taught it will only grow and improve. This is a unique and powerful space to learn about contemporary Indigenous peoples not as an afterthoughts, but as the primary subject of scholarship.",
                "I cannot recommend this class enough! It was my favorite class I've taken at Yale so far, and I'm halfway through an an ERM major. I learned so much, I loved all of the media and readings we read, the assignments were well thought out and I was so proud of what I wrote, the class community was wonderful, it was a truly amazing class",
