                "This class is very interactive and thus helpful to learn a new language. The professor too is very understanding and helpful.",
                "This course was excellent, the pacing and assignments were great. The only complaint would be the textbook and its companion website being of not great quality (which is not the professor's fault).",
                "Professor Elbousty's energy is amazing. He's so encouraging, which is so important when learning a difficult language like Arabic. He genuinely cares about all his students. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: The professor is very organised and knowledgeable. The TA was very helpful and informative\r\nWeaknesses: There wasn't an efficient way of getting feedback on work or progress.",
                "The strengths of this course are the professor and the high level of class engagement. The weaknesses are that in a virtual language class it is hard to get enough time speaking and listening to Arabic. The virtual environment also makes it hard to meet other students or get help.",
                "Really amazing foundations course! Strengths are the supportive environment, the wonderful Professor Elbousty and TA Bayan, and the Arabic skills gained. Vocabulary could be reviewed more in class but the grammar powerpoints made by the professor were very helpful.",
                "We discussed these changes with Professor Elbousty, but teaching an introductory level language course over zoom for the first time is incredibly challenging (especially Arabic!). We discussed more structured time and what resources should be brought to the table.",
                "Incredible instructors, both for section and lecture. Very thorough content instruction",
                "This class, when taught by Professor Elbousty, largely lacks weaknesses. It is engaging, and Professor Elbousty is to thank for that, as he is also engaged and passionate about making sure his students learn the material well. I would say that the way this course is taught truly teaches you a comprehensive basic understanding of Arabic, including reading, writing, and speaking. The only thing I would change is perhaps make sure that the content of the videos we watch when we don't have live lecture doesn't repeat itself, as I found that occurred more than once.",
                "It was a little disorganized - due dates and assignments were unclear - i think it would have helped to have the assignments on canvas be more descriptive (i.e. list the exercises we were supposed to do, rather than just a generic assignment name).I think it actually would've helped to have vocab quizzes earlier. Being called on in class was very helpful and helped me understand pitfalls\/mistakes i was making a lot better. i really appreciated the class environment - Prof. Elbousty made it very fun and comfortable, and I even made some friends, which is amazing to have happened over zoom. The group work days were really nice because it's helpful to practice with others so that you can ask questions and learn from each other. More music would have been nice:) and the written conversations."

                "We incorporated more videos to watch on our own time 2 days a week instead of meeting for class. When we did meet, PowerPoints were used for lectures and we often split into breakout rooms of 2-3 people to practice a conversation, which we would then each say to the class. Additionally, the inclusion of a short section with a TA once a week to answer any questions missed in class and review material\/prepare for tests were really helpful!",
                "What succeeded were the extra study sessions on weekends that were 2 hours long. Those sessions were more personalized and very valuable.what failed was the online learning software and getting enough time to speak or hear the language.",
                "Super nice have two class days be asynchronous. Gives us more time to do the homework for Wednesday. Grammar powerpoints were very helpful. I also liked having a designated day for group work.",
                "Professor Elbousty was a great resource and so was Bayan the TA (discussion section). We discussed improvement already, but some of the course lacked structure but that was part of the transition period.",
                "Zooming was utilized and it was very effective given the COVID 19 circumstances.",
                "As stated before, the videos we watch when we don't have lecture sometimes overlapped in content, which could be improved. Live virtual seminars did work well, and live\/in-person is the only way learning a language properly would be feasible. However, live virtual seminars do result in a number of technological issues which are hard to solve, but nonetheless are important to note.",
                "Group work days and breakout rooms were helpful. I think especially because it's virtual, its more important for it to be organized - there was a lot of consistent confusion over the syllabus and canvas postings throughout the semester, which made it really hard for me to get in a good rhythm and form good practice habits. Sticking to a daily schedule over the semester, at least in terms of what exercises and outside videos to watch by what day, would be nice."

                "Yes! Take it with Professor Elbousty if you can, he is a fantastic professor. He really cares about the students at a personal level, and is passionate about making sure the students learn the material properly. Professor Elbousty is understanding, personable, and a fantastic teacher. He will even hold extra sessions before tests to make sure everyone who needs a little extra help gets it. The TA for this class was also very helpful and sections were largely focused on things that people had difficulty with, so make sure to use this to your advantage. Make sure you do all the homework as well, as learning a language really requires daily application of it. I took this class as a virtual seminar during the COVID-19 pandemic and still learned a lot of Arabic, despite already knowing how to speak a specific dialect. You will learn how to hold multiple conversations, a number of grammar rules, and how to read and write at a basic level, and most of all, you will always be engaged in learning the language. Do not worry about mispronouncing something or getting something wrong in class either, even if some people appear to have less\/more trouble with doing the same. At the end of the day, everyone is there to learn Arabic, and this learning is facilitated very well.",
