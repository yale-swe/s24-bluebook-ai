                "I learnt how to critically observe text and film for hidden meanings and learning outcomes or morals, which has helped in not only my observational skills, but writing skills. This course was insightful, and I learnt many philosophical viewpoints which were critical in personal development.",
                "Gained a general understanding of Freudian theory and related criticisms; acquired a way of thinking about dream-related issues",

                "Philosophical, and text evaluations with a lot of critical thinking skills involved. This discipline is however not suited to my natural inclinations, since I have omitted studying any humanities subject for over a year at my high school already. I did not see myself enjoying the class 90% of the times, as I found the subject to be too abstract, combining ideas from a wide array of disciplines with no solid foundation. I initially thought that this would delve into the scientific explanation of dreams, and its implications but to my surprise, it combines various historical philosophical texts even inclusive of the Old Torah! I do not see myself pursuing a discipline along this line in college, unless it is one of my pre-requisites for graduate studies. The breadth of this course is also astonishing, inclusive of films, humanities texts and even a slight touch on the psychological explanations of dreams. (which is what I was expecting) It is interesting nonetheless to be able to explore a wide array of disciplines which American colleges do offer unakin to the British universities which required students to declare a professional career in which they wanted to pursue at the age of 17. Nonetheless, it would have been a lot easier to me to have taken a natural science course I enjoy such as Chemistry, which would have allowed me to score an A.",
                "\"The Logic of Dreams\" equipped me with a deeper understanding of fundamental psychological concepts and provided me with a basic knowledge of other relevant topics. This courses heavily enhanced my close reading and annotation skills, and gave me a desire to ask questions about seemingly mundane or trivial entities."

Taking into consideration that this is a humanities subject, discussions and opinion sharing must be facilitated. The classroom in which the class is held is more like a Physics or Chemistry class, similar to when I was learning Newton's Third Law in my 6th Grade class in a Thai primary school. \r\nThe nature of this subject is based upon discussions and sharing opinions, classrooms like that in Watson Center would not help students achieved the purpose of studying this course. \r\nI also believe that there should be a warning for future prospect students that this is purely a humanities course, and that the students would not delve into the scientific explanations behind dreams, rather an abstract knowledge spanning many philosophical texts and even the Torah or the Spanish literature which I was not at all expecting."

If you enjoy the areas of natural sciences however, you would not have enjoyed this subject, and could found yourself trying to stay awake while trying to interpret the philosophers' implications.",
