The first half of the course focused on general biochemical topics such as protein structure, molecule/biochemical techniques, membranes, signal transduction. The second half of the course focused on metabolism. A LOT of metabolism. We covered everything from glycolysis, TCA cycle, ETC, fatty acid metabolism, glycogen metabolism, etc.",
                "I learned so much about biochemistry and learned important concepts that allow me to make educated inferences of why the cell does what it does. I really enjoyed this course yet it was intensive and difficult.",

These principles will serve me in future academic and professional environments (including research and medical school).",

I definitely understood papers better after this class and after learning more about the amino acids, and it will make you a better experimentalist. Metabolism ties everything together very beautifully and the course altogether does teach so much in so little time and is very fascinating. I really enjoyed this course and learned how to better study and think about science."

                "great organization and teaching but the powerpoints are a bit hard to follow if u miss lecture",
                "Strengths: Quizzes were straight-forward. Professors were very organized. \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are sometimes boring. I felt that it was very easy to stare off into space, perhaps because the material seemed repetitive at times and was presented in a relatively dry way. So so so much memorization. Specifically the final required SO much memorization.",
                "The tests were really picky about the smallest details when a vast amount of information was expected to be on it.",
                "Strengths: Most midterms were written fairly; section was useful; overall have a solid understanding of biochemistry\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were overwhelming; metabolism slides were hard to follow; professors were intimidating but I think had good intentions; classmates felt competitive and test averages were very high",
                "Super fast pace, not much room for not understanding something without falling behind always seemed like the content was greater than time allowed for so remembering everything was an expectation",
                "Very intense course as there are a lot of materials. \r\nThe different sections of the course are not intertwined that much, may be have a logic overview of the course would be great!",
                "This course is hard. I'm not an MBB or MCDB major but I took this course for pre-med requirements and chose the MBB version over MCDB because I was told by many it is much more organized for learning. It is very organized for learning, and Matt Simon is a great lecturer. I thought Solomon was an OK lecturer - he went on tangents sometimes and it wasn't clear what we were supposed to focus on/learn sometimes. However, I used the previous recordings from the instructor from covid semester (Koelle) to supplement his lectures, so that was helpful. Overall, this course is really challenging and sometimes the exams had questions that were unfair because some questions we didn't even learn the information on, or we touched on it during lecture for like 5 seconds. I appreciated that the psets were short and were similar to exam questions/from previous exams. I also liked that they put one exact question from the psets on the exams for the three midterms and final. The study guides were also helpful to figure out what to focus on especially for the extremely dense lectures. Don't take this course if you're expecting a very HEAVY semester. You need to dedicate a lot of time to this class.",
                "The course was great. Lectures were very good and we were provided with ample materials to help review and learn material. Section was a helpful time to ask questions and lectures were a very comfortable environment to ask questions and engage with the material. The one weaknesses was when Professor Simon gave Professor Candy's lectures and was less confident about the material he was teaching because they were not his slides, but he still was great with questions and helping understanding where it was lacking. I also felt that the exam and final questions on metabolism did test facts more than understanding and concepts a little bit too much.",
                "This course was very well organized to aid our learning. The TAs in our section were very helpful and section was well planned out to help our learning. One weakness of this course is the lack of clearly planned office hours. While professors said they were available, it would have been easier if professors chose a time and place for office hours so that the burden wasn't on students to reach out and organize individual meetings.",
                "Matt Simon's lectures were excellent and engaging. I really appreciated (during the first half of the course) supplemental online lectures. I found that the study guides were helpful. Exams were fair, though I expect that the final grade differences will mostly be superficial since most students were regularly getting high marks. \r\n\r\nThe metabolism portion of the course felt rushed. I honestly think less time could have been spent on the material covered by Prof Simon (much of which was review from BIOL101) and more spent on metabolism. Lecture was virtually impossible to follow during this second half of the course. I also think it would've been beneficial to spend more time discussing how to tackle studying metabolism, which is challenging due to the abundance of information.",
                "Strengths: The course content is interesting! A must for anyone pursuing any sort of bio-related major.\r\nWeaknesses: The teaching style was not conducive to learning, and most TAs did not know their stuff.",
                "Strengths: Exams are pretty reasonable as the materials we needed to know are outlined in study guides posted with each lecture. Psets are also pretty short (generally takes 1-2 hours as sometimes even less) as they are just short answer questions from previous midterms/finals which also prepares you for exams which are nice.\r\n\r\nWeakness: This depends on who you are but the class is rather heavy on memorization. The first page of exams is straight-up fill in the blank up facts from the lecture slides (sometimes small details that aren't emphasized in class). The metabolism unit ends up being a whole lot of memorization of intermediates, mechanisms, enzymes, and cofactors.",
                "Strengths of this class is that it teaches you alot in a short amount of time yet that could also be a weakness.",
                "This class is probably the best possible way you could learn topics of biochem. People may say it's \"harder\" than MCDB biochem but I don't think that's true and everyone in the class seemed to do extremely well on midterms that were not dropped. Strengths of this course are of course the professors and TFs who put in a lot of effort to keep the course organized (one of the most organized classes I've taken so far actually!) as well as the quality of the teaching everything made sense! Also, I really appreciated that recordings from previous semesters were provided because I did go back to relisten to material after lecture in order to solidify concepts. Psets helped you get acquainted with exam-style questions and were pretty short to complete which was nice. The only weakness I would say is how office hours worked...I found it a bit confusing to try and figure out when office hours were especially in the beginning of the semester when there were not the same hours/day each week and were scheduled in canvas",
                "The biggest strength of this course was its emphasis on principles over details, which minimized memorization of facts while teaching students methods of biochemical reasoning, which are ultimately far more valuable. Unfortunately, this became a weakness near the end of the course, when the metabolism unit suddenly demanded huge amounts of memorization. This was reflected in both the last midterm and the final, a frustrating change in priorities.",
                "The first two sections of the course had excellent lecture slides and study guides, which greatly helped in understanding of the material being presented.",
                "I appreciated that the lectures were recorded, along with the availability of the lectures from the previous years. I do wish that there was more consistently/continuity within the course. The lecture slides from the first half of the semester were easy to follow, clear, and detailed; I could understand them after class when I was reviewing later. The metabolism section's lecture slides were not as nicely formatted, making them sometimes difficult to follow. I also wish that the video quizzes were required during the metabolism part of the course. I saw the questions from last year and I think they are incredibly helpful and insightful.",
                "Strengths: learned much more than just biochemistry, I also developed skills for problem solving, topic prioritization, study habits.\r\n\r\nWeakness: my grade does not represent how hard I work for the class and is very specific to a few learning methods. I am a verbal and kinesthetic learner, but it was very auditory and visual.",
                "The  focuses on the teaching of molecues before teaching the processes that the molecules are a part of. This layout allows for an effective understanding of the processes since the components have already been detailed. However, the transition between professors made it a little difficult to follow the course from one part to the other. While both individually were great teachers, the difference in teaching style and exam composition added difficulty to an already intensive course. The problem sets for the course seemed almost neglected, and were rarely covered in section, which I feel would've made the class more comprehensive.",
                "Great class! Really enjoyed the material",
                "This course covers an impressive range of material that proved useful across various disciplines. This course could be improved by developing more comprehensive study guides and multiple practice exams for each midterm. Furthermore, the workload for this course was rather heavy; in the future, it would be helpful to eliminate the out-of-class lecture videos given that student schedules are already densely packed. It would also be helpful to indicate if certain sets of information go beyond the scope of what will be tested on exams. While studying for exams, it was difficult at times to determine which minute details were genuinely important to know; this made it more difficult to focus on central concepts. Lastly, I believe the design of the third midterm and final exam should be reassessed. While the first two midterms of the course tended to focus on the application/incorporation of broader concepts, the last two exams included various questions that focused on highly specific facts from the course material (e.g., determining which cofactors, coenzymes, or other molecules were derived from vitamins). Given that the first half of the course emphasizes the importance of understanding the principles underlying the course material, some of the questions on later exams were not designed in a way that accurately assessed our knowledge.",
                "The biggest strength of this course was the emphasis on understanding principles rather than rote memorization. The weekly PSETS were great because they encouraged collaboration, which helped consolidate concepts from lecture. One weakness was that the final strayed away from principles towards specific memorization.",
                "I think all of the material is great. The grading on exams can sometimes be a bit strange. They are nit-picky about weird things, and some questions do not actually address things from the class well. I think the questions that make the student think like a scientist are very useful, where you have to puzzle things together, but there are some strange questions with structure that didn't really address the material. I really liked lectures and thought they explained things well, albeit fast. I wish the format for the psets was different (perhaps turn in a word document or something instead) just because the canvas tab could be finicky at times. I liked that we had pre-class quizzes, but for the material for midterm 2, the videos were twice the length of the videos from the first unit. This was hard because they would go over very important concepts in this section of the lecture, which was almost 1/3 of a lecture, but then not go over all of it in class. If the teaching team is going to keep pre-lecture videos, I think consistency in length to about 10-15 minutes is good. I really enjoyed the supplements and thought they were an excellent way to consolidate information, and I would not mind if lecture went all the way to 1 hour and 15 minutes if it meant things could be explained more clearly. Discussion section was very helpful as well, and I wish that there was discussion section very week despite an exam."

                "yeah def the course content is interest whether u r an mbb major or just a premed student",
                "Well, it's required for MB&B majors, so yes I suppose. Otherwise, no. It's just a whole ton of memorization, plus a bit of conceptual understandings. But, the real knowledge you gain is not much compared to all the facts that you have to memorize. So, unless you want to sit and memorize a ton of metabolic pathways, I'd say no.",
                "No",
                "I think this is a very challenging course but I left with a good understanding. It is extremely overwhelming and lectures are very overwhelming and the volume of the course is so high.",
                "Yes, this is a great course to take but only if you are really interested in biochemistry or if you need it. Sections are not too useful though so I found myself learning the material I didnt understand on my own.",
                "Its probably a requirement if youre taking it. If youre between this biochem and the other, Id talk to people in the other about how the exams felt, since psets can help you study. But if you dont feel the psets help, maybe dont take this over the only if you dont need to",
                "Yes",
                "It's interesting and definitely a MUST take if you're pre med. One semester should do you just fine for the mcats. Don't take this during a heavy semester bc for me, it was a very challenging/time demanding course because it is ALOT of information to learn.",
                "Yes. If you need a biochemistry class, this is an amazing option to take. It was incredibly fun. If you are like me and just needed biochemistry and wanted more biology in your life, this is also an amazing class. I learned a lot, had fun in it, and it allows me to take a lot more diverse selection of biology courses in the future. Honestly, this class was the right level of difficulty and there is nothing bad I can say about it.",
                "Yes! I'm a MCDB major and while I can't speak to the MCDB biochemistry, I'm very happy I took the MB&B version of the course. If you're looking for a deeper dive into the material, the MB&B biochemistry sequence is for you. MB&B 300 only covers proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids while MB&B 301 covers nucleic acids and is perfect for someone wanting to dive into the minutiae of biochemistry. Be ware, this course is a bunch of work and the material almost requires that you go to lecture, go to section, read the textbook, and go over the material many times in order to get a good grade in the class. There's also a fair bit of memorization in this course, although I appreciated that this wasn't the emphasis.",
                "Yes, I found the content to be very interesting. It's probably harder than MCDB biochemistry, but I liked it nonetheless.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless it's for your major or if you are premed. The grading is generous, but it is very difficult to learn things from lecture. I gained most of my knowledge from online videos and reviewing lecture slides with the textbook because the instructors were not great at lecturing.",
                "Defintely! For premed with the bandwidth, take this over the MCDB version as it is better taught and the grading (atleast from what Ive heard) is much more lenient! Exams are rather reasonable (except exam 3 on metabolism which was brutal) and you get to drop 1 exam out of 3. You do go into a lot more detail though so if you're not interested at all in biochemistry then you will probably find all the info overwhelming.",
                "Yes although very difficult it was very rewarding to learn.",
                "Yes, this is a great biochem class to take even if you're not MBB (I'm MCDB), I think it also pairs well with physio (BENG350/MCDB310) because of the overlap in lectures taught so studying for one felt like a review for the other or a lecture covered earlier in physio made learning the concept again in biochem much easier. I think this class is extremely well-taught and psets really help to ensure that you are keeping yourself on track. YOu do have to keep up with the lectures which can be time-consuming but it is really worth it when time comes for the midterms and final which were all extremely fair in the questions they asked.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in biochemistry. It's extremely well-taught and the content is very engaging. Be ready for a heavy load of memorization in the metabolism unit, but other than that the course does a good job of focusing on principles and reasoning rather than minute details.",

                "I would recommend the course to students interested in the subject matter, but not to someone outside of the STEM world.",
                "Yes! Great class especially for those preparing for the MCATs",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The course material is interesting and useful, the professors are fantastic, and the knowledge gained is applicable to various subjects outside of biochemistry.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course for someone interested in learning biochemistry. The principles approach is less intimidating and much more beneficial to understanding concepts.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student! This is, again, a very foundational course and teaches basics to science. You will read papers differently and understand your own research much more after this course, and it will expose you to novel techniques or ways of thinking about your work. I think that the teaching team is very organized and has done great with adapting to changes and teaching during the pandemic. I would definitely recommend reading the textbook, though, in order to fully understand concepts, and it will make psets much easier."
