                "Great course that helps with developing deep understanding of program evaluation and to gain skills to analyze the results of academic papers on Social scienc.",
                "This class gave a really great overview of the different empirical methods that can be applied to evaluate international development programmes (with the context focusing on education and health), for example RCTs, diff-in-diff, propensity score matching and regression discontinuity. We learnt the theory behind these methods and what type of treatment effect they produce, as well as how to carry them out using Stata. Professor Ardington also offered up a lot of her practical experience using these methods and how to analyse data effectively in Stata.",
                "A survey of the most typical experimental and quasi-experimental methods in development research.",

                "The strength are:\r\n- Structured and comprehensive instruction on RCT and other evaluation techniques.\r\n- Good balance between technical and exposure to the latest thinking in solving education and health challenges.",
                "Strengths - The readings were really engaging, and a large part of the course were reading summaries which Professor Ardington split between the class. We would go through these each week and analyse the research methods in detail, including drawing diagrams for the RCT approach and diff-in-diff. The mix between theory and Stata was great and made the course very helpful in a practical sense.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - There was a lot of change throughout the semester with the topics covered and also the reading list. During the midterm feedback period Professor Ardington responded to feedback about this and came up with a more structured syllabus/reading list which was really helpful. The assignments in the last few weeks could have been better organised however, as we only had one week's notice about a final group project and Stata exercise.",
                "Strengths: The final exam, readings, and practicals - all fascinating and the appropriate level of difficulty.\r\nWeaknesses: Class could have been better structured. For example, we read papers and wrote responses on these papers for Tuesday's class. Then on Tuesday the professor presented a lecture on the methods used in the papers we read. Then Thursday's class we discussed the papers. It would have been better if we had a lecture to understand the methods BEFORE we wrote our response papers. We also didn't get to cover as much as the syllabus said.",

                "I would really recommend this class, especially if you have an interest in international development or impact evaluation methods in general. The tips Professor Ardington gave on using stata to carry out the methods and common pitfalls (not creating dummies where you have missing data) were so valuable, and something I will definitely take into future work experience.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in the fundamentals of development research (particularly in the health and education space), this course is a must take. It is heavy on the methodology and light on the discussion of actual issues - if you are wanting to discuss policies and issues faced by different communities, this is NOT the course for you. If you are eager to understand how policies can be evaluated vis-a-vis efficacy, this IS the course for you.",
