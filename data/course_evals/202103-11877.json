                "We all receive the same exams but definitely do not receive the same quality of teaching. I found this to be very demoralizing and honestly just not fair.",
                "This was the most boring class I have ever taken in my life. I dropped down from 120 so I have to blame myself a little bit for taking a class with material I already knew a lot of. Regardless, math has always been one of my favorite subjects since I was little and I still hated this class.",
                "The explorations were not particularly useful. I prefer having concepts explained in class.",
                "A strength of the class is the size of my class was not too large that it did not feel collaborative. Furthermore, my professor made extra effort to encourage student discussion. A way that it could be improved is to have worksheets given to all classes. In order to study for the final, I used worksheets that were handed out by Professor Diethorn to her students (I had access to them from my friend who is in her class). However, my class never received worksheets such as these.",
                "This class was pretty standard in terms of math.  The amount of content covered was reasonable.\r\n\r\nI think this class would have benefited greatly from a section.",
                "Strengths: I think the structure of the explores and the weekly problem sets was good. I like how the units closely corresponded to the textbook sections.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I wish the problem sets were a LITTLE shorter/easier, but overall they were fine. I didn't understand the point of the Professor Demers activities -- they didn't add to my learning and I don't think they should be part of the course. My main issue with the class is that it needs to be more standardized across sections. Other people's teachers were making them review guides and giving them practice problems, while my teacher wasn't. In general, I feel that the course was not practice-based enough and we should have had more practice packets that we didn't have to submit as problem sets. The problems put up on the board during class that we were meant to discuss with neighbors were not sufficient.",
                "I think a lot of time is spent on \"fluff\" that isn't really necessary. I wish more time was spent on Taylor series than a massive chunk of time on different ways to prove the divergence/convergence of a series",
                "I believe the greatest strength for this course was the fact that they hosted review sessions each midterm as well as the final. The greatest weakness is that the quality of education varies greatly between professors. If it were up to me, I would make all of the MATH 115 professors use Professor Diethorns slides/review notes since those came in extremely useful!!",
                "The teacher didnt always provide clear instructions on how problems were done.",
                "I really liked the pre-class explores because it helped me understand each class' topic the first time around since I already had some familiarity with it (didn't have to go to office hours or consult textbook). I think there could have been more exam feedback.",
                "I didn't really like the way collaboration was enhanced in the class, by working with the person sitting next to us.",
                "A strength of this course is the vast amount of resources available to help a student if they are struggling. A weakness is that the time spent in class often feels wasted, due to the lack of direction.",
                "The strengths and weaknesses varied a lot based on which instructor you had. In my case, I wanted more practice problems and application, whereas we only had a couple each class and the rest was spent with the instructor answering questions asked by peers and explaining concepts.",
                "I personally had a lot of difficulty following my professor, and I wish there was more help offered from him.",
                "A strength of this course was the resources available to students outside of class. One weakness of this course was the lack of testing skills (outside of exams). Additionally, there was a lack of in-depth lessons for new material. Oftentimes the course was hard to follow and connect each unit to an overall understanding of math."

I don't think it's necessary to take this course if you're not planning on going into a field that requires calculus/higher math. It wasn't a bad course by all means, I just felt like I did a lot of the learning on my own by solving p-sets and looking at example problems in the textbook.",

                "I would not recommend this course to students who have previously taken AP Calc AB, even if they placed into the class. Many people in my class tested down into MATH 115 instead of taking a higher level. This made the course speed challenging for students who did not test down and were learning the material for the first time."
