                "I think the strengths are definitely the low-stress mode of instruction. I never felt stressed about the class but I still feel like I learned a lot throughout the course of it which made it a really enjoyable experience. The professors are great and all of the assessments, projects, and homework assignments are very low stress but also very informative. I don't think there are really any weaknesses, the course was really great!",
                "Could use a more specified format. Often assignments were given with no notice in advance",
                "A strength of course was it relying on conversations, stories, projects, and vocabulary review rather than just homework and tests. A weakness was sometimes miscommunication on important things such as exams.",
                "I believe that ASL is one of the best structured languages at Yale. Im not sure I have any critiques for the course.",
                "Wonderful course!\r\nStrengths: \r\n- Service learning aspect is great. \r\n- Incremental introduction and review of vocabulary is nice (when it happens this way)\r\n- Frances Conlin is wonderful. Generous, compassionate, dedicated teacher. Should receive a more substantive position at the University.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: (maybe the class, but I suspect the program which includes multiple classes all kept on the same syllabus)\r\n- Emphasis on memorization of obscure semantic and grammatical terms / postulates. Memorizing the names of the different categories of classifiers isn't nearly as important as being able to understand and use the different classifiers. Why would identifying them by obscure names be a fifth of the final? \r\n- Poor organization with respect to receiving work back. Had no idea where 2/3 of my homework was, then received it back and learned it was being graded on correctness.  \r\n- The fixed syllabus also makes it very difficult for us to work on the things our class is struggling with particularly (even when Prof C says \"we'll work on that\"). That's a real shame..."
