                "Learned a lot about writing about technical material for a broader society. I feel this class complemented my otherwise strictly technical involvement in computer science and made me a better scholar.",
                "I developed a range of knowledge, skills, and insights that have improved my writing and critical thinking abilities. Specifically, I learned how to research and write effectively about complex topics related to the technology industry, such as the impact of social media, artificial intelligence, and privacy concerns. I also gained a better understanding of different writing styles and techniques, including argumentation, rhetorical analysis, and persuasive writing.\r\n\r\nThrough various writing assignments, peer reviews, and class discussions, I learned how to structure and organize my ideas, use evidence to support my claims, and revise my writing based on feedback. I also gained insights into the ethical and societal implications of technology, such as the need for responsible innovation and the challenges of regulating emerging technologies. Overall, this course has helped me become a more confident and versatile writer, and equipped me with valuable skills that I can apply to future academic and professional contexts.",
                "Learned to emphasize an argumentative aspect to an essay and defend it. The main takeaway I gained from taking this course was how to create works that introduce new ideas that are interesting to the audience instead of truisms."

                "Strength: the readings were very accessible and engaging - no slogging through these! Assignments were also enjoyable and not hard at all to find a topic/angle that was fun to write about.\r\nWeakness: Course relies on pitching for a few assignments, which you don't get to practice in class. I would have appreciated a pitch practice day in class as an example.",
                "No notes. I thought our class discussions were really fascinating and the articles Prof. Gellman chose were thought-provoking. I also liked how she took suggestions of interesting articles and then assigned them late in the class.",

                "Yes, definitely! Especially if you're a CS major and want to gain a more well-rounded understanding of how your work fits into society and discourse.",
                "Yes! I would strongly recommend this class. A caveat would be that this class is almost exclusively taken by CS majors (we had 1 non-CS major), so if that sounds like not-your-crowd, you should not be taking the class. But otherwise, definitely take it!",
                "Yes, the readings discussed are very relevant to today's technological landscape and Professor Gellman ensures that the information being presented to the class is impactful."
