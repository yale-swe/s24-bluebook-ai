                "Strengths: I loved that the main homework was just to read the novels. There were no other readings. I enjoyed most of the novels, especially The Red and The Black and The Lover. Professors Samuels and Kaplan gave very entertaining and engaging lectures on the historical context, writers, and trends we needed to know to contextualize the books. I was always excited to attend the Zoom class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some books were a bit boring, but after watching the lectures I understood why they were significant.",

                "I loved the selection of books that we read, and I thought that lectures provided just enough insight to add to our reading experience while still giving us the opportunity to develop our own ideas. In terms of weaknesses, I wish the first two essay prompts for the writing section had been broader. I understand the motivation behind making us (1) compare two novels and (2) respond to specific guiding questions about the novels, but I found having to do both at the same time to be too restrictive. I think it would be better to ask students to do one or the other, rather than conform to both guidelines at once."

                "Yes! I don't know why this course isn't more popular! I really loved this class. Professor Samuel and Professor Kaplan are equally amazing, which I think is rare for a co-taught course. It was great to learn from their expertise in 19th and 20th century French novels respectively and also hear where their opinions differed. If you like to read novels, you will probably really enjoy this class. You get to learn about many different important writers including Balzac, Flaubert, Proust, Camus, and Duras. I did not feel like there was too much reading because most of it was enjoyable. The tests and essay were also very fair! Our first test had essay questions that focused on the themes and characters of the novels rather than memorizing material from lecture, which made things low-stress. Our second test was a longer take-home final with similar essay questions. This is an excellent humanities course, and I would recommend it to anyone regardless of major!",
                "A thousand times yes. This course is amazing and highly accessible. There is the option to take the class fully in English, take it as a writing credit, and to take it with lectures in English and the readings, exams, paper and section in French. You can make of it what you like. The professors are such a dynamic duo, and the material we cover is fascinating - the kind of books that everyone should read. This is the best class I have taken at Yale.",
                "Yes! A terrific course for people who are interested in learning just a little but about French literature, or just literature in general.",
                "I'd highly recommend this class! It was one of my favorites at Yale (I'm a senior, STEM major). You'll read some interesting books (I wouldn't say they were may favorite books of all time, but as someone who did not know anything about French lit beforehand, this class was a great intro) and hear some insightful lectures from 2 fun, personable profs. The reading takes some time (I'm a slower reader, I think) and discipline, but I think it was worth it. Even better to take it Cr\/D\/F in your last semester (like me), so that you can just enjoy the reading and the lectures without too much stress",
                "Yes. The readings were great and Maury and Alice are phenomenal lecturers -- each sentence they say is like poetry. Sections are meh but the good outweighs the bad.",
                "Yes. I loved both professors, engaging class and an interesting entry point to French history and intellectual History",
                "Yes if you like literature you have to explore the French canon with this class. Theres a lot of fun discussion through both a stylistic lens and a historical perspective, including realism and rising bourgeois values coming to dominate durimg and after the industrial revolution.",
                "Absolutely. Take this course to remember why you like reading.",

                "Yes, i really enjoyed it",

                "It was a great class, and Im glad I took it my final semester here. The class made me realize just what a privilege it is to be a Yalie and to learn from people like Profs. Kaplan and Samuels.",
                "Absolutely take this course if you want a fun English\/Literature style course! I had no interest in French literature before but genuinely loved almost all the novels we read. The teaching style was also great!",
                "Yes! I am so grateful that I took this course because it introduced me to an entire literary tradition I wouldn't have otherwise encountered. I learned so much about literature and French culture, but also about life and what it means to be human. Reading these books kept me sane through everything that was going on this semester."
