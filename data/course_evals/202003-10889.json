                "It is very up to the student how much they put into the class and how much they want to learn. Extremely useful for the future and very applicable.",
                "No weaknesses, this is one of the best and most useful classes I have taken at Yale. Prof. Antle teaches us SO much.",
                "Excel work and also basic accounting skills that I learned over the summer at a job.",
                "Strengths: you will learn a ton very quickly (especially if you don't know anything about accounting!). The material is straightforward: if you are willing to put in the work, you will get it. Doing the actual accounting is not difficult (it is fun for people who enjoy methodic work!), but the conceptual part can get tricky. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough evaluations. Basically if you do the 2 problem sets and the first part of the final, you will get a B+. Those 2 problem sets and the first part of the final might take you 10 hours total. Yes, you read that right: 10 hours. If you are not content with a B+, your entire grade is determined by the two-hour Part 2 of the final exam. This means that you will have NO IDEA what your grade will be until basically grades come out at the end of the semester.",
                "The semester was very i=uneven in my opinion with the first few weeks almost being too easy and then everything picking up and happening at the end. We often went very slowly over things that didn't matter as much and went quickly over things that might have been more important.",
                "Strengths of the course was the constant reinforcement of excel techniques that were used in trying to understand the concepts. A possible way that it could be improved would be to make the introduction to some of the terms and concepts more clear before jumping into the modeling and excel work. Much of the excel work was very faced paced and there was an expected prior knowledge level that was unclear and if not met, made it very difficult to keep pace.",
                "Strengths: Professor Antle is the most devoted professor who is always happy to answer questions or help students learn! Learning came through practice\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes felt like we werent learning accounting the standard way",
                "Strengths: Professor Antle is very nice and knowledgable in this field. The assignments are consistent and helpful with a lot of feedback provided through ExPrep and YALEiE. Weakness: This course needs better organization. Professor Antle needs to upload all assignments and files into one central location in a timely manner. At times it is hard finding where certain files are located.",

                "Strengths engaging teacher (love Antle), good structure and organization (which means a lot during virtual times)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses-- lectures were 1h15min where they could've been done in probably 30 min. Lots of wasted time in the lectures which was frustrating.",
                "Prof. Antle does a great job reviewing the homeworks in class and the in-worksheet feedback makes the PSETS and final exam very approachable if you have been keeping up with the lectures. I wish there were some more written materials\/guidance that students can refer to (no official textbook for this class) to think about and remember key terms, things to look out for, as well as where to go to answer specific questions we might have. Prof. Antle is very responsive over both email and Piazza so very grateful for his support throughout the semester.",

I found it very enjoyable to learn about accounting because I'm almost certain I will be using the skills I learned in this class after I graduate.

He has a green screen (yes, an actual green screen in his home), to make the videos look super professional. He even suited up for almost all of the lectures! He has 2 cameras, and will switch the angle of the recording to keep you awake. \r\n\r\nEngagement could perhaps be improved in lecture by asking students to keep their video on.",

I was impressed by the different technology tools he used to make class engaging and effective. The homework assignments were graded on completion, the PSETS were posted with enough time to ask questions and review, and the final exam had a flexible time frame. I think there could be more regular office hours to ask questions outside of class time. I also appreciate how he made study groups at the beginning of the semester and look forward to hearing about how Prof. Antle builds community among students in different ways.",

Extremely minimal workload (approximately 1.5 hours a week) and I still learned so much. However, if you care a ton about your GPA, you might be quite nervous about this class, as there are really no grades until the final, but I believe everyone gets at least a B+ pretty much.",

By the end of the class, you will be able to pick up any company's financial statements and actually understand what is going on. That is an invaluable and necessary skill in the business world.\r\n\r\nAlso, the class is fast-paced and you will actually learn a ton in just one semester. It's a great investment of your time. It's honestly probably better than any accounting class you would take in business school. This will definitely give you a leg up in the real world. But warning: you will only get as much out of the class as you put in. There is barely any required work, so unless you put in efforts, you might actually not end up learning very much.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in how to build and read financial statements. There is very little that is discussed about valuation methods and the whole course is a comprehensive process of journaling financial transactions, logging them in t-accounts, and then transferring that information into the balancing of financial statements. Hence, someone who is interested in reading financial statements and understanding the process for how a transaction goes from initial transaction to financial statement data should take this course.",

He also had numerous fun and personal anecdotes to liven up the material -- it never once felt like a technical jargon overload.",

However, as the semester progressed, I was able to familiarize myself with basic terminology and became more comfortable finding patterns and understanding how to fill out our assignments. I would recommend this to students who are interested in learning the basics of accounting in an accessible way. It was hard to stay on top of things with the pre-recorded lectures so I wouldn't recommend this to students who don't keep up with the lectures (I regret not doing this until too late). However, I learned a lot of practical skills and am grateful that I took this class. I took this class Credit\/D and feel comfortable recommending this as a 5th class.",
