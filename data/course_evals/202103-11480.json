                "Strengths: Rigorously encourages students to learn a new language. \r\nWeaknesses: Dips its toes into too many areas at once. Either do vocabulary or grammar first. Doing both together becomes very difficult.",
                "Strengths: Well taught and organized.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of work, although that is expected from a language. Also, it seems that the large majority of students who take L1 have had Spanish experience before, making it more difficult for those who have never taken Spanish in high school.",
                "I think a lot of the homework was tedious, unengaging, and not terribly helpful. VHL as a platform and the textbook in general just left a lot to be desired.",
                "The strengths definitely lie in the accessibility of all the material taught. I thought Professor Sofia was an outstanding teacher who took the time and effort to make sure we understood all the concepts taught in class fully. I feel what could be improved is the grading structure of some assignments. For example, 2 very important projects were judged a lot based on appearance and design rather than Spanish writing or speaking ability. Since this is a Spanish class, I don't see why we must also be good at graphic design.",
                "Strengths: our class was small and I felt like I got a lot of feedback from my teacher. She was excellent and always gave good feedback and made sure that we had everything we needed to do to learn the material. Weaknesses: I sometimes felt there was a disconnect between our teacher and the course as a whole. There were moments where I felt like some of the test material was coming from a different perspective from our teacher, which is probably to be expected, but was a little bit annoying sometimes.",
                "The strength of the course is that material is assigned everyday for daily practice, but a weakness is that there are too many major assignments due too close together.",

                "I would probably recommend this course to other students, especially if they are interested in Spanish. It is well taught and I learned a good amount of Spanish. However, in terms of language classes, there are certainly easier classes that get rid of the language requirement. If you are trying to get rid of the language distribution requirement, I would take a different language.",
                "Yes, definitely. I learned a lot and enjoyed it.",
                "If you are looking for a gut language, do NOT take this course. It is challenging and requires a lot of work. However, if you want to challenge yourself and learn a new language that is commonly spoken across the US, you will learn a lot from this course as it will build all the basic foundations necessary for you to progress on to Level 2.",
                "I'm not going to suddenly tell all my friends they have to take this class, but if you're looking to start learning a language, then I have no reason to tell you not to take Spanish. The class is hard but never unfair, and there is work but I never felt overwhelmed by any of it. I struggled with it at points, because starting from scratch with a new language is hard, but I didn't feel like any of my struggling had anything to do with the class. If anything, the class made sure that I was practicing the language effectively and gave me everything I needed to be confident for the assessments. That being said, the average grades in the class (from what I could tell on Canvas) felt lower than I expected, and I didn't feel like I studied often enough or effectively enough to do as well in the class as I could have. If you are hyperobsessed with grades, there are other languages for that; otherwise, I enjoyed this class and would recommend it to people who want to take Spanish.",
