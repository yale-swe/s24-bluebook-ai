                "I learned a lot about fundamental sociological theories! Even as someone who has taken several sociology courses, I learned so much  in this class about topics in sociology I had not yet explored. The content was not only interesting, but challenging in a way that really fed my curiosity throughout the semester.",
                "Learned about different facets of a society, culturally, racially, and from a gender perspective",
                "I learned what sociology is and some basic methods and concepts sociologists use to analyze humans and human society.",
                "I learned about different fields of sociology, prominent sociologists in their respective fields and what they theorized or studied, and generally studied concepts of sociology as they related to different themes in society such as race, gender, class, education, prisons, drug use, etc.",
                "An introductory knowledge of the field of sociology, which inspired me to take more classes in the field.",
                "I learned about sociological ideas in many different subjects, some of which include sports, education, medicine, crime, and the body. It was really interesting to think about things in a different way than I had before, especially during lectures that lined up with things we've discussed in other classes. It was very much an overview course, so we didn't go very deep into anything, but there were a couple people we talked about across many different fields (Durkheim, Foucault, Weber), and that let me make connections between topics.",
                "Sociology - study of society and what makes it work. The way the course worked was that each lecture was generally on a broad topic (e.g. sports, education, crime) and the social aspects. Overall I think the course did a good job of giving a sense of how a wide set of things are social, and how the social plays a part of each of these things, though we didn't quite go into depth with any particular topic (though they came up again and again because of interconnections). Overall I think each class was a good exercise in deconstructing different aspects of life and seeing how they're social activities. I think that seeing things through the sociological lens helps in seeing how the social plays a part in different parts of my own life."

                "Professor Smith is really engaging, and he has a way of explaining theories that stick. All the TAs were also really great for this class, and I could tell that the TAs and Professor had a good relationship. I can't think of ways this class can be improved except for making sure the class ends when it's suppose to end.",
                "Professor Smith has used a very generous grading scale, but this allows him to provide very real and blunt feedback and tell you precisely what your faults are in your sociological writing. I would say this structure makes for more effective learning. The weekly sections with the TFs to touch on readings related to the lectures are helpful for understanding concepts in action. Because the course is an overview, you should keep in mind that it's very broad and may seem like a lot of content if you aren't able to really conceptualize the different sociological perspectives. Professor Smith is a really wonderful and enjoyable lecturer. His wit and egalitarian feel make the lecture feel more welcoming, and he brings in perspectives from the TAs if he knows they can provide.",
                "nothing bad about this course learned a lot. maybe wish classes were more interactive",
                "I think it is hard to retain the information sometimes because you have to be really listening and taking notes. Sometimes talks fast.",
                "The two greatest strengths were the course content, which was almost always very interesting, and Prof Smith, who is incredibly engaging. The major weakness was the grading scale, which simply did not make much sense considering the amount fo work that went into preparing for exams.",
                "Strengths - great TA and section was super useful \r\nWeakness - the lecture was sometimes too fast and info overload",
                "The lectures can be very repetitive and often run past the end of the class time. The sections are also not very helpful and seem a bit unorganized.",
                "Very straightforward class, exams are fair and well structured, easy to follow assignments and lectures.",
                "Strengths of this course were the instructors. It was evident that this was Professor Smith's course and the TFs were knowledgeable, approachable, and generally enthusiastic about helping us. The work load was also fine for an intro course. Weaknesses were sometimes the lectures weren't super exciting but that was just the professor's style. Also, the midterm test and midterm paper were due really close together which I think is a bit unfair. They were held\/due on consecutive classes, which basically expected us to write our papers over spring break which I don't believe we should be expected to do. No one was going to start writing the essay before the midterm because we were studying, so the entire paper had to be written over spring break. Also, the rubric for the midterm paper was not specific enough about expectations and many points were docked for things that they did not specify how they wanted. Sections were great and helped the most for me understanding concepts through discussion.",
                "Strengths: Very informative lectures. He packs a lot of information into each one, but I found that to be a strength because it showed a lot of different facets of each topic. Even though we only spent one lecture on most topics, the variety of authors he included in the lecture let me connect topics across lectures. Weekly discussion sections were a strength because we talked about some of the topics from class in a way that made them seem more applicable (2-3 research papers each week from various decades).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have appreciated more detailed lecture notes. He has mentioned wanting to encourage people to come to class by providing very little information on the slides, but it would be nice to know that I can find the information somewhere if I miss writing it down or can't go to lecture one day. Having both a paper and a test for midterms and finals was also a bit stressful, but they weren't due the same day.",
                "Strengths: I think professor Smith is a solid lecturer and was generally able to deliver material succinctly (even if he had a tendency to go over the lecture time by a few minutes each lecture). He also has a solid knowledge of the field, and tried to implement discussions into the lectures. Overall for an intro course I think I got a good feel of the broad strokes of the field, methods, theorists, and different lines of thinking in sociology. The TFs show up to class and contributed their own knowledge as well, which I appreciated. The readings were light and I generally found the papers\/midterms not too bad, i.e. they were fair in terms of length and content.",

I made the unfortunate error of taking this course along with other really challenging courses and was not able to commit a lot of time to this course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone even slightly interested in sociology or the topics listed on the syllabus. It's honestly a really easy class. I skimmed the readings right before section every week, and that was enough to keep up and contribute and also to remember the major themes for the midterm and final. You have to study some for the tests because they require you to know people and specific ideas, not just common sense, but it's not too bad. Also, it was just a really interesting class. Professor Smith is pretty funny and definitely does a good job of explaining each topic. It's a great course if you want to fulfill a distributional rec or just take it for fun (like I did).",
                "Yes, it was more difficult then I expected but the class was very engaging and rewarding",
                "If you're a sociology major, I imagine it's probably required or you're probably already inclined to take it, so I'll assume that you aren't a sociology major. In general I think this is a fair course to take - it gives a lot of thoughtful directions of thinking, and connects to a lot of different topics in my own life\/that I'm personally interested in, and gave different views on these topics from new lenses. I think it was a good experience to sit in lecture\/section each week and reflect on how different aspects are life are social - I think that the course helps you exercise that muscle, and I think this helps me think about my own life more critically, and it's certainly something that I think many people can benefit from. It's a solid choice of course for fun or for social science credit I think.",
