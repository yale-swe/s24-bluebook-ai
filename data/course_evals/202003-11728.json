                "very well taught class",
                "Strengths: professor Anibal cares about his students and is a great person overall. However, the content of the course was just confusing. The psets were long and tedious, and there was not much support for them. After the entire semester, I still can't really say how the stuff we learned is applicable\/ why it matters. I think more office hours, more TA's and a better course flow plan might be helpful in improving this class.",
                "The course was very fast paced towards the end. However, it was very enjoyable as it was gradiated at the start, which built up my mathematical confidence.",
                "Strengths: The course provided a lot of support (1.5 hours of office hours by the professor, 4 hours by the TA, and 4 hours by the peer tutor) for students, and the professor was always available by email or after class for questions. The book closely follows the (optional) book, which made it easy to look up material if I didn't understand the concept. I liked that this class focused a lot on building our understanding of concepts in linear algebra rather than just giving us formulas for solving problems. While this made the problem sets a lot harder, since we could not rely on learning patterns but instead piecing together proofs in class to prove a new statement, it gave us a more in-depth understanding of the topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While the TA's sessions in the beginning of the class did teach you what methods can be used in math proofs, there are no instructions for how to write a formal proof, and most of it is done through feedback from homework or through learning from the professor's own proofs (which involved shorthand) during class. It would have been nice to be provided with a good example at the beginning of class, along with the terms that are typically used in a proof (e.g., \"Let ___,\" \"It follows that ___\"). Near the end of the semester, one of the graders stopped grading the assignments which made it difficult to check our understanding. However, this was not a fault of the professor's, and he also posted the solutions for us to look at.",
                "Strength: professor Velozo! and a peer tutor. Weaknesses: very often problem sets were out of scope of the material in the class and not having prior experience in proofs definitely made the beginning of the class very challenging. It was really hard to get started on proofs and without help from Max it would be impossible to get through the class. Although TA offered sections to explain how proofs work, going to them made me even more confused.",
                "This class is really hard but it was good.",
                "The PSETS were very well designed to help with understanding lecture material. They were challenging but certainly helped my understanding of the course material.\r\n\r\nThe pacing of the class could be improved. It moved a bit slowly at the beginning, and the last few units were too fast. It was still manageable, but difficult.",
                "I enjoyed how he posted the slides after every class",
                "Overall timeline., The first 3 months were EXCELLENT. However, in the last leg of the course, the pacing got way to fast and hard to follow",
                "The strengths include the depth of the material presented, as well as the assignments that were tailored to the material taught in class. The course could be improved by going slower in lectures and going over more example of sample problems.",
                "The course moved at a very reasonable pace, and Professor Velozo was always willing to answer questions and clarify concepts.",
                "Because it was a lecture course, it was very difficult to stay engaged throughout the class period. However, the way in which it was taught, with the slides not being pre-prepared and instead written out in front of us made it easier to follow everything and stay focused.",
                "I think a strength was that Professor Velozo was really helpful and willing to slow down and repeat things or answer questions. I would often ask questions during lecture and he really took the time to fully answer them and explain things again if I didn't understand. A weakness of this course was that it was a lot of new material that we moved through very quickly, but that seems a bit inevitable and just a reflection of the rigor of the material. What I do think could be improved is the way that proofs were covered at the beginning. I went to the TA session about proofs, but I still was not super clear about what would be expected of us for our first pset, so maybe that could be made a little clearer\/ more geared specifically to this class and expectations rather than in general.",
                "Great introduction to proofs!",
                "- The pace of the course was just right. \r\n- Professor Velozo weaved  concepts together such that new ideas sometimes felt obvious.\r\n- The mix between proof and application questions on problem sets was good. \r\n\r\n- The times Professor Velozo gave us the big picture view of the course material were some of the best. He could stand to do more of that in future classes.",
                "Prof. Velozo is a phenomenal instructor. I thoroughly enjoyed his class, and looked forward to lecture each day even though it was at 9am (I am not a morning person). He explains concepts very clearly and thoroughly. The class was organized very fairly, and I felt like I learned so much.",
                "Strengths: Pace was okay. Max, our peer tutor, was amazingly helpful. I felt exams were relatively fair. Weaknesses: I felt some topics were poorly explained. It was also not clear which theorems\/facts we could or could not use, and what we could assume as proven or not proven.",
                "I always felt well-equipped to do the problem sets and exams. I could do all of the calculations I needed to. But I often and severely lacked a physical or conceptual intuition about the math we were doing. 3blue1brown's \"Essence of Linear Algebra\" videos helped with this, and I wish we covered more of this in class. I could plug numbers into the formula or prove x = y, but if you asked me what x is, what y is, and why they are equivalent, I would have no idea. In short: more intuition and conceptual explanations.",
                "difficult material, extra support not offered across different time zones",
                "This course was fantastic. Anibal is a great teacher, and writes all the powerpoint slides as you go, which means the pace is reasonable and you can understand his thought processes as he goes from one point to another. Max, the TA, was also fantastic. I don't know when I'll use Linear Algebra, but it was certainly so much fun learning it and teaching my mind to work in new ways.",
                "Anibal is a great professor. He really wanted to help us succeed in the class, especially with the remote format, and cares about the class. The peer tutor was also great, and there were many chances to receive help in the class. The textbook is really helpful and pretty well written. Expectations are very reasonable. Overall, the material was interesting, but the pacing of the class was definitely a bit off balance. The second half of the semester felt more overwhelming in terms of the level of difficulty of the material.",

                "I personally found that having live lectures over zoom worked for me and allowed me to stay engaged. What really allowed that format to work for me is the way that Professor Velozo teaches. He usually specifically asks if we have any questions after each proof, and sometimes asks for us to suggest ways to work on the proofs as he does them. This helped me feel more comfortable asking questions because I didn't have to interrupt to ask them, and because I knew they were welcome, and this kept me engaged and really improved my learning.",

There were ample resources to answer any questions you might have and\/or get additional help.",

I could easily ask questions at OH or PT hours if necessary. I preferred this format to in-person lectures. The only thing I missed was interaction with classmates. I suppose I could've organized a study group or some such, but I am far too disorganized for that, so there was never any chance for casual, in-person discussion of material or mutual support on homework.",

All of my mentors highly recommended this course over one that just focused on calculations. Once you write down your problem in linear algebra terms, there is probably already some code out there to solve that problem, so learning the concepts is much more useful that learning the calculations.",
                "If you are going to take more advanced math classes in the future - definitely take 225. It offers a good transition from applicational to proof-based math. But if linear algebra is the last math class you are going to take, definitely take 222, because the pain from 225 is not worth it. Definitely utilise peer tutor OH and collaborate with other students on the problem sets, because it makes linear algebra experience becomes so much better when you go through it with a friend. And start problem sets early!",
                "Yes, this class is really epic.",
                "I would recommend this course. I really liked that we proved everything that we learned because it provided me with a more rigorous understanding of linear algebra. I had never done any proofs prior to this class, but I felt like the lectures did a great job of introducing all the proof techniques that we needed to do psets and understand the material. It was a very satisfying class.",
                "yes, if you need it for your major take it. Psets will be long and hard but you'll get through it",
                "Yes -- Lin alg is important for ML and Stats",
                "Yes, it is a great course to learn linear algebra and you get some experience with proof-based math.",
                "It depends on if you need this for your major or not.",
                "Yes; this is an excellent first course in writing proofs, and the topics covered were interesting.",
                "Yes. I thought the professor was great - he was always willing to meet to help go over questions about the problem sets or something from class. Beyond this, I thought it created a good foundation for proofs, and, although it was very challenging (especially in the beginning), it was a very rewarding class when all was said and done.",
                "Yes, but only if you have time to put in a good amount of work in this class, and you are willing to be patient with yourself in terms of understanding the material. While it was possible to get good grades in this class because assessments were open-note and take home due to covid, I found the material very challenging. I would often get really frustrated because I felt like I just didn't understand the material at all and it was all way more abstract than any math I had done previously. However, I realized that I could eventually get it by working hard, asking questions in class, and just giving myself time, as sometimes things clicked into place as we kept going. This class was really valuable to me because it helped me expand my logical thinking and math skills, and also how to push through when I am struggling to understand things. Plus it was really interesting and felt great when something finally clicked. I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a difficult but rewarding class.",
                "Yes! Linear algebra is a beautiful part of mathematics!",
                "Yes! If you are interested in math beyond calculus, take linear (especially if its with Anibal). Linear applies to so many different fields and you won't waste your time with the class. Also, if you plan to work a lot with proofs (i.e. math majors) this course was a really great introductory course to proofs. Anibal graded proofs more for content and wasn't so picky on convention, which is great for a person doing proofs for the first time!",
                "Yes, take Math 225 if Professor Velozo is teaching it. If you're reading this, there's a good chance you are debating whether to take 222 or 225. \r\nConsider 225 if you\r\n- enjoy doing proofs\r\n- don't mind seeking out applications on your own\r\n- want to develop your mathematical intuition\r\n- learn better working from first-principles ( I think that taking 222 would have had me saying, \"Okay, but why?\" more often than I would have liked. Before the semester began I had my reservations about keeping up. Because 225 resolved those \"why\" questions, I can say with hindsight that it was definitely the right class for me.)\r\n\r\nIf you take harder classes for the sake of taking harder classes, reconsider your motivations to take 225. Math 230\/231 might be a better fit.",
                "Yes. Great introduction to proof based linear algebra, especially if the instructor is Prof. Velozo.",
                "Very fun. I have never met him, but I would trust Anibal Velozo with my children in an emergency if I had children and for some reason he were the only available person. Good lecturer and great person.",
                "no- unless they needed to take it for a mathematics major. not taught in an enjoyable way, progressed too fast through material, not enough practice\/calculations to fully absorb the material, too theoretical",
                "Absolutely, if you can take it with Anibal. I think this is one of those instances in which it really matters who the teacher is, as Linear Algebra can be a dry or incomprehensible subject. Anibal is super funny, very understanding, and very good at explaining things to students. This class was a lot of fun, and I definitely came out feeling like I had a new way of looking at the world.",
                "Yes. The material is challenging, but you definitely learn a lot. If this is your first proof based class, it's probably one of the better classes to learn proofs in. I also shopped 222 and found that 225 was more interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. This has been one of my most rewarding, interesting classes at Yale to date. I enjoyed taking the course with Anibal."
