    "strength was definitely the teachers. The Japanese teachers are all really kind and helpful. They teach well and are really engaging. \r\n\r\nweakness is the textbook we used. I didn't like the textbook at all and there should be a better textbook in the market for learning Japanese.",
    "The class is VERY fast-paced, which is good because you learn a lot, but it's definitely an extremely time consuming class.",
    "Strengths: All professors are very dedicated and patient. The course is very engaging and interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeakness: The speed of class is very fast and workload is a little heavy."

    "Yes, if they like Japanese.",
    "This is the best class I have ever taken at Yale. If you are unsure which language to take and you have any interest in Japanese culture at all please take this class. Yes there is daily work (more than other languages) but the work is fun to do and you will learn so much Japanese it's crazy. The professors are some of the best people I have ever met.",
    "YES!! If you want to learn Japanese, you will seriously learn it with the best professors!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It is challenging and the workload is a lot because it meets everyday, but the teacher support I received was much better than my other classes. The teachers really care about you and the small class size allows you to really get to know your teachers.",
    "I would recommend this class if they really enjoy learning languages. Considering this is a class that meets every day and has homework every day, it would be a miserable experience to take it if you didn't enjoy it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to someone who has a serious intention of learning the language.",
    "If you are a student who is passionate about Japanese and interested in Japanese culture for sure take this class."
