                "I really honed my ability to analyze authors' choices and their effects. I also learned some great strategies for making my own writing more concise, interesting, descriptive, and coherent.",
                "Great class in developing close reading and improving your writing. Great first english class to improve my writing",
                "I think this course really helped me to develop my voice as an author. I think the combination of reading and writing essays was really beneficial in terms of learning about literary techniques and utilizing them in our own writing in a short timeline. I think my close reading skills improved as well.",
                "I learned to look critically at essays and recognize how tactical decisions by the authors can create certain tones. I got a lot better at revising essays and figuring out what to omit from my drafts.",
                "I became a much better writer over the course of the semester, and I became much more confident writing in a collegiate setting.",
                "In this class, we learned not only how to critically read and analyze texts but also how to develop a unique writing style to create our own pieces. I became very comfortable with taking risks in my writing.",
                "This course helped me develop skills on reading and evaluating essays, judging a peers essay, and correctly formatting an essay of my own.",
                "I read a wonderful survey of some of the best creative non fiction of the last hundred or so years, from excellent authors known and not so known. I strengthened my close reading skills tenfold from the start of the semester. I produced five essays, all of which got an incredible amount of close, insightful feedback.",
                "I have learned how to write a myriad of different essays, and my writing has improved substantially. This is the best English course I have ever taken, and the professors know exactly how to find what small mistakes you are making and how to make your writing better."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The readings are so engaging and interesting. Prof Hurley is super enthusiastic and makes the class fun. The 5 essays are actually fun to write (in my opinion) because they're informal, short, and you have so much freedom in what to write about. I went into the class thinking the essays would be like high school English, analyzing texts, but they're not--it's like, \"write about an interesting event in your life\" and \"write a profile of a person you know.\" The small size and seminar structure of the class also means you get to hear all of your classmates' thoughts and learn from them as well as the Prof. \r\nWeakness: I found the deadlines a little tricky sometimes, because we often had a very short time to write the first draft and then a lot of time to revise it and turn in the final draft. Personally, it takes me a lot longer to get the first draft out on paper from nothing than it does to revise an existing draft, so I wish that timeframe was reversed.",
                "Great material we read and lots of feedback which helped improve my writing.",
                "I think there are two main weaknesses to this course. The first is the structure and deadlines of the class. We would turn in an essay on a Sunday night, have readings due the next morning, and then a proposal due on Wednesday for the next essay, and a draft due on Friday or Sunday for that same essay. Between the readings and the drafts being assigned at the same time, I found myself drafting my essays only a few hours before the deadline and wasn't able to work on them as much as I would've liked if there had been a different structure to the deadlines in the class. The second weakness is the fact that the class doesn't really \"teach\" you how to write. You show up to the first day of class, and you're assigned readings and an essay. Theres not a lot of actual teaching going on, I think the students mainly make their strides on their own.",
                "Strengths: great professor (in my experience), a large variety of essay styles and content, good essay feedback\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lots of readings",
                "This course had a consistent curriculum and clear expectations. The essays we read were interesting and we got a lot out of reading them. The essay topics were varied and gave us a broad range of skills to explore.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hurley is one of the most enthusiastic and understanding teachers ever, she really is invested in the success of each and every one of her students. She gives very thorough, insightful, and constructive feedback on every submitted draft. The different prompts also allow students to experiment with different styles of writing. The seminar-style discussions, workshops, visits from professional writers, and \"field trips\" to the Beinecke Library all helped make each class interesting; Weaknesses: the class is fast-paced at times, and sometimes, the turnaround between drafts is not very long. Though most of the readings are great, some of them can get a bit dull.",
                "The amount of individual feedback you get on your writing is truly staggering  it's impossible not to improve as a writer. There are so many opportunities to receive and implement notes on your writing. The readings are (for the most part) short and engaging, and they cover a wide variety of subjects, tones, and styles. The workshop element of this course is both a strength and a weakness  for the first few workshops, the quality of feedback you receive from your peers is not as good as the last few, as everyone is learning how to give workshop comments, but once they pick up they're very useful. This is true for class discussions as well  if the students aren't coming from as strong English backgrounds and need to adjust, it takes about a unit for discussions to really take off.",
                "I really dont think there were any weaknesses in this course. The workload was super manageable and worth it."

                "I would definitely, 100% recommend this course to another student. It was a great way to practice writing in a chill environment and have a fun time reading interesting, funny, and sometimes controversial essays.",
                "Yes! Gina was an amazing instructor who greatly improved my writing over the semester. All of the reading material was engaging and I thoroughly enjoyed all the work for this class.",
                "Depending on what type of person you are, you may or may not want to take this class. I found myself in class listening to other students use tons of buzz words and trying to speak in a certain way to sound more intellectual and sometimes it was honestly painful to sit through. Overall do I think my writing improved? Yes. Would I take the class again? Maybe not. Just keep in mind that it's not for everyone.",
                "Yes, because I think it helps create a good writing foundation no matter what other fields they want to persue",
                "Yes, this course was a great introduction to essay writing that made me feel like I could write professional, published essays. I could witness my continual improvement throughout the semester. The professor was amazing. My only negative is that the standard for an A grade is outlined in the syllabus as an essay deserving of a departmental award. In a society that values a 4.0 gpa, it can be hard to justify taking a class that will likely bring that down.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially anyone who is interested in taking a nonfiction creative writing class. This course will make you a better writer in just one semester. Prior to this class, I had never really experimented with creative writing, but this class has taught me that the writing process can be a very fun (though challenging) process. Professor Hurley is very passionate and enthusiastic about teaching this class. Her feedback is supportive and her grading is fair. However, ENGL 120 is a lot of work, and getting high grades will require lots of effort each week (as the class is fast-paced so the time between draft and final draft deadlines is not very long). That being said, the amount of time invested was well worth it as I feel like my writing style and authorial voice have really come a long way this semester.",
                "Yes, it was a very useful course to take and will help me with any essay I need to write in the future.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially (I cannot stress this enough!) with Professor Hurley. My class was all first-years, but it's a great course for anyone who wants to improve their writing. I came from a pretty strong background in writing, and Im miles better than where I was at the beginning of the semester  and my classmates who weren't as confident in their writing skills also felt like they had improved immensely. The readings are funny, moving, and worth drawing on throughout the rest of your education and your life.",
                "Yes! Professor Hurley is one of the best professors I ever got to work with. Aside from being a genious at profreading papers, she is the sweetest person ever."
