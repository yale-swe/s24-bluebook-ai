    "Basic microeconomic concepts",
    "I feel like I gained an overall understanding of microeconomics and basic economic concepts, however I think it was at a pretty shallow level.",

    "Throughout this course, I have learned a great amount of economics. I feel like I have a better understanding of the course after taking this course. I am able to use theories and concepts to solve problems from taking this course.",
    "I developed a bait knowledge of Microeconomics as it pertains to the real world.",
    "I learned a lot in this course about microeconomics. I learned much more than I expected to, and believe that I now have a solid base to build on as I take more classes in economics.",
    "An introduction to microeconomics and a new perspective of how to look at things.",
    "I learned the numbers behind the basics of economics.",
    "I learned the basis of how a perfectly-competitive market functions, the trade-offs between efficiency and equity in the economy, the ways actual markets can deviate from this ideal, and the methods governments can use to correct these failures.",
    "I learned about market failures and how to correct them as well as how to be a good economic citizen.",
    "This course gives a basic introduction into the topics of microeconomics and helps develop the framework for the most important models, which will be useful in future analysis.",
    "I came into Yale without any experience in Econ, and now, I feel like I have a fairly good understanding of the basics of Micro. I learned some simple math and proofs that I did not know before taking the class. That being said, I don't actually feel like I learned all that much. I know that it is only an introductory course, but I do not think that I left the class with a lot of new knowledge; most of the information was fairly intuitive.\r\n\r\nI did, however, learn skills that will help me in future large lecture courses. I learned how to take good notes in such a setting, how to prepare for exams, and how to collaborate with others on problem sets.",
    "basic concepts of what economics is, though more in depth than any high school AP course would have gone",
    "You learn the basics of microeconomics. It's very theoretical, and there are few applications.",

    "I learned how governments work, how to maximize utility and other basic economic principles.",
    "I learned about several types of markets including perfect competition, monopolies, and oligopolies and how they functioned. I learned about optimality in general for each of these markets as well.",
    "This course teaches a lot of skills that are foundational for economics (i.e. supply & demand, efficiency, allocations, monopoly, etc.), and uses them in context of real-world examples (such as pollution\/global warming).",
    "I developed a completely different way of thinking. I now have a working knowledge of microeconomics that I can use to understand different policies and broad concepts. I also have practiced using math in a very application-based way which is something I've always struggled with.",
    "I had never taken economics before, and this was a good introduction to microeconomics. This course helped me decide whether I wanted to consider being an economics major.",
    "I learned about how to really think about situations. It was a breath of fresh air from typical memorization math; you really had to think about each situation and apply anything you learned to help graph it\/work it out.",
    "Basic microeconomics. I also learned how to take a large lecture course.",
    "General economics understanding, not too complex. Ideas of making optimal choices through marginal analysis.",
    "I learned a lot about the basic functions of economics and how to apply a lot of these principals. I learned how to think about various situations from an economic standpoint. A lot of different topics are covered in this intro course.",
    "Basic Econ knowledge. Emphasis on basic, but that's the point of the course. I had no previous knowledge and it gave me a good basis.",
    "My economics background was previously more conceptual and theoretical than based in positive analysis, and this course helped me understand how to apply graphs to economic concepts such as utility, efficiency, and equity.",
    "I learned the basics of microeconomics! I had never taken an economics course before, so I found this course to be pretty interesting. We learned how to use graphs and basic math to solve simple economics problems.",
    "This class improved my critical thinking and synthesis skills, since the material we learn in lecture is not exactly what we are graded on in problem sets and tests",
    "Basic knowledge of supply and demand, cost-minimizing and profit-maximizing production, risk, insurance, etc.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of how markets work. I specifically liked the latter half of the course, in which we learned about Game Theory and more concrete and realistic economic models.",
    "It taught me about using ideal models (perfect competition, etc.) in order to understand imperfect reality (oligopolies, etc.).",
    "I gained a pretty solid understanding or introductory microeconomics.",
    "This course was about what I expected. I gained a general understanding of Microeconomics.",
    "Basic economic skills",
    "I learned a great deal about microeconomics, as it was my first class in this subject.",
    "I developed a core knowledge of introductory microeconomics. I learned a lot of the theory, and learned how it could apply in real life, yet I am still not sure how I could use most of the skills I learned to figure out real life situations. However, it is probably unrealistic to expect to know how to solve real life economic situations after taking an introductory course.",
    "I learned how to think in a new way and understand broader ideas.",

    "Received an introduction to the various concepts involved in Microeconomics",
    "I understood how to think of economics in more mathematical, abstract terms compared to just the diagrams I learnt in high-school.

    "I got a basic understanding of Microeconomics.",
    "I learned the material that the course consisted of and how to academically handle a large lecture course.",
    "I understood basic economics concepts.  I am able to look at real-world economics debates and understand the different positions that people have.  I can make informed decisions and judgments in today's economic climate.",
    "Basic intro to micro skills. It was hard for me to develop strong skills since I did not get a lot out of the lectures.",
    "I learnt a lot after taking this course, although it wasn't what I expected to learn. There's a lot of focus on utility and efficiency, and the course moves pretty fast.",
    "I learned about what makes the free market work and under what situations it does not always work.  I also learned, by the end of the course, how to think about economics problems.  My initial intuition was not sufficient to understand and work through the material, so I had to learn a new way of thinking and studying.",
    "Economic thinking, different basic models of markets, individual and firm choices.",
    "Having never taken an economics class before, this course introduced completely new material to me. I learned the basics of supply and demand, budget constraints, utility, monopoly, and the interactions of different firms within the market. I also got to refresh my algebraic and, in a very shallow way, my calculus skills.",
    "I went into this course with zero calculus or economic background. Though the course was difficult at times, I feel confident in saying that I now have a clear, solid knowledge of how microeconomics works...I didn't have that before! I personally did not enjoy the class, but I enjoy reflecting on everything I know now that I didn't know before. Hopefully that makes sense! \r\nI didn't realize that economics was so intricate and that there were so many moving parts. After 13 weeks of econ115 with Professor Berry, I have a newfound appreciation for economics as a field of study and work.",
    "I had taken no economics courses before this one and I felt it helped me develop an understanding of introductory microeconomics beyond what (as far as I can tell) many of my friends in other schools had the opportunity to. I felt I gained both conceptual and mathematical skills in this course.",
    "After taking Econ 115, I know look at the world kind of differently. I think about efficiency and equity a lot more, and think about positive analysis in almost every decision I make. I think the course was challenging in a good way, in that it pushed me to think really hard, but also to, at the end of the day, THINK INTUITIVELY.",
    "I had already taken Economics in high school, but I am much better at marginal analysis now that I have taken this course. I also have more insight as to why graphs and such look the way they look, rather than regurgitating memorized information I didn't fully understand.",
    "This course gives you a basic knowledge of algebra-based microeconomics and functions as a solid intro to the field of economics in general.",
    "I learned the basic vocabulary and models used to analyze economic concepts, and made some connections to real world problems and events.",
    "It was my first economics class ever, and I think it gave me great exposure to the subject.",
    "I gained an understanding of economics on the micro scale (individuals). I learned the technique of marginal analysis and its applications to different market structures.",
    "I learned about beginners econ.",
    "My knowledge in introductory information of microeconomics was improved. I had no prior knowledge and I thought this course adequately provided a good transition into the material. I also was able to experience a class presented in a large lecture. I developed skills to learn in such environment and taking separate sections to further improve my knowledge in microeconomics.",
    "This was my first ever Econ class. Because of this class I am going to pursue an economics degree.",
    "I learned many people have a superficial understanding of economics.  If you are going to take this course, take it to the end.",
    "Being someone that has never taking any economic's courses, I learned a lot about the basics of micro economics such as topics ranging from supply and demand to risk aversion.",
    "I developed a better understanding of free markets, distortions to free markets, taxation, decision making, monopolies, and other basic econ concepts. The course incorporated graphs and limited math for most of these concepts which added a bit of rigor to the concepts.",
    "This class taught me how to calculate optimal quantities, like prices, outputs, etc. from given information like supply curves, demand curves, budget constraints, etc. I really liked this course as I felt that it allowed me to graph and quantify interactions that I would normally think of as social or difficult to compute. I like that we had to use a bit of psychology to justify some of the assumptions we made. I feel like this course really opened my eyes as to what economics (at least microeconomics) is all about.",
    "Econ...and how to deal with a large lecture.",
    "Having no previous knowledge of economics, this course got me very interested. I learned basic market structures, as well as some of the market's most basic strengths and weaknesses and potentially how to mitigate or overcome them. It provided me with a basic structure on which I can now start to branch out and learn more about the world.",
    "This is a very solid introduction to economics. I learned techniques for evaluating economic problems and theories which will hopefully help me in future studies in economics. I have also learned how basic concepts like supply and demand can be extrapolated upon and made more complex as more \"real-world\" factors are introduced.",
    "Basic economics, insights into crowd behavior, how to do marginal analysis and extend it beyond economics",
    "I learned about supply and demand.",
    "I learned how real world business concepts can be explained by economics. I learned how to represent the business world with a series of supply and demand graphs.",

    "This class helped me develop my note-taking skill in a large lecture class.",
    "I gained a valuable introduction to microeconomic theory, models, and arithmetic.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about Econ. I feel like I can converse more eloquently on these issues",

    "I began to think about decision making in a different light and it gave me ideas to apply to business as well even if actual computing of decisions relies on data one doesnt necessarily have.",
    "I learned the basics of microeconomics and how markets work. Additionally, I learned about marginal analysis and how that's used in economic analysis.",
    "I got a general understanding of microeconomics.",
    "Learned the basics of economics",
    "You'll learn lots of basic economic theories that will only occur under certain assumptions that could never actually happen in real life.",
    "Learned how to do basic microeconomic theory, starting with perfect competition and ending with oligopoly. The amount of math required is minimal, which can be both helpful and hurtful. Most of the math is made easier because its only algebra, but some of the math assumptions made are described as just so and not really given much explanation, which can be confusing.",
    "I realized just how much thought processes behind microeconomics are integrated into basic and everyday decision-making of both the average producer and consumer.",
    "I learned basic microeconomics such as how supply and demand work in conjunction with each other. I also learned how both the consumer and producer sides can affect how supply and demand work.",

    "I learned how to think about the economy and how to analyze markets and external effects on markets.",
    "I learned introductory economic thinking around supply and demand",
    "I learned the basics to economics, creating a good foundation for understanding economic theory. Although I don't plan on continuing with economics, I think learning some of the themes within economics helped me understand how different economic processes, and thus our world, work. I also learned that economics wasn't for me, which may sound bad, but is good, as it has helped me narrow down what fields I'm interested in.",

    "I took AP Macro\/Micro in high school and got 5s. Still, I learned a good amount in this class. I think my high school class was a better though. It had more breadth and even depth in certain aspects, but it also met everyday and was 30 people as apposed to 500. However, it was nice learning new things in this class.",

I learned about maximizing benefit by equating marginal benefit and marginal cost. I learned to rethink the world and my actions in terms of marginal benefit and marginal cost. I learned how taxes distort the market, which can either create deadweight loss or correct negative externalities. I learned about the social optimum and how we can take measures either through the government or through society to attain that optimum.",

   "comments": [
    "The strength is that you learn a lot of information. It's biggest weakness is that, at least for me, it was pretty boring most of the time.",
    "The course moves at a very fast pace to where the concepts aren't covered well enough in depth. Also the TA's are not always the best at explaining these concepts. There needs to be more care to make sure that concepts are actually being understood rather than just covered.",
    "The strength was that the class was well organized and offered a structured learning schedule that was logical.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course was that at times, it just seemed a bit dull because each lesson was the same; however, I admit this is not an issue of the course, but rather an issue with the nature of introductory material in general.",
    "The lecture was too large, and not very helpful. I had to do a lot of self-teaching for this course.",
    "Strengths: The problem sets and section problems in this course help most with understanding and practical application of economic concepts. Being able to apply the lecture to actual problems is how I learned most in this course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Each lecture has to cover a lot of information, meaning that even if you understand how to do each type of problem or draw particular graphs, you come out with very little understanding of why microeconomic concepts work the way they do. I don't feel like I gained much of an understanding of economics at all. There's also a lot of disparity between TAs, which meant that I just stopped going to section entirely because it didn't help at all.",
    "The strengths were that Professor Berry is very engaging and clearly knows a lot about the material in a way that was very helpful from a learning perspective. The main weakness was that new material was often covered very quickly at the end and then reviewed for a much longer the next class, a system that just doesn't work as well for my learning process.",
    "The strength is the organization of canvas in having the previous years' material posted. I felt like this extremely helped in studying for midterms and finals. In addition, the review sessions before the exams were extremely helpful. The weakness is that it would be great if the professor was a bit more engaging during lecture.",
    "The size of the class can be a weakness to some, but I think the practicality is its main weakness. Lecture often isn't useful, and the bulk of what a student will encounter on exams is taught during section.",
    "A strength of this course is the ability of the professor to teach such a high amount of information to students in a single semester. However, this can lead to problems. The class is 75 minutes, and it can be very difficult to stay alert during this long period of time while the lecture moves so quickly. Also, taking notes is no easy task. The slides from each lecture are posted after class, so it is necessary to focus on scribbling down a huge sum of information during time that should be used for listening intently. Note-taking made it difficult for me to absorb all of the information that was presented in this high-speed lecture.",
    "The class does not always feels as if it is an introductory class, more time could be spent per topic.",
    "Strengths: Professor Berry was super enthusiastic about the course material, and there's a lot of other first-years taking the class, so you're probably going to have a lot of opportunities for help\/study groups. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Berry gets too excited sometimes and can be hard to understand, especially if you're not sitting close to the front. The p-sets were sometimes not worded well, which made completing them more difficult. Lectures are easy to fall asleep in (but the information can be really cool!). Section wasn't that helpful to most people.",
    "Strength: weekly psets, posting of old material\r\nWeakness: big lecture",
    "Strengths: clear weekly routine -- very few surprises, standard format for exams and psets, clear correlation between lecture material and assessments\r\nWeaknesses: second midterm much more difficult than first, no partial credit on psets, lectures often dull",
    "I think the class offers a solid overview of the basics of Micro, but it is not SUPER engaging. The material is not the most fascinating. I think it is also challenging being in such a large lecture. It can be difficult to remain focused and really absorb the material. I know there is the seminar option, but the curve in the smaller class is daunting. Maybe there is a Goldilocks zone in the middle?",
    "Please, please, PLEASE do not let the course continue to be run as the largest lecture in Yale College. I have a feeling I would have enjoyed it much more if I had had the foresight to take it as a seminar.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, a thorough, if dull, introduction to microeconomics. The class is exactly what it said it is; nothing more, nothing less. Professor Berry is a good lecturer if you can hear what he's saying. He banned laptops on the first class; phones should be banned too. \r\n\r\nA good TF is critical. Be careful in selecting yours; Eoin was fantastic.\r\n\r\nPay attention in class (and go to class) and you won't have to read the textbook or stress about pretty much anything.",
    "being such a large lecture, it can occasionally get kind of dry, but Berry tries to throw in a lot of real world applications to make it interesting. Going to section ends up being pretty important, as Berry doesn't really go into much math in the lectures and the exams are mostly math. The problem sets are generally pretty short (an hour or so), but often take ages to grade with pretty vague grading. The exams also differ greatly in difficulty, but the curve is pretty strong and makes it a bit less stressful",
    "the weaknesses are that the course is not taught in an interesting way and the material taught in class is very different from the questions asked on the problem sets so they are very hard to complete.",
    "the class was at a bad time since it was directly after lunch. Also, the class size requires a lot of motivation.",
    "I had trouble learning from some of the TA's and TF's. I felt like there was a language barrier with some of them that made it more difficult to learn.",
    "The strengths of this course are that a lot of information is presented during the lectures and the sections generally help you out for the problem sets. The weaknesses are that not all the material is covered well during the lectures and readings are not emphasized. This could be improved if the graphs and information during the lecture were taught\/draw better.",
    "TAs weren't always as helpful as they could've been in section.",
    "I think this class does a really good job of teaching to the overwhelming number of student who take this lecture. This class also provides the problem sets, midterms, and finals (and all the respective solutions) from past years of the class; these are EXTREMELY beneficial to succeeding and practicing.\r\n\r\nThere are a few weaknesses. One thing that was difficult was a random problem set schedule hiccup; problem sets are normally due on Monday, but at one point, there had been a problem set due on Monday, another due the following Wednesday, and another one the following Monday. Normally, section materials cover\/prepare for the problem set at the end of the week so that you can do the problem set that weekend with advanced knowledge\/practice. That extra Wednesday problem set was rough, and needed better preparation. A second weakness is discrepancy between TFs. For the final, some TFs emailed a final study guide to their section students, while others missed out completely or had to ask around to find it. Between sections and review sessions, there are some discrepancies or differences between what TFs say, making it hard for students to get exact help.",
    "The strengths were that the professor was really great and made the lectures interesting even when the actual information could be dry. My teaching fellow\/assistant was the same way. One thing that I had trouble with was just how big the class was because sometimes it was really hard to get individual help because there were so many students asking questions and not that many on duty.",
    "The delay in work returned was hard because it meant I never really got feedback on work, since psets were returned several weeks later or not at all.",
    "sections are very inconsistent, learn different things\r\nlectures are effective, psets are fair, office hours are crowded",
    "This was my first time taking a large lecture class, and it was definitely hard to concentrate or to ask questions.",
    "The discussion sections are very helpful for clarifying the material learned in class. The only thing was that I found for a lecture discussion with nearly 500 people, an hour and 15 minutes was a long time to focus, especially when students were leaving and showing up late.",
    "Steven berry was an amazing lecturer. He made the course material extremely accessible.",
    "problem sets and tests were completely different than what we learned in lecture. the format of the class made it difficult to learn material that is in itself already very difficult to understand.",
    "Lectures need to be more engaging. Often felt like copy down the slide, wait for next slide or catch up to current.",
    "I thought the material was taught much too quickly. There is a really big learning curve in this class, and it is detrimental to students like myself. It is very clear that a lot of students already know a lot of this information, and I don't think that those students should be able to take this intro course. They greatly affect the grading\/curve of the course in a way that often feels unfair to students who are new to this material. I often felt as though I was in a class well beyond introductory level. Despite learning a lot of new and useful material, I frequently struggled to keep up with the pace of the course. The grading of the course was subjective- particularly for problem sets. There was never any explanation for why you received a particular grade - no commentary from TA's. The expectations for assignments were unclear and the grading of psets seemed to have no structure. There was no way to ever improve performance.",
    "Lectures were a bit repetitive, but it's an intro class so that's expected.\r\n\r\nI liked section",
    "Professor Berry was engaging considering the size of the lecture, but there was only so much that could be done.",
    "Very passive learning. Lectures are simply taking notes and section is pretty awkward and quiet. Most learning is done on your own or in study groups with friends. The good thing is that so many people are in this class, that it is very easy to work with others on psets and studying.",
    "The main weakness of this course is its size. The fact that there were so many students make it difficult for the professor to attend to the needs of the individual students, so it was hard to learn during lectures. Also, since the class was so big, it was hard for the TAs to grade papers in time, so we didn't always have our problem sets back in time to study from. \r\n\r\nHowever, the material of this class is very interesting since it applies to our everyday lives, and it was interesting to draw comparisons between our lives and what happens around us. This class also extends far beyond the AP curriculum, which made it very engaging. Another strength of this course was all the staff available to help, especially the TAs and peer tutors, who had office hours every day. \r\n\r\nThis class was also organized very well. I particularly enjoyed how there were 5 semesters worth of old problem sets and old exams for us to study from, which was very helpful in providing good examples and comprehensive answers.",
    "I think a big strength was Eoin, the head TF. Having him for my section made the Psets a lot easier. I think the usage of PowerPoint is very appropriate for the large lecture. I loved having old midterms and finals to study from, and it was for the most time very consistent with what we were tested on. It was difficult at times to clearly listen to what Prof. Berry was saying, I wish there were captions or some way to listen to the lecture afterwards.",
    "The class needs desperately to be restructured. It's difficult to study\/stay motivated when the problem sets are returned 5 weeks after being submitted (at the least). The graders also take weeks to review problems you mention with their own grading, even when it's incredibly simple.",
    "The sections were great and engaging, the lecture a little less so.",
    "Professor Berry is an excellent lecturer and explains the concepts. However, the psets\/exams are not conceptual. The course relies on TF's in order to teach how to solve the actual problems. This can be good or bad depending on which TF you get.",
    "Professor is really good\r\nBut the class is too big for engagement so actual learning suffers",
    "Strengths were connections to real world issues and how involved the class is with lectures, tutoring, sections, and review. Very helpful when necessary.\r\nCould be improved by taking some time out of review at the start of each class to rather expanding lessons being taught that day to more current policy.",
    "I honestly think that the only way this course could. be improved is it were smaller, but I understand why this isn't very possible given the amount of people who want to take it.",
    "Strengths: Teacher was enthusiastic; availability of problem sets and exams from past years helped a lot in preparation for current problem sets and exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Many of the TAs\/class tutors were not knowledgable about the introductory-level subject material. The problem sets often went far beyond what was taught in class, and thus often required group efforts to solve. The feedback on incorrect answers on exams was also often unclear.",
    "I thought there was very little support for students unless they actively went to look for it. It was very hard to focus and engage in the 500+ people classes and then during section the TA was often unprepared. I would not have been able to complete the problem sets without the peer tutors and many people didn't even know they existed. When I came time to study for an exam I found it very difficult to find people to answer my questions. There were no office hours the weekend before our final.",
    "lectures could be boring, and with them being 500 people, it was easy to not attend",
    "Strengths: the lectures are interesting and well-tought, the teaching fellows are knowledgeable, there are a lot of resources to help with studying.\r\nWeaknesses: sections a little slow, often study halls crowded, didn't get problem sets back in a timely fashion. Also lecture slides as presented weren't always posted very soon.",
    "I thought it was strong",
    "Strengths - Good introduction to material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Very disorganized with returning problem sets and midterms. First midterm took almost 3 weeks to grade. Another course with similar amount of students and TAs had it graded within 5 days. PSETs took over a month to grade, whereas in another course they were returned within a week. Difficult to study for a final exam when you do not even know how you did on the problem sets relative to the content.....",
    "This course delivers what it needs to deliver-an introduction to microeconomics that takes a more quantitative approach compared to high school econ, but still provides a broad base understanding of the topic.\r\n\r\nBut, the large size of the course once again works to the detriment. The acoustics of the Law School Building aren't that great. It's sometimes difficult to listen to what Professor Berry is saying, especially when he gets to the newer, more mathematical topics, and it's easy to get lost.",
    "This course definitely taught me a lot with clear teaching, and the material was not terribly difficult. The problem sets and test questions, on the other hand, were often unnecessarily confusing in their wording. Half of the time on any given exam or pset was spent trying to figure out what the question was asking rather than applying any actual principles",
    "Strengths: This course covered a huge amount of material in a short amount of time. It was accessible for people who did not have any background with economics in the sense that there was no calculus involved or prior knowledge assumed.\r\nWeaknesses: This class was extremely theoretical. The pace was too fast and the problem sets and exams were not well designed for learning. The only time we actually learned how to solve problems was in section, and lecture covered so much, so quickly that it was overwhelming and not very helpful. Very dry and not at all engaging.\r\nThis class would really be improved if it were divided into two intro micro classes: one for people who intended to major in Econ, which would basically just be Econ 115, and one for people who hoped to gain a practical understanding of the concepts of microeconomics and economic decision-making without having to do all the graphs, equations, etc.",
    "Strengths: it's a basic course and the psets are helpful in learning the material\r\nWeaknesses: Pset questions sometimes don't follow the lecture so they are hard to figure out. Class is pretty boring sometimes",
    "This course is simply too large to facilitate student learning. Often times, the class tutors seemed overwhelmed with the number of students who were completely lost. Take it in the seminar format if you want to have a solid understanding of the material. Section was helpful for understanding certain concepts, but it was often hard to gain a solid grasp of concepts after listening to two mediocre lectures each week and going to a 50 minute section.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the TAs were often responsible for filling gaps in students' understanding, this class would have been a much more fulfilling experience if they knew how to teach the material better. Some TAs seemed genuinely surprised at the questions they got from students who were trying their best to understand completely new material; there seemed to be a lack of empathy among them.\r\n\r\nIn the future: offer more class tutor hours. The TAs were not very helpful with the problem sets. They could only give very vague hints about the material, which was unhelpful if the problem seemed very far removed from the material we had learned that week. The class tutors (other YC students) were much more helpful, but their office hours were often very crowded.",
    "Lectures were good, I appreciated the amount of material online to use to study.",
    "This course does require math. I was not expecting so many of the questions to be so reliant on maths and numbers, rather than just economic concepts. This is definitely not the easiest QR credit. Many people who find this course easy have already taken a high level of calculus.",
    "This class is slightly disorganized. This is partially due to the size of the course, but this should be anticipated prior. The problem sets frequently had typos in them and had to be re-written. The problem sets were also extremely vague and unclear, causing them to be interpreted in multiple ways which proved problematic when they were graded. The problem sets were so unclear that multiple peer tutors had trouble coming to a consensus and answering them. When we received graded problem sets, they would simply put a cross through an incorrect problem without explaining what part of the problem was incorrect. The graders were sometimes quite picky with the problem sets and when I asked if I could find out what I did wrong, it proved to be very difficult as we had to track down the TA who graded it, often weeks after I had already completed the problem set. The problem sets should have been graded more promptly, especially before exams.\r\nDue to the size of the class, there were many TA sections, which differed greatly. People's experience in this class was highly dependent on the TA they had.\r\nBecause this is a recurring class, the old materials and practice exams proved to be extremely helpful, (except for the second midterm, which differed vastly from all the practice problems). I appreciated the many resources that this class came with (many TAs and peer tutors as well as the textbook). The TAs should have had more office hours on weekends since the problem sets were due on Mondays.",
    "The TFs ability to really form a bond with the student was kind of weak.",
    "Section was a strength insofar as it gave a space to ask questions. Psets being due on Monday was a good idea as it allowed the weekend to learn the material. On the other hand, it was easy to lose focus in lecture.",
    "The problem sets were often much harder than what was shown or explained in class, beyond reason.  The lectures move very fast and the slides are often not posted until later.",
    "I really liked how there were so many opportunities for me to get my questions answered. It was really easy to understand the course material through the psets, which was really important to me.",
    "I believe during lecture not enough time was given to certain areas while subjects which we were barely tested on were talked about for a while.",
    "Since a lot of people take the course, there are always people around to help, and the TAs do a really good job of offering a lot of review sessions and office hours, so there's always help available. Professor Berry is an engaging lecturer, but since the lecture is so large, it's easy to get distracted on your phone.",
    "I feel one of the most difficult parts of this course was engaging with the material.  As I mentioned in the previous response, I did not feel it was very intuitive, and so that made it difficult to engage until I realized how to think about the problems.  One thing that would have helped me understand and engage with the material was more real life examples.  Concrete examples helped me learn the concepts, but I didn't realize this until later on in the course.",
    "The psets could be submitted via Canvas.",
    "The strengths of this course were that the pace was decent, especially for someone who has never learned about economics before, and I also liked the resources available online for practice and review.\r\n\r\nThe size was at the same time a strength and a weakness. It was helpful because in a class of over four hundred people, it was never hard to find someone who could help you on a problem set. However, you couldn't ask questions in a large lecture hall. My section also had a lot of students and there was always so much material to get through that there wasn't much time for questions either. Even going to the CTL didn't guarantee much help from a TF because there were so many students.",
    "The course taught a lot in very little time and showed us many applications of the things we learned in order to help us understand. There isn't much weakness. Many of us were completely blindsided by the second midterm, and while the reason it was much harder made perfect sense, it felt as if we would have had a better learning experience had we known this and been able to study and prepare properly for the exam. Other than that, no problems.",
    "For a large lecture course, the course was still fairly engaging and I felt I learned a lot. The discussion sections for the course vary a lot depending on the TF, and some are not helpful while some really help you gain understanding.",
    "Give peer tutors more guidance on the problem sets. Because no problems in class are as hard as the problem set ones, I often needed the peer tutors' help. But sometimes the help they gave me was ineffective because they didn't know how to help. They need more guidance so they can be more effective.",
    "I wish we could have learned more of the conceptual stuff through reading and then spent more class time going through examples, because I always found problem sets significantly harder than the basic conceptual things we had learned in lecture.",
    "The class size was enormous, but I suppose that's unavoidable in an Intro Econ lecture. \r\n\r\nCOMPLETE NOTES\r\nIn Introductory Stats the professor would record lectures and post the complete lecture notes before class. I think it would be extremely helpful if we did the same in Econ. Many people still regularly attended the lectures in person. And having the complete lecture notes actually helped me pay attention to what the professor is saying. If I focus on writing extensive notes, I actually find that I have trouble paying attention to what's being spoken, since I mostly just focus on writing. \r\n\r\nTA AVAILABILITY\r\nMany TAs had office hours very early in the week when we just received the problem sets and when most people did not even have section yet. Only two Peer Tutors were available during the weekends. Realistically, most people finish the psets 1-2 days before they are due, so it would have been more helpful if there were at least one TA present during the weekend. If TA's aren't available on weekends. It would be helpful if we could have psets due on Wednesdays instead of Mondays.",
    "This course is a large lecture with over 400 students this year, and that can make it more difficult to learn than in a smaller seminar structure. However, Professor Berry is an excellent lecturer, and if you follow his lectures closely during class, you should get the same information as if you were in a smaller setting. Problem sets are assigned roughly once a week for the course and are usually more challenging than the material on the exams, which is good because it prepares students better for the exams. However, they can be poorly written or hard to follow at times.",
    "The lecture and section format of the course works well because the lecture covers the more abstract parts of economics whereas the section covers the actual problem-solving. However, the 75-minute lecture felt very long at times; perhaps three 50-minute lectures per week would be better.",
    "The strengths of this course was the sections and problem sets. Eoin McGuirk was a great section instructor. It was helpful to get into a small group each week and review the details of the lessons that week. The problem sets allowed me to apply the knowledge I had learned in class and in section and acted as a large contributor to my learning and progress in this class. The old material provided online was extremely useful in reviewing for exams.\r\n\r\nI have no weaknesses to report.",
    "Hated the lecture structure.",
    "Some of the strengths I noticed were that this class provided an encompassing introductory material and the professor was able to teach adequately in such largely sized class. However, it was difficult to rather focus in such class setting, in which it was not possible to ask the professor direct questions. This was only possible through the sections, in which the TA's were not adequate enough to basically re-teach the material taught in the class in a short period of time.",
    "Strengths: great head TA, Eoin, who really kept things organize and timely\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: too many students, too much material that was never quite explained, and not enough good TA's to facilitate learning.",
    "I was not aware of the amount of math used in this course. I would need to make sure to incoming students that they take math 112.",
    "Being that it is a lecture class, it is very hard to learn a lot during class because you are too buys taking notes. However, the class sections proved to be very helpful. The only downside to the class is that not all of the TA's are knowledgable so it  is simply luck of the draw when it comes to getting a good vs. bad TA.",
    "Strengths: great professor, interesting topics, helpful TFs, clear and straightforward lecture format\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lecture can become monotonous, very large class so difficult to get to know professor",
    "The strengths of this course is its lecturer, Prof. Berry. He was very engaging, funny, and intelligent. The way he taught the course, via slides on an ipad he could draw on, was great and the fact that he made us take notes really helped I think. I didn't have any weakness with the course: the peer tutors were knowledgable and helpful, the TFs were great at explaining things to us in section, and there were tons of office hours so we could get help when we needed. The readings complemented the lectures and helped me learn what I needed to learn. Great course.",
    "Better TFs who teach the material better. And use better handwriting and provide more feedback when returning midterms.",
    "I, for one, like the lecture based learning. I found that I absorbed lots of information, and there were plenty of practice resources to help back up that learning. \r\nThe lecture notes are not always posted in time for the relevant problem sets, so having those up sooner would be better. Also, I did not receive all of my problem sets back, so I was not able to study from them for the final.",
    "Professor Berry and the TF's provided us with ample resources to be successful in this course. Weekly section, pre-exam review sessions, and office hours with TF's were all extremely helpful for grasping the material. The material itself is presented in a well-organized, clear manner. Professor Berry does an excellent job of boiling down highly complex topics to make them easier to understand. In terms of improvement, lectures and most sections focused on the theory behind the operations we were asked to do on the PSETs and exams. However, it was often difficult to extrapolate how to do these problems given the way a concept was explained in class. I would prefer if there was time in lecture or section to discuss applications of a theory, before we are asked to apply it on a graded assignment.",
    "I thought that this class was very well taught and structured, and I learned alot during it. It could have been improved by sections that not only did practice problems, but also went over more content.",
    "Weakness in that it was hard to stay awake in class.",
    "I wish the course had followed the textbook more closely.  The book was very well written, and I think it would have been beneficial to have a more organized teaching plan. \r\n\r\nI felt like we didn't get to everything in class.  There were items on the problem sets that we never got to in class.  In section, my TA would set at the front of the room, tell us to do the problems, and give us the answers at the end.  I had to learn much of the material on my own, which was highly ineffective.  \r\n\r\nI wish we had gotten through the material in class so that I could understand it when I went to practice on the problem sets.  I am unsure of how to fix this, but I think we should teach TA's to teach effectively if we are going to offer sections for the course. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we did not get feedback on our work until after the midterms, which did not help me learn from my mistakes.  I wish we could have gotten faster feedback on our work.",
    "Strengths are that it's well organized and the material is fairly simple. The pace felt fair, and there are lots of helpful resources if you don't understand the material.  The weakness was that the course didn't use any calculus. This led to long, roundabout explanations that could have been solved by an easy derivative or integral.",
    "Although the topics we covered were interesting, I found it easy to disengage in such a large lecture. It would have been more engaging if we had done practice problems during class just something I could follow along to.",
    "I was often in office hours. I liked how often hours were held. It made it easy to seek help in the class. I have no complaints or suggestions.",
    "Honestly, this class is way too big.",
    "Lectures were organized and the professor is good at presenting the information.",
    "The class is the right balance of specificity and generality. The large lecture style could be seen as a weakness to student engagement, but the section meetings make up for that.",
    "The lectures are engaging and the problem sets are helpful. Midterms are too difficult.",
    "Weaknesses: very large class\r\nStrengths: Professor is really engaging and knows how to explain concepts well.",
    "The course gives a good explanation of basic concepts, but is far too large for anyone to gain a whole lot of material out of it.",
    "Such a large lecture\r\n\r\nSections good",
    "Extremely large lecture class, so it's easy to be distracted, and its tougher to ask questions if you're confused because its a large class that goes quickly",
    "There really wasn't much engagement, but that makes sense for such a massive lecture.  There's always the seminar version of the course if you'd like a more interactive experience.",
    "I can honestly say my TA sessions were a waste of time. Office hours were ample and amazing though, so it was fine! Strengths would include the responsiveness of eoin , also.",
    "Class material learned in lectures wasnt applicable on problem sets.",
    "We had many resources to help us in this class, but sections were not usually very engaging.",
    "Lectures were well-organized, although it was hard to focus on the lecture for a full hours and fifteen minutes. It would be nice if the lecture switched styles to keep students focused (For ex. showing videos, doing ex. problems, etc). Problem sets were fair and so were exams. Section was not that helpful and hard to focus.",
    "Lecture sometimes hard to follow, not much professor student interaction (but thats just because its such a big lecture), Professor was funny and clearly passionate about teaching",
    "Structure of lecture could be improved by not covering new material before each midterm.",
    "could be improved by more instruction in section, more consistency among TAs",
    "Weaknesses - Psets were hard to answer if you only attended lecture; my TA wasn't that helpful in section; lectures could be hard to follow",
    "The main thing is it is way too large of a clas.",
    "It was hard and the way concepts were explained in lecture was a little confusing. Eoin McGuirk, my TF, was excellent at explaining concepts. The only concepts that I actually learned were concepts that he explained to us in section.",
    "The course offers good information;however, the lecture is extremely large.",
    "If office hours and review sessions were better.",
    "would have preferred more conceptual stuff. I could often do the math but often didn't really understand why I was doing the math that I was doing.",
    "I felt that in lecture I was focusing more on being able to keep up with the notes which made it more difficult to learn while in lecture. Probably could be fixed if more concise notes with more explanation through talking",
    "The biggest strength of the course was I felt like the course material was very well structured, in that we first learned how markets worked and then saw how they failed. Additionally, I liked how the concepts we learned were used throughout the course. I also really liked how all the old material from previous years was posted on Canvas for us to study from. I think the main way the course could be improved is that I feel like the discussion sections for the course could be smaller. I'm not sure what exactly the size was capped at, but our discussion section often had at least twenty kids in it. Although in and of itself that wasn't a big deal, combined with the large lecture size, it made it harder to ask questions and feel really engaged in the course.",
    "Its a lot of material and it was all covered but some of it not in detail.",
    "Its wrong to not offer partial credit on the homework when each question has like 5-10 parts... makes people think they may as well not do the question if they dont understand one part",
    "It was sometimes hard to understand what Steven Berry was saying because it was a huge lecture and the mic wasn't always great, but even when you could hear him speak, it was still hard to follow. The key to really understanding the material, was copying the slides down and then studying them for comprehension outside of class.",
    "Course is taught in a twice-weekly large lecture, which is helpful because theres guaranteed to be at least 5 people in the same entryway taking the same class. The collaborative atmosphere encouraged on the psets is nice, but the TAs will sometimes overcompensate and make psets a little too difficult. Class has a no-laptops policy which helps curb distractions.",
    "I think this course needs more dedicated TA's with more women! With everyone it was really a hit or miss with your TA, and I know most are paid graduate students, but it is a complete waste of everyone's time if they cannot communicate ideas across. I think the head TA Eoin is really good, but he is one of the few that is great at understanding the concept and teaching the concept in a digestible way for someone with little or no microeconomics background. The other TA's should go to Eoin's sections or something before to see how to properly communicate a concept. That said, my main frustration was with the PSETs because it always seemed like the professor would teach the information after the PSET was due. Some type of reverse classroom situation the professor thinks is good for students to teach themselves or go to office hours, but when most of the TAs are imperious and unhelpful while Eoin only offers office hours for one of the days that I was never available, and sometimes you can't teach yourself something, it can truly make microeconomics a nightmare. That said, I appreciate that our midterms were in class rather than outside of it. For me, I wish I had taken the seminar instead of the lecture because of all of this.",
    "Professor berrys voice is sometimes hard to understand in the echo of the huge lecture room",
    "The course moved at a fast pace which was all right because of the TAs but I dont think that the material was always taught in the clearest manner. There were times were I felt lost and the professor just moved on with a subpar explanation.",
    "They provide plenty of resources to study and learn. Section was useful until a point where the TA just zoomed through the problems. Lecture was absolutely useless..",
    "This course does a good job of teaching the basic fundamentals of microeconomics through lectures and problem sets.",
    "Strengths are the focus on the lectures, but some TAs are great while others are not, so some students are at a disadvantage.",
    "TAs seemed to struggle with course material",
    "The lecture is huge - almost 400 people. The material is hard to follow, and some deem it as a \"drawing class\" because the notes are simply scribbles.",
    "I loved Professor Berry and I had a good TA.",
    "strengths: lectures are well paced and clear, lots of resources for help, not too hard of math\r\n\r\nweaknesses: section was very impersonal and fast paced\/hard to ask questions. no personal attn from professor, minimal questioning of some of the basic assumptions of the course (rational choice theory, self-interested decision makers, economics as pure field separate from but related to politics, etc)",
    "I learned to think critically and derive functions to express situations in economics.",
    "I learned more from sections than I did from lectures. I wish Professor Berry had talked slower during the lectures because sometimes it was hard to understand everything he was saying.",
    "Being a large lecture class, it's hard to get personal help with the professor. Section was usually hurried as it covered a lot of material, and I found that the discussions were more pragmatic than lectures, which were more theoretical.",
    "The lectures are strong, but more time could be taken to explain corrections to missed exam and Pset problems",
    "I think the size of this course can be daunting at first, but I think the sections helped quite a bit. I think the grading policies were really nice, where one TF would grade all the same pset. It made the course feel fair. However, I did feel there was an unfair advantage given to some students on the final. Some students received a \"study guide\" from a TF, which I found out about an hour before the final. This study guide outlined what was likely to show up on the test, helping students who received it narrow down what they should study. It felt unfair, as many students, including me, didn't get access to this study guide, meaning we were at a disadvantage when studying. This was a glaring weakness of this course and left me with a bad taste at the end of the course.",
    "I believe that the expectation for problem sets could be made a little more clear.",
    "The class is one of the largest lectures at Yale (roughly 450 students), which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your preferred style of learning",
    "It's a pretty decent class with a generous curve, but it's also a lecture of hundreds of students and it's rather difficult to stay engaged\/motivated for most.",
    "I felt one of the greatest weaknesses was that in class we never really addressed the true ramifications of what we studied. It was so graphical and algebraic that often the meaning was lost in translation. However, another weakness was that the problem sets asked us to go from 0 to 60 in no time; I think that having more incremental examples instead of just the easiest case presented in class would be very beneficial to fully grasping and engaging with the problem sets.",
    "Strengths:\r\nStraight-forward material that anyone could understand if they paid attention. \r\nNotes were online, if you just happened to miss a lecture or two. \r\nGood professor and discussion sections, if you go to them.\r\nLots of study material and past tests online, so exams are great.\r\nCurve is generous in a huge (500 person) lecture class like this.\r\ngut class tbh\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\nHuge class = less personal attention (somewhat addressed with discussion sections) = less engagement\r\ngut class tbh\r\ncurve isn't great if you're the one making it\r\nshould meet thrice a week so we can cover more material with more depth",
    "Strengths of the course were that there was always a lot of help available. Weakness is that it was so big that getting the problem sets or midterm blue backs back took a while.",
    "Strengths: great intro, interesting concepts\r\nWeakness: sometimes psets were difficult to understand given lecture",
    "The psets require that you keep up with weekly material, which is helpful. However, while the TFs are very accessible they are often unhelpful and unclear on the material. For this reason, section was not always productive.",
    "Help bridge the gap between class notes and problem sets and tests.",
    "The Tad should actually know what they are doing and there shouldnt be mistakes on answer keys.",
    "The course was well organised  the problem sets and section discussion fit in well with the flow of the course. The slides were not always particularly helpful to review (although this does motivate students to take better notes).",
    "More opportunity to get involved in class\/during lectures",
    "Weakness are that in lectures I found I was so busy trying to take down what prof Berry had on the slides that I was t really listening to him \/ wasnt listening with enough concentrated attention that I didnt really understand what it was I was writing down. And then section, which was supposed to clarify and solidify lectures, did a poor job.",
    "This course is well taught and the constellation of TFs and peer tutors are excellent resources. The review sessions for midterms and exams were immensely helpful and the problem sets were an excellent tool for learning. Additionally, Berry is an excellent lecturer. \r\n\r\nThe only drawback of this course is the large size of the class. This can be either a pro or con depending on how you look at it. On one hand, it is sometimes hard to focus in class and learn, but on the other, it's comforting to have so many peers. Overall, however, this is a well-taught class and I learned much during the term.",
    "Strengths: Section is helpful\r\nWeaknesses: More practice of questions is required.",
    "The class size of this course made the course challenging. I found that I generally learned more in the smaller discussion sections.\r\n\r\nThe course material as presented in the lectures was more conceptual, where the problem sets and evaluations were more math based. The sections helped bridge this gap, but this reality posed a challenge to many students, including myself.",
    "Strengths include its consistency and organization. Weaknesses include an unclear correlation of the course material to psets or exams. I think if more quantitative examples were included in lectures, students would be better equipped to approach the work when it comes their time to solve problems on their own.",
    "Professor Berrys homework was at times impossible. Even the tutors didnt know what to do.",
    "If you do the work from past psets and exams you're good.",
    "It is good material, but the large lecture was not very engaging",
    "Professor is very good, material is hard but fair",
    "Strengths: interesting\r\nWeaknesses: exams are awful and don't test anything",
    "Economics can be difficult to learn through lectures, so that is one and maybe more seminars should be offered.",
    "Some of the TAs did not help me at all and seemed to not want to be there.",
    "I think the lectures are informative and straightforward, which helps students gain a solid foundation of understanding that sections build upon later. However, I found my section to be somewhat unhelpful in furthering my knowledge, as if I paid attention in class and did the problem sets I had no problems doing any of the questions in section on my own. Also, the grades take a while to be released, especially a makeup midterm that I took, so I had little idea of my grade in the class for much of the semester.",
    "A strength of this course are the various resources that are provided to students to help them as they complete problem sets and study for exams, such as past problem set and exam solutions. However, while meeting in section often cleared up any confusion that I had about lecture materials, by talking to friends I realized that one's experience in section depends largely on his\/her TA. The course could be improved by speeding up the grading of problem sets, which often took a few weeks.",
    "better structure in section would be helpful",
    "A lot of times the problem sets and sections did not prepare us for assessments",
    "Professor Berry delivered engaging lectures and incorporated material that relates to the real world. I was never truly bored with the material and enjoyed my time in the course.",
    "I really liked it its just not good if you need more specialized attention",
    "The lectures were well-structured with conceptual ideas and I expected the TFs to go over application of those concepts learned in lecture to problems and scenarios. However, in section, we we're rarely shown the connection between the lecture slides and the problem sets. I think there needed to be more emphasis on how to apply those concepts.\r\n\r\nIn general, grading was extremely disorganized and my second problem set was lost by the TFs and never recovered. Comments on exams and graded problem sets offered no insight to what was done wrong or how to improve. The tutors were also extremely unhelpful and with so many students in the class there needed to be additional office hours and they should've been held in bigger spaces.",
    "The lectures were fairly engaging and very informative, but the TAs varied drastically in quality and frankly made going to section not worth it.",
    "I think a weakness of this course is that the sections weren't particularly engaging or helpful.",
    "A weakness is the anonymity that comes with a large lecture. There's not really anything to do abiut that though--a seminar alternative is offered.",
    "Strengths: the review portion at the beginning of each lecture, Mr. Eoin, Mr. Snashall (there could be other outstanding TAs, but I worked mostly with these two), Professor Berry's jokes, and the length of office hours.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Review sessions, peer tutors.\r\n\r\nImprovements: I've heard from a few of my classmates that some of the review sessions they attended were very useful, but the few that I went to were not at all. Maybe laying some basic ground rules for every TA about how they need to run a review session would help make the quality of the sessions more consistent.\r\n\r\nThe peer tutors were helpful when I could get them to talk to me, but sometimes there were so many students that turned out to be an issue. I don't think this is the case for every single peer tutor session; it seemed to be a problem at peak times like the night before a pset was due or a few days before an exam. It would be helpful to have more than one student available to help during these peak times.",
    "Strength - useful material\r\nWeakness - poorly taught",
    "Steve Berry is did the best job I think any professor could have done with the large number of students in his class. A weakness is the unequal helpfulness of the TAs, as some were great while others struggled.",
    "The course doesn't move too too fast, which is nice. Goes at a good pace.",
    "The lectures were, on the whole, very good at explaining the theoretical side of microeconomics, and while the topics were sometimes a bit dry, they were presented with a good deal of passion. I did, however, think that sometimes too much of lecture was spent reviewing old topics (usually the first 15-30 minutes of the class), which made the already long lecture seem even longer for some reason. I also felt like section could have focused more on conceptual understanding and less on simple calculations.",
    "no attendance was ever checked for section made it so I didn't go very often which ended up hurting me later in the semester.",
    "Although lectures were engaging, the time of day was not ideal for intense focus. Also, sections were rarely helpful. It seemed as if lectures were supposed to cover the concepts and sections were supposed to help up apply the concepts, but because the dynamic of section was often disjunct, I never left feeling more confident in my ability to apply my knowledge.",
    "Bad teaching that didn't coordinate with psets which didn't coordinate with exams.",
    "The course has the positives and negatives that come along with a big lecture course. I think the course could have been more up front about the difficulty that it has. There is a reputation of this being a gut course, and I assure you that it is not. If you have no economics background you will be in a bit over your head compared to those who come in with a strong economics background. The course has strengths in the instructor and weaknesses in the level of feedback and resources available for going more in depth with concepts you don't understand.",
    "The biggest strength was Professor Berry's sense of humor as well as his vast knowledge about economics, and the biggest weakness was the lack of clarity and the amount of rambling Professor Berry would oftentimes do.",
    "The course was very organized, and concepts were paired together in a very logical manner.  But, many of the mathematical concepts were not explained thoroughly in lectures, but not all TAs were well-prepared to adequately teach these concepts in section.",
    "Strengths is the breadth of material however the weakness is the difference between the easiness of lectures and hardness of problems sets and exams, there needs to be a smaller gap of difference.",
    "I felt like everything was presented way too quickly and didn't have enough time to engage with each concept.",
    "The strength of thr ciurse is the methodical and well paced curricukum the wekaness is the  lack of student engagement in lecture or sections. Perhaps making the sections more interactive could improve the course",
    "I found lectured hard to focus in. If I didnt understand something. I would have to wait until section",
    "The course is as well-run as it can be for a class of this size. One weakness is that some of the TAs are not as good as others. Additionally, the review sessions are focused on certain midterms which makes them less effective than they could be if they were just regular review sessions where students could come with any questions.",
    "The lecture was entertaining at times! Professor did a good job keeping things enjoyable in an enormous lecture.\r\n\r\nSection quality varied by section, so was a negative for some and a positive for others.\r\n\r\nThe grading system for homework was not very forgiving, as a single wrong part gave one a 4\/5.\r\nI felt the material covered was very basic, even less advanced than what I expected for an introductory course. I also think the use of only algebra is a handicap that has a higher marginal cost than benefit.",
    "I really enjoyed the material, and I think it was great even given how large it was. My only complaint is that they incorporate calculus into it, instead of just side stepping it. Or perhaps, they should offer a more calculus focused intro Econ class.",
    "I did not find my Teaching assistant very engaging, and my TA actually left the program half way through and we got a new TA, going through a total of 3-4 TAs which did not help in maintaining a cohesive consistent section for understanding, especially when the lecture is probably the largest size at yale.",
    "Strengths - ample opportunity to learn the material in sections and office hours\r\nWeaknesses - I dont get a lot of of lectures because I find myself trying to scribble down too much info nd not actually learning the material",
    "Pros:\r\n--Material was interesting and challenging.\r\n--Followed along with textbook.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n--There were not many resources outside of tutors\/TAs\/peers\r\n--Structure of class was not great, needed more examples and online resources.",
    "I think the lectures are engaging buf can feel a bit long at times. The course is very large so theres isnt a lot of individualized attention but there are resources you can seek out.",
    "I think that the course does a good job of introducing students to economics and allowing students to discover what their interests are. The course's greatest weakness, though, is that I do not think it is advertised properly. Introductory Micro is very math heavy course and I, having not had calculus, struggled a lot. While the course is doable without single variable calculus I think that should be an encouraged prerequisite.",
    "The class is enormous. The tests are not necessarily what you expect to be on them. They need to be more specific about the format of the test before you walk into it and get surprised.",
    "Taught incredibly quickly, sometimes not entirely clearly, but sections were good",
    "Strengths: office hours\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the material in the lecture compared to the section compared to the homework were different.  Lecture was all conceptual, while the section was all applications, while the homework was conceptual.\r\n\r\nHomework took a long time to get returned.",
    "Sections were less helpful than I would have liked.",
    "A weakness I had was trying to keep up in lectures, also note taking.",
    "Strengths: Professor Berry. He's a nice guy, is very experienced teaching the course, and really tries to do a good job. My only complaint there would be that he painstakingly explains simple math and rushes through the econ, rather than the other way around. There are also a lot of practice materials available that are very useful when studying for tests. The tests in general are fair and representative of what was taught, what was on the psets, and what was on the practice exams.\r\nWeaknesses: Grading is extremely sloppy, arbitrary, and unclear; the worst I've seen in 3 semesters at Yale. When I lost points, there was rarely any explanation given of why or even what part was wrong, and when there was an explanation, it was consistently unintelligible. Points were taken away for arbitrary reasons or because the grader just didn't bother reading through the whole solution, although this was somewhat balanced out by points not being taken away for things that were clearly wrong. The TA's who grade are clearly just trying to get it done as fast as possible and don't really care about doing a good job. I understand that there are a lot of students in the class, but there are a lot of TA's, too. On a similar point, sections weren't especially useful. (Side note: I thought Eoin, the course director, did a great job organizing the course. These comments are about the other TA's.)",
    "The large lecture setting does make it difficult for students to feel engaged. It makes it easier to rely on online notes and the textbook, which may result in less engagement and interest from some students.\r\n\r\nAs well, I think it can be difficult for some students to keep up in the course if they have not taken any econ courses before, particularly if they are in a class with many students who have, which felt the case with this class.\r\n\r\nA strength of the course is the extreme variety of resources that the students have. I felt lucky to have lecture, section, TA office hours, a textbook, and many, many online resources to cite when I had problems.",
    "The course does not really teach how to apply the concepts learned in class to a format that coincides with the exams",
    "The class was really easy.  Just add the calculus back in, everybody already knows how to do it and omitting it just makes things more confusing.",
    "The course was basically all self-learning for me. I mostly learned the material on my own. The lectures covered only the most basic content.",
    "Strengths: good lectures\r\nWeaknesses: TFs sometimes unprepared to answer student's questions, tests not correspond with PSET type problems",
    "The lectures are interesting.  I enjoyed Prof. Berry.",
    "The class was very large and I found myself losing focus in class.",
    "I believe there should be more sections because these were the most helpful. It was difficult to receive feedback on work because it was graded so late and often difficult to obtain.",
    "One has to be rather self motivated to succeed and actually learn in this class. If you put in the effort, youll learn, but its very easy to put in minimal effort and just let it wash over you.",
    "It is taught well but sometimes things are a little rushed and not elaborated on as much in lecture (especially obscure vocab like economic rent). It provides plenty of resources to practice with which was really helpful. I never figured out how to view the answers to the section questions on Canvas though.",
    "you learn very little- a lot of reliance on curve"

    "I would say take it but be ready to work. The material is harder than I expected going in.",
    "Obviously if econ is needed for your desired major than yes, and I strongly recommend taking it as soon as possible if you are a prospective econ major to really assess whether or not you enjoy it.",
    "I would recommend this to a student just because I feel like a basic understanding of economics is useful.",
    "No. Unless this is a prerequisite for your major, do not take it. You don't come out with any understanding of microeconomics, and if you do it's frankly not worth your time in this course.",
    "I would recommend the class because I think that it is important for everyone to have a good basic understanding of economics and this class certainly does that. I also think that the math isn't very challenging, which makes the course accessible to a wide variety of students.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Actively doing PSETS each week really helps with the understanding of economics as a whole.",
    "If you don't plan on being an econ major, I would not recommend this course. It is not a gut that you can take to fulfill your QR credit.",
    "Yes. Simply because a basic understanding of economics is a skill that all people should have. If possible, I'd probably recommend Macroeconomics over Microeconomics, but the class is still useful.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is willing willing to put in a lot of time out of class to learn economics.",
    "I think it is a good class for anyone to take, but students who have no interest in economics should stay away.",
    "Everyone should take intro Econ. It helps you understand the argument of people who you may disagree with, both ways",
    "Yeah! Though it's at times kinda hard to get through, some of the insights that you get from the class are absolutely amazing. It's a good intro to econ and even to just applying economic thinking in different areas of life.",
    "Yes, very helpful intro microeconomics class that will help in further classes.",
    "I would recommend it for people interested in economics. The workload is not particularly heavy, and exams line up well with psets, so they are not too difficult to study for. That being said, the material becomes considerably more difficult after the first midterm. Lecture is often quite dull but necessary to understand the psets.",
    "I would recommend it to those who need it as a prerequisite or who are curious about Econ. If you don't have a reason to take the course, I don't think it is worth your time.",
    "A thorough, if dull, introduction to microeconomics. The class is exactly what it said it is; nothing more, nothing less. Professor Berry is a good lecturer if you can hear what he's saying. \r\n\r\nA good TF is critical. Be careful in selecting yours; Eoin was fantastic.\r\n\r\nPay attention in class (and GO TO CLASS) and you won't have to read the textbook or stress about pretty much anything. This is invaluable advice. Again: go to lecture, take good notes, and you probably won't even have to go to section.\r\n\r\nThe class is pretty easy in general.",
    "strongly recommend for econ majors, and you'll probably be able to decide if you want to commit to econ or hate it",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It's very collaborative in that you can work with others on psets, and you get a lot of information in a very short amount of time.",
    "no, it does not teach very much being in a 450 person lecture for an hour and 15 minutes with a professor who works very quickly.",
    "Its a classic intro lecture. If you need it for the requirements, its satisfactory",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I feel that it is important for being a good citizen.",
    "I think that it is a good introductory course to microeconomics. It honestly wasn't too difficult. Some topics are harder than others, but it's very doable. Also, the problem sets aren't long either. You don't need to have take Econ before to do well in this course.",
    "It's one of the most popular courses for first-years to take, and it's also required for many popular majors, so I guess it'd be helpful for students to take this if it's necessary for what they want to do.",
    "It's a great intro but some people say this expands beyond intro micro. Be weary if you haven't taken micro before; I hadn't and found it difficult. The problem is that its a prerequisite for so many other things.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student because it's a way of thinking that everyone should at least become a little familiar with. It gives you an appreciation of another way of thinking, especially if you're not used to it. One thing though is that it can be a little frustrating when you're working on the psets.",
    "I learned many useful skills that I think are fairly applicable and can be more critical of policy",
    "Relatively easy weekly psets (1-3ish hours), two midterms that vary in difficulty, and a final.\r\nThe curve is WILD (20% As, 20% A-s, 30% B+s, with the ppl who drop still in the curve), so that is your friend. Our second midterm was wildly hard, but the curve ended up being incredible, so don't stress about the difficulty of exams because they are impressively curved. \r\n\r\nThe lectures are decent, and it is helpful to go, but there is no attendance policy or grade. \r\n\r\nNot a \"gut,\" but really not too bad. A pretty good choice as a QR for a humanities person.",
    "I would recommend the student shop both the seminar and lecture class to see which style of learning he or she would be most comfortable with.",
    "Yes, especially if they have even the slightest interest in economics. Although a lot of material is covered, at the end of the course a clear picture of what everything looks like working both together and against each other at times, and it is really interesting when you finally begin to see it.",
    "Yes! I think this a class everyone should take because it offers a very different method of understanding the world.",
    "I would recommend this course to this interested in learning about economics or curious if they are interested in economics, not as a general QR without any economics curiosity--it will be painful.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students if they have some working knowledge of economics- otherwise they will easily fall behind. It is a worthwhile course if it is required for your major. The fundamentals of econ are important for everyone to know - but, I don't think this course is taught in a way that is suitable for the average person looking to learn the basics.",
    "Yes, good basis for econ",
    "Probably not unless they are an econ major.",
    "It was not as engaging as I had hoped, partly because it was a lecture with hundreds of students in the class. I learned a lot for sure, but I would not necessarily recommend it to another student without a strong interest in economics.",
    "Yes! You learn a lot, the workload is manageable, and you can make friends in the class!",
    "This course opens up many doors as lots of courses require it. As an introduction to economics the course is also quite solid as it gives insight on the mathematical foundations that drive firm and consumer decision making. So yes, definitely take this course if you want to go into econ, politics, or many of the social sciences. Not the most enjoyable course, but it gets the job done.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they were looking for an easy QR credit, since this class uses simple math only. However, for someone interested in economics, I would recommend the seminar over the lecture, since those classes are smaller and more focused on the student.",
    "Take it for basic economic knowledge. It is a good course for useful information and as a gauge for how you feel about economics.",
    "I mean, this class is a requirement for a lot of classes. Worth sticking through, 80% of people get A-B range.",
    "I would recommend this course mostly because it's necessary if you're interested in Economics. I enjoyed Professor Berry's style of teaching. If the class improves on the lack of feedback\/transparency then it would be great.",
    "I would only take it if your major requires it, which is the reason I took it. However, I really didn't enjoy it so I decided to change my major. If you're looking for a QR credit, take a funner class!",
    "I would recommend this course. It was a good introduction to economics.",
    "If you think you might want to be an Econ major, take it.",
    "No. It was too disorganized.",
    "Yes. It's a good introduction to economics",
    "If one thinks he\/she has a possible interest in economics, absolutely, or else he\/she will be very bored and distant from the subject.",
    "Yes. The notes Berry does are very helpful and it is easy to be able to follow in class, given that you pay attention.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Even if you are not interested in becoming an Economics major, this course provided me a foundation in economics (which I think is important in every profession), and made me think about some real life problems in different ways.",
    "Take it with Berry. The lectures definitely got a little more boring as the term went on, but for a 450 person lecture he did a remarkable job of teaching in a way that was clear and connected with students. Probably one of the better lecturers out there. It's not a lot of work and as long as you study you'll be fine. Professor Berry really was the reason that this was a good course. He clearly cares about his students and teaching this material.",
    "I would tell them to take it if they are really interested because the material can be quite dry and there isn't much support. You have to be prepared to sit through fairly long lectures.",
    "yes. mandatory prereq for econ, interesting and useful information even if not an econ person (idk if I am so)",
    "Yes, I thought it was an enjoyable introduction to economics, well-thought, and not a very difficult courseload.",
    "Yes. Good subject to know about",
    "Yes, good introduction to economics",
    "This course is a prereq for many classes and majors. It might also be a helpful introduction for anyone who just wants to know the basics of economics. But it's by no means a captivating course.",
    "Yeah it's a good intro course",
    "Yes, if you want to major in Econ. No, if you were like me and took Econ 115 hoping to get a better understanding of the economy so that you would be equipped for many possible majors and careers and to be an informed citizen generally, because this class is so theoretical that you learn very little about the real world, aside from understanding taxes and insurance (kind of). Steven Berry is a decent lecturer, but what really matters is which TA you get, and unfortunately that's just luck. You will learn how to do the kind of analysis and problem-solving you need if you want to take even harder Econ classes and then major in it, although you don't really learn these things in lecture, just in section or on your own while you study for the exams. The lectures were dry, dense, and not at all engaging. The sections were where I actually learned enough to be able to take the exams and do the problem sets. I don't think the content itself is unreasonably difficult, but it feels that way because after the first couple of weeks, the pace is insanely fast-- practically a chapter per lecture-- so there's no time to absorb what you're learning. I didn't feel like this class was optimized for learning. If you're not going to major in Econ, the theoretical nature of the problem sets starts to feel really pointless and it's hard to stay motivated. As the professor said before the first midterm, \"It doesn't matter whether you understand the content, it matters whether you can get the points on the midterm.\"",
    "If you want to get some exposure to economics, I would recommend this course. It is massive and definitely not the most exciting course I have taken here, but it gives you a good background.",
    "Yea I would recommend. It's a good introduction to economics that isn't too, too hard.",
    "Personally, I wouldn't recommend this course to another student. If they are interested in economics, I would highly recommend taking the seminar instead. It is hard to get a great grasp on material in this class. Professor Berry often mumbles a bit during the lectures and could do a better job of explaining how the material is relevant to the problem sets. If you don't understand something in lecture, it's best to bring it up in section. However, sometimes the TFs in section were simply awful instructors. A few of them could be very condescending or just unhelpful to students who were seeking help.",
    "Yes, it was an interesting class and I see it as being widely applicable to many fields.",
    "This class wasn't as easy as I expected it to be. I would recommend taking it though if you are interested in other economics classes, because it is a common perquisite.",
    "Yes. Great course taught by a great lecturer.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student wishing to pursue upper level economics or public policy courses. I would not recommend this class to someone who just wants to fulfill their distributional requirements because there are smaller and more focused classes that will help fulfill those requirements. I would recommend this course to someone who unsure of what they want to pursue but she likes math and social sciences. This is a good introduction course to someone who is at least remotely interested in the course matter.",
    "If you plan to continue in economics or want to test out econ because you think it might be for you, then yes.",
    "Yes, because while it was difficult, I emerged a more informed citizen.",
    "I think most people do this course to fulfill a prerequisite, but I think it's an interesting course that provides a good foundation for further economic classes.",
    "Yes if youre honestly interested in the material or think you will be after shopping period. Personally, I really liked it, but my friends who took it for an easy-ish QR,  as a prerequisite, or because everyone takes it largely hated it.",
    "I would. It won't be the best or most life-changing course one will ever take, but I think overall, given that it's a very popular introductory course, it did the best it could with the resources available.",
    "If you are looking to get a QR credit out of the way and you're not an amazing math student (I certainly am not), I recommend econ115. I personally don't do well in big lectures, but I was afraid of the rigor of the seminar (Econ 110). I wonder how I would have done if I were in a smaller setting (one in which I typically thrive), but I don't regret taking the lecture. The curve is pretty generous.\r\nThere were people in this class with micro, macro, and calc experience, and people with absolutely no experience that would help them going into the class (myself being one of them). I cannot fully speak for the \"well-prepared\" students, but I feel as though everyone was challenged by this course because of the pace and the disorganization. With 450 students, I understand that it isn't easy to grade 450 problem sets and provide clear feedback, but I feel like part of what made this class difficult at times was how insufficient the feedback and turn around time (time it took to hand back graded material) was. \r\nIf you're looking to learn the foundations of micro and get a QR credit, I recommend Econ 115. It can be frustrating and problematic at times, but it's a very accessible QR class.",
    "Sure. If you need an econ course or simply want to expand your understanding of economics, take this course. The math is not too hard and the concepts are interesting. The textbook is wildly expensive but worthwhile. Professor Berry is a good and very entertaining lecturer.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it covers important topics and you learn a lot but the workload is not discouraging.",
    "Yes! Take Econ115. It'll help you in your other classes in how its a very cool combination of math, history, logic, social studies, and problem solving. You won't regret it.",
    "Yes. I learned a lot.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course to another student. Not only is it a solid introduction to the field of economics (and a prerequisite for many other econ classes), but it also teaches really interesting material and doesn't have a huge workload. Yes, it's a massive lecture setting, but if you don't mind that aspect of it, you should try this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who has never taken economics before and want to see what the subject is like. However, if you have no interest in it at all, I wouldn't recommend this course to be your SO\/QR credit.",
    "Yes, I definitely would! The material is helpful and interesting regardless of your major. The course adds perspective to ideas that are a part of our lives every day, and I now look at the world and different interactions through a new and more informed lens.",
    "yes. If you're an american, I think it's extremely helpful to have a basic foundation for the economic parlance that governs most policy.",
    "Yes, I think it was a good way to transition into economics if the student has never taken any class related to economics.",
    "It's a good introduction to the principles of micro economics, but can get very boring if you're not into econ.",
    "If they are wanting to pursue an economics degree, then I would definitely recommend this class to them.",
    "Economics is not for everybody. Give it a shop if you want.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this course to other students because I found that as long as you dedicate yourself to the course you will learn a lot of useful information.",
    "Yes, if you are a student with limited experience in economics and want a thorough, but not too difficult, introduction to basic market concepts",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to someone else. I wish someone had recommended it to me sooner. I think econ is a field that complements almost any other field very well. Econ also allows you to think about things that you would normally associate as a social event, not quantifiable, in a graphical, logical way, and make predictions based on these models. Even if you aren't interested in econ I think this is a good way to be introduced to this kind of thinking.",
    "If you haven't studied econ before, it's a must take. Knowing this stuff is a requirement for being an informed citizen of the world, and everyone should try to understand it.",
    "If you are going to pursue economics, this is obviously a necessary and very good introduction. If you are taking this as a QR credit or because you think it's good to know about economics for the \"real world,\" you probably aren't going to get what you want out of this course. It seems like it takes more than the intro level to be able to apply many of these theories to real-world scenarios.",
    "Definitely. One of those courses that gives a strong foundation for a lot of skills, not just econ.",
    "I think that this class weeds out econ majors.",
    "I love economics and it is useful for everyone to learn about. \r\nHowever, I would suggest the seminar to another student because I did not feel that the material was taught effectively in this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material is fairly easy to understand, and is applicable to the real world and our daily lives. This class gives a cool new lens on business and work.",
    "Pro tip you only learn Econ if you go to lecture. So maybe do not take as a senior.",
    "If you are looking to learn about the basic concepts of microeconomics then by all means take this class. However, you might also want to look into the seminar version of the course.",
    "I would recommend it only for two reasons 1) you're already good at economics and are alright with getting limited individual attention or 2) it's a prereq and you just need to suck it up and get through the class. It's not a terribly difficult class by any means, but the psets can be very difficult to understand alone so it might help to have a group of friends to talk them out with. Lecture can be extremelyyyy boring but Barry seems like a nice guy and cracks the occasional joke.",
    "Yup, for students who have no exposure to Economics.",
    "I would recommend this course, even if it is just to try it.",
    "Not necessarily. If the student truly loved econ I would but if the student was only partially interested I would say this class is not that enjoyable.",
    "Uea",
    "Yes because it is a good introduction to college lecture classes, and it isn't that much work.",
    "For any students interested in economics, this class is a must.",
    "Yes; its ikportant knowledge to have",
    "Yes I would, the class gives you a basic understanding of how microeconomics works and is very useful in other classes. Gives you a logical sense to every situation.",
    "Yes absolutely! I think theres a lot to be learned and gained by having a grasp of economic principles.",
    "I would recommend because it can help someone decide if they want to study economics.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, good, interesting class.",
    "I'd recommend this course, since it leads into so many potential paths of study.  It wasn't the most revolutionary or enthralling course, but it's what you'd expect and still a pretty fulfilling experience.",
    "Yes! Everyone should take it.",
    "Only recommend as a prerequisite.",
    "Yes it is an interesting course that shows how you can develop your critical thinking skills.",
    "Yes--it is important if you want to continue with economics at Yale.",
    "This is a necessary course for all interested in econ or majoring in econ. I learned a lot, but would not recommend to those who just want to be more financially aware.",
    "Good intro class worth taking",
    "yes if interested in Econ",
    "Not necessarily. The large lecture style wasn't for me, as I felt that I didn't really learn much from attending lectures.",
    "yes.need it for many other classes and its not that bad",
    "Yes, it was a great start to economics.",
    "Yes, if they are good at economics and are willing to devote a lot of time to learning all of the terms and concepts, because it takes a lot of effort on your own part.",
    "Yes , it offers alot of information. It is important to note that section is vital to the class.",
    "Yes. Its a good course the take. Even though it was a lecture of 400 kids, I still learned a lot.",
    "eh. I don't think I learned in ways that would benefit me outside of an econ classroom\/helped me see understand things around me in new ways",
    "Yes I think it provided a good starting point and introduction to econ. It isnt able to be directly applied in many ways but the theories it teaches and ways to approach decisions are very helpful",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in economics, with the caveat that because it's such a large lecture, you really need to be motivated to learn the material.",
    "Yes if you want a broad understanding of microeconomics.",
    "I guess",
    "I would recommend this class to any kid looking to major in Econ. Otherwise, there are easier QR credits to take.",
    "No, I am sorry but I would and have told all of my friends that I know of who are interested in introductory microeconomics to take the seminar. I think the lecture format is too confusing, some of the TAs are insufferable (why so many men), and the seminar would probably facilitate more engaged and directed learning.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "No unless you really want to major in economics",
    "If you enjoy learning about how economics affects our society then yes I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, because its great for the fundamentals and a good basis of Econ.",
    "Yes; good understanding for the economy",
    "I would only recommend this course if it is absolutely necessary to your major. Otherwise, it might be in your best interest to stay away.",
    "Definitely a good course to take in order to be able to think and speak intellectually about markets, their strengths and inconsistencies, and governmental attempts at correcting these inadequacies. It cultivates a good level of Economically-focused thinking.",
    "solid overview of classical microeconomics with strong support from ta's through office hours. clear lectures.",
    "Yes, it was a good introductory course but I found it quite difficult to learn in a lecture environment.",
    "Yes, but hopefully the course will be able to improve.",
    "I believe that despite it's flaws, everyone should take this class. Everyone should have basic knowledge about the economy as it pertains to literally everybody.",
    "Yes, for anyone with interest.",
    "It depends. I would recommend it to a student who had any feeling they wanted to perhaps pursue economics in the future, as a way to gauge that feeling. However, I would not recommend it to someone wanting to take a QR credit other than mathematics.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to have a basic understanding of how the economy works. Additionally, this course is worth taking for undecided students, as it is a gateway to several different majors at Yale (Economics, Global Affairs, EPE, etc)",
    "If Econ was a subject of interest to this other student, then yes. Otherwise, probably not, considering I personally had a difficult time understanding concepts and applying them.",
    "Yes, easy social science requirement, and the material is interesting enough. Plus, you'll always a friend or twenty in this class.",
    "yes only for those looking to go down the Econ route though",
    "Depends on how much work\/effort they are going to put in.",
    "Yes -- great course whether or not you will major in econ",
    "Yes",
    "Yea if you want to take econ.",
    "Yes only because it is an iconic Yale course and your friends will be in it so you can struggle together. Its a prerequisite for a lot of other Econ things",
    "This is a good course for a basic understanding of microeconomics. I am planning to take more courses in economics and perhaps major in it, so it was a very good start to the major.",
    "This is an excellent course for a student considering majoring in economics or looking for a SO distributional credit. I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking for an interesting class.",
    "As a core requirement for the Economics major, I would recommend it to people who are thinking of becoming Econ majors.",
    "Its not too hard but its a very basic course. Take this course only to understand very basic econ which everyone should",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "No, I found that homework was a poor learning tool. Out of 5 questions, one problem might be 5 parts long. Missing one part would be a score of 4\/5, which was the same score as if one entire problem was completely wrong. I often lacked motivation to try and improve.",
    "Yes, as it it required to do any interesting econ courses",
    "Yes if they are interested in econ",
    "Do not take this course unless you have to!!! I absolutely hated it.",
    "I would recommend it as a QR credit if you like numbers or if you want to be an Economics major.",
    "Yes. I think it's important to know the subject's material and know how economics work.",
    "This class offers a strong foundation of knowledge for any further economics courses, so if any student was interested in exploring the field of economics this would be a great class to start with. For anybody with significant knowledge of microeconomics already, this class will be easy but still builds upon the knowledge you already have. The lectures are interesting, and the addition of materials posted online definitely helps the review and learning process. However, if a student is looking for a more intimate and engaging class, this class is definitely not for them.",
    "only if they were considering becoming a political science or economics major",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student due to its engaging content and amazing instructors.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, if you are majoring in economics.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in economics.",
    "Yes because I think for anyone of any major, being able to think about the world in this way is critical.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. As long as you can pay attention in a big lecture, its worth the curve.",
    "Yes: if one wants to be an econ major, this course is required. Additionally, it makes a good forst year course or 5th credit because it has a small workload and plenty of available resoures for studying.",
    "Yes. \r\n\r\nI had a positive experience with most of the TAs and Professor Berry. I think the class is a true intro class: broad overview, general skills, focus on preliminary knowledge. I felt as though there were plenty of opportunities to get help and puzzle out problems. The workload and level of difficulty was moderate but manageable. The weaknesses of the course were frustrating at times, but nothing truly awful.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a good intro to economics. I would recommend.",
    "It's alright, but I cam out of it feeling confused about a lot of things rather than confident. Still an important foundational class for Econ majors and non-Econ majors alike, and some fun applications toward the end of the course.",
    "I would not because it's so confusing",
    "Yes I would. It is not unbelievably challenging, so even for non Econ majors they would be fine taking it to explore and learn about markets.",
    "Yes, highly recommend. If you are or are not sure if you are interested in Econ, this course is a good way to find that out.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, I think it is a good class but very challenging, especially if you don't understand the material in the beginning.",
    "Yes I would because the topics were enjoyable and although the material was challenging for me, it was worth it.",
    "If you think you might be interesting in economics, then sure, it's a good introduction to the field. You probably won't leave each lecture inspired, but you will leave the course with a more full understanding of the business side of the economy.",
    "Definitely a great way to get a QR credit if you need one. Curve is usually pretty generous.",
    "Take if its a requirement you need to fulfill.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who knew what they were undertaking. I would advise that before you commit to this course you be honest with yourself about the level of work you are going to put in and the commitment you have to the course. There are great people involved with the course who are willing to help you, but you need to be willing to seek out those resources.",
    "I would reccomend this course to students who want to get an intro to the subject, but I would warn them that it is difficult to do well and get help.",
    "To anyone who wants to have a basic knowledge of microeconomics, I would strongly recommend this course. This course helps students think critically about firms' decisions as well as about the economy as a whole.",
    "For students wanting a basic knowledge of microeconomics and the foundation of economics, this course would be very helpful.  It is also a good way to see if you are interested in the economics major or social sciences in general.",
    "Not unless you want to be an Econ major.",
    "Yes. It provides a nice overview of microeconomics. Eoin is a phenomenal TA. He makes sure that you really understand the material. Apart from him, it was a general lecture class. All the exams were curved. This is bad when they accidentally make the test too easy and good when they make the test too hard (both of which happened the semester that I took the course). Berry was engaging in lecture. He covered the basic concepts and some application. For the most part, I had to rely on the TAs to explain the level of analysis actually required for psets\/exams.",
    "Sure. It is a basic course which gives you basic knowledge, nothing special but necessary.",
    "Only if it is a prerequisite for their major.",
    "Yes if the student has any interest in economics",
    "Yes",
    "This class, I felt, offered a wonderful introduction to the discipline of economics. Indeed, the massive class size is a testament to the truth of that statement. Anyone who is interested in social science or how people do and ought to make decisions should take this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to all students. Intro Microecon is a class that provides great skills that will always be useful and interesting for every career.",
    "If someone had any basic knowledge in economics, I would recommend they take intermediate. But for someone looking to ease into college at Yale and get accustomed to college life before pursuing more rigorous academics, I would recommend this.",
    "Yes I think it provides a good basis.",
    "I recommend it for an introductory level to economics but not too far beyond otherwise.",
    "Yes - good way to learn the basics of micro but can be a little confusing and sometimes hard to figure it out.",
    "Only if you have to for your major or if you want to learn more about economics. However you will need additional courses to really understand concepts at a deeper level. Otherwise, probably useless material.",
    "If your interested in Econ, I would recommend it. Otherwise, dont. Its your basic course.",
    "I would if they are both set on being an Econ major as well as if they have taken calculus.",
    "I mean it is basic Micro, if you want to do any economics you have to pass through this course. It is not particularly interesting or fun, but you got to get it out of the way.",
    "Yes, it is necessary for many majors later on.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in economics you will definitely learn the fundamentals in this class.",
    "As long as the person knows what theyre getting into, Id recommend it.",
    "I think it's useful to understand the basic concepts of economics, even though you won't remember all the little details, and this is a fairly low-commitment way of doing it. I have heard consistently that out of the four intro econ professors (micro fall, micro spring, macro fall, macro spring), Steven Berry for Micro fall  i.e., this course  is the best, so if you're looking for one sample econ course, take this one.",
    "Yes, I think it is a class worth taking. That being said, I think it's important to know your strengths, and I probably should have realized a bit sooner that econ is not one of mine.",
    "If they are interested in Econ then yes",
    "Yes, good class if Eoin is the TA.",
    "Yes, but pirely our of the necessity for more exciting economics courses.",
    "I would only recommend this course to someone who is interested in pursuing economics.",
    "Yes-  If they are interested at all in economics or finance, I would suggest it.",
    "No because I felt the layout of information during lecture to be poorly presented and feedback on grades to be much too disorganized.",
    "Ya, especially if you are good at Math and Science.",
    "no"
