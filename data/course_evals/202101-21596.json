            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Dr. Cooper is really knowledgeable and really good at explaining topics. The workload was very manageable and it would have been even better had I known that all the quizzes were open note. It was a really good class and I actually felt like I was learning. I heard lots of horror stories about taking lab on sequence but if you have the opportunity and if Dr. Cooper is teaching the lab, take it with him off sequence. you'll actually learn so much more and not feel miserable doing it. This was one of my favorite classes and I usually don't enjoy STEM. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't know if Dr. Cooper is going to grade us like lab has been graded in the past with grade deflation, but I know he said at the beginning of the semester that that's what would happen. I see no point in having grade deflation and defaulting the average grade to a B+ -- it just pits students against each other (I personally did not try to compete with my peers because of this, but that's a potential consequence of deflating grades). But hopefully that's not how we'll be graded! The only other weakness I can think of is that it took a long time to get feedback on our lab reports and other assignments, so I would always turn in the next lab report without knowing if I was repeating mistakes from my previous lab report since we didn't have our grades back soon enough.",
                "The class is a large workload for being only 0.5 credits.",
                "A strength was that the lab reports were weekly because these provided plenty of opportunities to practice / improve at scientific writing.\r\n\r\nA weakness was that these lab reports were _not_ graded on a weekly - or even a monthly - basis. If the instructor kept up with the grading, students would get more out of these weekly assignments.",
                "I really enjoyed the short but detailed pre-lab videos that we watched beforehand, as I found that they really helped me to understand the concepts in each lab. I also appreciated the pre-lab quizzes to keep us accountable for watching the lab videos and reading the lab manual. In class, Dr. Cooper did an excellent job of showing us exactly how procedures are conducted in lab and answering any questions that we had throughout the process. \r\nIn terms of improvements, I have two suggestions. Firstly, it would be helpful if students could receive more regular feedback on assignments such as lab notebooks, as those were very useful in writing the lab reports, so it would be good to catch errors on the lab notebooks before handing in the lab reports where possible. Additionally, though I understand that post-lab quizzes were useful in checking our knowledge of the lab concepts, I found them a little bit redundant. The lab report already required us to debrief the lab thoroughly, so taking a post-lab quiz seemed a little unnecessary.",
                "would be much better in person to actually do the labs but for a virtual learning version it was great",
                "Interactive and great resolution lab",
                "It is such an intense course with the number of things that must be done in one week. A strength is that some grades on specific assignments are dropped which lets the student focus on the concepts more. One of the apparent weaknesses was that the concepts taught at the beginning like solubility were not really grasped because those taking the gen chem lecture unit had not gotten to that topic yet. Also, the questions at the end of the lab report are kind of overkill after spending a bunch of time on the lab report itself.  Some of the questions were a little difficult to figure out what to do, more clarity in the lab report instructions for when making a graph.",
                "Dr. Cooper is great at providing resources to help his students and made the class workload very manageable",
                "Strengths: The lab format, the interactive discussions, and the pre-lab lectures all allowed me clear understanding of the lab and the concepts necessary. In addition, the lab report outlines were very helpful as they helped me plan out my lab notebooks.  Overall, this course was very well laid out and enjoyable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The one thing I would say could be improved would be the timeline of the pre-lab lectures. I wished that I had access to the lectures earlier than the day before as it would have made the pre-lab quizzes a lot less stressful.",
                "The only weakness is the inability to individually perform each experiment. We had to watch and take notes while the professor conducted the entire experiment. However, a strength was that the lab was recorded and we could easily go back and rewatch if we missed any measurements.",
                "The biggest weakness of the course came from the virtual aspect of it as it was not possible to gain hands-on experience in the lab. Besides this, I believe that the course does a good job of guiding students through lab work as well as the process of writing lab reports.",
                "Again a lot of the issues were technologically based as there was not a lot that could be done with the virtual format. However this course really sought to engage the students taking it and to guarantee that everything was understood properly.",
                "I think it was very hard to do Chem Lab virtually but I appreciated the efforts of Professor Cooper. I thought it was difficult to get feedback for Lab Reports as our grades came back late."

The pre lab lectures were clear, and having Dr. Cooper do the experiments really aided my learning because he was really good at explaining everything.

As far as virtual labs go, this class was wonderful.",
