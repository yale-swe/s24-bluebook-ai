                "I think some topics were too advanced and not well explained. One topic that I really struggled with is variational inference.",
                "Strengths: The professor has done a good job of structuring the course. The lectures are (for the most part) well planned.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's a lot of material. And the homework assignments are long and difficult. The code in the class demos doesn't usually translate to what needs to be done in the homework. So students have to sort of teach themselves how to implement the code and going to office hours for help is absolutely necessary. Many times I thought it was just me that didn't understand how to implement the code, but then I go to OH and realize lots of people don't understand, not just me.",
                "Strengths: This course does an incredible job introducing you to ML architecture and methods. I've walked away with a rudimentary understanding of how many of the famous AI/ML function.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times this course can be confusing in what it expects the students to know. I felt like it straddled a weird line between a ML theory class and a survey course.",
                "This is like the modern machine learning survey course you never knew you needed/wanted but you do (or should). At first I was annoyed because the course samples like 10-20 machine learning techniques and most of them you dont understand enough to use on your own or detail the math behind them. However, Lafferty has a great talent for making things clear and distilling concepts, and he makes the course very worth your time. Through surveying all these topics with such an expert, you get a sense of what the techniques are about, things like Mercer Kernels and policy vs value optimization and permutation invariance and conceptual differences between HMMs and NNs (and adaption of HMM into kalman filters) and attention. Tests are excellently crafted, much better than most classes, and grading is fair. You skip over details but Lafferty puts time into high quality supplemental notes you can read after the course. If you ever work in the field, you wont have learned enough about anything to be close to independent, but you will know enough to learn quickly on the job and know whats going on as you learn. So I think the class serves a very specific purpose that I didnt at first appreciate; Im impressed and dont have any immediate weaknesses to point out as its not what Im used to. Maybe actor-critic could be taught a little better on the slides, as you have look at the code to figure out how the loss functions work.",
                "The strength is that this class is so interesting and the prof is one of the best in this field. The weakness is that the transition between concepts could be smoother.",
                "The content taught in this course is incredibly relevant, as it gives us the tools to begin understanding current research in the field. Many of the applications were really interesting, and the problem sets were super helpful with both solidifying understanding of topics and also being able to produce cool results.",
                "There are a lot of mathematical concepts that maybe given my background, I was unprepared to seize. To this day, I still have yet to figure out how we take the derivative of a norm and this can cause many issues when doing the homework assignments. Be sure you understand linear algebra well and brush up on it before taking this class. Prof. Lafferty also performs many derivations of formulas/proofs in class, which you don't need to rederive on the psets or exams, but it can make following along in class just a tad bit harder. \r\n\r\nPreviously this class was not recorded, however, mid-way-through, it was. There was a lack of consistency with the recordings as the course manager will upload them at random times throughout the week. The recordings were also weird sometimes - focusing on the podium, which did not allow us to view the chalkboard when Prof. Lafferty was writing . This can be solved by going to class, which I highly recommend because Prof. Lafferty is a kind and great professor. Ed-Stem (platform for discussion like Piazza) is a huge plus for this class, the TAs are super responsive and it allowed me to learn from my peers.",
                "Strengths include extremely helpful lecture notes and slides, demo notebooks, recording of the lectures that enabled self-paced reviewing",
                "Could explain some concepts more clearly, some topics are covered not in detail and sometimes confusing",
                "Focus more on applications",
                "It would better if the instructor chooses to include less old knowledge like linear regression and kernel regression but focusing on SOTA method, like Diffusion model",
                "I really like this course, but I feel this course is less satisfactory than I expected. We touched on many topics, but sometimes the professor did not have time (or gave us enough materials) to enable us to understand the content well. Also, the slides are not organized enough.",
                "The course holds a good balance between going too deep into theory and keeping it applicable. Sometimes math and derivations went over my head, but, fortunately, the general understanding is what you will be tested on. Sometimes taking a read of additional articles will clarify the concept and allow you to get a better grasp of the lecture material. Be prepared to put a lot of work into that one!",
                "The Professor presented the materials clearly and comprehensively. It would be more effective for us to learn if there are more basic concepts introduced",
                "The psets and quizzes were very good in helping to understand the material",
                "Strengths: Covers important foundational topics in machine learning; course topics shift as the machine learning space shifts. Very organized and has logical flow through topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of topics leads to not every topic having appropriate attention and background for full understanding; some topics are esoteric and not given sufficient explanation.",
                "The problem sets were generally very good! They were interesting and I looked forward to doing them every week. They were the right balance of difficulty! Professor was generally a good lecturer and the slides were comprehensive. I think that maybe some topics could have been explained better.",
                "Strengths: extremely knowledgeable professor, a well-designed course that covers state-of-the-art machine learning methods, and gives practical experience in using machine learning. Weaknesses: None.",
                "Lots of great intuition built up about different ML techniques and their probabilistic foundation. I think a quick lecture on recommender systems w/ collaborative filtering + content-based filtering would be relevant to many of the students in the class as well as fitting in well with the final lectures on ethics.",
                "Strengths: Lafferty is a good instructor and cares a lot about learning in the class, assignments tested knowledge fairly, ULAs are fantastic\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures can get verbose sometimes and go by too fast. Also they just posted my grade and I never got my final exam grade back and I think I did well on that so I kinda hope they graded it",
                "Really excellent course\r\nVery well explained lectures and engaging assignments \r\nOnly weakness was that it was at 9 am",
                "Laffertys passion about the subject is obvious but some concepts could be explained better. Homework and quizzes aid understanding but its helpful to hold TA sessions to go over some concepts and more importantly the implementation. I learned a lot (before exams) but not sure if I am able to apply the skills better than if I were to read a few tutorials online",
                "The lectures can sometimes be difficult to follow, but there are ample resources to help: Lectures are recorded, there are frequent office hours, and slides are posted online.",

                "Yes and no. I think the workload of the course was a bit too much at times. The homework was long and topics were difficult. I understand the structure of the course, but I would only recommend this course if someone has time and knows the pre-reqs very well.",
                "Yes, but be prepared to allocate a lot of time for this course.",
                "The course covers a lot and has a lot of prereqs. I had all of the prereqs except intro ML (S&DS 265), which I skipped. I can't tell if that was a good or a bad decision - I was sort of confused throughout the class, but I honestly think a large part of that was due to the course organization itself (and people I know who took intro ML and then this course were also confused). If you really want to understand the content, you might have to learn a lot of it yourself (I watched a LOT of youtube videos to try to understand the concepts). A lot of the time it was unclear to me how one part of the class connected to another part, or the motivations for things we were doing. On the upside/after all that effort, though, I definitely have a much better understanding of machine learning concepts and where the field is today.",
                "Yes! The PSETs in this class are some of the best designed PSETs I've ever come across. The knowledge I've gained from this class is incredibly applicable.",
                "Absolutely. Anyone remotely interested in machine learning or AI should attend this class.",
                "Of course, provided you have some experience with basic machine learning techniques or are willing to spend extra time learning about things. Professor Lafferty really prioritizes making sure his lectures are accessible and understandable. Generally speaking the course is well-designed for learning. Given that you'll learn so many things that are useful and important to know, definitely consider taking this class.",
                "This was my first machine learning course  I didn't take the introductory course as I had all of the prerequisites to take this class. I would say that going into the course, I wanted to understand why computers were able to learn and predict the next letter of a given sentence or for flappy bird to learn how to navigate the environment (both are psets), but I didn't really learn this. At least, it's still murky as to how computers are able to learn these things. What's helpful about this course, though, is that you get to learn so much and really get hands-on experience and exposure to a variety of topics in machine learning. I'm still unconfident with my machine learning abilities, but this course has given me an introductory understanding to learn off of and learn more, which is the crux takeaway I think. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned in my strength/weakness section, there are A LOT OF MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS that maybe given my background, I was unprepared to seize (this was mentioned by prior students in their course evaluations as well). Be sure to brush up on linear algebra and have a good solid math foundation as following along the proofs Prof. Lafferty goes over in class can be helpful for implementation of algorithms/homework assignments.\r\n\r\nThe recordings were also uploaded in inconsistent time intervals, which was frustrating, but ed-stem was a great resource. Sophia Zhu and Louis are SUPER helpful - I highly recommend going to their OHs and study sessions. There are also QUIZZES (5), which test concepts in class - these were hard for me, but be sure to stay on top of lectures and ask questions ahead of time during class/OH.",
                "Yes, I would strongly recommend it to the junior students in particle physics experiment.   It provide extremely helpful background for ML applications in our work.",
                "Yes! Very nice course for intro to serious ml research topics",
                "Yes, I learned a lot about throughout the semester and the content feels very applicable to today's machine learning industry",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this class to another student interested in ML. It clears a path to other advanced ML and DL classes here at yale as an undergrad.",
                "Yes, but only to very intelligent students with excellent python skills and deep learning knowledge",
                "I would if they are a statistics major since it is a mandatory class, but be prepared to work to understand the topics",
                "I would recommend this course to students who want to learn about machine learning who have good background in mathematics and statistics (linear algebra, maybe calculus, experience with proofs, S&DS 241/242).",
                "Yes, if youre an S&DS major or even comp sci I think this course is amazing for giving you foundational knowledge about machine learning.",
                "Absolutely. Prof. Lafferty is extremely knowledgable and approachable. The course gives a great overview of machine learning while still providing important theoretical detail. It is truly a great course.",
                "Yeah, I think it helps build up a great foundation in ML. Definitely a lot of additional areas to explore after the class, and it's easy to phone in the coding parts of the hw, so I think keeping up with the material after the class + expanding on the ideas is necessary to get the most out of the class. I'd recommend taking this class earlier if possible (like junior year or early). I felt like probability theory helped beforehand but S&DS 242 less so.",
                "Yeah, most definitely. In the past, this class has gotten more hate than it deserves, and hopefully this year's reviews reflect that. Machine learning is a brand new field and this class deals with some of the newest and most cutting-edge techniques around - like the field as a whole, the course inevitably has some growing pains, but Professor Lafferty teaches the class as well as he possibly can. He is also amazing with student feedback and is always looking for ways to improve the class and support students. As far as content goes there is a fair amount of both math and coding, so make sure you have those down tight. Even if you do, office hours are an absolute must because they're so incredibly helpful and understand that usually at least one of the problems is super confusing. It's more of a survey course so don't expect to have all the techniques memorized by the end of the semester, but you get a cheat sheet on the exams and you don't need a five-second recall in research/industry anyway, so it doesn't really matter.",
                "It was hard but 100%",
