    "This course covered the psychology of thinking and rationality. We discussed logical fallacies, theories of human behaviour\/thought\/motivation, and logical reasoning, among other things.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: strong examples, excellent TF, great professor, assignment are clearly structured (primarily the modules function)\r\nWeaknesses: felt like too much information at points, the end felt rushed",
    "The course was very organized and the lectures and discussion meetings were engaging.",
    "I very much liked that there were short quizzes associated with each lecture. It forced me to stay on top of my work, and it made me aware of any gaps in my understanding of the material so I could ask questions if necessary during the discussion sections. While the course material was challenging at times, the professor gave engaging, interesting, and clear lectures.\r\n\r\nI wish that the discussion sections had not been solely centred around discussing homework problems, and could have included more open discussion of the concepts and information.",
    "The arrangement of this course is good with self-study lecture videos and question periods. This helps us to reflect on what we have understood. But the emphases of the course can be ignored when most work need to be down before lecture. And the work load is a little heavy for memory. The course also need some background knowledge in psychology I think."

    "Yes. Because the course cotent is good and useful especially if you are interested in psychology and have some background knowledge."
