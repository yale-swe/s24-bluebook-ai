                "Strength: the teacher and the TA. Professor Dolgova is so committed to teaching Russian, and really wants you to improve. She's also brilliant and very, very nice. \r\nWeaknesses: This course is a lot of work, including long daily HW assignments. This is what you need to do if you want to learn the language, but it is a lot of work.",
                "Great teacher and teaching assistant. Helpful and dedicated to students learning.",
