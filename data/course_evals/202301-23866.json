He came in with a plan and specific passages for us to read from without dominating the conversation too much. Most classes go by slowly, but this one always would fly by :)",
                "DS is awesome! learn tons and great people. lovely community develops around it! downsides are that you don't relaly get an in depth understanding of many of the texts, because you go so quickly. also there is disparity in grading policy between sections, and generally a lack of feedback based on how the course is structured.",
                "Strengths: exposure to many texts in a relatively short amount of time that I would not otherwise be able to interact with on a regular basis.\r\nWeaknesses: many texts in a relatively short amount of time; I wish we had more time for each of the texts to really dig into the works. A week (or sometimes a couple days) per work did not do them justice enough, in my opinion!",
                "I greatly enjoyed this course. I liked the small seminar format, which give everyone ample opportunities to speak. I also enjoyed having introductions to the works we read. Discussions were engaging and well structured, and the portions we read in class were interesting and relevant to themes we were talking about.",
                "A strength was that every student was really encouraged to share often and I felt as though our thoughts were appreciated. A weakness was that often the energy of the class was low."

Of the three, lit was my least favorite, but that's really just because I'm more inclined towards H&P and philosophy. All around, good times, good community, interesting readings in DS.",
                "Yes, but only for students that are really passionate about reading and/or talking in depth about the works. This applies to the DS curriculum in general!",
