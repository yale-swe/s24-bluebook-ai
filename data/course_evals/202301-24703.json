Typically, I would write something about less reading so we can engage more deeply with the material assigned, but I felt that readings chosen for this course were all important and contributed to the overarching discussion. It could be interesting to have more discussion leaders.",
                "This class was amazing the only small request I would make is to lessen the reading load. Given that most of the readings were dense theoretical pieces, it could feel overwhelming some weeks.",
                "The strengths of the course were definitely the readings and the professor. Both were able to provide me with so much information and historical about my surroundings and my identity as a Black person.   Professor Boyd was extremely passionate and this passion made us, as students, want to match his level of passion for theory.\r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I would say that sometimes the words Professor Boyd would use were inaccessible. I had a hard time breaking down his feedback at times solely because of the language used."

Please continue this course even after Prof. Boyd leaves.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! This has been the most enriching course that I have taken at Yale so far. Each reading has broadened my perspective on issues that impact my daily life. The environment fostered in this seminar allowed for a genuinely free and open discussion in which everyone left the day having contributed and learned something from a peer.",
                "Yes! Black political theory needs to be taught in tandem with the \"normal\" political theory taught in intro classes because of the radicalized nature of our country. If you want to go into politics or activism I think this class is a must take. The information it provides its students is incredibly valuable and eye opening."
