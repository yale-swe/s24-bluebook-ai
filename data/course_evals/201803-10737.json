    "pinyin, characters, and pronunciation pf chinese",
    "I learned a basis for Chinese with reading, writing, understanding, and speaking. I also learned much vocabulary and grammar.",
    "I went from absolutely no knowledge of Chinese to learning 350+ characters! I am now able to read, write, and converse using these characters. I also learned Chinese tones, pronunciation, grammar, and some facets of Chinese culture. It is AMAZING how much I learned in just one semester!",
    "I learned more characters than I thought possible in a semester. Besides learning to write and read characters, I also strengthened basic speaking skills and improved my ability to pronounce Chinese words.",
    "I learned to approach learning a new language: how often I should practice, the different components of language learning and identifying my own strengths and weaknesses",
    "How to speak more colloquially, vocabulary, commonly used phrases. Tones and pronunciation and proficiency at reading.",
    "I really improved my reading and writing skills.",
    "Prior to taking to this taking this course, I had none-to-limited experience with speaking, writing, or listening to Mandarin Chinese. Through this course, I learned how to write, speak, and listen to basic Mandarin Chinese.",
    "Learned how to read & write Chinese characters and practiced aural and oral skills"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are that you learn very much very quickly and it really helps supplement any previous knowledge you have. A weakness would be that the speed is quite fast so if you get behind, it truly becomes quite difficult to catch up and remember all of the characters. Perhaps a slower pace would help?",
    "Strengths: The course was incredibly engaging and sets a solid foundation for L2 and beyond Chinese. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The amount of work (in the heritage level) was extremeI put in a good 2+ hours per night for homework and studying for daily quizzes. However, it was definitely worth it!",
    "The class is engaging, informative, and predictable; if you put in work everyday, it is definitely possible to do very well. I went into the class not knowing how to write my name in characters, but after a semester, I am able to write full paragraphs using characters. There really are no clear weaknesses.",
    "Strengths include a very thorough and comprehensive curriculum\r\nWeaknesses include maybe a slight lack of focus on conversational practice",
    "Good teacher, concentrated curriculum.",
    "I like how we are always looking at characters in class on the board. It would be great if the characters for the daily quiz had pinyin and English on Canvas.",
    "Strengths - Firstly, I thought the class assignments were very well-organized to facilitate student learning. While the class assignments (ranging from daily homework to recordings) required significant time commitment, they helped me greatly improve my Chinese speaking and writing abilities. Secondly, I really enjoyed taking this course with the instructor, Professor Chan. She gave very helpful, timely feedback on assignments and always helped students identify where they could improve. \r\n\r\nI found no weaknesses with this course - I really enjoyed the course as it was structured and would recommend it to any student who is looking to  establish a solid foundation in the Chinese language.",
    "Strengths: Great professor who really cares about the course and interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: Somewhat fast-paced but no where near as unreasonable as CHNS 132"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you want to learn Chinese. However, this isn't a course you can breeze through, it will require hours of outside class work.",
    "If you are sure that you want to learn Chinese, then ABSOLUTELY take this course. The Chinese department at Yale is unparalleled, and every instructor within the department is incredibly intelligent, welcoming, and supportive. If you just want to fulfill a language requirement, consider another language as Chinese at Yale warrants hours of work per night.",
    "I would recommend this course if you already have basic speaking skills in Chinese, but have limited or no skills in reading\/writing characters and pinyin. Also, you should be willing to put in at least an hour and a half or two hours of work everyday.",
    "Yes! I think this course did a fantastic job of building the different types of skills needed to learn a new language and made me genuinely excited to see myself improve",
    "Yes, very fun class! Teacher is coolio and is a great fit for anyone who kinda speaks a little and home and who isnt proficient at writing and reading.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to any heritage Chinese learner who has limited experience with speaking, writing, and listening to Mandarin Chinese. In my experience, I found that despite having limited experience with Mandarin Chinese prior to this course, taking this course has allowed me to improve my grasp of the language greatly. While taking this course is a significant time commitment (we meet every single day, in addition to daily homework and memorizing of Chinese characters), it is so worthwhile.",
    "If you're interested in learning Chinese but have little previous exposure, I would highly recommend this course. I speak Chinese with my parents occasionally, but I learned so much through this class. I initially could not read or write Chinese characters, but now, I'm semi-literate."
