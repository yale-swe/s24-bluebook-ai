                "The pace is great to thoroughly understand the course material, and it is nice that the course is structured so that each week is one subsequent step of an experimental protocol. However, there is a lack of independence with the experiments, as we all are following one specific protocol at a specific pace.",
                "It's a good introduction, although given students' various experience levels, it can start out feeling very ahead or behind of the course material. It's well organized, but more explanation of the structure of the course would be helpful",
                "The course is not well organized at all. This is not at fault of the teaching team but of the program they used for teaching. I liked how most of the work was done in class but everything took way longer than it should have due to poor organization",
                "I really enjoyed how the course was structured around the long-term completion of one biochemical objective--each week was a different step in the overall experimental protocol. The strength of the course is also its weakness, however. The protocol was developed by another school, so there were times where we had to make a lot of changes that meant we wasted time in lab and/or didn't achieve the end results we were looking for. Still a great learning experience, though.\r\n\r\nOne other weakness is that, apart from the quizzes, we didn't have anything graded throughout the semester (we had notebook checks, but weren't told what we received on those checks), so it was hard to know where you stood grade-wise."

                "Its a little too slow if you already have wet lab experience but I liked having a bit of a break from extremely hard classes",
                "I think this course was a great way to improve laboratory skills, especially those concerning a long-term experiment with one overarching objective. This models what research is like in an actual lab, so I think the experience of being in the class is very valuable for anyone interested in pursuing scientific work."
