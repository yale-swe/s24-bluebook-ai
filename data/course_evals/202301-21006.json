                "An understanding of how nuance and public and political pressure shape environmental law, policies, and outcomes in the US and around the world.",
                "Each week we focus on a new topic in environmental law: from remediation, water quality, air quality, biodiversity, agriculture, etc.",
                "Through this course I gained a broad understanding of many topics within environmental law, and mostly further insight on common issues with laws and regulation all over the world. This class included interdisciplinary issues that prompted us to learn about global trade and economics, development and human rights, access to information and many more. This class also taught me how to read case files and summarize large amounts of readings.",
                "I learned about a variety of issues in the fields of environmental law and human health. It was a helpful and comprehensive overview of how many topics there are to explore in this arena. The final paper allowed me to delve into a topic of interest more specifically and I enjoyed the process of researching and writing it.",

                "Learned about relevant environmental regulation and corresponding case studies.",
                "I developed a strong sense of the international complexities surrounding law, including environmental constraints, disparities in language and meaning, and the difficulty of standardization of sustainable practices."

                "This was the first time teaching this course as a seminar, and while Professor Wargo has many great things to say, it took a while for the class to find a balance between his speaking and discussion\/collaboration. It will likely go smoother next year!",
                "Strengths: interesting material, very knowledgeable professor, understanding deadlines, reasonable workload\r\nWeaknesses: While Prof. Wargo definitely made efforts, the class at times still felt like a small lecture rather than a seminar (this is the first year it is a seminar, though, so it is an understandable transition)",
                "Strengths: The course readings were highly engaging, the course presented an excellent sample of both domestic and international environmental cases, and the final paper was both a great opportunity to apply lessons for the case studies to an area of personal interest, and was very well structured to promote intensive research.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class may benefit from being 20min shorter and\/or having more clearly defined sections of lecture-style and seminar-style working",
                "Strengths: professor Wargo is an expert in the field and it's great to learn from him! The readings are super interesting and very relevant, the cases we study as well. I came in already with an environmental interest and learned so much each week. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes it took a while to get advice on paper progress but that's understandable. I wish this class was broken into two times a week because the one day a week sometimes was a bit long",
                "This course was very helpful for teaching how to write from a legal perspective, which I originally found daunting. I love how we were able to write about and dive into whatever environmental case interested us.",
                "I enjoyed the mix of the lecture and seminar format, I think it was much more engaging than a typical lecture because there were less people. I also enjoyed the difficult questions that we were asked, though we obviously could not find the solutions it was a thought-provoking task. I also enjoyed the readings we did as they were very informative before we discussed the topics in class. My only recommendation is that I was hoping to see more discussion of Southeast Asia or countries outside the Western world since it was outlined in the syllabus.",
                "I liked that the course was such a broad introduction to a variety of issues and that the class was a combination of a lecture and seminar discussion. Breaking into small groups to come up with potential solutions was very engaging and enriching. Sometimes the lectures dragged on and it wasn't clear where the class was heading, but they were always interesting.",
                "strengths-- in depth readings each week and guidance on essay, availability of prof. wargo to talk. weaknesses-- course did not build on itself because each week was different. minimal student engagement during class time. slow to give essay feedback, arrived too late",
                "This course, in concept, works very well as a seminar. In practice, however, the professor ended up doing most of the talking, and I wish there had been more discussion between students. I learned a comprehensive overview of environmental problems, but little time was spent learning about effective solutions. I wish this class had been more hope-oriented.",
                "Covered a lot of real world environmental challenges and worked to develop critical thinking and knowledge in these important areas.",
                "The strengths of this course were the collaborative discussion that occurred each class meeting. Students always brought thoughtful insights and I found I learned just as much from discussion as I did from the readings and lecture."

If you are ready to engage a lot with the material and ask extra questions, then this is a great course for you--but if you don't take much initiative, your grade will be fine, but idk if you'll get much out of it",

This class addresses some of the greatest challenges the world faces today, and it is important that everyone understands the extent to which systems of power have abused the environment and common people. Everyone can come out of this class with at least one takeaway.",

This class might also appeal to students interested in public health, since most of the topics covered had a heavy emphasis on human health impacts.",
