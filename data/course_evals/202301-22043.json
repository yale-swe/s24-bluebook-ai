                "A brief insight into the history of Hollywood films, and learned a lot about the backgrounds of the films you watch!",
                "So many. I'll never watch a movieclassical Hollywood or notand not think about this class. I learned so much about how movies are made, the stories they tell (purposefully and not), and how the film industry got to where it is today.",
                "I actually learned so much about the beginning of Hollywood and the history of film during the early 20th century. I also learned a lot about film analysis and the different formal features.",
                "I learned about the history of the Classical Hollywood era. On a more practical level, I also learned ways to \"see\" and experience film.",
                "You'll learn about the nuanced, energizing and sometimes troubling history of early hollywood and its writers, directors, performers, and audiences. You watch countless fantastic films and become confident analyzing them for content and style. Further, you'll read screenplays, movie reviews, conduct interviews, and research topics of interest. In many ways, FILM 232 feels like an exhilarating pick-your-own adventure course, as you can generally write about whichever topics really interest you for the papers and increase your own engagement in the course through your interaction with the films and readings. You can choose to explore the studio systems, actor growth, filmmaking style, and more niche topics like female silent film screenwriters and actresses in your assignments. And most importantly, you'll develop a joy for learning about film and Hollywood and responding thoughtfully to the course content through essays.",
                "I came in with no film background, and now I won't look at them the same again! I have a whole new appreciation of cinematography, music, props, costuming, plot structure, and more. Even for the casual filmgoer, this course is incredibly rewarding.",
                "I learned a lot about films during the classical hollywood era. This includes how theyre made, history, key figures, and important elements of films.",
                "I learned so much about how to critically analyze and appreciate films of the classical Hollywood era. We learned about the history of the big studios, the producers, directors, cinematographers, composers, costume designers, etc. We got to watch black and white films, which I thought was particularly neat.",
                "Best course at Yale hands down",
                "I learned critical analysis when consuming art and how to be cognizant of the societal and cultural influences that shape the stories that are told and how they are told.",
                "This course offers so much! You re exposed to beautiful movies that I at least never would have watched on my own, you get an understanding of how the film industry has changed over time, you see the connection between film and politics and society. Professor Thomasons lectures also teach so much about morality, the complicated reality of human nature, and so much more!",

                "Awesome class!!",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: I LOVE THE FILMS, I do not consider myself a big movie/film buff, neither do I think of myself as a romcom person at all... After watching Roman Holiday and some of the other films in this course, I fell in love with older Hollywood narratives. This course is simply amazing, and every lecture from Prof. Thomasson feels like a story.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: NONE",
                "Only strengths, no weaknesses. Every movie was great, there was never a dull lecture, and we even played Jeopardy twice. One of the few classes in my time at Yale that I genuinely looked forward to going to each day.",
                "Honestly, I wouldn't change anything about the course. It is fun, engaging, really interesting, and a great time. Camille and the teaching staff care so much about their students and it has a great classroom energy. Not super challenging nor a lot of work.",
                "Strengths: Professor Thomasson is such a wonderful, kind soul who really makes this course shine. All the TFs are wonderful as well! Every lecture felt like listening to a story or a super engaging podcast. This is a must-take for any student!",
                "Strengths: Professor Thomasson is an angel and it's a joy to learn from her. The second you step into the Alice Cinema for each class, you are greeted with her ear-to-ear smile and the film score for that week's film. It's like stepping into a magical Disneyland ride for 50 minutes twice a week, and her lectures are gripping, suspenseful in the fascination they build for the topic, and leave the class clapping at the end of every lecture. Professor Thomasson creates such a joy for learning through her infectious enthusiasm for the course and creation of a community of eager students and TFs. She learns your name and genuinely cares about your successshe hosts the most wonderful office hours with tea/espresso, cake, and the fun treasures she's collected from a fun life of filmmaking. She reads each students' papers and sends each student thoughtful email responses to essays and extra credit discussion posts. The weekly readings are also quite light, which enables students to complete them thoughtfully and bring ideas to section for engaging conversations. Professor Thomasson also has fun Team Jeopardy tournaments between sections and has check-ins where we rate our favorite filmsboth those screened on Tuesday nights and those optional to watch for extra credit over the weekend (highly recommend!). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Absolutely none!",
                "This course is awesome! Lectures are incredibly engaging, and sections are a casual, fun opportunity to discuss the week's film. The only improvement could be more regular feedback on our writing, but I still feel like I improved as a writer, regardless.",
                "Strengths: I can't imagine a professor more invested in her students than Camille is. Above and beyond everything else, she wants you to be enjoying yourself, and she succeeds at that. She has so many fun days -- Jeopardy x2, HUAC reenactment, the day she brought in musical instruments -- that don't feel superfluous but make me never know what's going to happen next in a way that never makes me want to miss class. This class also has one of the best sections I've ever been in. Camille really wants a community of people and something about section made that happen. It was the section that felt the least like pulling teeth of any section I've ever been in.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the course was slightly more information-dense. Two 50-minute lectures isn't a ton of time, and often her lectures would be 40-45 minutes. Some of those lectures also consisted mostly of anecdotes about the week's movie -- I wish more of the time could have been spent to talk more generally about the time period. I don't really feel like my understanding of Classical Hollywood changed that much after taking this class.",
                "No weaknesses, besides better communication on where to find extra credit on canvas.",
                "Strength: CAMILLE THOMASSON. She is such a gem and probably one of my favorite profs ever. So kind and caring, and such a wonderful teacher. The TFs were also amazing, and always willing to help. Weaknesses: none.",
                "The lectures were phenomenal and very engaging",
                "Only strengths!! I genuinely looked forward to every single lecture and Professor Thomasson is amazing. Each lecture felt like a ted talk in the best possible way. The films were enjoyable and varied. Section was usually interesting. Overall great course!",
                "Professor Thomasson is the greatest strength of this course. Her passion for the subject is apparent in every lecture. Every single class is engaging and interactive and she conducts it in a way that it is hard to be anything other than fully invested. Can't think of anything that can be improved!",
                "Incredible class, no weaknesses",
                "Very engaging and the film selection is absolutely amazing. Truly delightful.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are fantastic, sections are fun and compelling, readings are not too bad, assignments are fun and flexible to your interests, the anthology of movies is wonderful, Camille Thomasson is the sweetest person alive\r\nWeaknesses: It's only one semester.",
                "Prof Thomasson (and the teaching staff) is definitely the biggest strength of the course; she is one of the most passionate, helpful professors I've met at Yale. I'd have very few suggestions for improvement: the workload is adequate (currently 15 pages of film journals, one interview project, two papers, readings before every class, weekly film screenings) and the class is highly informative and enjoyable.",
                "I love the films and the lectures. some of the best lectures I've even had at Yale.\r\n\r\nGrading on papers felt a bit harsh sometimes.",
                "This course was highly organized and it was clear what we needed to do for the following week.",
                "This course's strength is Prof. Thomasson and the amazing TFs. Prof. Thomasson is the most warm, invested professor I've had at Yale, and made each class and office hours visit a joy. The class is extremely well structured for student learning, and the objectives for students are clear from the beginning. The organization of the syllabus and the chronological/thematic progression of the films is done with care and intention. There are no real weaknesses to this class -- only that so many Yale students won't be able to take it in their time here.",
                "The lectures were excellent very instructive in terms of both content and modeling analysis.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved with more attention to technical terminology and knowledge of film, either during section or lecture. I felt that one section worth of going over vocab and tools for analysis wasn't enough, and I had to do a lot of learning on my own in order to write at the class's expected level. Spending certain days focusing just on cinematography, sound, editing or mise-en-scne would have been very helpful.",
                "Very well structured and engaging lectures. The assignments and schedules were very clear through the Canvas modules. The syllabus was organized well and the week-to-week focus was clear.",
                "strengths: Prof Camille's lecturing style! Absolutely draws you in and I left every lecture wanting more. The teaching fellows are so helpful and engaging, especially when you've never taken a film class before. Manageable workload, tons of extra credit opportunities, intimate class community\r\nweaknesses: honestly none",

                "Absolutely. Never again will I be able to sit down every week with other like-minded students and watch these films on a big screen. Please please please take this class if you can!",
                "ABSOLUTELY! Sign up. It will be your favorite course at Yale. You'll get to meet one of Yale's most thoughtful, engaging professors and watch classic movies with a class of caring students and TFs. In each magical class, you'll watch film clips, listen to film scores, and learn so much about Hollywood. You'll get to pick your own adventure to chart via your essays. And most importantly, you'll have SO MUCH FUN!!!",
                "Yes, definitely. Professor Thomasson is one of the best professors at Yale, and beyond that, the subject matter of the course is applicable for everybody. It really augments your appreciation of film, even if you are just a casual film-watcher.",
                "This is one of those classes that is different from anything else at Yale in the best way possible. I came into this class knowing some things about Classical Hollywood and don't feel like I left learning that much more than when I came in, but I never felt like coming to lecture or section (!!) was a waste of time. You can take it as a fifth class -- other than the midterm/final, there's practically no homework outside the Film Diary entries, so on a normal week this class took up my Tuesday night and nothing else. If you think you might enjoy watching movies every week, then I see no reason why you wouldn't want to take this class.",
                "Yes, Camille is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. She visibly cares a lot about her students.",
                "YES. Take this class if you can get into it. Best class at Yale.",
                "Its the best course 100% Camille is the best Professor ever. Talk to her she is amazing",
                "Absolutely",
                "Absolutely! One of my favorite courses Ive taken! Professor Thomasson is a gem and is very kind and generous with her time and the energy she puts into the course. It really felt like a community by the end of the semester which I cant say for many courses.",
                "Absolutely! This is one of the best classes I've ever taken. If you get in, take this class!",
                "Yes, this is maybe my favorite class Ive taken at Yale.",
                "YES!!! This course and Professor Thomasson changed my perspective on film and life in general. I feel like my love for writing has been reinvigorated and my appreciation for classics and the art of story telling is alive.",
                "Yes. The films will always stay with you.",
                "Definitely! If you are a filmmaker or film buff, you have to take it. If you are just interested in cinema and need an art credit, this course is an awesome choice, but you have to really embrace it, going to lectures, sections, and screenings each week! It is one of my favorite classes at Yale so far!",
                "Yes! This is the best class I have taken at Yale. It was such a joy to come to lecture every week.",
                "Absolutely. If you get in, by all means take it! You'll learn to appreciate (Hollywood and other) film in a far more nuanced way and will also have a fun time while doing so. This course was definitely a great counterweight to the major-focused courses in the rest of my schedule.",
                "Yes!!! I love the films and lectures so much.",
                "Yes! Even though I knew very little about film, I truly felt compelled during classes and discussion sections. The films we watched in-class were wonderful. Camille is wonderful. The teaching team is wonderful. This class has been the highlight within my Yale career. I loved it!",
                "Yes, absolutely. This class is fantastic. You can look at the syllabus right now and see exactly what you'll be working on for 13 weeks of class. It is a fantastic survey into the Classical Era of cinema, which overlaps with some of the most important moments in U.S. history. Movies are a spectacular lens for viewing social change during this 40-year period, and this class likely relates to so many other things you're studying in ways you don't yet know. The Tuesday night screenings are a highlight. There are so few opportunities to see films like these in large theaters with such engaged audiences (people audibly laughed, shrieked, and booed) and I loved each film. Prof. Thomasson is the kindest professor I've had at Yale and is so, so invested in each of her students. Her care in crafting this course extends to her selection of TFs, each of whom were amazing.",
                "Absolutely. Phenomenal course that offers a great intro to Hollywood history. The screenings are great and Camille's lectures are incredibly engaging.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially to non-film majors who can get the course to count either for their major or for a distribution credit. I would also recommend this course even just as a total elective, to a student in any year or semester. It was a surprisingly good choice for a fifth course there was a significant amount of weekly work but it was all enjoyable and I looked forward to classes and screenings, which lessened the weight on my courseload.",
                "Absolutely! The lectures fly by because they're so engaging, and you get to immerse yourself in a world that you might not have otherwise!",
                "Yes! Esp if you have any interest in films. I've never taken a film class ever and I am so thankful this was my first introduction. If you want a fun WR credit, take this! I promise you won't regret it",
