I worked a lot on my writing in this class as well as my ability to look at larger themes within genres. I think this class was a great opportunity to think together as a class about abstract topics and reflect on our own history.",

                "I felt that the texts we read were some of the strengths of this course. Rasheed did an excellent job of selecting books, essays, songs, and plays to read as a group which helped the entire class stay engaged. I loved our class discussions and the ways in which discussions continued on after class. I really found a community in this course. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of this class was that I wish we had more time for formalized writing workshops. Most of the writing process was done outside of class but it might have been nice to have more time focused on the skill of writing. I feel that I now have a strong foundation in how to engage with academic literature, however, I wish I had more guidance in terms of writing.",
                "This course was my favorite of the year. We read a good amount of books that let us stay engaged without rushing. I cant think of weaknesses to this class.",
                "My strengths came to adding new insight to seminars and bringing nuanced ideas. One weakness is that I need to focus on breaking down texts even further for their deeper meanings and connection to other authors."

                "I would. The instructor was excellent, the course topic was unique and specific yet highly applicable to anyone, and the subject matter of the course is one that allows for a close community of students.",
                "Yes! This class was a fantastic building block for my writing at reading at Yale. Rasheed was incredibly supportive of my writing and gave great feedback to my papers. I would heavily recommend this to every student.",
