                "strengths: instructor was extremely knowledgeable and flexible with content matter; very interesting material\r\nweaknesses: problem set grading seemed arbitrary at times, unclear expectations",
                "Strengths: there was a PDF of content that paired well with the PowerPoints from class; the alternating schedule of quizzes and tests ensured I was retaining what I was learning in class; Weaknesses: the content could get a little too in-depth at points that it was very difficult to understand",
                "Stength of the class was that it was VERY engaging. The lectures during the beginning of class were presented in a very interesting way and followed up questions that expanded understanding and connected the material. The second half of class would include a discussion on a reading that would also provide a different perspective and allow for more student interaction on the topic. Another strength was that even though the class had a large focus on biology, it also involved other aspects such as art on the subject or real world events. Shorter and more frequent assignment forced constant review of the material and a better retention of the material. Additionally, combination of assignments made the class more interesting. Having a final paper and project at the end of the class rather than a large final was also a strength as it allowed students to take a deeper dive into topics that they were more interested in. Fantastic class and I don't see what else could be done to improve it.",
                "Strengths: small class size allowed for lively discussions and personal engagement with the professor. A variety of instructional and assessment methods were used which ensured I was almost always interested in what we were doing in class. The lecture packet put together by the professor was a great help and very appreciated.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not any major ones I can think of.",
                "Since it is a first-year seminar I thought the class was pretty engaging and overall enjoyable. The readings were very interesting."

If you have less background, be prepared to put in more work, but the professor's lecture notes packet is immensely helpful in understanding some of the more complicated immunology topics. Students will come away with a scientific and historical understanding of immunology and infectious diseases that will serve them well in the future regardless of their main area of focus.",

                "Yes! Prof Kavathas is the best. The course can be hard and covers materials that are quite detailed and advanced, but Prof K's teaching enthusiasm and the structure of the course make it enjoyable.\r\nIt is easy to get behind on the lecture materials, so regular reviews are necessary to stay on top of the increasingly nuanced immunological concepts."
