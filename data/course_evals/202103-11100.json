                "This course is not taught in a way that is conducive to retaining information. I think the course would be more effective if the professor kept about half of the concepts in the course and taught those more thoroughly. (For example, lectures tend to speed through many slides rather than build up a strong foundation of core concepts; exams tend to focus on strangely specific information.) Would also be nice, in my opinion, to spend more time on SQL, and possibly assign a pset that allows students to write SQL.",
                "Strengths are overall low levels of work. Weaknesses are unclarity around grading, lectures just reading off textbook slides, bulk of coursework being theoretical and unpractical.",
                "The strength of this course is that it was completely remote, but it's also its weakness at the same time. I could have not watched any lecture, but followed along with the slides and still do decently in the class. Might be a good thing too",
                "This course was taught online this semester, so I imagine the quality of the course suffered because of that.",
                "There are no strengths aside from the low workload. The weaknesses lie in the fact that the content of this class is useless. The lectures are also SO dry and uncharismatic. The prof straight up just reads through slides really fast word for word, sometimes even skipping relevant stuff. The entire class requires self-studying. To improve this class you need a new prof and new content.",
                "This course was held on zoom (due to repeated unforeseen occurrences), so it was convenient to be able to rewatch the lecture material at any time. It wasnt a very engaging course at all, thought. Avi just lectured from the slides basically verbatim and the only assignments were canvas quizzes",
                "Despite the fact that we were supposed to return to in-person learning this semester, this course was completely online. This was not communicated in any way at the beginning of the semester, and it was very disappointing and confusing as to why it was online. The TFs for this course were not expected to know all the material, so going to office hours was not a guarantee that we would get help. On a couple of occasions, I asked a TF a question only to be replied with Im not in charge of that material, youll have to go to the other TFs office hours. It was very unfair to expect students to be able to go to three separate office hours every week in order to get their questions answered. The exams were poorly written (i.e. the same question appearing twice, no correct answer for a question) which was stressful and confusing during the test. The exams themselves were multiple choice, which was also really not ideal for demonstrating understanding of a concept.\r\nThis course was advertised has having a final group project, which I was really looking forward to completing in order to get some hands-on experience with databases. A few weeks into the semester, this was changed to only multiple choice exams. This was very disappointing. I dont understand why more TFs couldnt be assigned to the course to support the grading of projects. I personally feel that the CS department failed to provide students in this course with an adequate learning experience, because they did not provide enough resources to the class.\r\nThe one strength of this course is that Avi is a kind and understanding man. I understand he was dealing with some illnesses this term, and I wish that the TFs and other members in the CS department could have supported him more in order to make this course a better experience.",

                "One strength of the course was the helpfulness of the TAs. They were always accessible during a somewhat difficult semester and always willing to meet outside of office hours to help. I think one of the weaknesses of the course was the format. It was challenging spending the semester over Zoom.",
                "This course had no strengths. Every single evaluation was multiple choice. TAs consistently did not show up to office hours, and when they did, they didn't seem to understand the material themselves.",
                "Due to overwhelming demand, the course staff had to cancel the practical project this semester. It would be best if there were enough staff to prevent this in the future, or some guaranteed (perhaps autograded) programming assignment(s) to at least let us practice SQL. Although the lecture is almost just the slides, Prof. Silberschatz seemed to care about his students and how much they learned; it would've been more apparent in a smaller-class, more engaged format.",
                "Strength: Strong focus on conceptual understanding of topics, Weaknesses: Assignments were all multiple choice quizzes, which can only do so much to help with practice.",
                "Comprehensive topics about database, it would be better if it includes more SQL code.",
                "A good amount of the content of this course is important. Particularly the units about SQL. However, it is taught very poorly, the prof. just reads off slides that don't explain things very well. The assessments were pretty tough too.",
                "Strengths include low workload, the flexibility of zoom classes, and the fact that the topic is very important to CS. Weakness include organization, theoretical approach without practical component, and multiple choice exams. The class wasn't organized in the best way possible. There was big TF shortage as there was much more demand than in past years, which led to getting rid of the project component so the class ended up being only theoretical. The assignment due dates and exams were also not announced at the beginning of the sem, rather throughout. This sometimes led to very short notices, which would sometimes be changed due to complaints, but again though these changes were helpful they could lead to confusion. Multiple choice questions often ended up having a different answer then the one originally chosen as correct or there were cases where a specific word or phrasing would make a big difference. Announcing due dates at the start would improve the course. Increasing the TF's and reintroducing the project would also be helpful to gaining more practical knowledge.",
                "One strength is that the slides are pretty good summaries of the concepts we learned in class. The slides were solid study tools and were often good sources to look at for the problem sets. \r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, the first that comes to mind is that the TAs are not responsive at all on Piazza. It would take many days or even weeks to get questions answered, and sometimes questions regarding the exams would go unanswered until after the exam date while questions about grades went unanswered until very late in the semester. Some of the course content, such as the normal form algorithms and early emphasis on relational algebra, felt a little obscure. Another weakness throughout was that the professor really only ever read the slides verbatim. He only elaborated beyond the exact words on the slides if people asked questions.",
                "Interesting and comprehensive topics, clear and useful lectures.",
                "weaknesses: useless assessments and lack of hands-on experience.",

                "The course was well balanced in terms of workload and difficulties and was overall a good course",
                "It was entirely on Zoom, which I personally enjoyed. I thought it was well-structured considering there are only so many ways to structure a course on Zoom. I also appreciated the fact that the final (group) project was replaced by a third exam; forming groups, meeting regularly and completing a big project in that very remote setting would have been difficult.",
                "Great course",
                "the lectures were dry",
                "This course went in depth about database systems but didn't actually teach any SQL or practical applications of database systems. It would've been helpful to at least get a crash course in SQL and have some assignments where we had to write SQL code",
                "Needs more TFs and better organization. This was one of the most unorganized courses Ive taken.",
                "Strength: clear course materials.",

                "This class has interesting material, although perhaps in a unfortunate format due to the online teaching model. Though I understand that extenuating health and logistical circumstances forced the class to be taught online, it was quite unfortunate that it had to be this way, and I feel I had difficulty engaging with the material to the extent I would normally have been able to. The online exams were fairly easy due to their open-notes nature.",
                "I think the course can demonstrate more examples in class materials.",
                "Strengths: It's a gut...\r\nWeaknesses: As a result of being basically wholly online, with everything being done via Canvas quizzes, I didn't really ever feel challenged to learn the materials whatsoever.",
                "I think more practices can be made, especially on sql.",
                "This is not a \"course\". This is a textbook. It's not very good and it's read in an accent I could rarely understand.\r\n\r\nA class like this makes me question the value of a Yale education. Do outsiders know that the education is this bad or are we keeping it hush hush?\r\n\r\nThe entire class was a professor reading his own textbook. We never coded or did any work in SQL or any database system. I doubt anyone learned anything. The teaching staff were aggressive about their ignorance and failures. The professor was AWOL. The entire class grade consisted of ~100 multiple choice / True False questions. There were no other assignments. For a CS class! And there were multiple choice questions that had no correct answers! Something like 5% of the final grade came from multiple choice questions that were incorrectly written.\r\n\r\nI think a proportional response to the atrocity of this class would be a public apology and a full semester tuition refund to all students enrolled.",
                "It is lecture heavy and there's not much homework.",
                "The course is very well-organized and serves as a great introduction to the field of database.",
                "This course had so much potential. A foundational course in databases is such an important course in the academic career of a computer science student. I was so excited to get hands-on experience working with SQL coming into this semester. I was so disappointed when the course not only moved fully online for the entirety of the semester, but every single graded assignment turned out to be multiple choice. Each lecture contained between 40 and 100 slides of dense, theoretical database concepts straight from a textbook. Lectures were dry and not engaging at all. Out of ~150 students, maybe 20 showed up to each lecture. Since we had no hands-on work, assignments and exams consisted of studying hundreds of slides of theory and finding tiny specifics to answer questions each worth >1% of our final grade. I sincerely hope this course will be in-person and much more practical for students in the future.",
                "The lecture material was interesting and slides were a good summary of the book material. The professor was good at explaining concepts and always stopped to ask for questions. The assignments and exams were very manageable. One recommendation though would be to release the assignments a bit sooner.",

                "It was more theoretical than I had anticipated (I thought it would be more practical), and if you're not interested in the material at all and are just looking for a low-workload class to take, you'll get a low-workload class but you'll probably find it a terrible experience. If you're moderately interested in the material and are willing to put in some effort to read the textbook (or you're good at understanding lectures), then you'll get a low-workload class and possibly get something out of it as well, though it still might not be the most pleasant experience.",
                "No, the class is low-workload but really not worth it overall",
                "Yes. I love the professor so much. Even though we met so many challenges this semester due to unexpected reasons, the professor gave us a wonderful experience in zoom sessions. And the overall structure of this course is clear and fundamental to the database system. Very helpful.",
                "yes, very good professor",
                "Yes. This course is an introduction to database. It would be helpful for other students if they want to explore a new area. The workload is reasonable.",
                "someone with a decent CS background who cares about the theory behind database design would enjoy this, but if you're looking for a class with directly applicable skills, this isn't the one",
                "Yes. It's a great intro course to the database system.",
                "No. This class sucks. Its not worth the low workload. Dont do it.",
                "If it were in-person, yes. Otherwise, no.",
                "Absolutely not. Whatever you do, don't take this class. Total waste of a credit. If I could go back, I would not take this class. Do not even take it for the low workload rating -- it's just not worth it.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in data engineering or database design because the material is very useful but I think it could have been delivered in a better way.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if he/she is interested in databases or is looking for a low workload CS elective.",
                "Depends on the situation they're in. If you're looking for a low-stress CS elective where you'll learn a little about databases, then yes. If you find nitpicky exam questions annoying, if you prefer coding-type psets over more theoretical quizzes, if you tend to rely on a strong support system (TAs/prof) in your classes, or if you have a high standard for the depth/quality of course material, maybe try something else.",
                "Only if they care about theory around databases.",
                "If you are looking for a CS gut, take this class.",
                "I would definitely not recommend taking it when it is taught online.",
                "This class was probably the worst class I have ever taken at Yale, and I've taken a lot of classes. Keep in mind, I'm usually the type of person to give professors the benefit of the doubt. I've taken classes people claimed were terrible and didn't think they were that bad after all. When I took this class, I didn't have high expectations: I was just looking to take a CS elective and was willing to put up with some degree of mediocre instruction. But this class was truly terrible. In Professor Silberschatz's defense, he was dealing with some medical issues outside of the class that seemed to be demanding his attention. I'm also sure it's also much harder to teach a class over zoom (this class was taught entirely virtual). However, that does not change the fact that this class was an absolute mess. Every single homework assignment and exam took the form of a multiple-choice Canvas quiz, which sounds nice and easy at first, except these questions were often ambiguous and poorly-worded, leaving you with no clue which option to pick, even if you had attended every lecture and kept up with the material. What's worse, since the questions were multiple choice, there was no partial credit, so you could get screwed over by poorly-worded questions even if you understood all the concepts perfectly. In the second exam for this class, out of the twenty questions on the test, two of them NO CORRECT ANSWER (all four of the multiple-choice options were incorrect), which led to me wasting a ton of time trying to figure out the answer to a question that had no answer. And that wasn't the end of it - on the third exam, two of the questions had exact duplicates later on in the test. It was almost as if the TAs were tasked with writing 30 questions for the exam, but could only come up with 28 questions, so they picked two questions to duplicate and hoped no one would notice. That's the only explanation I can think of. In any case, the homework assignments and exams in this class showed such a clear lack of effort on part of the teaching staff, with mistakes so blatant it seemed like the teaching staff never even read over their own test.\r\n\r\nAnother downside of the multiple choice format of this class was that I left the class having barely learned anything. I took this class because I wanted to learn SQL, but since we never had any problem sets or proper homework assignments, I never wrote a single line of SQL in the entire class. Watching YouTube videos and self-studying SQL would have served me so much better than wasting my time and effort on this class.\r\n\r\nSpending time studying for this class was honestly demoralizing because I knew no matter how much effort I put in, I was bound to get screwed over by poorly-worded questions on the exam. It seemed like there was no correlation between the effort I put in to studying and the grade I got back. It was also frustrating because it seemed like the TAs were putting in so little effort on their part. The class had an Ed discussion page, but the TAs rarely responded to questions, especially towards the end of the semester. Important questions (such as clarifications on ambiguous homework questions and grading scheme questions) were left unanswered.\r\n\r\nBy the time the Credit/D/Fail deadline rolled around (on the very last day of class), the professor had still not released a grading scheme. Under the grading section, the canvas page read:\r\n?% on 4 homework assignments\r\n?% on first exam\r\n?% on second exam\r\n?% on final exam\r\nSo essentially you had no way of knowing what your grade was in the class and whether you should Credit/D/Fail or not.\r\n\r\nThis class was so poorly organized - it seemed like us as students were putting in way more effort into the class than the teaching staff. What amazes me is just how little I took away from the class. Despite the effort that I put into this class, it was not reflected in either the amount of knowledge I learned (which was not much) or the grade I got back.",
                "I would not. The content is useless and impractical and the prof is not a good lecturer.",
                "I wouldnt recommend this course to someone unless they want a very easy but very disengaging CS elective. There are definitely more interesting course that you can take than this.",
                "No. Very disorganized",
                "In its current state, I would not recommend this course to others.",
                "I would not recommend this class. The course and lectures were essentially just a group reading of the textbook, and the weekly problems sets (Canvas quizzes) were just checks to see if you'd followed along or read the textbook on your own. We never used SQL or any of what we learned about directly -- rather, it was all theoretical and not applied whatsoever. In the end, I very much regretted taking this course.",
                "No because it was very unorganized, the TAs didn't know the material, the slides had many mistakes, and I didn't learn much from lecture (had to learn on my own).",
                "No, Im not even sure what I got out of this class but an easy A",
                "I would. The material was challenging, but very interesting and worth learning. The helpful TA's and professor also made the course accessible.",
                "No, not in a million years. Take another elective which will be applied and actually let you code.",
                "Yes, if you want to cover a thorough foundation of database systems.",
                "No. Pretty bad course with inattentive teaching staff. Half of the questions on Ed related to whether questions would be answered. They never were",
                "Yes.",
                "Not really, unless you are really interested in databases and there aren't any better options. This class is really poorly taught, partially because we didn't have a single in person class because the prof. had health issues. Even though some of the topics are really important, particularly SQL, we had no hands on experience so you don't really end up learning how to it.",
                "I would recommend this course if they need a CS elective with a manageable workload and don't mind the theoretical approach.",
                "Take this if you want to get some good general knowledge about databases and want a low-workload CS elective, but expect frustration with the course organization.",
                "Yes, an interesting and useful course in databases.",
                "No\r\nAlmost nothing useful can be learnt",
                "Yes. This is a good course.",
                "I would definitely recommend. A bit more chill than some other advanced CS electives so it goes nicely with some much more technical courses. Also a solid introduction to database concepts.",
                "Great course",
                "no",
                "Yes, as an easy compsci elective. Most of the content, however, is not stuff you will really use in industry.",
                "Yes, if you want your workload be low",
                "No, unless the course includes a final project or more assignments writing SQL code",
                "Definitely not unless the course becomes better organized. Syllabus changed from two exams and a final project to three exams due to lack of TFs and high demand. Exam logistics were a nightmare. Ed discussion posts would take weeks to get an answer even on pressing questions.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. Because this course provides introductory knowledge to database management.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, although I would encourage them to take it at a time when it is able to be taught in person.",
                "Yes. The content is very useful. The instructor has been very helpful and excellent at teaching the materials.",
                "It's a gut CS class! It was held entirely over Zoom. HW and exams are all just multiple choice questions. The final project was waived this semester since we had over 100+ students enroll and the TAs couldn't keep up. But you may have a final project when you take it though.",
                "Yes, because if you spend just a teensy bit of time on the coursework, you'll pass.",
                "Yes, it's a fundamental part of computer science.",
                "If this class is taught again, I would recommend dropping out of the CS department in protest.\r\n\r\nThis is not a \"course\". This is a textbook. It's not very good and it's read in an accent I could rarely understand.\r\n\r\nA class like this makes me question the value of a Yale education. Do outsiders know that the education is this bad or are we keeping it hush hush?\r\n\r\nThe entire class was a professor reading his own textbook. We never coded or did any work in SQL or any database system. I doubt anyone learned anything. The teaching staff were aggressive about their ignorance and failures. The professor was AWOL. The entire class grade consisted of ~100 multiple choice / True False questions. There were no other assignments. For a CS class! And there were multiple choice questions that had no correct answers! Something like 5% of the final grade came from multiple choice questions that were incorrectly written.\r\n\r\nKnowing that this class was an abysmal failure, I believe the prof tried to dissuade negative reviews by releasing final grades on Canvas and giving the majority of students As. (which I think was the fair response). But that will not temper my review! I cannot be bought (well I'm taking my A anyway)!\r\n\r\nI think a proportional response to the atrocity of this class would be a public apology and a full semester tuition refund to all students enrolled.",
                "Depending on whether they are interested in the database. Not a must-take class.",
                "Yes. The instructor is very kind and does as much as he can to make sure his student thrive. The materials are relatively easy to understand even if you have zero background knowledge.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student, at least not in the current format. To be clear, it was not a lot of work at all. However, I got very little out of the course. It was so difficult to stay engaged with the material and to practice core database implementation. If a future employer or professor asks me to write SQL, I will not be able to do it at all.",
                "I would! The content was interesting and the material was well taught. The assignments were not bad at all and neither were the tests. There were some hiccups with the canvas quiz format this semester that added some challenges to the exams, but I'm sure that will all be taken into consideration for next time. The professor was very understanding about these challenges and made up for them with time extensions on the exam. This is a good CS elective to take as I think the content is important to know and the class is not as intense as other CS classes.",
                "Yes if you want to take some easy courses and boost your GPA. But you don't really learn much except a lot of concepts that you easily forget."
