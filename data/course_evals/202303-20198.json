The class really opened my eyes to how vast the field of forensics is and how there are so many applications of geoscience research in everyday life. You learn how to properly synthesize information from these papers and present them in an objective manner which considers their successes and their shortcomings.",

                "The class is so well organized, all the readings are easy to find and rubrics are so helpful when completing individual work. I really liked that we needed to provide reading response questions from the reading, in preparation for discussion; this made it so that everyone had at least one thought to contribute into discussion. The class was also great in that the (few) lectures that do occur are there to catch everyone up to speed on important research technologies and principles that will be discussed in future papers of discussion. \r\nThe only thing that can be improved is maybe providing a mid-term participation report where students can see how their participation is panning out. We discuss most days but our participation, while guided by a rubric, is never really revealed to us until the end of term report.",
                "Strengths - interesting, class-led and professor-moderated discussions. The case studies covered a wide variety of topics\r\nWeaknesses - not enough field trips",
                "I though is was organized very well. Engagement remained high because of the required reading discussion questions and the presentations were interesting to create and watch.",
                "The strengths of this course are the professor, Maureen, and the format of the course. The weekly case study presentations and discussions are a great way to get everyone engaged.",
                "strengths: learned a lot about both science and forensics\r\nweaknesses: the majority of the work for the semester is all at once for your presentation and then all at once when writing your term paper; listening to classmates lecture each class can feel a bit boring - no attack on my classmates here, we were all doing our best - and by the middle of the semester half the class showed up egregiously late just for the discussion, not the presentation. Classes were very repetitive.",
                "Strengths:\r\n(1) Professor Long is INCREDIBLE. It was so amazing to learn from her this semester. She was amazing at facilitating our class discussions, and made every conversation a great learning opportunity. She also definitely cares about her students, and was gentle with deadlines for the final papers.\r\n(2) the class was organized extremely clearly.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nWould have liked a little more guidance for the final paper! Seeing the example was helpful, but it wasn't super clear how to go about the research. However, I super appreciated that there were regular checkpoints for the research paper throughout the semester, making sure that students kept up.",

                "Strengths:  I cannot gush about this course enough. \r\nRemember in Mean Girls, when Lindsay Lohan's character is like, \"I spent about 80%. of my time talking about Regina George. And the other 20% of the time, I was praying for someone else to bring her up\" -- that's how I felt about forensic geoscience. \r\nProfessor Long assorted this ragtag team, this motley crew, this little Justice League/Avengers League/United Nations \"intellectual potluck\" of students to discuss a new case every week. With Yalies from each corner of campus (EPS/Math/CS/Econ/Film etc), everyone had their own unique background to apply to the course material. It was a very active group. We even got to give our fingernail samples to a forensic lab (free manicure?)  and run around campus with a GPR device. \r\nAnd I wrote a science paper!! I had never done that before. My only regret is not taking this class freshman year, when I could have taken more EPS classes afterwards. But this is the end of the road for me. Im graduating in a week's time, and I shall never return. I have lived a full Yale life. Bathed in the sun, slept in the sand, even drove an old lady around and taught her about  true friendship. But that kid is long gone... This old crab is all thats left. Goodbye, me.",
                "YES! Highly recommend this course to STEM and non-STEM kids alike. Forensics is such an amazing field and it's so interesting to see how historical research or anthropologic research uses geoscience techniques to advance their own fields.",
                "I would. Especially to someone unfamiliar with the politics and operational process of the scientific field, this was a very eye-opening experience. Also, the material was super cool to learn about",
                "I absolutely would. I found it very interesting to learn about investigative sciences, especially as a non STEM major I found the material and organization of the course to be digestible.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to people whether or no they need a science credit or if they know anything about geoscience. I found myself talking about this course so much with friends. I learned so much and got to do my own research project (which was kind of brutal to produce, but overall very rewarding.)",
                "Yes!! A fascinating course with a wonderful professor",
