    "This course was a very good intro into the complex world of constitutional interpretation and its historical context.",
    "The history of how Constitution came to be, why the document was framed as a necessary replacement to the articles of confederation, how to interpret the Constitution (textualism, original intent, structuralism etc), the history of voting rights, and the sociopolitical forces shaping the amendments.",
    "I attained a greater understanding of Constitutional history and Constitutional interpretation.",
    "Content (both explicit and implied) of the US Constitution as well as the basic tools of its interpretation.",
    "Analytical skills for answering constitutional questions",
    "Deeper understanding of the founding principles from the Constitution and guidelines for constitutional interpretation."

   "comments": [
    "Amar's immense knowledge is certainly the strength of this course. Students can get the most out of the experience by doing the readings early and formulating as many questions as possible. Amar is fantastic about making connections between the readings and the modern world, and allows students to direct the class with their concerns.",
    "Textbooks are great, lectures were thorough and built on the reading well. I think the discussion section could have been more structured - perhaps students could have submitted discussion questions, or there could have been a more specific set of topics to discuss than just the chapters. I think that because the chapters encompass discussions of sociopolitical forces, the actual history, and reflections on the mindset of influential individuals, the discussion was a little unfocused.",
    "The quality of discussion varied a lot depending on the quality of students' questions. I'd recommend asking every student to submit a question (related to the readings) to Prof. Amar in advance of each seminar. Then Prof. Amar could pick the most interesting ones and center discussion around them. Obviously, the best part of the course is the chance to pick the brain of one of the foremost scholars of Constitutional law. Prof. Amar's books are excellent and surprisingly readable, and it's pretty cool getting to ask him questions about them for a couple hours multiple times a week. Prof. Amar was also really generous with his time, typically going at least 15 minutes overtime just to finish answering students' questions.",
    "engaging lectures\r\nDiscussions were a little lecture-like",
    "Relevant to current political events and provides a good balance of history and modern legal implications. The pace was a bit fast, so keeping up with all of the lectures and reading was a bit difficult at times."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to others. If taking it online, it might be wise to get some of the reading done before the class begins.",
    "Yes. I think any US citizen should understand the Constitution and even international students might find learning about a landmark historical document like the Constitution interesting.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in Constitutional law.",
    "Yes. It's like a literature class, except the stakes of interpretation are super high, and your professor has had his scholarship routinely cited in Supreme Court opinions. Recommend especially for those interested in legal scholarship.",
    "Yes, it's a great approach to learning parts of American history that are relevant to today. Even if you've taken US History courses in the past, the focus on the Constitution keeps things interesting. Also, it's still approachable even if you don't have a poli sci\/history background.",
    "Yes. Vitally important subject matter and outstanding instructor."
