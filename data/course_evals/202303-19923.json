                "Professor Nicholson is a GEM. She can (and will) make absolutely any topic an interesting and engaging one, and when dealing with the same author for an entire term, that is a very underrated skill to have. Every week brought with it new and interesting discussions. I honestly didn't think there could be that much to discuss concerning one guy, but there absolutely was. Only weakness would be if you aren't invested enough in Donne himself.",
                "Overall - Prof. Nicholson is an excellent, extremely knowledgeable instructor, especially with a good eye for providing insightful written feedback and for her presence in the classroom. I think there were some structural problems with the course; I did not feel prepared for the final paper going into it. \r\n\r\nAt the level of the syllabus, I think, given that we were mostly doing close readings, that there should be less but more focused readings. We probably only talked about less than half of the ~10 assigned poems for any given week, often through a reading that was non-evident and I was discovering in class in really time, so preparing for class felt kind of ad-hoc - I felt about as prepared for the classes where I had done all the readings closely as those when I skimmed the poems. I feel like the syllabus could be balanced by reducing the number of poems down to, like, 4-5 poems a week, which the students are required to *closely* close read, maybe aided by a weekly assignment. I know this is supposed to be an upper level course, but regardless of students' experience with poetry it's just not possible to treat 10-11 poems with any reasonable care within an hour and fifty minutes. It'd also be much easier to group poems thematically this way. To counterbalance the reduction in poems, I think there should be much more secondary critical literature, like double the amount, both on Donne, but also on Early modern poetics in general, so that students can come away with more history of literature knowledge that they can use to contextualize their other studies. We didn't talk very much about the secondary critical literature or the biographies - I wish we had - as they would have given more of a framework / through line / momentum of the course.\r\n\r\n There were something like 5 people talking consistently in a class of 15. There were a number of people who never talked the entire semester except for the one or two times we went around the room and, e.g. everyone shared what they were working on for the final project. I think that a lot of the issues with discussion in the course had nothing to do with the syllabus, the readings, or Prof. Nicholson - the class was genuinely not very engaged, just from the get go, and I'm really sorry for that - Prof. Nicholson was working very hard during discussion to engage a class that was just fundamentally difficult to engage. I think a lot of people in the class were there because of the Renaissance requirement/senior seminar and not there for an original interest in Donne. (admittedly, sort of myself included, initially - I came across a number of poems I really loved, though, and I'm ultimately quite glad I took this course)\r\n\r\nI think one way to improve the engagement in the course would be to set higher expectations for the reading responses. In the first class, Prof. Nicholson made it clear that they were fairly low stakes, that they would just be graded for completion, and that we could put just a short question or something - although I often didn't do this, I somewhat wish there was a requirement to do like, at least 300 words and to advance an argument about the poems for that week. Possibly some group discussions/presentations of poems/texts would be helpful?"
