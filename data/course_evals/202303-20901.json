                "This course provides great insight into the history of Tokyo and its modern-day problems.",
                "We learned how Tokyo developed as a city, about social and political movements in the city, about the character of many neighborhoods, and the legacy (or seeming lack thereof ) of war. The course gives you a great understanding of the makeup of the city and the way Tokyo is both a product of the city's landscape and of technological development that occasionally resists the former."

            "comments": [
                "I loved the courseespecially the events outside of the classroom. As a freshman I really appreciated the small community the class became.",
                "Strengths: Professor Botsman is great. His knowledge of the city is pretty remarkable; almost any questions we posed he knew an answer. On top of that, he is kind and personable. I loved whenever he shared personal stories from visiting Tokyo or his life in academia. As a group, we watched two movies together outside of a class and went out for Japanese food, all highlights of my semester. Professor Botsman made intentional efforts to foster community in the class and it worked; I'm grateful I got to be a part of this group. I liked how the course began with contemporary art, and then jumped back to the Edo period. Overall, I found the recent history more engaging. The four writing assignments felt genuinely worthwhile and allowed us to freely explore our interests in the city. Weaknesses: While I thought the syllabus was super interesting, I wish there was more diversity in our assigned texts. It would have been cool to look at more artwork, films/videos, and music, especially music. It also would have been nice if there was more variety in discussion format; it felt like they dragged on some days. While we did group work a couple of times, I would have liked it to be more often and clearer in its instructions/purpose. The class's Canvas could have been more organized and frequently updated.",
                "Strengths: Professor Botsman is incredible, it felt like a real privilege to be able to have discussions with him in a small group. Not only was his knowledge so vast, he was able to make really interesting arguments in ways I hadn't thought of, and really challenged our beliefs. The discussions we had were the clear strength of the class. I also enjoyed the assignments, especially the final paper that gave us a chance to discuss whatever we wanted. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class structure was always show up, talk, and that was it. While this did lead to some really interesting discussions it did get repetitive at times. \r\nMost of the readings were interesting but some were very niche and a little bland. This led to slower discussions where the amount that students could participate was somewhat limited because the scope of the reading was limited, and, without external specific knowledge, it was hard for students to discuss.",
                "This class provides great bonding with the other students and you learn a lot about the history of the city. The weaknesses of this class are a lot of the readings were posted hours before the class was due to start and it felt like some of the readings were very similar to each other.",
                "Strengths - very interesting course topics, very knowledgeable professor, also Professor Botsman is just a really nice person and very understanding (and got to know everyone pretty well)\r\nWeaknesses - discussions often stalled and didn't progress much beyond the readings. It felt like everyone would give their opinion and regurgitate a section of the reading they found interesting and then we would all sort of tune out. The professor should guide the discussion more and introduce a bit more of a 'taught' element (maybe 15-30 mins of lecturing per class) because the class meetings are very long and often we ran out of things to say. The one week he did that (lectured for a small portion at the start), everyone was noticeably more engaged and it felt like I learned a lot from that one class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Botsman is great. He is engaging and facilitates discussion well. The course material is also great. You get to both learn about the history of sushi and social movements in Tokyo."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to other studentsI found the class academically stimulating but most importantly very fun.",
                "Yes, and especially if you are interested in citys or Japanese history/culture. Professor Botsman is awesome and makes intentional efforts to build a sense of classroom community. I really loved some of the readings and all of the essays were manageable and enjoyable. As someone more interested in urban planning and contemporary history, I did find myself less engaged when we covered some of the farer back history. Even so, it was cool to take a class on such a specific topic and fascinating city.",
                "Yes absolutely. The class was super interesting, and Professor Botsman is amazing. It gives you a writing credit for relatively little writing but the writing assignments were all interesting. The reading load was manageable and most of the readings were super interesting. The feedback from Professor Botsman was great. With the papers he graded, he would sometimes respond with a whole paragraph telling me more about what I had written, and give me extra sources to read if I was interested. The professor also organised events like multiple movie nights and a class dinner that made the class quite tight knit, and showed just how much Professor Botsman cared.",
                "No",
                "I would only recommend this course to those who are extremely interested in the class. I love history and am a complete history nerd, but those who are really captured by this course should take it.",
                "Not sure - if they are properly interested in Tokyo then yes, definitely, because the course does have a lot of informative readings, but if they are not 100% sure then maybe not just because the class is mainly the readings (the discussions are very focused on them and tend to stall by the end of the meeting times) and so if you're not going to finish say 40 pages on a particular area in Tokyo then there's not that much point taking this course",
                "Yes absolutely! Although it may seem narrow in scope, you will leave with a great sense of themes and history of the city that make you consider the development of any city. The class was one of my favorites of my first semester. You should take it if you can, whether you are interested in Japan, urban studies or just generally history."
