    "This course exposed students to new parameters and concepts to work with as compositional tools. It also provided a forum for the exchange of musical ideas and to learn from professional composers, as well as to develop one's own work.",
    "General improvement of composing skills; learned from several composers; indeterminacy and non-standard notation was a focus for our class assignments",
    "Indeterminate notation and musique-concrte compilation techniques, individual lessons progressing my personal understanding of music",
    "I developed my compositional skills and voice greatly.",

    "The Canvas page was difficult to navigate since both seminars were lumped together into a single page. This made it difficult to find resources and to keep track of assignments.",

    "Yes. This is a great opportunity to work on your music and to be exposed to others' music!",
    "I would definitely recommend this to any student serious about composing. It is very important to learn from a variety of different composers, and it is very special that we can hear from all of these highly-regarded composers in class.",
    "Yes! An invaluable experience for anyone who would like a broader understanding of how and why music is made",
    "Yes! If they are interested in working creatively with music, I would, as it is just the course to experiment with composition and music.",
    "For sure!! Its a great class"
