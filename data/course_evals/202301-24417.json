                "Strengths  super interesting scope of literature and gives a very comprehensive understanding of post-1970s in Japan \r\n\r\nWeaknesses  discussions could have been more guided, not a lot of structuring of classtime",
                "This course is wonderful -- the syllabus is incredibly strong with a variety of books. I really felt like we dove into Japanese literature and learned an abundance.",
                "Strength: Professor Rosa is extremely kind, and the option to do two creative writing assignments instead of academic papers is definitely the best part!\r\nWeakness: I think sometimes the class discussion is not very well organized. It might be better if we were asked to do a reading response before class and then Professor Rosa organized the discussion based on our posts. I also hope there were more content discussion instead of trying to come up with a paper argument.",
                "I think since it was a new course, there were some texts that were stronger than others. That being said, all were valuable! The class overall was structured very well.",
                "Strengths: I really loved the readings for this class and the diverse array of students who signed up for it, especially grad students! The midterm and final project were also so much fun to complete and allowed for creative expression and flexibility. Also, I absolutely loved the creative writing exercises we did in class and wanted to do more of them and to read more of my classmates' work! Weaknesses: I think that we spent a lot of time in class talking about how to close read and write essays, and while this was helpful, we spent less time actually discussing the literature like in a traditional English class. I would have loved to spend more time talking about the readings, some of which we didn't touch on very much. In addition, I would have loved more of the historical/political contextualization that we did at the beginning of the class with the slideshow in order to help tie the readings together.",
                "The class was very well designed, featuring a mix of traditional fiction, poetry, theatre guests, etc. Of course, certain readings werent as well liked, but this isnt as much a weakness of the course.",

                "This is truly one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. The engagement of my fellow students was astounding and this was all due to Professor van Hensbergen selecting incredible texts and facilitating wonderful discussions.",
                "Yes if you're interested in Japanese literature. You may not enjoy every book on the syllabus, but it would be interesting to see what's popular and influential.",
                "Absolutely! The teacher is fantastic and the literature was engaging.",
                "Yes, I would, especially if you are interested in contemporary feminist literature! The readings for this class were so thought-provoking and genuinely fun to read.",
                "Yes, especially if you have an interest in modern Japanese novels.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student in a heartbeat. The syllabus is made up of some great readings, and Professor van Hensbergen works really hard to make sure that the class is enjoyable and that everyone gets to participate. It also allows you to be creative and explore different kinds of writing and critical thought.",
                "YES. Take any class that Rosa teaches. You will not find a professor more dedicated to her students and creating a positive, collaborative environment in her classroom. Going to her class every week was a breath of fresh air amongst the otherwise turbulent stress of Yale. The assigned readings are all fascinating and completely manageable within the time frame of a week. The final project is very open-ended and allows you to experiment with the aspects of creative writing that stood out the most to you during the semester. Rosa's approach to literature discussion feels playful and imaginative, while still rooted in meaningful, critical work. It is a treat to learn from her!",
                "Yes!!!!!! Rosa is one of the best professors Ive had at Yale, she cares deeply about her students and fosters such an amazing classroom space. Be prepared to read a book per week, but it never feels like work!",
                "Would definitely recommend this course to any student willing to read the material. The reading is about 150 pages a week which was a very manageable amount and the reading itself was interesting. The writing is consolidated into bigger papers which allows for more feedback and lower stress. There are occasionally weekly writings but those are also low stress and casual. Besides the workload being manageable, the class discussions are fairly interesting and the activities we do in class make sure that it does not become just discussing the reading every day."
