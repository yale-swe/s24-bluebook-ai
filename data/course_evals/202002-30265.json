    "I learned more about modern art, a field I was previously lacking in. It was also nice to have a global look at art, instead of focusing exclusively on European\/American art. The class about Mexican Muralism was one of my favorites. This class also helped me with my close-looking skills, especially with online images rather than works of art in person.",

    "modern art history, the meanings of modernism",
    "We learned about modern art movements between the 1860s and 1920s."

   "comments": [
    "A strength is definitly the intersectionality and global nature of the course, allowing us as students to view the art in new and interesting ways, even if we have experience looking at works before. Another would be the splitting up of the three-hour blocks into lecture, activity, and discussion\r\n\r\nIt's always a challenge to take classes online, especially classes that were supposed to have a museum component. I would have liked it if we utilized museums more, such as we did in the Mexican Muralism\/Latin American art class, perhaps with more guidance from the professor.\r\n\r\nAlso, because we missed a class early on, our paper schedule was even more compressed than previously. That was rough.",
    "Online learning was tough for me",
    "strengths: time was broken up, consistent assignments \r\n\r\nweaknesses: a long time on zoom",
    "I found the class interesting and engaging. The reading load was manageable, and the long class time was broken up with different activities that made it easier to stay focused."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's a great class for looking at modern art in a global context. There's a lot of critical thinking about how art is conventionally taught. I would recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in the years 1870 to 1950, as even beyond art, it provides a way to look at the \"modern period\" through the lens of culture.",
    "Yes, the professor was great and it was a nice way to learn about modern art but the online format was difficult and I think the class would be much better in person.",
    "highly recommend because Mia was very good",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to familiarize themselves with the ideologies and artists that made up modernist movements."
