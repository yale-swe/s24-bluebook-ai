                "Learned about Eastern Europe! a bunch of stuff that I really should have known and now I do!",
                "Excellent introduction to Eastern European history. Lots of focus on WWII, Cold War, and end of communism.",
                "I gained greater insight into the major themes and developments of Eastern European history and, by extension, global history since 1914. Specific attention is paid to drawing historical parallels between the present moment and the case studies of the past.",
                "Learned everything about Eastern Europe",
                "I learned about the history of Eastern Europe through the first and second World Wars, the interwar period, the rise and fall of communism, and post-communist states.",
                "Snyder's course on Eastern Europe has been the most enlightening history class I have ever taken.  He has helped me change the way I consider history avoiding the mirage of inevitability, instead examining how things that happened easily might not have.",
                "You gain a lot of insight into the region and gain a better sense how to think about history.",
                "We drew broad themes and arguments from a huge array of related, but highly-specific political and social case studies. I feel like an expert in the ethos of Eastern Europe, with some fun and horrifying anecdotes that support it. I learned to read selectively, because there was a lot of readingbut the amount of reading depends upon the culture of your section.",
                "In this course, we learned about how interwar and postwar Eastern Europe functioned and why it was that history developed there in the way that it did. While this content on its own makes the course worth taking, the really incredible parts were when we analyzed the meta questions of historical inquiry. Professor Snyder emphasizes the role of contingency in history, and coming to appreciate why things like WW2 or the rise of communism in the eastern bloc happened without leaning on the bizarre sonderweg that so often passes for history in the popular imagination. The literary readings, especially borowski, were indispensable in challenging us to examine the historians craft.",
                "I learned a great deal of content-woohoo, but that is secondary to how to think about history in an analytical, dare I say, scientific mode. The comparative method is emphasized because there are so many countries to cover. It allows you to consider VARIABLES of historical development and their relative significance.",
                "Went in not knowing much about Eastern Europe; left with an understanding of the modern history of the region.",
                "An in-depth understanding of the failure of democracy, the peasant question,  the rise and fall of communism, and the post-cold war order in Eastern Europe in the century. Also, strong historical reasoning skills, and a greater appreciation for history.",
                "a much more versatile view on the history of Europe as a whole",
                "Analysis of primary and secondary sources, the workings if communism in eastern europe",
                "We covered the history of Eastern Europe, focusing on the years between 1918 and 1991 (with a little at the end about post-1991). I would say we focused on the western part of Eastern Europe: Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, as well as the USSR. The main themes were the collapse of democracy in the interwar years, the disaster of WWII, the communist takeovers, the communist era, and the fall of communism.",
                "I learned how to read a lot, synthesize the information, understand important historical events. And learned a ton about Eastern Europe.",
                "This class developed many skills important for looking at and trying to unravel history. We learned to logic about motivations and intentions in history and to predict consequences of actions. We also learned a lot about the process of writing and understanding history as an ontological being.",
                "This was a great class for learning more about Eastern European history and learning about the national question.",
                "I gained an appreciation of recent Eastern European history that has allowed me to analyze and connect current day affairs in the region much more clearly",
                "Despite coming from Eastern Europe myself, I learned a ton about Eastern European history from Professor Snyder. An incredible class, one of my favorite",
                "This class gave me a detailed and complex view of the history of Eastern Europe. It blended the study of broad patterns and details to provide a rich picture of the goings on, providing me with the analytical skills to study history in a nuanced way without losing track of specifics. This class was particularly interesting in this moment as Snyder adapted the material covered to follow and explain the origin of the crisis in Ukraine. His discussion of historical patterns and the purpose of studying history was fascinating and engaged directly with current topics.",
                "Pretty detailed look at major moments and movements of Eastern Europe after 1914.",
                "Through this course, I gained a very deep understanding of the history of Eastern Europe. We learned in detail about all of the transformations and struggles that the countries of this region went through during the interwar period, World War II, and the Cold War, up until the present day. This course really gave me a much deeper insight into the history of this time period, beyond anything that I knew before. We also talked a lot about the current crisis in Ukraine and how we can use the history of the country and the history of the Soviet Union to understand what is happening.",
                "Writing, reading, and critical analysis of historic sources",
                "I developed a lot of knowledge about Eastern Europe -- the class was great.",
                "I developed knowledge about Eastern European history, state formation, and communism.",
                "So much! Very different perspective on 20th European history in general, better understanding of the conditions that made WWII possible, better understanding of the trajectory of 20th century communism",
                "This course was a really interesting survey of Eastern Europe during what was a complicated time in almost every nation and definitely one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Every lecture was fascinating, and the reading was tough  but was essentially a prelude to lecture  it was particularly valuable when lecture was complex.",
                "Incredible overview of the Easter Europe in the 20th century and beginning of the 21st! It helped a lot to understand the history of the region in the context of all countries and not isolated examples.",
                "Learned so much about 20th century Eastern Europe from a historical, humanitarian, philosophical, and literary perspective. Learned about the failure of post-WWI Eastern European democracies in the 1920s-1930s after the Great Depression, and the subsequent power struggle between Fascism and Communism during WWII. Learned about how changing interpretations of Marxism defined Soviet rule over Eastern Europe in the post-WWII world order, up until the fall of communism in the region in 1989. Learned how ideology was used to carry out acts of mass atrocity. Learned how recent history relates to current crises in the region. Probably one of the most enlightening lecture courses at Yale."

                "Snyder is a super awesome lecturer, the best I've ever had.  I think the reading for the course is not manageable and people end up not doing all of it - I think making the load more reasonable and choosing the readings that you actually need everyone to read to be a good citizen would be better.",
                "Strengths: great professor, good assessment format, interesting information\r\nWeaknesses: too heavy on reading",
                "The course demands a high commitment but is well worth the investment. I have gained valuable insight into East European history that will benefit me in whatever career I choose to pursue.",
                "Readings for the course are extremely taxing. The selection of readings is a variety of very in-depth selections on extremely specific subtopics of the course. In total, I would estimate that 3,000 pages were assigned over the entirety of the course. This was simply impractical,  most of the TFs admitted to not completing all the readings. In the end, most students did not complete any readings because it is simply overwhelming.",
                "Professor Snyder is a true expert on the subject, and it was great to hear him speak about it (and especially relevant now given the invasion of Ukraine). Administratively, however, this course could have used more support. I had Covid in February, and this was the only class that had zero accommodations for sick students. I understand that Dr. Snyder wants us to learn non-digitally, but I thought it was unfair that there was no way for me to listen to the lectures I missed while sick.",
                "This course is the best I have taken at Yale.  It should not be changed; it is near perfection.  One of the only weaknesses is the sheer amount of reading, which is hard to keep up with.",
                "The professor is great",
                "Strength: Snyder is an incredible lecturer. Funny and engaging. The subject was super relevant, given the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, or Snyder can make the lessons of Eastern Europe relevant.\r\nWeakness: The exams are not a great evaluation of learning, the chronology assignment was vague, and workload depends entirely upon your section. Snyder teaches his arguments as facts which is fascinating, just be aware and unafraid to contradict them.",
                "Professor Snyder is an extremely engaging lecturer and he ties together all of his lectures well.",
                "The course has a very engaging lecture core, but the readings assigned in the first half of the semester were a bit much.",
                "I think an edited reading list would help. It's difficult to know which readings to do since some are actually important/interesting and some are redundant and really dry. The exams are quite jam-packed but you have very little time.",
                "I didn't feel like the discussion sections were necessary for a better understanding of the material, although the content itself and Snyder's lectures were fascinating",
                "Strengths: the teacher, the TA, the assignments \r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: Prof. Snyder is a great lecturer. The lectures were engaging and interesting, with a good mix of going over events to talking about trends. Since I took this class during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we spent a couple days just talking about that, and it was amazing to get to hear Professor Snyder's expert analysis. Some of the readings felt a little boring or over-specific, but Professor Snyder's books were excellent. I liked the chronology as the final project.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: In my opinion, the exams were too much writing in too little time. Two essays and a short essay in 50 minutes is really difficult, and I left both exams worried that I hadn't put enough detail into my essays--not because I didn't know enough, but because I didn't have enough time to write everything I wanted to.",
                "Best course I've taken at Yale so far. Super interesting course work, amazing TAs, great lectures.",
                "The course is strong in developing an understanding of Eastern European history in an approachable way for students who may not have experience with such classes. Timothy Snyder is an excellent lecturer who knows how to communicate salient points in relevant and meaningful ways. \r\n\r\nThe course is a lot of reading and work so sometimes things fall through the cracks, this can be bothersome at times.",
                "The course was great, but there was a lot of unncessary reading I thought that made it a bit stressful",
                "The lectures were great, Im not sure I would change much.",
                "The class is outstanding. I learned about the history not as a collection of dates but as a process.",
                "This course outlines an incredible amount of material which makes it dynamic and interesting but occasionally hard to follow. The lectures are already interesting and clear, but the information hand outs feel somewhat disconnected from the content. It could potentially be helpful to have slightly more accurate names and dates per lecture or make edited versions available on the canvas page. It was difficult to follow this course when in quarantine (hopefully an issue specific to this semester), so recordings or uploaded versions of the lectures and handouts would be helpful. Additionally, because it can be occasionally difficult to follow chronologically in lecture, it would be helpful to go over the broad-strokes timeline in section to make sure events are in order.",
                "This course needs a paper, but Snyder is the best lecturer at Yale.",
                "Professor Snyder is a wonderful lecturer and the class is very interesting and I learned a lot from it. However, at times, the amount of readings can be very overwhelming on top of other classes and I think that it takes away from learning the material. I also think we spent a lot of time talking about the current war in Ukraine, which I really appreciated, but it meant that we had to listen to a lot of the lectures outside of class on top of the readings and weekly section assignments.",
                "Amazing professor and TAs, spectacular curriculum",
                "I think the course could be improved by changing the final project to be an essay instead of the chronology, but besides that it was a great course.",
                "End of the class felt a little rushed, wish we could have spent more time with the end of communism",
                "Snyder is the best lecturer I've had at Yale. This semester the Russian invasion of Ukraine overshadowed every discussion in the course. Snyder placed these events in context and always had a profound insight after the study of history for the present day. The weakness of the course is the reading selection. I will openly admit that I love course readings, but the readings for this course felt more applicable to doctoral oral examinations rather than an undergraduate survey course. Many readings in the course packet left me with perhaps the worst question to have after reading: why did I read this? This alleviated during the second half of the course with an introduction of a primary source reader. But the first half could benefit from a more tailored reading list.",
                "This course was great  the exams are a serious time crunch and the final project is a massive amount of work, but I left with a huge array of knowledge and general understanding of the region that I didn't have before. The reading is frankly unmanageable, particularly if your courseload is heavy, but you definitely learn how to pick and choose and decipher what is important material  an important skill for any college student. The lectures are hugely entertaining, Snyder is an amazing storyteller.",
                "Professor Snyder is the best lecturer you will ever find! He is amazing and I his lectures were highlights of my weeks. I think the reading assignments were definitely on the heavy side. Especially because I felt like all the readings were super important, but it is incredibly hard to read all of them every week.",
                "Strengths: Professor Snyder's lectures are objectively fantastic, and he has such unique insights into an underappreciated aspect of contemporary history. I learned SO MUCH in this class. Most of the readings (especially the books by the Professor) are extremely interesting and helpful in reinforcing the lecture content if you actually invest the time in reading them (which I recommend, even though you can do well without doing much of the readings). The exams are pretty straightforward if you attend lectures and pay attention, and my TF was very chill. || Weaknesses: The reading load is quite large, so much so that nobody actually reads all of the assigned readings per week. Maybe reducing the weekly reading load could make it more approachable for students to actually tackle. The online course packet is very difficult to navigate because it is so long that even scrolling through to find a week's assigned reading takes forever (there is no other convenient way to access a specific week's reading because there is no table of contents). Also, section was often not that useful, even though our TF was pretty cool.",
                "The lecture for this course were fantastic! All the material was interesting and one of the strengths of this course was seeing how historical events fit into broader patterns. However, there was a lot of reading and bits of it occasionally felt unnecessary since we never discussed some of the readings. Maybe decreasing the number of pages of reading per week but requiring some kind of more in-depth discussion would be helpful.",
                "Great professor and very interesting lectures. Only weakness is that it was way too much reading.",
                "Reading should be filtered. Students end up doing 20% of total assigned readings because of the workload."

                "I would definitely recommend!! Time Snyder is an absolute gem at Yale and Eastern Europe has a rich history.  Snyder is amazing at showing how history applies to today, the ways in which we're in history.  Really can't say enough good stuff about him.  His exams also ask exactly what you think they will, which makes them very reasonable.  I actually never did the reading and did well in the class, so don't worry about the huge workload, it's not exactly essential.  I would just recommend keeping aware of what everyone else is reading and if Snyder says something is a big deal, read it (ie power of the powerless, here in our Auschwitz)",
                "Yes, not too intense on writing for non-humanities majors. Heavy on reading, but engaging lectures, interesting topic and assessments were challenging but not unfair.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student regardless of their general interest in history. Professor Snyder's lectures were well-structured, engaging, and immensely relevant to current events in Eastern Europe.",
                "I would recommend this course to students regardless of the focus of their historical interest. Since Eastern Europe has played such a fundamental role in determining the course of global history, this course proves valuable in whatever capacity students are interested.",
                "This is an important course in terms of its content, but the readings are intense (both in quantity and emotionally -- assigning 100 pages about genocide to read in two days is difficult). Exams are graded somewhat leniently, but feedback is unclear and additional assignment workload varies drastically from one TA to another. I suppose it's not that difficult to get an A, even if you don't do all the readings, but I regret not doing Cr/D/F.",
                "Yes for anyone who likes history, it is the pinnacle of Yale's offerings.  For anyone who isn't sure, it'll convince you that history is paramount.",
                "Definitely take this course if you like history",
                "Yes. It's fun for me to sit in lecture, to read books (and there are a lot of books and primary sources to read  if you choose to do so), and think about history. It could be a very chill workload and Snyder is a funny, astute lecturer. Eastern Europe itself is also intense funny and freaky. The class makes me feel historically competent, which is nice.",
                "Absolutely. This is an iconic course with an iconic Professor here at Yale. I am glad that I was able to take both parts of this course, but even if you didnt take Eastern Europe to 1914, you should definitely take this one. You will be glad that you took it.",
                "Definitely. I am not a history major but loved every minute of this course. The content is very relevant to today's geopolitical conflicts.",

                "Definitely, and if you don't have the time to take the class, I recommend reading Prof. Snyder's books. I knew very little about Eastern Europe coming into this class, and I left with a much better understanding of the region. Professor Snyder is so knowledgeable that it's really interesting to hear him analyze the region, both historically and with connections to the present. We spent multiple classes talking about the war in Ukraine, which were a great distillation of everything that was going on and also taught me things I hadn't seen mentioned in the news. It's a considerable amount of reading (maybe an average of 150 pages per week), but it's manageable if you plan your time well.\r\n\r\nI took this course without taking the previous semester (HIST 263, covering Eastern Europe before 1914), and Professor Snyder gave enough background in the first few lectures that I was totally fine.",
                "Absolutely - best class I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes! It is incredibly well taught and really uncovers a world not really covered in other American curricula.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student because it was very interesting and Snyder is a great lecturer.",
                "I would, the workload was manageable and lecture was always worth attending.",
                "Definitely. Professor Snyder is a legendary professor.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It provides valuable knowledge regarding topics otherwise not covered in standard American education, and no prior knowledge is necessary. The material is interesting and complex and the lectures are engaging. The workload is substantial, but worth it and section makes the material easier to grasp.",
                "Yeahyou dont know enough about this area. You also didnt take full advantage of Yale unless you take a Snyder class.",
                "I would recommend this class if you are interested in Eastern Europe. This course will give you a very detailed understanding of this region of the world. However, I would warn that you should be prepared to do a lot more work for this class than for other classes. There is a lot of reading that can really add up if you are taking other reading-heavy classes and you are expected to do weekly assignments for sections, whether that be answering some questions in paragraph format or writing essays.",
                "Yes -- it was a great course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
                "Yes, great class",
                "Yes! Very coherent overview of the broad sweep of Eastern European history.",
                "Yes. Regardless of interests or major, Snyder has become one of the must-take professors at Yale.",
                "Take this class! The lectures are amazing, the material is fascinating, and you can put as much into it as you want and still end up with a good grade. And learning from Professor Snyder is an incredible opportunity.",
                "Absolutely!!! Take this course, it will be the best thing that will happen to you. It does not require any background knowledge in the history of the Eastern European region and some of the insights are truly life-changing.",
                "100% yes, I would recommend this course! It has definitely been my favorite class so far at Yale, solely because of the amazing lectures given by Professor Snyder. He's one of the world's leading experts in this subject, so if you are interested in history in any way, do yourself a favor and take this class. This class has made me want to take more classes in the Russian and Eastern European Studies department in the coming years. While the class does have some organizational flaws, the lectures are so good that the class is still worth it (and the exams and chronology timeline are pretty straightforward if you go to class and pay attention, so it is a relatively stress-free class).",
                "I would recommend this course to almost anyone. Timothy Snyder is a fantastic professor and gives some of the most interesting lectures I've ever been to. He clearly is an expert in the history of Eastern Europe, and even as someone who has never studied history before I got a lot out of this class.",
                "Yes, a must take course with one of the best lecturers at Yale.",
                "Definitely.",
                "Definitely. Snyder is an incredible professor and the material is very relevant to our time."
