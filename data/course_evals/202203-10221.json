                "Good introduction to the journalism industry, basics of journalism that feel reliable beyond what I had picked up here and there working for different publications. Profile and long-form story aren't overwhelming but are good processes. Good discussion and Brill offers lots of expertise and experience",
                "I learned a lot about journalism as a practice. Less about writing but a lot about how to be a journalist and the current state of the business",

                "Strengths: very practical knowledge for people interested in journalism, interesting assignments/ readings\r\nWeaknesses: the class discussions could be a bit more interactive and engaging, Brill is a little terrifying but means well",
                "This course was wonderful. No weaknesses! The strengths would definitely be the readings on the syllabus  I deeply enjoyed all of them. I also appreciated the priority placed on thoughtful and GOOD written pieces. We aren't churning out short little journalism articles; instead, you focus on writing well.",
                "Strengths -- interesting people, discussion, good intro to industry and practice of journalism\r\nWeakness -- It makes sense structurally but sometimes feels like classes are pretty similar and you forget what each individual class on the syllabus was supposed to be about",
                "Professor Brill is easy to reach outside of class and very helpful.",
                "Strength: Steven Brill is a truly remarkable journalist--it is a privilege to learn the craft from him. Likewise, he is particularly dedicated to students and makes himself available whenever students have questions or would like to discuss their projects. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the readings are a missed opportunity. The class does not require many readings; nor do we discuss thoroughly what we do read. Also, the syllabus promised at least one trip to New York to meet with professional journalists, which did not happen.",
                "Strengths: The readings were varied and interesting and I learned a lot through the peer profile and final reporting project assignments.  Apart from learning about journalism, I was also able to read about a lot of interesting topics that I hadn't explored before.  Lastly, Prof. Brill is very accessible and gives helpful writing feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: In class, it felt like everyone was talking to the professor and not to each other.  Prof. Brill cold calls at times which I don't mind, but class sessions felt more like a test and not very collaborative.",
                "The course is clearly organized and the readings are manageable. We also had enough time to work on every assignment, which was lovely.",
                "Professor Brill is knowledgeable and an excellent journalist with much skill to share. \r\n\r\nSometimes the readings didn't feel relevant to class."

                "I would recommend this course to another student, but only if they are seriously interested in journalism. This course is very useful for deciding whether or not journalism is a viable career path. Professor Brill's insights into the industry are very valuable.",
                "Yes! If you want an introduction to journalism or to explore more deeply, this class is for you. Professor Brill is a bit strict and takes some getting used to, but I think most people grow to really like and appreciate him and he certainly cares about his students.",
                "Only if you really like journalism and are willing to put in the work. I interviewed 30+ people for my final project and spent so much time on it, but it made me realize what I wanted out of journalism and what I personally could contribute to the field. Professor Brill is a little daunting but if you pretend not to be scared then hes not scary. At least, thats what a former student told me and Ive been living by that. Also great readings in this class, especially the healthcare-related ones. Dont be daunted by this being cross-listed as PLSC, I am most definitely not a poli sci major and survived during discussions.",
                "If you can get in, yes!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is relatively new to journalism and would like to learn about how to practice it effectively.  If you already have some experience with journalism, I don't know how helpful this course would be to you unless you are interested in the Yale Journalism Scholar designation.",
                "Not particularly  the professors view of journalism seemed to be archaic and influenced the type of environment cultivated in the classroom. The students were competing for which of their opinions most reflected Brills and Woodwards (at a point). The classroom environment did not cultivate opportunities for free thought. Most of the students are also of similar backgrounds, so they did not view this as an issue. Previous feedback on the course framed Brills teaching as a taste of the real world when it seemed unnecessary negative at times. This type of feedback can bring down morale instead of boosting it. This approach seems to be a relic of the old world of journalism. Though Brills support for journalism at Yale is commendable, other courses can provide more useful feedback and insight into modern day journalism than this one. Students should look deeply into Brills teaching style before considering this course. This was one of my less rewarding experiences at Yale.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in journalism at all. You'll learn about the nitty-gritty of how to be a journalist, as well as the business side of it.",
                "Yes -- if you're interested in journalism. If you're interested in general creative writing, I would try a different course -- not as a slight, but just because it might be better aligned with your goals."
