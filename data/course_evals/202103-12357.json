                "This class provided insight into a variety of biochemical approaches to study the environmental and climate change. This was done though lectures and discussions, a hybrid that was very successful.",
                "A great introduction to so many different issues that are contributing to climate change, with great tie ins to molecular biochemistry as well. If you are looking for a class based on your environmental interests that relates to your own fields of study this is a great seminar to take.",
                "This course emphasized the research surrounding the biochemical principles involved in climate change. We learned how to analyze research papers and how our research could be used to study climate change.",
                "This was my first time looking closely at the various issues emerging from climate change. Outside of greenhouse gases and pesticides potentially causing infertility, most every article was news to me. I learned about ways architecture can help address climate change and the ways various life-forms are being impacted by the climate change. Perhaps the most insightful thing was that trees form underground root networks to exchange nutrients.",
                "I learned about the intersection between biochemistry and climate change.",
                "I gained a better understanding of how biochemical processes influence both the organisms affected by climate change and the solutions scientists develop to combat it.",
                "This class was a really cool survey of different biochemical topics that are up-and-coming in climate sciences. The main skill that we developed and exercised was thinking critically about scientific papers and procedures, and we spent a lot of time in class talking about how to design new experiments or improve others.",
                "I gained a lot of knowledge on the biochemical foundations of various concepts related to climate change, such as temperature-controlled responses in organisms, methane production from the meat industry, and sustainable architecture. This course also helped develop my ability to read and think scientifically about experiments and papers, challenging me to question the motive behind every action rather than deferring to the authority of the authors. Additionally, I also learned how to write a mini-review for the first time, and I gained more confidence in my own scientific writing skills."

            "comments": [
                "Was great material in theory to learn! Wonderful explorations of the topics in non-classroom settings\r\nSuper disorganized :( which makes sense because it's the first time but that in combination with occasional stringent grading doesn't make the most sense",
                "One strength is the alternating lecture-discussion formatI really liked the general background info that we learned in lecture, but it was really nice to get experience reading and discussing papers in section, especially because previous biochem courses don't really focus on paper-reading. I loved how small the class was because it made discussion much less nerve-wracking, and we got a lot of good feedback on assignments. The final paper and mid-term paper were also really great for pushing us to explore biochemical applications to climate change on our own and learn to design experiments/synthesize information!",
                "I think a strength of this course is that we looked at biochemically-related climate change topics, learning and researching about mechanisms that are either directly impacted by or could aid in combating against climate change. However, this was not as clear going into classes; most of the class time is dedicated to being a book club with different scientific papers tangentially related to the week's topic. Also, it seems that different components were pulled from other classes/other professors without specifically tailoring to the objectives/focus of the course.",
                "This class was great! I believe one of the perceived weaknesses was actually its greatest strength. Professor Neugebauer, while not an expert as she confessed, used this fact to cultivate an atmosphere where all felt comfortable engaging and sharing ideas. Additionally, the honesty and flexibility she brought to teaching the class alleviated a lot of the apprehension of taking a new class in its first year.",
                "Amazing class, especially considering it was in its first run. It was well structured in a manner to allow for individual thinking as well as guided discussion for discussion sections and lectures were particularly interesting as well. Perhaps could have had more guidance or discussion on assignments in class but both the professor and TF are very approachable individually!",
                "I enjoyed the first few weeks of this course the most. Tuesday's would be \"chalk talk\" type lectures followed by a journal club discussion on Thursdays. I think the later lectures in the course could have been more effective my structuring them around a single biochemical principle, having an in-depth discussion on the mechanism, and then connecting it to a climate issue. By the end, the lectures had too many ideas thrown into one lecture where it felt like we couldn't dive deep enough into the content.",
                "The feedback on written assignments, group discussions, and field trips were the strongest aspects of the course.",
                "I love how diverse the topics covered in class were. I also really enjoyed the field trips, such as going to the architecture firm and going to the Marsh gardens.",
                "A major strength of the course was that the material engaged was on the cutting edge of science. Almost everything covered was developed in the last decade. A weakness of the course was its lack of organization and lack of space to brainstorm or explore new solutions. It often felt that the class sacrificed its creativity to remain within the bounds of the assignments. I wish a significant portion of class time was devoted to creating potential solutions.",
                "Some major strengths of the course include the selection of topics that we covered, Karla and Saras engagement and enthusiasm for the course, and the Thursday small group journal club. All of these contributed to my furthering of scientific learning significantly! In terms of weaknesses, I wish that we had learned some of the mechanisms and biochemical reactions/cycles in a more systematic and thorough way. I felt like most of these topics, like covering the Shikimate pathway or nitrogen fixation, was covered in a more topical and cursory way, and I left class often wanting to know more.",
                "One of the greatest strengths of this course was Professor Neugebauer's passion and excitement. I could tell that she truly cared about the topics and how climate change is threatening our world, so her lectures were always very engaging and pertinent. The field trips to the Marsh gardens and the architecture firm were also great additions to the lectures since they helped us visualize and see lecture topics in practice. I also really enjoyed the discussion aspect of the course, since rarely do I have the opportunity to discuss research methods and experimentation with my peers, and it was exciting to see my own experiences in the lab transfer over to helping me better understand the papers we read. Another huge strength of the course was the classroom community. I felt as if I really did become closer to many of my classmates in the same discussion section as me, and the atmosphere was always so welcoming and encouraging. In terms of the workload, I thought it was very manageable and reasonable, and I actually really enjoyed both the mini-review and the proposal. \r\n\r\nOne minor weakness of the course was the confusion surrounding the mini-review. Through talking to my classmates, I think most of us had never written a mini-review before, so we were a little confused as to what was expected, especially since there was no clear rubric. However, after talking to Professor Neugebauer and addressing my questions, everything became very easy to understand, so I think providing clearer guidelines in advance will be very helpful for future students. I know that Professor Neugebauer noticed this as well since we were given very clear instructions and expectations for our final proposal, which I really appreciated. Another small weakness also associated with the mini-review was that feedback on topic selection was a little delayed. This didn't end up posing a problem for me since mine was approved, but I know that some of my friends had to rush to find a new topic and we were all hesitant to start writing before we received feedback. \r\n\r\nOverall, I thought this course was taught wonderfully despite being new! There was always very clear communication between Professor Neugebauer and the students, everything felt very organized, and it is easily my favorite MB&B class I've taken so far!"

For anyone who is interested in learning more about biochemistry beyond a formal biochemistry course, or in developing paper-reading/critiquing skills, or interested in general climate change issues/how to combat climate change, this is the perfect course. Super interesting, relevant material, and a really engaging class! Also sometimes there are field trips!",
                "Yes! This class is so interesting and covers such a variety of biochemical research that is not often discussed in other MB&B classes as most others are medically focused.",
                "Yes. Especially for those interested in global climate and environmental change who wish to see the issue in a different lens that could be more applicable to your own field of study! Well taught and leads to many different things to look into as well as opportunities to do so as well.",
                "I really enjoyed this seminar, especially the Thursday journal clubs. One downside was that we did not get much feedback on essays and outlines, so it was difficult to know how to improve your writing.",
                "Yes. The course is a great survey of climate change issues, and offers students the chance to research, present, and receive peer feedback on biochemical issues pertinent to climate change.",
                "Yes, i would recommend this course to another student because it was an interesting upper level biochemistry class.",
                "Not in its current form.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student with a sufficient biochemistry background! The material is genuinely engaging and so pertinent with regard to the current state of the environment, and Professor Neugebauer is delightful. There is a good mix of instructional styles, including lectures, discussion sections, and field trips, so I think this course will appeal to a wide variety of students. The atmosphere of the class is also very encouraging, and it felt like my classmates and I were on a learning journey together since most of us had very little exposure to the biochemistry behind various climate topics. I also quite enjoyed both of the major assignments and felt like they did push me to grow as a scientist. Finally, Professor Neugebauer's mission of trying to promote an interdisciplinary approach to addressing climate change is extremely relevant, and I would love to see more biochemistry students get involved with climate research in the future."
