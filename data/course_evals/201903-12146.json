    "I think having more deadlines\/structure could be helpful in encouraging everyone to make progress on their scripts.",
    "This course is workshop-style, which is helpful when people have things to present to the class, however I think that the course can be strengthened in the moment when no one has pages to present to the course. While most everyone in the class has taken other screenwriting classes over the course of their time at Yale, for many of us this is the first time writing a feature-length script and it would be helpful to have more in-depth conversations that cover the basics of story structure before we are expected to write. While much of the learning in this course comes from watching movies that have been made, I believe it would be helpful to have more conversations about character arcs in films and how to go from idea to the page. I think there is an expectation in this class that the students are able and ready to dive headfirst into writing, though I think many of us could have benefitted from some basics before we were meant to be writing pages and pitching full outlines."
