I learnt about the layered methods of space making, mapping marginalized spaces and the combination of human relations and power dynamics that go into the mix of space making. This course was useful in expanding my perspective!",

                "Race, Space, and Power taught me how to see spaces as more than just physical sites, but as mental, physical, and social places in which power struggles exist. Learning to look at how race and power dynamics play out within spaces taught me to see how historical structures/practices instituted during the European colonization of African and South American countries continue to influence the racial and socioeconomic injustices that continue throughout much of the world today. This course helped me to learn to look deeper into the root causes of much of the systemic injustices present in the world today.",
                "This class was incredible! I appreciated learning about different countries and reading different works about race from non-US scholars. I think the course was important to my understanding of space and race in different non-US contexts and learning about different forms of resistance against colonial structures of oppression."

                "I particularly enjoyed this course, as Prof. Leslie was very engaging and provided a space where learning was not only fun but extremely interactive. Her syllabus was a mix of theory and case studies which helped apply the theory into more practical aspects. Prof. Leslie was very dedicated in the making of the syllabus which reflected really well not only in her seminars but it also helped us students  be really engaged in our breakout room conversations.",
                "This course had a reasonable workload with readings that were relevant to both the course and the world. Many of the weeks' readings discussed topics that both aided in furthering my understanding of the intersections of race and power within spaces and allowed me to apply that understanding to current issues like the BLM movement and the racially unjust systems in place in the US. The writing assignments were also very manageable and encouraged students to provide personal and academic reflections on the themes of the course and how they apply to the world. One thing in this course that could be improved is receiving more feedback on the writing responses. The professor would respond with questions to our assignments that were helpful in pushing our thinking further, but it would also be nice to receive feedback on how well our responses connect with the themes of the class.",

Also, at the end of every class, all students would unmute to say goodbye, which also helped foster a sense of community.",

This course really helped shape my worldview and see my experiences from a different perspective, and I can honestly say it was one of the very best classes I have ever taken at Yale. Even the class environment in and of itself was collaborative, helpful, and supportive. I felt like I knew my classmates better than I have many times before at Yale, in person! That's all thanks to our professor and how well she organized the course, as well as the positive energy my classmates brought every week to the virtual space. I feel so grateful to have been a part of this class experience.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. The content of the class draws on historical and analyses of non-American places (for the most part), as well as more recently published works, that help to build the themes of this class that can be applied to current issues outside of the academic setting. This class shows a new way to approach and think about systemic, racial injustices that are extremely relevant to the world today.",
                "Yes! Professor Gross-Wyrtzen was amazing and her class provided an alternative perspective to race-space relations. If you would like to learn about race and space-making outside of the US I would recommend this class because it shows you different modes of resistance and what work non-US scholars are doing in other countries."
