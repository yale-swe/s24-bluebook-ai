                "Critical thinking, broadened my horizons in architecture and art, modern history, learned many interesting facts.",
                "I have thoroughly developed my discussion and critical thinking skills. I learned to be more concise and eloquent when it comes to presenting my ideas in front of class. I also became a more thorough thinker, if that makes any sense. I was forced to question things and look at subjects from lenses I would not have even imagined, which in turn helped me become more engaged with the world around me.",
                "Think critically about cities, their organization, and how it affects the people in them. Less discussion of formal architecture and more discussion of artistic elements of cities.",
                "We read about and discussed the architecture, urbanism, history, and politics of New Haven, Berlin, Tokyo, New Orleans, Abidjan, and Los Angeles. We also learnt about the situationist city, the commons, nature and its connection to architecture, and so on. There were three main assignments: a (non-academic) paper on any building at Yale\/in New Haven, an individual collage\/drawing project about the just city, and a group collage\/drawing project about our hometowns. I came in as a CS major but this class really transformed my views and made me realize that I could actually pursue what Im truly interested in and become an architecture major.",
                "I learned about how architecture can play a role in not only defining the city, but also in shaping the lives of its inhabitants.\r\nI also learned how cities can shape the development of individuals, in terms of priorities, values, and experiences.",
                "I learned more about the architecture of the world, important places and people, and the relationship between culture and cities. This class has quite a lot to offer. I was able to strengthen my ability to read into the deeper meaning of images just by visualizing and making connections.",
                "This course provided exposure to art, architecture, the built environment\/landscape, and city design and development through exploring different cities around the world that have been influenced by social and political factors. The class helped me gain vocabulary in describing architecture trends and designs as well as encouraged me to expand my knowledge through research papers, collages, and presentations."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of the course are in the fact that it is taught in a seminar, which forces us to engage with one another and exchange our ideas. I would perhaps give the discussions a little bit more structure. I would have also benefitted from having to prove in a certain way my knowledge of the readings, because since we only had to read to discuss I did not feel as compelled to engage too deeply with a lot of the readings. I think the course would also be improved if the professor gave us concrete feedback for assignments.",
                "Amazing course with an amazing professor. Would love if there was slightly more guidance on the assignments during the semester.",
                "Strength: Surry is a brilliant professor and it really shows in the way he leads the discussions in seminar and when he critiques your work. The assignments are really good introductions to the field of architecture. Our TA Yuqing was also really helpful in office hours. The film screenings and field trip and final crit were all fun and supportive environments and I felt really welcomed and at home at the architecture school.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I would like to study more Asian cities or at least more interesting Western cities instead of New Haven, Abidjan, and New Orleans. Objectively it was a pretty good selection of cities though and the modules were well-organized.",
                "Strengths: Discussions were engaging, taught me how to analyze collages\/architecture pieces. Weaknesses: Oftentimes 20-50% of the readings weren't discussed in class. I hope that in both sessions in the week we could discuss the entirety of the readings and connect them to the art pieces\/photographs.",
                "The strengths of this course was the arrangement. It was organized around a set of slides with well-selected images such that it allowed us to share open interpretations. It also fostered meaningful conversations, through which we could apply experiences from our different hometowns.",
                "The strengths of this course would be the constant group talks, which push your thinking. It opens your mind to see the bigger picture rather than a narrow road.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that there are any weaknesses to this course; the only weakness I believe it has is how long the class is. When class is over, I get excited to attend the next class due to how engaging this course is.",
                "This course is so wonderful at presenting art and architecture in an approachable way where students feel encouraged and supported to voice their observations and analyze urban landscapes and design through discussion."

                "Yes, absolutely!! I found the material observed very interesting.",
                "Yes! It does not only cater to students interested in architecture or urban studies. The way we were talking about science, religion, philosophy, and sociology in a course that was focused on architecture is truly exciting.",
                "Yes, especially if you love art and\/or urban studies.",
                "Definitely! A great way to build interest in architecture and discover the importance of architectural design in past and contemporary societies.",
                "Yes; this was my favorite class of the semester. Beware that a lot of the discussion and readings will be about art, philosophy, aesthetics, social justice, activism, etc. and not just architecture and urban studiesbut thats a brilliant introduction to the field of architecture and urban studies and interested majors should absolutely rank it as their #1 first-year seminar. Grading is generous like any other first-year seminar.",
                "If you want to major in architecture, this is a very good class to get started with.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, in fact I have already recommended it to at least eight of my peers (who are sadly first years so cannot take the course as it is not offered second semester). It made me more aware of the built environment, and has changed the way I experience New Haven, NYC, and even new cities when I travel.",
                "100%, I brag about this course to every single person I know. It's engaging; the professor sits with you, so it feels like a genuine conversation. The architecture and history behind it are engaging and powerful. The professor is quite literally your best friend when it comes to this class. When it comes to screenings, that is the best part. You get to watch a movie that feels like it has nothing to do with architecture, but once you focus on the background and setting, you'll understand it. Especially with historical landmarks and well-known cities.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because of how incredibly Surry is able to create an environment that facilitates creativity, curiosity, and exploration through art. By learning about the urban development and design of international cities through the political, social, or religious environment; this course explores what it means to be human and how humans interact with the built landscape."
