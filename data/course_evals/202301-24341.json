The second half of the course exposed me to many of the nuances surrounding abolition and reform that I had not previously considered, as well as multiple abolitionist perspectives.",

The class brought up realistic and important questions including: How can we redefine safety? Why is it necessary to move towards community-based models of care and investment, rather than turning to the carceral state? How is the carceral state inherently violent? We were able to unpack how the carceral state operates in collaboration with global capitalism, immigrant policing and deportation, neoliberal reform, and other violent systems of power.

                "Strengths: Really cool professor, great, great readings, communication style assingments.\r\nAreas of Improvement: The discussion times were sometimes a bit awkward but that is normal! Maybe also a bit less reading, it was almost impossible to complete the reading from monday to wednesday sometimes.",
                "This course ends up being very student led in a way that is very helpful and insightful for everyone. Professor Manning adds his expertise in a complementary but not overpowering way in class. Another strength is bringing in outside speakers which helps to build a well rounded perspective that brings in community leaders. One weakness is the newsletter as the final project as the goal of it was not clarified from the start and led to some confusions about how we should disseminate it.",
                "Strengths: the course provided a very strong basis for understanding abolition. I feel we covered a large amount of literature. I also enjoyed the guest speakers, it added a very special element to the course where I see the theories we discussed being put into action.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think there could have been even more diversity of sources. I appreciate all of the books we read, but it would have been nice to read a few more articles and documentary sources. I also would have liked to focus in on one or two stories where we get to see the impacts of mass incarceration.   I appreciate the unconventional approach to writing assignments, however I wish there was more independent work in the class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Manning! Classroom environment is also full of life, and the readings are incredibly interesting.",
                "Strengths: the breadth of what is covered. I learned about a lot. How abolition is discussed in class. Professor Manning's lectures. The assignments (both the sociological correspondences and the final newsletter) were really engaging and definitely felt meaningful and worthwhile. // Weaknesses: because so much was covered, I felt like I didn't learn in as much depth as I would have liked to. I think I would understand what we were learning better if there was more time dedicated to each topic. Sometimes I wish the culture of class discussions was more accepting to not fully-formed thoughts or opinions (I think this is more of a reflection of the people in the class though, not the class itself)",
                "I appreciated how this class went beyond the typical essay format. Our assignments included writing correspondences with a partner, which I deeply valued because I learned a lot from my peers' personal experiences and thoughts. I also felt I was able to write more freely in the format of a letter to a peer. Other assignments included a submission to a final class \"newsletter\"the form of this submission could range from an op-ed, personal narrative, literature review, interviews and recaps of local events, and visual/video/artistic presentations. A huge strength of this class was this flexibility in format, emphasizing both traditionally academic and more creative mediums as valid forms of intellectual work. Another assignment was a book review and tour (ie. presenting a reading and leading the class discussion on it), which was done as a group. Again, I learned a lot from working with my peers and learned a lot from their experiences. This was another strength of this class, as it gave us warm and safe space to share our own lives and experiences with the carceral state. There was also no judgment in class discussions, as people were able to debate, question, and express doubts about abolitionism and then discuss them further."

I came into this course relatively unfamiliar with the history of prisons and mass incarceration. After this course, I've been introduced to a number of theorists and scholars like Angela Davis, Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Beth Richie and have a comprehensive understanding of what abolition means. I found myself drawing from course themes in my other seminars. \r\n\r\nWould definitely recommend this course if it's taught under Prof. Manning.",
