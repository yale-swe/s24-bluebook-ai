Developed Spanish-speaking skills through oral participation.",

I wish we talked more about ethical concepts, but it was super helpful to learn about particular diseases and how to use Spanish to describe them.",
                "Strengths: highly interactive (oral participation and write homework responses), collaborative, relatively low workload.\r\nAreas for Improvement: sometimes received minimal feedback on written assignments.",
                "Strengths: The homework assignments were good writing practice and a reasonable amount of weekly work. Class was relaxed and a welcoming environment to participate in. I enjoyed putting together the group presentations as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have been happy to do another group presentation. I think that would be a good way to ensure all students are participating and practicing speaking in Spanish"

                "yes, its a great opportunity to improve your spanish",
                "I think many should take this course even if \"medical\" terminology may not be your thing. You truly do learn a lot more than just medical terms, and you learn a lot about social norms, cultural aspects, and you get a lot of practice of speaking and understanding spanish.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in Spanish and\/or Medicine",
                "Yes! As someone going into healthcare, I feel that I am much better prepared having taken this class.",
                "Yes, I would! Professor Carreras is so kind and class can be very cute and fun. I think sometimes it could get boring during lecture time but the oral presentations were engaging at the end of the course and the course is amazing for a Spanish L5!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student regardless of their major\/academic background. It is a wonderful opportunity to practice your Spanish in an encouraging setting and learn about health conditions and social determinants that affect global communities. The content is applicable to approaching health outcomes from a multicultural perspective in the New Haven community.",
                "Maybe. If you are looking for a 5th class to add, this one is pretty relaxed. The weekly assignments are very fair and manageable, although expect to put aside a few hours to complete them."
