                "I learned how to close read better and work in group discussions",
                "Reading the work of one author so intensively was illuminating  it was an amazing experience to see Woolfs art evolve over her whole career.",
                "This course challenged me to manage high volumes of difficult reading and to write a 20 page paper. While I started out most of the books trying to puzzle through every single line, I learned over time to let go of that impulse and to focus on just experiencing Woolf's writing  which was so confounding and often frustrating, but most of the time, so rewarding. Our readings and discussions drew from Virginia Woolf's biography and personal writing to draw connections between her various works, which has encouraged me to look more into the biographies of other writers I admire. Finally, this course helped me think more deeply and critically about the politics of Woolf's writing, especially the imperial context of her work. I really appreciated that we were never expected or encouraged to idealize Woolf or justify her shortcomings  I felt that we pieced together a full picture of who she was as a writer and person, which I would never have gleaned without the help of this class.",
                "I learned about how to engage with a single author's work in relation to its historical and literary context. I also developed my ability to write a longer research paper.",
                "I became deeply immersed in the life and writings of Virginia Woolf, with special emphasis on her ideas concerning gender, sexuality, race, colonization, and national identity.",
                "This class provided a wonderful deep dive into the life and work of Virginia Woolf. We read all of Woolf's novels except her second, and in doing so gained a meaningful understanding of who she was as an author and how her writing grew and changed over time. The in-class discussion was always engaging, and the reading was carefully chosen and insightful. I really enjoyed this course!!"

            "comments": [
                "I love how many books we read but I wish we couldve gone to the Beineke one week to look at primary sources. That wouldve been cool.",
                "I would have liked to see a little more support built into the class for the final paper. We wrote the whole 20-25 pages essentially starting in the last week of classes, and I think it would have been helpful to start that process earlier in the semester somehow.",
                "Professor Homans is definitely the biggest strength of this course. In class discussions, she encouraged us to focus on the stickiest, most ambiguous and puzzling parts of each novel and rarely settled on one satisfying reading. She is also one of the kindest professors I've had and clearly tried to draw out something meaningful from every student's comments. While the class environment definitely could have been intimidating and stressful given how tough Virginia Woolf can be to read, Professor Homans set a generous tone of discussion that both motivated us to finish the readings and allowed us to be honest when we couldn't, or when we didn't understand them. As for how the course can be improved, I think discussions could have been more structured and I wished we had spent more time analyzing passages directly from the text rather than discussing them broadly. Because there was SO much to talk about with each book, I think our conversations sometimes tried to tackle too much at a time rather than delving deeply into two or three aspects of each book. I also wish we had talked more about Woolf's sexuality and how her writing about sexual fluidity was received.",
                "Strength are the class's focus on a single author and Professor Homans, who leads excellent class discussions. One weakness is the sheer amount of reading, but Professor Homans is very understanding and doesn't expect students to read all the secondary readings every week.",
                "Prof. Homans is a fantastic instructor, and guided our conversations with ease. She is supremely knowledgeable about all things concerning Woolf, though she never once told us what to think. She encouraged us always to pursue our curiosities, and supplied us with all the support necessary to do so. Conversations in the class were always lively, and naturally, the source material was amazing. Woolf is one of the most consequential writers of the 20th century, and many of these books deeply resonated with me.",
                "This is such a wonderful class. Professor Homans is the course's biggest strength, as her expertise and generosity make the assignments, class meetings, and readings genuinely enjoyable. The devotion to one author for an entire term means this class functions differently than most other literature classes I've taken. Professor Homans guided us in getting to know Woolf and her writing, and the way she so carefully conducted our seminar discussions made our collective understanding of the novels much deeper. I can't think of any weaknesses, except maybe that we moved very quickly through the novels. But part of this class's appeal is its sweeping, broad approach that exposes students to all Woolf's work.",
                "This course was very strong. Professor Homans facilitated a fascinating discussion every week and I always left class with new outlook on the books. I really enjoyed the specific focus on one author, it was different than any class I'd taken before and very rewarding. I had some difficulty with writing one huge final paper instead of several smaller papers, but it was an informative experience nonetheless."

                "I would definitely recommend this class to someone because it had such great class discussions and the books were great.",
                "Tentatively, yes. I wouldnt recommend taking it if youre looking for lots of structured support to improve your writing and help you produce a long paper. But if youre confident in your abilities and interests and are fine being self-directed, then yes. Its a good opportunity to read some amazing novels.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course as a senior seminar! For younger students, I would caution that it is a lot of work.",
                "Yes - it was one of my favourite classes at Yale! You may not love all or even most of the books on the reading list, but they still make for an interesting discussion.",
                "With my whole soul! These books will change your life for the better, and what you learn is so invaluable.",
                "Definitely! This was such a great course for senior English majors looking to fulfill their senior seminar requirement. I've never had a professor as kind and incredible as Professor Homans, and for that reason alone I would recommend! The other students and the novels make it even better, and I learned so much in every seminar meeting. You begin to piece together how Woolf saw the world, which is not something that many other classes offer.",
                "Absolutely!!! This course was wonderful, I highly recommend it. It was a lot of reading (about one novel and ~75 pages of supplementary reading each week) but I believe it was worth it. Professor Homans created a stress-free teaching atmosphere that made going to class every week a really enjoyable experience."
