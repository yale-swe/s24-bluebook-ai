Prof Lopez Carrillo is also a passionate and kind seminar leader. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the readings were a bit dense\/I wasn't exactly sure what we were supposed to be focusing on until coming to class. Themes also repeated quite a bit between class discussions, and I would have liked a bit more variety in our medical pluralism discussions.",

Her lectures are clear, and she has many incites that encourages really great and thought-provoking questions and discussions in class. She is supportive, attentive, invested, and really helpful when it comes to our individual research projects. I have no complaints about the class."
