                "social movement tactics, nonviolent as a strategy rather than ethics, framing, political process model, immigrant organizing, labor organizing, and so much more",
                "I am now much better at understanding how ideas spread, and how action can be inspired. I am a political science major, and this class was crucial to understanding the undercurrents of domestic and global politics today, especially regarding the role of the advocate/activist in shaping a nation. I took the writing intensive option, which I highly recommend; writing research papers seemed overwhelming at first, but my teaching fellow really guided me through the whole process and ensured that I got a lot out of it.",
                "I learned a great deal about nonviolent uprisings and the logistics of community organizing.",
                "I learned about the foundations of social movements and through examples of historical movements, I learned what worked and has not worked in the past in application to the creation of movements in the future.",
                "Through this course, I learned more about the different aspects of social movements and the necessary conditions to create mass mobilization around a given issue. The course also improved my skills in evaluating case studies and the historical record to evaluate the success and failures of different social movements in the United States and around the globe. By presenting different theories on mobilization and organizing, the course took a comparative approach to discussing social movements and provided key insights into the scholarship on the matter.",
                "I learned the skills to evaluate the motivations, framings, targets, and goals of social movements. I took the writing credit and therefore learned how to craft a supported, extended argument based on these concepts.",
                "I would not change this course. It was one of my favorites at Yale thus far.",
                "I gained a greater understanding of social movements and theories regarding their rise.",
                "I learned a lot about social movements and community organizing. The class provided a lot of great historical and current examples as well as tools for analyzing how movements take shape and why they do/dont succeed. The writing-focused discussion section also improved my writing and research skills.",
                "I learned how to view a social movement through different perspectives. When it comes to social movement usually individuals join thinking that one day someone just decided to go out and do something randomly but for the most part that's not the whole truth. A lot of planning going into social movements and a lot of the individuals involved in helping create it often go unnoticed.",
                "Various social movements and effective tactics to achieve larger goals",
                "I gained a great foundational understanding of the components of social movements. I learned the various tactics employed by successful movements and the conditions that exist in a society in order for movements to emerge. I also learned about many specific movements ranging from the Civil Rights Movement to different immigrant rights movements and more.",
                "Gained a deeper appreciation of protest movements",
                "I absolutely loved this course. I learned so much about why social movements happen and what makes them effective. I also received very helpful feedback on my writing and ideas."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths- very passionate professor, topics presented in a very clear, persuasive manner, learned a lot of political science concepts in general. Weakness- reading can be a lot in some weeks, but pretty manageable overall",
                "The strengths of this course were the interesting lectures, the research papers, and the section. Student engagement was high, and students had the opportunity to share their perspectives and ideas in class. Teaching fellow review sessions before the midterm and final were excellent. The weaknesses were the classroom (the temperature was often incredibly uncomfortable, which made it hard to learn). Some guest lectures did not feel necessarily pertinent to the course, but it was valuable to hear the new perspectives. Nonetheless, the teaching fellow guest lectures were all excellent. Also, some content at the end (especially transnational movements) felt rushed, which was frustrating.",
                "I think there are too many assessments at the end of the term. The midterm and final exam did not help me understand any of the content or improve my ability to apply it-- it just forced me memorize lots of little facts from the course.",
                "Strengths are the amounts of case studies discussed in class; it made it easier to apply the concepts learned in class to real life. A weakness is that I feel we didn't engage much with the readings; I would have liked to discuss them more in class, even for non-WR students.",
                "The strengths of this course were the choice of topics, the insights the professor shared, the guest lecturers - including the Teaching Fellows - and the case studies selected through readings and film. Throughout the semester, the topics were always timely and relevant to the present day. Professor Wood shared exceptional insights into the framework of social movements through her research, especially on El Salvador and South Africa. The guest lecturers were always wonderful, as they presented on diverse topics and brought in new considerations to the course. The choice in case studies were also excellent, as there was substantial variety in the type of social movements selected, as well as their geographical location. The only recommendation for improvement would be to bring in the course readings into the lectures more often.",
                "Great content, organization, and framework via Protest Politics Today. Writing TFs were awesome. Lost a bit of focus at the end of the semester with guest lecturers, but they were also awesome.",
                "Strengths are that the lecture notes and readings are directly related to material on the exams, so there arent many curveballs on tests.",
                "This course was a great overview of social movements and organizing. It was accessible for less advanced students, but the course material was varied and engaging enough to keep me interested as a junior Political Science major. The inclusion of guest lecturers and the high-quality TFs were added bonuses. \r\nThe only weakness Id mention is that there was sometimes a bit of a disconnect between the class lectures and the readings. They usually complemented each other well, but there were a few oddball weeks where I wasnt quite sure what my takeaways were supposed to be.",
                "A strength is definitely the workload of the course. I never felt like I was behind unless I didn't do the readings but the writing responses and in-class exams were very manageable. A weakness could be the lectures themselves at least their presentation. Adding more visuals could be more responsive or adding less text to the slides, in opposition, the slides are fine but would be beneficial if they were posted on canvas before class.",
                "Lecture could be more interactive (more discussions, etc)\r\n\r\nAssignments, such as the field-trip report, can be entertaining and a good learning opportunity",
                "The course topic is interesting and a wide range of subjects is covered throughout the semester. I think the course could be improved by outlining some key topics/themes that the lessons fall under. At the end of the semester when studying for exams it became more clear why we covered the things we did but as we were learning it sometimes felt like just a random assortment of info. ALLOWING TYPED NOTES would have also been extremely helpful! The notes were very long so it was impossible to keep up by hand. I found myself struggling to focus without actively being able to take notes since I would have to wait until after class to receive the slides and type them. I and others mentioned this in the midterm evaluation but no changes were made but this should really be considered!",
                "I really enjoyed the topics covered in the class, particularly early weeks looking at what explains why a social movement will start."
