                "Over the course of this semester, I got to engage with race and different forms of media in ways that I haven't experienced before at Yale. There should be more media studies classes that intersect with the ER&M banner. We started off the course with a foundational understanding of why comedy is effective, which informed the rest of our semester as we studied everything from stand-up comedy to satiric novels to movies and sitcoms. I developed a language of how to talk about comedy and its implications, a skill that is ever-relevant in today's time.",
                "Great introduction to cultural theories of comedy, media analysis, racial\/comic history. Writing and research skills for cultural analysis.",
                "I learned how to think critically about comic cultural productions and how to ask questions such as: who is the audience? how is the performer employing humor? for what purpose? what's the role of race and identity? what strategies are used? I also learned that there is a thin line between racism and humor that often gets blurred.",
                "Unique opportunity to look at comedy from a critical lens, engaged w\/ lots of material with strong theoretical and historical perspective set up in the first weeks. Laguna always tries to bring in cool and interesting guest lecturers which is a plus. Course is true to its description and does not separate comedy into \"good (PC) comedy\" and \"bad comedy,\" rather allows for really nuanced discussions of the way race is working throughout different comedic pieces. Analysis of sitcoms\/stand up\/literature\/plays and performances\/movies\/memes etc.",
                "The history of comedy and the nuances in the media we consume today and how it relates to race relations",
                "I learned about comedy but I'm not exactly sure *what* I learned about comedy. I loved watching movies about racial identity reflected through comedic lenses, but I'm not entirely sure what I'm taking away from the class as a whole.",
                "I learned about the history of racialized comedy and racial humor in the US. I also felt I gained some critical tools to dissect and digest jokes and humorous mediums (like sitcoms, standup, etc.). I feel like I can now close read comedies along with dramas in general as well.",
                "I feel much more comfortable analyzing comedic works as they handle and relate to racial issues",
                "I learned to be more critical about the humor that I encounter every day. I encounter racist jokes all the time, whether in conversations or in the media and sometimes, Im not sure how to react. This course pushed me to think not only about why we feel this way but also about what drives racism in jokes. Why do we find them funny? Why do we laugh or not laugh? Is there anything wrong with laughing at these kinds of jokes? We explore all of these questions in the class. The readings and shows that we were assigned to watch were all super engaging!",
                "I learned so much about the history of comedy, especially non-white comedians and their roles developing forms of comedy such as stand-up and sitcoms. This was a fascinating course, I was excited for every reading and assignment."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the syllabus! And Professor Laguna's openness to nontraditional final projects (in form and content). Professor Laguna is also incredible at creating a dialogue and connecting points by different students to move conversations into nuanced and fascinating arenas.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Laguna, the content (interesting, reasonable amount of readings, entertaining media products most weeks), the sitcom project was pretty fun but not too high-stakes, assignments super doable and give you the chance to dive in to a specific topic\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class discussion occasionally felt limited in depth (not really Laguna's fault, I appreciated his facilitation, ymmv), wished the class content felt like it built on itself slightly more (applying concepts from different weeks, not just comparing products)",
                "Strengths: instead of just readings there was a lot of media to watch which was engaging; interesting class discussions; manageable workload; good professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: can't think of any!",
                "If you love comedy, you will love this course. Laguna is an excellent professor who keeps discussions focused and interesting-- literally never had a boring discussion in this class. Readings and material were balanced and interesting, consistent amount of work each week. One of my favorite classes at Yale! No real weaknesses to note.",
                "Strengths- very engaging professor, centered on discussion \r\nWeakness- none",
                "I loved the homework, which was watching (or reading) funny things that dealt with race, including lots of stand up, some great movies, and a book or two that were fine. \r\nAnother strength was the ease of class discussion, we had fun in class and conversation flowed easily. However this very quickly led into territory of tangents and getting completely off topic. I'm not sure what any one class' \"big question\" was, I'm not sure what we were really trying to figure out in this class. \r\nA weakness was the breadth of some of the assignments, I didn't fully understand what we were studying when we looked at sitcoms, and some of the material felt very broad, as in I don't know what many specifics of \"race and comedy.\" It feels somewhat nebulous, looking back at the semester.",
                "Strengths: the content is super interesting! The weekly readings\/viewings are actually worth doing (something I think I would rarely say for most classes), and they were very manageable. The workload was enough to keep me engaged by not overwhelming. Prof Laguna is also great!!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we got more feedback over the course of the semester. I also think that the discussions in class could sometimes feel disorganizedbut I feel like the digressions were still very interesting and important.",
                "Strengths: The course was structured really well and we were introduced to so many different genres of humor throughout the weeks. It was very student centered so every week, we guided the discussions in a very chill environment where we were able to speak our thoughts freely.\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "The class was poorly organized in my opinion and was not tightly focused. I was excited to discuss the difficult aspects of comedy, but unfortunately the class gets very roped up in identity politics and never moves on to questions of form because it's so focused on calling out controversial content. This definitely depends on the group of people you're with, but given the class's favoring of ERM majors, it will probably continue to be the case.",
                "This class was incredible I can only think of strengths. The readings were carefully curated to accompany what we watched for the week, the weeks divided to cover each new topic and also build upon what we had already learned."

                "Yes! If you have the chance to take any class with Professor Laguna, take it. Especially in the arena of pop culture, Professor Laguna's scholarship is fascinating. He challenges students while creating an open environment for people to express their opinions.",
                "Yes! Dr. Laguna is brilliant and a great teacher, and the content is interesting, applicable, and fun to learn about.",
                "I would recommend this course if you like comedy and want to explore the intersections between race and comedy. Because I am not big on memes\/stand-up comedies\/etc, it was a bit harder for me to understand some references. However, the topics and discussions were still very interesting and lively. The workload is also manageable and the professor does a great job of providing enough context but also allowing for discussion.",
                "YES-- if you can get into this course and love comedy, take it!! Highly engaging, satisfying, and entertaining work that doesn't feel like schoolwork. Writing the final paper (very flexible topic where you can write about anything related to the course themes) was probably the most fun I've ever had writing a paper at Yale.",
                "Yes, the material was not only interesting but very useful as we navigate the world today",
                "Definitely! Such an insightful seminar!",
                "Sure, it was not my favorite class but I laughed and I had a decent time. It is a class that definitely touches very quickly on some intense material but then backs away. While we did study some of the harmful and dangerous forms of racial comedy, it was a once-off situation, just scraping the surface really. And the class is necessarily broad, painting with broad strokes! 13 classes is not many. A lot of the seminars each week were singular classes about \"Indigenous comedy\" or \"Latinx comedy\" and it felt strange that things were split up that way, though I did appreciate the many different people we were able to listen to. I'm surprised we didn't talk about Dave Chapelle.\r\nIt's not a difficult class to engage in, but coming away from the class I'm really not sure what I'm taking with me. I had a good time though.",
                "Yes! This course is very interesting and popular, so if you manage to get into the seminar, I highly recommend keeping your seat and taking the class. It was refreshingly enjoyable class.",
                "Yes! Very interesting conversations and cool comedic works",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. The workload isnt overwhelming and half of it was just watching comedy shows (stand up, tv shows, movies, etc). I was introduced to so much comedy that I didnt know existed and I deeply appreciated the new knowledge\/recommendations on what to watch next. The weekly discussions in class were also super chill  Professor Laguna had some guiding questions but for the most part we guided the conversations and most of them were, unsurprisingly, funny! The content makes you think more critically about the humor that you  encounter every day and its super fascinating to come away with new perspectives.",
                "It depends on your expectations and interests, but I think the time could be better spent elsewhere if you're looking for something that deals with comedy and the philosophy of humor. As much as Laguna and the class want to discuss form, it rarely moves beyond the realm of talking about ERM.",
                "Absolutely! This was my favorite class I've taken at Yale so far (a second-semester junior) and I loved every part of it. The assignments were fun and informative, the professor was passionate and great at teaching, the discussions were incredible and I left every one with a million more things to say. If you can get into this class, TAKE IT, no matter your field of study, though as an ERM student, this was particularly engaging."
