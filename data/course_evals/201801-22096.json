    "How to think philosophically and analyze texts.",
    "Philosophical thinking, examining logic, and considering the works of philosophers as a whole rather than piece by piece.",

    "Learned how to write a compelling essay. Learned to analyze and understand complex philosophical texts.",
    "I learned about the modern continuation of the western philosophical canon.",
    "DS Philosophy spring semester is very different than fall semester -- much more metaphysical and theoretical. However, the concepts we broached through the readings, in lecture, and most of all, in seminar, have fundamentally changed the way I understand the world. From the basics of human existence to the foundations of morals, the questions and discussions gave me deeper insight into my own assumptions and taught me to live life critically and analytically.",

   "comments": [
    "DS Philosophy is a good course and does exactly what it's supposed to do.",
    "Maybe too many texts to fully appreciate all in short time available.",
    "Too surface level, although this is partly the nature of the beast that is DS. I wish we could've spent more time on some of the particularly difficult texts.",
    "In my experience, DS Philosophy lectures are actually very useful for understanding the concepts, unlike the other two DS classes. The reading does feel overwhelming in certain places, but that's DS.",
    "Very strong course, weaknesses mostly involve the brief amount of time we can spend on materials. If I don't write a paper on an author and therefore don't re-read them I feel that I have not completely learned the material.",
    "This course was excellent, no improvement needed."

    "Yes",
    "Yes. Fun, challenging, interesting.",
    "Absolutely. Modern philosophy is fascinating, and if you're passionate about it, this is the course for you without a doubt.",
    "Yes, I would! DS was such an intellectually transformative experience for me. The professors are great, and in philosophy in particular they foster an engaged, relevant, expansive discussion in a way similar but non-DS classes don't necessarily seem to offer.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student taking Directed Studies.",
    "Yes, Professor Szabo was an amazing teacher and discussion facilitator."
