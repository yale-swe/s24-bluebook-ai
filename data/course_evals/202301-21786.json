I learned the specific tools to write a compelling short-story, and how these skills are explicitly different than one that we'd learn in a literature class where we'd spend most of our time analyzing pieces of writing.",

Also loved the chance to read everyone's writing.\r\nPossible improvement: more writing earlier on? I think you really start to integrate the craft lessons when you practice them yourself, so maybe weekly writing assignments to really experiment with these craft elements ourselves.",
                "There are no weaknesses! The strength was definitely Professor Sexton, and his ability to have fun with students in class and give constructive feedback that didn't demotivate the writer. He pushes students to be bold with their writing, while also giving explicit improvements to give structure to the often arbitrary art of writing.",
                "Strengths: workshop style discussion of stories, short writing assignments that teach you different skills, feedback on writing, several really engaging assigned readings\r\nWeakness: Some of the assigned readings were a bit boring but this was the minority. Feedback could have been received a little quicker, and honestly I would have enjoyed a couple more short writing prompts (perhaps optional ungraded ones even)",

It was such a blessing to see the stories that students were interested in writing, and everyone's unconditional support for each other was so beautiful to see.",

Prof Sexton is hilarious, incredibly well-read, empathetic, and a great teacher. You will improve as a writer and learn how to write good, readable fiction. The worst case scenario is that you have a fun semester reading the stories assigned for the class and written by your classmates",

                "Definitely! Its exactly what it sounds like so if that is interesting to you, then yes! Also Professor Sexton has a great workshop style.",
