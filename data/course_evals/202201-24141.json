                "This course is uniquely important and excellent because it gives students the time and resources to create the work they want to make! It prioritizes MAKING, which in my opinion should be the priority of the art major. I'm so glad that most of our class time was dedicated to working on our projects with Alex's supervision. At a liberal arts school such as Yale, it is crucial to build studio practice into class time so that students are able to develop their practical\/conceptual skills with the supervision and real-time feedback from a professor. I am very grateful for the constant feedback from Alex about my project as it developed, and I know if I was only able to work on it outside of class that it would not have turned out nearly as well. I wish more art classes had professors so directly engaged with the students' generative processes. I already touched on this, but learning practical skills is something that is really lacking in many arts courses here. I feel so much more confident as an artist with this strong foundation in woodworking, as opposed to other experiences where I am drenched in theory (which is certainly extremely valuable, but theory should be complimenting, not superseding art creation, otherwise it can't be fully processed or taken advantage of). I can't think of any weaknesses to this course!",
                "Experience working in the shop and a lot of attention from the teacher and TA (at least in this case). We ended up only doing one project for the whole semester which is ultimately how long it took, but the class could have been much better organized at the beginning to maximize the efficiency of getting shop trained (as the first 2 weeks before that were online which is basically completely useless).",
                "Strength: lots of freedom, knowledgeable professor, TA, and shop monitors that we could ask for help, lots of free work time\r\nWeakness: very unstructured, not much learning about sculpture as a concept",
                "strengths: access to the school of art wood shop, instruction on how to use the tools and guidance on creating a range of projects\r\ncons: a little disorganized--we ended up completing one semester-long project instead of four"

                "Yes - it's a good sculpture class if you're looking for something general and a bit open ended that is not sculpture basics - as you get to go a lot deeper into the project that you're doing.",
                "I would recommend the course if youd like to work with wood, and if you already have a project idea in mind. This course wasnt the best for developing ideas, since it was so unstructured with lots of free time. But if you come in with specific ideas of what youd like to make, you could get a lot out of it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning their way around a wood shop and in creating interesting sculpture pieces",
                "Yes! This class is a wonderful opportunity to learn practical skills at Yale and create art you are proud of."
