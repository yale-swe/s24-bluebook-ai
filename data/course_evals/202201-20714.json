Prof. Stern allows ample space for student discussion, but makes clear that this course is not one where someone can simply sit and listen to the conversation. In addition, the TA, Lital, was amazing. She met with me whenever I needed to discuss the writing prompts, and offered thorough and clear feedback."

                "Without a doubt! The course was not only timing and engaging, but it encouraged us to re-evaluate many of the ideas regarding Judaism, the Holocaust, antisemitism, and Israel that I had long taken for granted.",
                "Absolutely! This is an amazing and enriching course.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in understanding the idea of how history can be \"used,\" because it allows another viewpoint into the discipline. Having some background in Holocaust/modern European history would also be a plus."
