                "This class is generally very small, which was really nice as it made class feel almost like office hours. I thought the readings selected were great and offered a lot of exposure to different methods. Another major strength is professor Menon. She is always able to break things down in a way that makes themes or methods really digestible and accessible. She is also just really approachable, accomplished, and cool. Her recorded lectures are super well organized and contain really great information, and having the recorded lectures meant that we spent most of our class time discussing, which was great. One small weakness was that sometimes methods are not the most exciting thing to talk about so, at points, discussion felt a bit dry. But this has nothing to do with Menon or the format, I think it's just the nature of a methods class.",
