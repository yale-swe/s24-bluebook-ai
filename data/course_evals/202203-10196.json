                "This class gave me a great introduction to early modern tragic theater, which I hadn't really read at all before taking the class.",
                "I read many of the most important tragedies in the Western canon and learned about the general historical arc that binds many great authors and literary movements together. I also learned how to analyze and compare the text with theatrical productions, and think critically about the choices directors and actors made. This class does what a good survey course should do. I read many different tragedies and I can now reference many central figures in the literary world.",
                "I learned more about tragic plays, many of which I knew nothing about, and I thoroughly enjoyed almost every play on the syllabus. Even though this class was offered on Zoom this semester, I still got a lot from Professor Trumpener who was amazing and understanding, and the other students in the class. Professor Trumpener was amazing at leading discussions and gave great essay prompts, so I feel like taking this course in person would greatly enhance it (because after all it still was a Zoom class). Professor Trumpener also was very thorough and clear in her comments on essays and the workload was always fair, never overbearing. She was also cool about adjusting workload and the syllabus in busier times of the semester to make things easier for the students in class.",

                "The course gives students a great overview of many different tragedies throughout the Western canon, including a few intriguing plays that I did not expect. Because you read so many plays, you can place a wide range of authors and figures in conversation with one another, which often brings about interesting discussions and discoveries. That said, this survey course does sacrifice depth for breadth. I wouldn't necessarily change that fact, it is just something students should note if they are curious about the course.",

                "Yes! Prof is amazing",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. The theme of tragedy is accessible to anybody regardless of level of interest in literature, and the discussions were open and welcoming.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who want a general overview of important tragedies in the Western canon and to those who like thinking across multiple disciplines. Though it may not seem important, it was interesting being in a class with many theatre studies majors, as they had insightful comments that, say, English majors did not have. (The reverse is true as well).",
                "Yes! Even if theater or tragedy isn't normally your thing. I went into this course thinking it would just be something to fulfill a major requirement, but it actually ended up being one of my more positive classes this semester.",
                "Take it!!! A brilliant and important class that EVERYONE at yale should take. No one should count themselves exempt from reading these riveting and resounding tragedies. It's such a true form and these books have had so many afterlives. Professor Trumpener is a wonderful professor who guarantees there's never a dull moment in class--our class was always engaging and provocative, even on Zoom. Whether its your first or fifteenth English class, youll definitely get something fruitful out of these texts and our conversations about them."
