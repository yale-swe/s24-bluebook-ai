She walks us through the texts and is very open to student ideas. She is also the fastest grader I've ever seen, giving us our paper grades back the day we submit them.\r\nWeaknesses: Zoom really made student engagement a lot less robust. This was the last class she taught, since she's retiring, so it's sad that future students won't be able to take her course."

However, if your literary Chinese is not as strong, you will struggle a bit in this class. The reason why workload was rated much greater is because I'm slow at translating. Native Chinese students will find it much easier. This class really is made by the professor's personality and knowledge. Kang-I really made this class, and hopefully the next professor will be able to live up to her legacy."
