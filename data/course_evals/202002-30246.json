   "comments": [
    "I learned how to analytically write for the research paper, as well as how to shift between different approaches of thinking about international relations.",
    "The biggest skill that I developed this course was the ability to do research using the Yale library and put together an argumentative research paper.",
    "I learned a lot about international relations, including information on trade, terrorism, war, civil war, and cooperation.",
    "learned a lot about the three paradigms of international relations and the ability to write a research paper",
    "Learned about the basics of IR and how to write a social science research paper.",
    "By taking this course, I expanded my knowledge of international politics and the processes involved in creating international law, treaties, war, and peacetime. I learned how to analyze IR through the lenses of realism, liberalism, and constructivism, which enhanced my understanding of world history and modern government operations. I now feel empowered to lead a discussion about topics pertaining to international relations and world politics, which I would not have been able to do before taking this course.",
    "I learned about approaches of international relations, levels of analysis, different theories that apply to cooperation and conflict, and I learned how to write an analytical social science research paper.",
    "I definitely developed my research and writing skills as I had no knowledge about how to write a political science paper prior to this course. Moreover, I learned the basics of the IR field and this has changed my perception and opinion on world events.",
    "In taking Intro to IR, I gained knowledge about about how key decisions in world politics are made. Much of our learning was theoretical and this was something I had not yet experienced in a class. While IR aims to predict trends in world politics, I also gained knowledge about specific events and their contribution to foreign policy. In addition, I learned how to structure and write a social science research paper. While this process was difficult at times, I was definitely able to develop my analytical writing skills, specifically through reviewing the current literature, formulating a research design, and carrying out case studies.",
    "I gained the ability to critically understand the intricacies of relations between states and to evaluate why states take the actions that they do.",
    "I gained knowledge of different methods to understand international relations.",
    "The foundational theories for international relations.",
    "Basic understanding of IR and the three main theories",
    "intro ir",
    "Knowledge about diplomacy, world history, international relations, and political theory.",
    "This was a strong baseline introduction to international relationsincluding historical context, textual information, and an introduction to writing for a social science."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths are that it relates well to the modern era, which helps with engagement, and the lectures are clear and informative. Weaknesses are that the research paper felt like an afterthought and should have been integrated more into the course, and I would have loved more utilization of breakout rooms.",
    "The strengths of this course is it provided a very introductory foundation that can be used as a platform to go into other IR areas. The research paper was a good way to exercise our critical thinking. One weakness of this course is that we ran out of time to discuss. Its a hard course to compact into 6 weeks, but Professor Lotito did a good job with what we had.",
    "The strengths are the professor's ability to relate all topics to each other and the setup for the course allows great discussions in class. The main weakness was the lack of ability to get to know other students.",
    "strengths: comprehensive, pretty interesting\r\nweaknesses: moved really fast, a bit too theoretical for me",
    "Strengths: Professor Lotito is a good lecturer, knows how to use Zoom effectively, and the course material was interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: The workload really picked up near the end. This might just be the nature of the Summer Session. Final paper due on Monday of Week 5 and final exam three days later on Thursday. Kinda rough.",
    "Strengths - very well organized, provided lots of supplementary material, very easy to contact the professor and TF for clarification, thorough discussions \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - given the time constraints, there was often a lot of information packed into a short amount of discussion time. Perhaps a lighter workload or increased class time would aid students' understanding of all of the information presented. Also, this course did not utilize the \"Assignments\" function of the Canvas page, which would have aided time management in terms of due dates for writing assignments and exams.",
    "Strengths: Great introduction to International relations, the readings expose you to a variety of diverse ideals and theories.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There could be more guidance when it comes to the final paper.",
    "The main strength of this course was that it was pretty impressive that we covered so much ground in merely 5 weeks. The quality of the lectures and the seminars were generally very high. However, the main weakness is the quality of the TA. The quality of the feedback from the TA was generally low and way too general. Most of the questions I asked about the research proposal and design were unanswered and was met with the response that my grades are already one of the highest. I felt offended by the response as the point of asking the questions was to improve on my final paper, but it felt like the TA assumed that I wanted to challenge his grading, which is unfounded and untrue. Furthermore, I asked for a meeting to discuss my final paper, and the TA specified a certain time in Eastern time without AM\/PM written, therefore I assumed it would be written in standard 24-hour format. However, I was sent an email in the specified 24-hour time not in Eastern time, but my time, that I did not show up at the meeting time. I felt like the miscommunication was due to the lack of attention given to students. Overall, the course and instructor were great, but the TA should definitely improve\/ be replaced. One additional feedback would be that the Writing Fellow we had was extremely friendly and helpful, and overall helped me the most in this course.",
    "Some of the strengths of the course were the discussion-based class format, small class size, intriguing subject matter, and the access to resources such as office hours with the teaching fellow. An aspect of the course that was both a strength and a weakness was the length. At times, the fact that the course was so condensed caused me to become confused with the subject matter or just feel overwhelmed with the coursework. However, most of the time, I enjoyed the fast pace of the course and felt like I was constantly learning a lot each session. Also, by the end, I found that the content was still very fresh in my brain and I remembered what we had learned throughout the 5 week period. While I would have enjoyed meeting in a classroom face-to-face with my peers instead of on Zoom or in breakout rooms, I would not categorize this as a weakness because COVID-19 is not a controllable variable at the moment. However, I think we overcame this challenge effectively and I generally enjoyed what little class time that we had.",
    "It was an excellent course but increasing the use of breakout rooms would be beneficial.",
    "While I understand that as a summer course theres limited space for discussion, I would have liked to see more discussion and application of our learning to more current events.",
    "despite being very engaged throughout the course, my final grade will not reflect this because the majority of the grade stems from the research paper and final exam. Since the TF grades the papers, there was a lot of disconnect for the expectations, and since the course is so fast-paced, our final exam was the first exposure to any type of testing. It was difficult to prepare for. There was not enough guidance on how to articulate the aspects of the course we were actually graded on.",
    "The research paper just didnt work well for me. I understand teaching research skills and it was a good attempt, but in a 5 week course online it was very difficult and I feel like I didnt get anything out of it. I understand that the prof and TA were available to answer questions but things were due so quickly after getting any feedback that I feel like I wasnt prepared.",
    "Strengths: Content, class discussions, readings, project\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Assignments descriptions and feedback were vague, harsh grading",
    "I think it felt slightly impersonal, but it was a lecture conducted over Zoom. However I do wonder if discussion sections during the week might have helped to make the class feel closer, even though they would have been conducted remotely."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if they're new to International Relations. It gives a really good overview and broad survey of International Relations.,\\",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I think that the foundations that this course supplies can apply to many aspects of everyday life. It is very informative and coming out of the course I feel as if I have something to add to the conversation of world politics.",
    "Yes! Great course to learn about the basics of IR. Good for beginning political science majors as well.",
    "yes if you want to get a basis in IR and are genuinely interested in the subject",
    "Definitely! The course was interesting and the workload was not bad at all. If you're at all interested in IR or just want to be able to better understand what's going on in the world, I recommend taking this course. Especially if Lotito is teaching it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it was very interesting, insightful, timely, and applicable to the modern world. Throughout the course discussions, we often talked about current events and how the concepts we were analyzing applied to what was happening in the world at the time, using real world examples to better understand these concepts. Likewise, it was very well organized and facilitated learning and intellectual growth.",
    "Yes. It is a great introduction to international relations and it provides you with the skills necessary to evaluate developments in world politics.",
    "I would mostly recommend this course to another student, as I believe that I improved my knowledge, public speaking, research, and writing skills greatly over the course of 5 weeks. However, it is true that the course feels kind of rushed, so if the student has no knowledge about world events or international relations, I would tell them to evaluate if they can put in enough effort and time to succeed in the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student looking to learn more about world politics and the inner workings and effectiveness of International Organizations, etc. Also, my immediate attraction to this course stemmed from my interest in learning more about the world today and how foreign policy dictates much of what happens in our everyday lives. If another student was interested for any of these reasons, I would recommend the course to them.",
    "Of course, I think it is important for students -- regardless of their intended major -- to take this class as it gives students the ability to critically understand how and why the world functions the way it does.",
    "Yes, this course is great for anyone regardless of major. Professor Lotito was a great professor and I really enjoyed the class. I felt that I was valued as a student, and I learned a lot that can be applied to my understanding of the world right now.",
    "Yes because the content itself is important, and Professor Lotito is clearly dedicated to teaching.",
    "Probably not if it were online. I think I would have loved this course in person at Yale, but it seemed like the course wasnt modified for online engagement rather it was just  an attempt to teach the normal class online.",
    "Yes because the content contributed to my academic growth and I enjoyed class discussions.",
    "If you're interested in international relations, definitely. If you are a prospective major, it's an introduction to some of the seminal texts and ideas. If you're just interested generally, it's a relatively superficialbut also interestinglook into how international relations function and are studied."
