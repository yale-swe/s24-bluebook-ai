Beyond providing us in depth knowledge about domestic and global efforts to empower women to be both represented and treated equally in the labor force, the course challenged us to consider what entities are best equipped to tackle issues like unethical workplace policies, stereotyping, wage gaps, and other impacts.",

                "I liked how small the seminar was. I never felt the pressure to participate because I j we I would have the chance and could also do so without the fear of taking up too much air time. Professor Latura was very clear in her syllabus about how the class worked so there were no issue of me following along. The biggest weakness of the course was that the material was very two dimensional and not intersectional at all. Professor Latura did disclaim that at the beginning of the semester but Im really failing to see how she can talk about the issues women face and not also talk about race and class."

Professor Latura created an engaging environment for us to learn both from her and one another. Class wasn't just informative, it was an enjoyable and interactive experience where we were encouraged to share our perspectives and ideas.",
                "Definitely! This class was very eye opening and helped me understand the gender equality issues faced my women through a new perspective",
                "Yes, I loved discussing different policies and evaluating them as a group. The sessions were always pleasant and Professor Latura encouraged us to think critically about policy, something I particularly loved.",
