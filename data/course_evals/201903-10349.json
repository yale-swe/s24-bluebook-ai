   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Knowledge on a variety of topics including: Human evolution, non-human primate phylogeny, forensic anthropology (there were many more, these were just my favorite)",
    "It helped better understand human evolution and the complexity of the theories regarding it.",
    "I furthered my understanding of the field of anthropology.",
    "Learned much about evolution, but also about how bio anthropology\/evolutionary aspects also tie into other fields of immediate concern to society",
    "I learned about the evolution of humans and human variation, and how the latter has been shaped by social and cultural practices in recent times. I learned a lot about primates, osteology, genetics, different fields of anthropology, and most importantly, how to think critically!",
    "I learned about the field of biological anthropology and the history of human evolution.",
    "This class focuses on teaching critical thinking skills and about the evolution of humans biologically and culturally.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! I took it as a science credit and came out with such a good understanding of the origins of humans\/human biology. Every single class was packed with interesting material and was completely accessible regardless of science background. Dr. Thompson is an amazing lecturer and I am so so happy I took this class with her.",
    "I learned more about myself. More specifically where my species came from and how the study of humans with the biological lens thrown on can help in everything from understanding other cultures to writing correct forensic reports.",
    "I learned more about how humans came to be the way we are!",
    "I learned more about the murky areas in hominid evolution -- super interesting stuff.",
    "I gained an understanding of how anthropology can have  multidisciplinary applications. I learned an overview of subjects like bioarchaeology, medical anthropology, and human evolution.",
    "The course gave us a strong foundation in evolutionary theory and the current state of knowledge of human origins. The approach the class took to the material was really fascinating and cross-disciplinary.",
    "This is a survey course into the topics covered by biological anthropologists, who study humans in the context of evolution. We covered everything from evolution to bioarchaelogy, to health, etc. You learn about evolutionary principles, primate evolution & human evolution. We also discussed contemporary topics in anthropology, such as race, the Paleo diet, and how different populations experience sickness. Since it's a survey course you learn a lot about the field, but you still get detailed insights and learn a lot about contemporary issues.",
    "I learned the answers to a lot of questions I have been wondering for years. I learned everything from basic cell development to who our ancestors were.",
    "This class was a survey of the history of human evolution, discussing how we became who we are, the schools of thought associated with this, and some of the current fields of research for biological anthropology.",
    "I learned a very good basic coverage of biological anthropology and the history of humans!",
    "I learned about  human biology from an evolutionary perspective and primate evolution.",
    "Taking this course, I learned the basics of biological anthropology and its related areas of study. We covered the evolutionary path of humans, the processes behind scientific work, and the work of different related areas of anthropology from forensics to medicine. Getting to have hands-on work with fossils, seeing real-world applications of biological anthropology, and reading contemporary scientific research helped to reveal the techniques and solidify the relevance of scientific work.",
    "This course was a great introduction to biological anthropology and its uses in the academic world. I enjoyed this course because it situated humans among the rest of the animal kingdom and our evolution in conjunction with major ecological and environmental changes- this had real world applications in the modern day.",
    "I have a deeper understanding of human evolution and its relation to the development of culture.",
    "I believe that this class offers a wonderful foundation to anthropology.",
    "N\/A",
    "Long view of human history. Scientific thinking.",
    "I learned a lot about biological anthropology from the human ancestors to present.",
    "I gained a better understanding of the complexity of evolution and the actual uncertainty and blurriness of science.",
    "Basic understanding of human evolution",
    "I learned a new way of thinking about human origins, evolution, and life history; and the factors that influenced how our species evolved from primates into our modern day selves. I also learned about how to combine multiple different kinds of evidence, from DNA to skeleton fragments, in search of these answers.",
    "To be honest, I did not like the content of this class (no fault of the professor or the syllabus, I'm just the kind of person who would take all English classes if I could) but I think that by being forced to take a science class I learned a lot about why I should be scientifically literate.  Prof. Thompson was great and made sure to always talk about how the stuff we learned connected to current events, and the readings and lab discussions showed a lot about ethical conflicts in the field. I really liked how much time was given to talk about the intersection between society now and human biology and evolution because it gave me a reason to value it and understand it on a deeper level."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: lectures were very clear and organized, quizzes were fair, many opportunities for extra credit. Weaknesses: sections were often disorganized, either too much work was assigned for the 50 minute block or assignments were given that required knowledge that many of the students did not have (e.g. of human skeletal anatomy).",
    "The course was overall very good. The material was taught well and with passion. The discussion sections were very helpful in understanding the subjects and the quizzes made sure that they were remembered. My only complaint is that I felt 20 minutes may have been a touch too short of a time to do a quiz, but she was under a time constriction so it is understandable.",
    "A weakness would be the discussion sections. I rarely found them actually helpful.",
    "Strengths: love how there are multiple tests so one test doesn't make or break your grade, very well-taught and understandable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: honestly, can't think of any!",
    "This course requires a lot of memorization. There are weekly to bi-weekly quizzes on the material for that week, and a study guide is provided ahead of time so you know what questions to study, but this just results in a lot of memorization and not a lot of actual learning, and it also makes up a large percentage of your grade. I think it could be improved if there were weekly problem sets instead of the quizzes. The course itself was pretty well-organized and interesting.",
    "Your grade is based off of section participation, 9 quizzes that happened about every third class (1 dropped), and the final (worth 2 quizzes). I thought that this grading scheme was genius given the quantity and detail of material we were learning because it encouraged students to study along the way, but each quiz was on a very reasonable amount of material. Dr. Thompson is a great lecturer and she made the material interesting and easy to understand. Ultimately, I feel like I came out of the class with a solid understanding of the origins of humanity and I really really enjoyed every lecture.",
    "The humor and recent event portions kept class intellectual yet engaging.  Occasionally, lecture would get tedious and the multiple quizzes really did put pressure on students with their proximity and the amount of information that was only spoken orally. The lecture slides contained less and less information as time went on.",
    "I think it was a really good course overall. In terms of improvements, maybe having more summary points on lecture slides so we knew what points were most relevant.",
    "The sections could have been better structured with lab activities that can actually be finished within 50 minutes. I'd also really appreciate a little more background knowledge in labs -- oftentimes we'd encounter a lot of unfamiliar terms with very limited background information to assist our understanding (especially in human physiology).",
    "Strengths: spread out semester (grade is heavily decided by quizzes and section and not so much by the final), passionate professor, not too many readings,\r\n\r\nCons: studying almost every week for a quiz is not for everyone,",
    "The course was really well-structured, with many small assignments throughout the term, which for me made it much less stressful\/easier to do well in the class. The labs were really relevant to the concepts discussed in lecture and really helped further my engagement with the course.",
    "Strengths: Dr. Thompson tries to keep lecture engaging and sets you up for success. Uploads slides so you can follow during class, breaks up material into 9 short exams and a final instead of two big midterms and a final. She also gave study guides before each exam AND gave extra credit.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the final exam covers a LOT of information, and the study guide were very specific and did not match up with the broad questions on the actual exam. Also, the TFs never handed in section materials in a timely manner. (However it was very easy to get a good grade as long as you showed up).",
    "The professor made the lectures engaging just by choosing topics that were hot-button or using her humor.",
    "The course is very well designed, with lectures supported by weekly practical lab sessions. The lectures string tightly together and require no previous knowledge or background. Assessment is very fair and straightforward, with 9 in-class exams, discussion section worksheets and a short final exam. The workload is very manageable.",
    "Strengths: The weekly quizzes helped me maintain information; the slides were well taught and explained.",
    "I personally liked the structure of the course. Though the frequent quizzes might be a lot for those who are not used to keeping up with readings\/ lectures I thought they were fair (she gave us study guides for each quiz and extra credit opportunities) and they keep you accountable so that the final is a breeze. If you keep up with the quizzes, taking the final will make you feel like you actually learned and internalized a lot. I feel like section could be improved because I was in one of the first sections of the week so it seems like we were sort of the test run for the labs ( we often would not end up finishing in time or got confused so they'd make the labs shorter\/explain them better for the later sections ).",
    "The strengths of this course are definitely found in the lectures, which were very engaging and informative. They presented information in a readily digestible way and were well organized for student success. The weaknesses of the course were in the sections, which often felt overly ambitious. Although many section meetings did a good job of introducing material in a tangible and interesting way, the best were based on discussions of scientific topics. Those that centered around specific procedures and techniques didn't feel organized enough within the time and material constraints, sometimes expecting a knowledge of procedures, terminology, or anatomy that we did not yet have. I think more communication between section TAs, students, and the Professor can improve those issues.",
    "This course was taught well- I felt I mastered the material and was able to learn at a decent pace. There were a variety of entry level topics and the ability to dive deeper into content through the readings and questions.",
    "The course's pacing allowed for gradual absorption of the material, however, sections were often disordered and failed to supplement lectures.",
    "I think the strengths of this course was definitely the lecture style. The Professor was very engaging and clearly wanted the student to succeed. I think the slideshows could be improved for clarification.",
    "Great course!",
    "N\/A",
    "Clear what you need to know; lectures are well-organized for retention. Weekly mini-tests are difficult enough to keep you engaged, not so much as to ruin your grade.",
    "The lectures were very interesting, however there was far too much out of class work. With studying for exams weekly, 30 pages of textbook reading a night and discussion section homework it added up to be a lot of out of class time.",
    "Sections could be improved to be centered around mastering the material in lecture.",
    "Strengths: Professor Thompson is an engaging lecturer and very passionate about her work.\r\nWeaknesses: the labs are poorly structured. students spent most of the time trying to figure out the instructions of the lab and how to do it, and then completed most of the lab at home. If you had lab earlier on in the week, you would be trying to complete an experiment and answer questions about material that we hadn't yet covered in class. The labs seemed pointless to me and added a lot of frustration to the class. All of the labs were handed back on the final day of class, so we had no feedback until the end of the semester.\r\nThe quizzes are also structured poorly; each seemingly 'easy' and 'brief' quiz that is only 20 points covered (on average) 100-150 slides of material. This required about 5- 7 hours of studying (most of which was memorization) because even if you didn't know 1 or 2 questions, your grade would lower significantly with every point lost.",
    "The course gives a strong overview of biological anthropology, but I felt that it focused overly much on certain forms that were for me less interesting and relevant to my studies (ex. ancient environment reconstruction).",
    "Please please please do not let lecture be this long. It was impossible to stay engaged the whole time even when there was nothing wrong with the content or the room or the professor. It was just so long and genuinely felt like I was stuck there sometimes. That being said, the readings were interesting, Prof Thompson was super considerate of student needs and set super clear expectations. Her review slides were amazing and the lectures were easy to understand (but hard to engage with because of the length), The set up of having an exam every other week was good because it broke everything into parts and it was hard to get behind, but it was also bad because sometimes you just learned to pass the exam and then didn't really remember much long term. Sometimes reading got overshadowed by studying for the exam because you knew that you could talk less in discussion but get a good exam grade."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! The material is very interesting and the Professor and TFs are overall amazing instructors!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I found the material fascinating and engaging.",
    "I would if this is a field of study they are genuinely interested in. What you put in is what you get out.",
    "Yes, especially to anyone interested in evolution\/human origins\/just explanations in general.",
    "YES! (especially to those people who need a science credit)\r\n\r\nThis course was super interesting, largely thanks to the professor. She made the topics relevant and interesting! Also, it's cool that humans are studying about humans *mind-blown*",
    "I'd recommend it if you're really interested in anthropology. It's not the best science credit class because it's a lot of memorization and your grade is mostly based off of quizzes, there are probably easier ones out there.",
    "YES. Incredibly interesting material, incredibly fair grading scheme, great professor and TAs, cannot go wrong.",
    "Yes. It is a great intro to anthropology and gives background knowledge to use in all sorts of environments.",
    "Yes! It's a wonderful science credit.",
    "Yes, if you're curious about human evolution and don't feel like doing a ton of work, this course is for you.",
    "Yes, this is a fair course to take as a science credit or as a survey of the subject. Professor Thompson and the teaching fellows are invested, readings are light. Would recommend a study group to keep worklead down.",
    "Yes! I absolutely would, its a fascinating course and its really accessible to everyone regardless of your field of study",
    "Yes, if you need a science credit and\/or are interested in learning about anthropology. Dr. Thompson set this class up for your success--there is no reason to not get an A or A-. As long as you pay attention in lecture and show up to section, you will be fine in this class. You don't even really have to do the readings.\r\n\r\nI learned a lot and feel that I can have greater discussions on certain topics like race as a construct, ethics in scientific research, and so much more. It wasn't life-changing but it was super interesting. Plus I got my science credit!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who needs to take a science credit but is not well-adapt to take science courses. It is interesting, but not too much of a burden.",
    "Absolutely! This course is very interesting and I really enjoyed Professor Thompson's lectures, which were always supplemented by memes and funny content, so there was never a dull moment in the class! I was always looking forward to this class. The workload is fairly light and getting a good grade is not hard if you work for it. Professor Thompson also connects the content to current day events, making us realise just how relevant this class is in contemporary society.",
    "Yes, this was a great course to get my science credit. No, it wasn't a gut but if you studied for the weekly quizzes you could do well in the class.",
    "Yes, I think the structure of the class is fair, and if you are not a science student you will learn a lot of interesting material  about human\/primate evolution and variation.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in biological anthropology. Intro Biological Anthropology is a great start to the study of human biology from an evolutionary perspective. It does a good job of tying in subjects as diverse as archaeology, medical anthropology, and environmental science among may others to provide a wholistic look at what science can tell us about ourselves. If the prospect of learning about our numerous human (or rather non-human) ancestors, studying fossils, and hearing about important finds doesn't immediately grab you, I will say that makes up a large portion of the course. However, that is by no means the course's only focusnitty-gritty evolutionary biology, sociocultural issues and implications, and current scientific findings are also addressed. Overall the course is well organized, well taught, and especially fun if taken with a friend. All topics might not be the most interesting to you, but if you pay attention and stay on top of the material (supplementary stuff can be fascinating too) you'll do well, learn a lot, and have a good time doing it.",
    "YES. This course is great for a science credit, but will also enrich your interaction with the world around you and other topic matter.",
    "Depending on the area of interest, I would likely recommend the course if it aligned with the indiviudal.",
    "I would recommend this course for students looking to learn more about anthropology. I do not recommend just taking this course for the science credit because there is a level of complexity but you do learn a lot.",
    "Yes! absolute great class, super interesting and amazing teacher.",
    "No, hard to engage with the material.",
    "Yes if they need a science credit or are interested in the subject.",
    "I would recommend this course for students who would like to learn more about evolutionary biology. Biological anthropology is a necessary counterdiscipline to the big claims made by evolutionary psychology.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you are extremely interested in biological anthropology and human evolution. It is a TON of memorization (even though Professor Thompson will stress learning the main idea) because the quizzes require you to know a very specific amount of information. If you aren't interested in the material, studying for the quizzes is very tedious and painful.",
    "Yes, it was a very interesting course overall!",
    "Yes! Professor Thompson is a great teacher who keeps lectures interesting and engaging. However, note that there are 9 quizzes\/exams in the course during the semester. This means there's a lot of steady work to keep up with the course, but it's also easier to get a high grade.",
    "I would recommend this as an easy science credit--and when I say easy, I mean it as a good thing because it makes science approachable and gives you relevant information while also challenging you and getting you out of your comfort zone. I also would recommend it because it connects science with current events and sociological stuff, which helps to make it memorable and teaches ways of thinking that you can apply to other areas."
