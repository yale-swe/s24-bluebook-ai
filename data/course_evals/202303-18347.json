                "I learned SO MUCH about children! Our course was split into three main themes: theory, curriculum, and policy. I felt I learned the most about theory, but the course did cover the other two themes in extensive detail. I also learned a surprising amount about myself as we had to reflect on our upbringing in the journals.",

                "Weaknesses were just that timing was pretty poor - lecture would tend to go over and into the time that was supposed to be allotted for sections. Wasn't a huge deal, but could make things seem disorganized. Also, issues with the technology in the classroom could get very frustrating - slides would go down and wouldn't be on canvas, etc.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Professors Close and Horwitz are both EXPERTS on kids, and it was such a privilege to hear their perspectives and learn from them.",
                "Strengths: the professors were great, the observations helped ground our readings, and the guest lectures were very interesting\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes we had technology troubles",
                "The professors and guest speakers are all amazing! Each lecture is quite interesting and I was able to connect a lot of things learned from the class to my observations within the daycare and with the child I observed.",
                "Discussion section at the end of the course was nice, although time didnt always allow for it.",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed the guest lectures, which offered extremely unique insights from professionals dealing with certain issues like Anti-Bias Education, speech pathology, and curriculum on the grounds. I thought the observations were extremely effective in learning theory on the ground.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: More organization in terms of lecture slides being uploaded onto Canvas."

                "Highly highly recommend! My favorite class I've taken at Yale by far - I was able to learn a ton in a very low stress setting and the professors are so experienced, knowledgeable, and passionate about the topic. It's also so fun to discuss and hear when others share about their own childhood experiences. Observing a daycare classroom was also a lot of fun.",
