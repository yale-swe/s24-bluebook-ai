These frameworks are applicable to other ethnic and racial groups that have faced systemic oppression.",
                "This course was an excellent exploration of the academic scholarship surrounding Black feminism. The course was a really in-depth understanding of the history, foundation and aspirations of Black feminist thought. Although I had an understanding of Black feminism before the class, I began to understand the full intellectual basis for some of the more everyday applications of Black feminism. It was also a really incredible exposure to the most foundational Black feminist scholars -- I'm so happy I finally read their work!",
                "I learned a lot about Black feminist theory, and different modes of engaging with it.",
                "This was the *best* class I've taken at Yale, and it's not close. Prof. Lewis is an absolute delight, is so incredibly accommodating, and strikes the perfect balance of intellectual rigor and creating a loving and empathetic learning community. I was challenged more by the content of this class than by any other class I've taken at Yale. That doesn't mean the class was inaccessible, quite the opposite. It was incredibly accessible, and the other students in the class added to the atmosphere."

                "1. Strengths: interesting subject, personal application to course topics\r\n2. Weaknesses: lack of a clear visual diagram exhibiting all theorists and areas of thought, many low engagement seminar discussions as a result of confusion on how to analyze course content and and lack of clear overarching structure, very high reading load that was not possible to complete each week to the level of mastery expected to be demonstrated in class",
                "Strengths of this course include the syllabus. It was an excellent array of thinkers and themes. We started with the more foundational pieces and ended with more recent revolutionary works. Our classroom was incredibly vulnerable and nurturing. We struggled through our material together, always trying to relate it to our own lives. \r\n\r\nMy first recommendation would be to add other types of materials to the syllabus. It would have been nice to have a few movies, songs, podcasts, etc. I think those mediums could have been accessible and offered a new perspective. My other suggestion would be for a little more structure to discussions, particularly during classes when we were struggling with the materials.",

                "Yes! If you're interested in the intellectual grounding of common Black feminist thought, you should definitely take this course. Anyone who claims to be a feminist should read these thinkers! It's hard to say you're Black feminist without ever reading Kimberle Crenshaw, for example :) \r\n\r\nFor me, this class was also an incredible space shared with other women of color. I really did feel like we built a little community. In that sense, it was unlike any other class I've taken at Yale!",
                "Absolutely.",
                "Yes, absolutely. If you can get in, please take this course. Prof. Lewis is here on a temporary appointment, so take it while you can. She's also one of the foremost scholars in her field!"
