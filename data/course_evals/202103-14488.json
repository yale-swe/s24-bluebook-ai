As a non-science major, I appreciate the ability to learn about a wide variety of fields in science to this level.",

I learned about key insights and discoveries in these areas, and the three-week modules on each were a great way to learn more about which areas of science interest me.",

I've had to extend myself beyond just the material we cover in class, so I've been able to research fascinating topics. I also became more skilled at collaborating with my peers, since the seminar format makes it easier to get to know my classmates."

                "I think the strengths of the courses involved the lecturers. I was a big fan of all of them. I feel the instructors and subjects chosen by the course creators were well done. I really think it's a big positive that Professor Kankel was present during every unit, even the ones he didn't teach. In general he was positive. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the weaknesses of the course, I can only think of two. There were instances where lectures felt like they got way over my head. As the lecturers are very accomplished and experienced in their fields, this is pretty natural. Still, I think that some things could have been taught one level below what they were. I also feel that occasionally the pace of the lectures is a tad slow.",
                "Strengths: we learn about a great breadth of science topics!\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the courses get hard to follow, especially when Dr. Kankel talks about biology",
                "Strengths: Ability to dip your toes into a topic without the commitment of a semester-long course on it, information-packed lectures, interesting class discussions and projects, modules covered pretty cool topics, reasonable workload. \r\nWeakness: Lacks the cohesion and depth of a class that focuses on a single topic.",
                "I think that the structure of this course is a strength. The lecture-quiz-project style gives me adequate time to work on something to the best of my ability and seek extra help. I believe that one way this course could be improved is with the introduction of an office hour for students to seek more guidance from the lecturer during that particular module."

                "Yes. It gives good exposure to students who may not be so interested in stem to the different advancements being made in the field. The workload isn't too much to handle and the course itself covers interesting content.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think it's a good way to learn about a lot of different areas of science, which would be great if that was the kind of thing one was interested in majoring in. It's also just a good way to explore a lot intellectually if you're not a science major. The instructors have valuable knowledge and insights.",
                "Yes! It is fun and has a nice small community",
                "I think this course is great for non-stem people who wants a manageable science course with a breath of topics.",
                "Yes. Prof. Kankel is extremely nice and even though its inevitable that youll like some of the modules more than others, this class is a great and very accessible introduction to cutting-edge science. I also appreciated that because each unit is so compressed, theres very little wasted timethe lectures move at a very good pace, where I didnt struggle to keep up but had lots of notes after every class.",
                "Yes! Having a small group of friends for an entire year is amazing! The personal connections are very meaningful and the information taught in class is fun, interesting, and relevant.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, because it provides the opportunity to discover niche science topics but not so in-depth that much prior knowledge is needed. I have found this course to be very interesting so far, and I am looking forward to future modules in the spring semester."
