                "This course was extremely beneficial towards my development as a writer. Professor Bozovic gives great feedback and is also more than helpful in the ideation+drafting process. The reading list was fantastic books that you should read anyway! Nabokov thought about literature and art in an interesting and idiosyncratic way. His novels and autobiography grant insight into that.",
                "I became a better writer and started looking for meaning in everything.",

                "I grew as a reader and a writer so much! The reading was challenging, but I feel like we as a class became so much more sophisticated thinkers because of it. Marijeta and TF John Stachelski also pushed me to develop my writing skills, and by the end I created a work I felt so proud of.",
                "This course was great. I learned a lot about Nabokov, his influences, the discourse around his work and writing style, and how he can be put in conversation with other authors. The best part of this course for me was the individualized attention the professor and teaching fellows gave students after each paper. I got wonderful advice on how to improve my writing, not just on Nabokov and literature but in general. The skills you learn from Prof. Bozovic are applicable in any course that requires writing, and she is just a fabulous teacher and person.",
                "I learned a lot about what Nabokov brings to the school of Modern, as well as the modes of reading that Nabokov teaches and advocates for. I also learned a lot about world literature and the role that it plays in intellectual discourses."

                "A lot of reading! Not a good or bad thing, but people should definitely come ready",
                "This was a fantastic course. I think one thing I would change is that it felt like we didn't get enough time to talk about any one book in particular because there were so many different novels to read. I think I would've preferred to do the same books except maybe remove Ada or Ardor, and one or two others and then have more in depth discussions in class about the novels. Another great aspect of the class was that professor Bozovic took a lot of time to look closely at various parts of the reading and give beautiful analyses of the passages in the novels providing for a really rich understanding of the text. I think something that could complement this really well would be to turn over a passage like this to the readers and ask students to summarize it and or what we had read in the session before. Even this very simple technique of asking students to summarize what we had read and then look at various significant passages from the students perspectives really helps.",
                "This course had an amazing reading list and wonderful writing feedback!",
                "Weaknesses: None! Strengths: Bozovic is a wonderful professor. Her lectures are interesting, engaging, and rich with insight. She also makes it a point to meet with each student individually to talk about their writing. The TAs were both great and led engaging sections.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Marijeta's availability and required meetings after papers\r\n- Slack",
                "Strengths: Professor Bozovic is awesome. She is brilliant, kind, and looking to help students improve. Her lectures were engaging and really cool. \r\nWeaknesses: The virtual aspect made the course  somewhat less engaging, but that was inevitable. Other than that, really no weaknesses of the course!",
                "Absolutely fantastic course. Professor Bozovic is amazing. The lectures are short and engaging, regular breakout rooms kept them lively, and the reading was obviously amazing. One of the highlights was the feedback on papers. Everyone gets a meeting with her, and she gives you two or three key things to look at rather than a barrage of tiny comments. The grading was generous and there was a very kind recognition of when you had put in effort. You were encouraged to have crazy ideas and write about them: at least fail spectacularly.",
                "This is a really great and engaging course which both offers an in-depth view of a fascinating author and provides a perspective on that authors impact across the rest of literature.",
                "fantastic prof",
                "Strengths: incredibly personal attention and genuine care from both professor and TF; very clear syllabus and organization; not too much work despite the heavy reading load (but I got away with not reading all the books and adjusting reading to fit what I could handle); only the 2 papers, weekly writing responses (very chill), and final paper\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: zoom and easy to opt out of live & watch recordings, which made engaging with the novels a bit more difficult; would have gotten more out of it if I came in with some background information on modernism/post-modernism culture and literature; a lot of reading",
                "It can be easy to fall behind on readings because there's just so much to get through, but the excitement of the Prof. Bozovic and the TFs about all of the course materials will make you want to stay on top of things! The strength of this course is that it makes reading and discussions about literature fun, and I have the instructors to thank for that. There's a lot of flexibility around choosing what to write on, which makes the work pleasurable and engaging all around. I can't think of any weaknesses, this course only offers strengths. By the end of it, I felt much more confident in my analytical reading and writing.",
                "Professor Bozovic is brilliant and very, very encouraging. One of the major strengths in this course was her passion and knowledge. I would say this class has no weakness. Sometimes it felt like there wasnt enough close reading analysis in section, but this may have been a product of the students and not the course itself, which highly encouraged deep analysis of Nabokovs language."

                "Definitely - I think this is an insightful and fascinating course for literature and non-literature people alike.",
                "Yes! The biggest hurdle was probably the raw amount of reading - There's quite a lot, and it's not the most light reading either - in the first part you'll be reading some huge novels by Nabokov (ranging from around 200 pages to over 500!) every week, and in the second, the novels are also pretty hefty. Nabokov's prose isn't the easiest to understand with how heavy it is with intellectual games, allusion, his idiosyncratic flowery style, etc. but if you have read a novel by him in the past and enjoyed it, you'll definitely enjoy it in the context of a course like this.",
                "anything with prof Bozovic is an absolute must take",
                "Yes, if your idea of a good literature class means reading good books by interesting authors. It is very nice that all the readings are the novels themselves, no commentary or secondary sources are required. Most of the students in the class want to be there and it shows, since the level of engagement in the class is quite high. I would recommend reading a book by Nabokov first to see if you like his style before you take the class.",
                "yes! marijeta was wonderful",
                "Yes!!!! Definitely take this course even if you aren't familiar with Nabokov/world literature. I grew so much because of it, and even though I didn't engage with every piece of work, if I frame it positively - I read 2-4 books I never would have read otherwise. Marijeta (prof) and John (TF) were so engaging, accessible, empathetic, personal, and intelligent. It was such a privilege to learn and grow with them. It is a dynamic class, learning from both peers, prof and TF, but also them learning from your own insights.",
                "Absolutely. If you have any interest in Russian literature or just want to read for pleasure (which is sometimes hard to do as a university student), this is the course. Prof Bozovic is amazing and I have no doubt this course would be wonderful in person.",
                "Absolutely. Nabokov is a fascinating figure both as a writer, but also as an intellectual. He teaches his readers about literature just as much as he passionately changes it. His role in modernist discourse is very enlightening."
