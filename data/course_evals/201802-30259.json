    "This course was highly enriching as the material covered both theories and case studies of issues surrounding race and inequality - most of which I did not have deep knowledge of. It has been an eye opener.",
    "Learned a lot about inequalities present and formed through public housing and its developments.",
    "This was a good class to start learning about Urban studies. It was definitely not an intro class, but Professor Barnes made the material accessible to those that weren't familiar with Urbanism."

    "Discussions were very lively and the professor's opinions were valuable. However, there might have been too much material planned initially.",
    "The class had good material for the most part and was a very interesting topic, especially with how relevant it is in the present. That being said, the readings weren't picked most efficiently  much of the class was reading two entire books, where most of the information we needed could be found in a few chapters therein and other necessary information could be quickly summarized in a class presentation. There was often missing class time because Prof. Barnes is often late to class."
