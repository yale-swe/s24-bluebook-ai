                "A wonderful, engaging professor. It would be great if midterms were actually designed for the allotted time we have.",
                "Don't think there are any glaring weaknesses. I absolutely loved Professor Chalioti. She was a huge strength in the course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Chalioti is very kind + enthusiastic, and the course is very well-organized. Weaknesses: Just very boring material - I supposed this can't be helped.",
                "Strengths: Professor and staff were great, office hours were incredibly helpful\r\nWeaknesses: Some material felt a bit rushed and their weren't that many exercises to practice with for exams",
                "Professor is passionate and really good at explaining the concepts. She does her best to make the really mathematical content of the course connect to real-world economics and the significance of what we're learning. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is still an entire course just full of Lagrange and math... \r\nAlso, would prefer some cleaner numbers on the PSET.",
                "The professor is very understanding and goes out of the way to make this semester's circumstances easier on the students. I also like that she both goes through lecture and does problems in class; many of my previous economics core courses did not do so many examples in class; they were only part of the PowerPoints. On the downside, I wish we could have gotten previous exams to study from; the problem sets are great study tools, but I think many students also wanted to see old content and study based off of those.",
                "The psets were excessively hard, but that was to be expected \r\n\r\nProfessor Chalioti is great at reviewing the topics covered in the class",
                "Strengths: Professor Chalioti is kind and caring about her students, and wants to make sure that we come away with a greater appreciation for microeconomics. Tests are fair, and problem sets are useful to prepare. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class should put a greater emphasis on the Ed discussion forum, since those forums tend to be a more lively place to ask questions. Many students were also confused about the content in the second half of the course (trade, supply, production), mainly because there were several lectures in succession in which it was unclear when to use certain approaches, and when to use others.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the class is just a lot of math, and sometimes, the problems seem needlessly complex from an algebraic standpoint. There should be practice exams available to students beyond what is available for the discussion sections.",
                "Difficult material, great professor.",
                "This course does a good job of building upon the topics covered in Introductory Microeconomics, although the podcasts did not do too much to increase my understanding of the topics.",
                "Strength: Structured lectures, loved that the professor reviewed content from previous lectures to set up for the current and future lectures.\r\nWeakness: Sections could be improved to be more helpful. They felt rushed.",
                "Sometimes too much content in lecture rushing through slides and hard to follow.",
                "I really liked the real world applications! Wording/clarity of some pset questions could be improved.",
                "Strengths: the sections do a great job of reinforcing learning\r\nWeaknesses: There's SO much material and I was upset that the final wasn't open book; even though I didn't need my notes in the final, I just would've been a lot less stressed preparing for it",
                "Strengths: \r\nCovered lots of interesting material, touching on central ideas on a variety of things. Very clear lectures, both in terms of conceptual presentation as well as working through problems. PSETS extended and practiced skills gained in lecture, and solutions posted which helped clarify any questions which might have existed. Grading was fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nOccasionally (though I think others exaggerate this point), felt like problems just required doing lots of algebra and relatively little intellectual engagement. Sometimes it felt like we covered things too superficially to really understand what was deeply going on, though there is some trade-off on this issue with how mathematically sophisticated the class is meant to be. Sometimes felt like material jumped around a little bit from topic to topic, though maybe this is a necessary feature of such a wide-ranging course. Lastly, since it is such a big lecture you don't get much personal feedback, but not much can be done to improve this point.",
                "Strengths: The material was presented in an engaging fashion (through powerpoint but also live \"problem-solving\" through an iPad) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course covered mainly the same principles as Econ 115 (Introductory microeconomics), although at a more rigorous level (with calculus). However, I would have liked to learn more about the applications of some of these concepts in the real world, as well as go into more depth with some of these theories.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Clear content that is structured\r\n- office hours phenomenal\r\n- lectures were clear\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Plug and chug, easy to get lost there instead of why it matters",
                "Section could be more engaging.",
                "Though the professor does a good job of explaining why economics are interesting, and does a good job of explaining the material, I think more could be done to explicitly demonstrate how the theoretical material is backed up by real-world data.",
                "strengths- eva is a great prof; very knowledgeable and understanding\r\nweaknesses- if you don't like econ this is an agonizing class",
                "Overall a very great course. The professor is excellent.",
                "This course is extremely math-heavy with very little effort dedicated to testing and/or teaching the conceptual nature of the content.",
                "Strengths: very organized, material builds on each other, very interesting\r\nWeaknesses: at times dense and overwhelming, felt like we couldn't spend too long on any one concept",
                "Best teacher.",
                "I found the professors style of showing example problems in class to be difficult to follow, as they often ended up in pages that were long and confusing to follow, which then made looking back at them and using them to study very difficult.",
                "Just more practice problems would be helpful",
                "Ample office hours and peer support",
                "I felt like I was stronger with monopolies, but struggled with economies with production. To improve, I could look online for extra resources as well as join office hours and reach out to professors for help.",
                "Strengths: Many resources, well taught\r\nWeaknesses: Easy to lose focus",
                "I think one weakness was that the information on the psets was only covered in section and we did not really go over it in class. A strength is the office hours and the examples that we do do in class.",
                "There was almost no review material given for midterm and exams. Often concepts not taught in lecture or section would be asked in exams and in problem sets which wasnt ideal.",
                "I think lectures were clear and the was a lot of extra help outside class which was good",
                "strengths: good progression through the topics, problem sets coincided well with the material, I learned effectively\r\nweaknesses: the second half of the course felt a bit more scattered than the first half. I felt like I had a weaker grip on the material after the midterm than before it.",
                "Very engaging material",
                "One strength of the course was the enthusiasm of the TFs and the professor. However, the course moved very fast and the psets were very time consuming considering the relatively small percentage of our final grade that they made up",
                "Not very organized, difficult to follow.",
                "One of the biggest strengths of this course is the way it is taught, both through lectures, discussion sections, and problem sets. The lectures allow the students to learn the theory and start to understand the mathematics behind solving problems, while the discussion sections review the more challenging problems with interesting / unique solutions, and the problem sets cement the students' understanding of the topics.\r\n\r\nHowever, this course did have one notable weakness: its lack of practice problems. I noted that the exams were difficult, not due to their inherent content but due to the lack of practice problems provided to review for the exams. While there were some problems provided, I wish there just were a larger number of problems given to practice with.",
                "Could have given better info during the lectures.",
                "Strengths: super well organized, clear psets\r\nWeaknesses: some psets were way longer than others?",
                "Strengths: Professor Chalioti cares a lot about students and keeps the class engaging \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class was too theoretical at times but mostly because of the nature of the material",
                "clear delivery by instructor, organized and well-paced psets and exams",
                "One of the biggest strengths of this course is that the professor works through problems in class, which is very helpful to understanding the material and thinking through the math.",
                "Strengths: Eva is a great professor who is really invested in student's learning. She has super clear lectures and is very available to chat with. Her exams are also pretty fair and don't try to trick you like other econ classes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many, beyond the fact that the content is not super interesting or relevant to the real world. Required for the major.",
                "The class in general was pretty interesting, just complex concepts behind it.",
                "I guess Prof. and instructors (and even IT support) did their best to cater to the needs of students at this critical juncture. So, I do not see any weaknesses. But, international students might need a bit more concern at this critical time.",
                "Professor Chalioti is such a nice professor who really does enjoy teaching the class. She made sure to make everything super fun. The class would have benefitted from more practice materials. There def was not enough in my opinion, like no practice exams from past semesters were given out.",
                "Strengths: Psets were very comprehensive, professor explanations were very clear.",
                "Strength: \r\n1. The instructor was organized, well prepared, and used class time efficiently.\r\n2. The instructor effectively explained and illustrated course concepts (e.g. using lecture notes).\r\n3. The course was organized in a manner that helped me understand underlying concepts.\r\n4.The assigned readings helped me understand the course material."

                "Yeah! The course is super interesting, although I assume you are only taking this for a requirement for a major. Definitely take with Professor Chalioti though, she is an absolute gem and one of the best professors I have ever had at Yale.",
                "Not unless you need it for Econ/Global/EPE etc. You basically just practice doing calculus/algebra, I don't feel like I learned any more economics than I did in intro micro, but it was still stressful since exams are a time-crunch and psets often have long math problems to trudge through. I'd say it's low intellectual challenge but high workload. That said, the Professor (Eva) is so sweet and enthusiastic, the TFs are great, and overall the course was very well-organized.",
                "Kinda, I only took the course because it was required for my major. If you are not taking the course as a pre-req, I would recommend you just take intro-micro instead.",
                "Only take the course if you need it as a requirement, or for future courses that require this as a requirement.",
                "Sure for completing your major requirements",
                "Most people take the class because they have to, but if you really like math and economics, you could have fun in this class.\r\n\r\nIt is A LOT of math, though, so if you don't like math and don't need this class, maybe take something else.\r\n\r\nThe class does have good applications if you're looking to take other classes in the department, like climate change economics with Nordhaus, for example.",
                "Yes if you need to. Otherwise, probably not. If you took high school econ and are debating between this and 115, take this!! This class was very much a repeat of ECON 115 with an emphasis on mathematical techniques (mainly LaGrange) to build upon the ideas introduced in 115. If you have the sufficient math background for it ie. a decent grasp on calc and know/are willing to self study LaGrange and partial derivatives, take this over 115! Chalioti is not the most engaging lecturer and sometimes the material can feel muddled. The problem sets can also be annoying since they will often involve tedious math with not clean solutions that you sometimes need a calculator for so I wish the numbers were nicer so that it was more conducive to learning the material",
                "If you have just taken intro to micro and were very excited by the topics, I would recommend you take this class to deepen your understanding and expand your economic toolkit.",

                "Required for econ but also some topics were really cool; I really liked game theory and I also liked thinking from the firm's perspective",
                "Yes. This covers a wide variety of interesting and applicable microeconomics questions, and also provides a foundational set of concepts and tools which can be used in future classes or just in your thinking in general. Prof. Chaltioti is a very clear lecturer, and although the math can get tedious that is how you derive the results, and practice makes perfect, so you get better by doing it.",
                "Yes, only if you are considering the Econ major. Otherwise, it is basically a repeat of Econ 115, but with calculus.",

                "Honestly, only if its required.",

                "Yes",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the subject.  Although you learn more than you learned in intro micro, a lot of the models are still generalized past the point of being realistic which can be frustrating.  So worth taking if you need it for your major, but if you just want to know some econ, intro micro is enough.",
                "if you are really interested in the more mathematical modeling side of microeconomics! I took this as a non-major and ended up credit/d-ing it because I was having trouble keeping up, but the material was very interesting",
                "Well, if you need it as a requirement, you need to take it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student that has taken ECON 115 or equivalent, as it builds on the knowledge of introductory microeconomics and strengthens one's math skills. It offers an interesting approach to many topics, and provides better context (with mathematics) and intuition for the relationships between different economic theories and concepts.",

                "You probably need this class for your major if you're taking it (Global Affairs, Econ, or EPE) so I would say yes amongst all of the choices to fulfill this requirement. Definitely take this class with Eva as she is such a sweetheart and always full of energy and enthusiasm. I'll also add that you don't need a strong math background to do well in this class  I only took Math 112 and while I found the course difficult, it wasn't due to the calculus but rather the broader methods in general. The only calculus we use is derivatives (total and partial derivatives) and the langrange multiplier, all of which we learn in class and are pretty straightforward.",
