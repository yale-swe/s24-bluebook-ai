I enjoyed having Professor Schroers as a teacher and his mindset of teaching the basics without creating the hardest problems ever for the sake of \"challenging the Yale students\" is refreshing. Slides can be a little chaotic and no solutions are posted for psets or exams but the textbook is great and matches lectures well as an additional resource.",
