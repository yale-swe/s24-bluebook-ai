I enjoyed having Professor Schroers as a teacher and his mindset of teaching the basics without creating the hardest problems ever for the sake of \"challenging the Yale students\" is refreshing. Slides can be a little chaotic and no solutions are posted for psets or exams but the textbook is great and matches lectures well as an additional resource.",

                "Yes! Professor Schroers is great, and problem sets\/exams are fair.",
                "This was a required course for me, but it was a genuinely interesting class. For non mechanical engineering majors or those not on the ABET track, materials science would be a good class to try."
