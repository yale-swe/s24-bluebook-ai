Overview of the policies that drove innovation to meet the regulatory standards. Lots of other background on the improvements over generations of addressing environmental issues.",
                "I learned the fundamentals of evaluating water and air pollution (mass balance always applies!) and the basics of assessing pollutant risk. I also learned about the remediation of water pollution via wastewater and drinking water treatment (sedimentation, activated sludge, removal of biological oxygen demand, denitrification, chemical treatment ... the list goes on!). I will never look at a smokestack plume the same, will never smoke in an Iowa basement, and will always think about the integrity of the groundwater supply when I see a dry cleaning plant or a gas station.",

                "Strengths: Professor Fortner. Great lecturer, engaging, and caring, and created a positive learning environment. \r\nWeakness: Textbook is a little old, but only really exposes its age in the section about climate change.",
                "No recommendations to improve, I enjoyed it.",
                "Strengths: the lectures and homework adequately prepare you for the exams. Exams had a qualitative(closed book) and quantitative(open book) portion. 50\/50 \r\nWeaknesses: The course itself was informational, but not very rigorous. However, it is just an intro course.",
                "This course had a proper level of focusbroad enough to feel like a comprehensive introduction, but in-depth enough to feel like it gave us a comprehensive understanding of each topic. Professor Fortner also worked hard to make class a welcoming and accessible environment. He, himself, is a clear strength of the coursehe clearly cares about the success and wellbeing of his students, and that made it feel good to be taught by him (and his stories were wonderful! Only exceeded in quality by his not-to-scale diagrams). One thing that could possibly be improved is the level of organization of the course. There were a few times when I wasn't exactly sure, based on the syllabus and on his communications with the class, what specific reading I should do on a given weekend. Professor Fortner was always quick to respond to any questions over email, but it could be beneficial if that communication were proactive and shared with the whole class. Other than that small area of improvement, however, the course was great.",
                "I liked the content of this course. I think my engagement could have been a little bit better, but the professor was great and did a good job of explaining important concepts and applying relevant examples. I also thought the professor did a great job of applying concepts to real examples and legislation.",
                "Great professor, great coverage of materials. My only complaint is that taking this course as a first-year can be challenging because it uses a lot of physics and chemistry equations that you don't really learn yet, which makes it hard to understand.",
                "Very high contrast between what is covered in lecture and the psets and the exams. Lectures were very superficial and broad content, psets were very technical and calculation based and complicated. Exams reflected this. Also lectures were quite disorganized in terms of the sequence of content covered (went back and forth jumping between things)",
                "There are no weaknesses. Professor Fortner is fantastic! He is extremely interesting and is a great professor and person. I learned so much during this course due to his commitment to the course and his fantastic teaching abilities.",
                "The professor is great but the tests can be challenging.",
                "I would have wished that the lectures were recorded. Other than that, the course was amazing. Loved the professors teaching, slides were shared, important and interesting topics were explored.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are engaging (Fortner is funny and includes really interesting examples), exams are fair (made from problem sets)\r\nWeaknesses: PSets are not manageable without TF help, class material does not thoroughly cover PSet material (lectures are more qualitative, PSets more quantitative, though textbook is very useful for the PSets)",
                "This course offers a great overview of environmental engineering that doesn't get too bogged down in the details. The only thing I could think of that would improve the course is providing examples for problems in the p-sets that weren't covered in the book or lecture. However, these problems are not the majority and can be reasonably figured out once you figure out what equation to start with!",
                "One thing I wish this course had more of is walking through problems on the board. This helped clarify things for me"

I would highly recommend courses in this department over EVST if you are actually interested in learning tangible information about ways to combat environmental issues-- you come away from these courses having learned something and been exposed to skills to help solve environmental problems. About the average amount of work required for a STEM course.",

                "I would recommend this course to another studentin fact, I already have. I took this course as a junior humanities major who had not studied chemistry since their sophomore year of high school. I found it incredibly enjoyable and relatively low-stress. Unlike the other science courses I have taken at Yale (courses tailored for non-STEM students), it felt like I was actually learning things. I was challenged at some points (e.g., some questions on the homeworks took time to figure out, and I had to review some chemical concepts in a way that others in the class did not) but never in an existential way. And we went on a field trip to a wastewater treatment plant (optional, but how could you turn an option like that down?)!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they wish to explore Environmental Engineering and get a sense of what it is all about.",
                "Interesting but high workload for psets",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course for the aforementioned reasons.",

                "Yes I would highly recommend! Although it moves quickly through a lot of topics, dont be intimidatedthe homeworks\/exams are focused on key concepts that Prof Fortner is very clear about. This course offers a lot of great information about many different aspects of environmental engineering, from water treatment to air pollution, and is a great way to find out more about the major or to discover a research area you might want to explore in the future!",
                "Yes! Very manageable workload, interesting\/relevant material, and Fortner is flexible and engaging.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I am a non-stem major that took this for a distributional requirement and I found it very reasonable. It is certainly not a gut per se but if you a reasonable amount of time and effort into the material you will do well. Professor Fortner was absolutely fantastic, an extremely kind and enthusiastic teacher who wants everyone to succeed.",
                "Yes! This is a great class",
                "Yes, because it really does touch every bit of environmental cases and helps one to decide on the major",
