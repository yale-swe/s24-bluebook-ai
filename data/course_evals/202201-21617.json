                "Strengths: Lim Ssn is amazing and kind. The class dynamic is excellent and really conducive to learning. Everything is explained really well Weaknesses: Maybe a hot take but I do wish we were exposed to more new grammar and vocabulary. It still feels like actual native speech uses many more grammar points and words than we know and I wish we saw more of that. I also liked the few times we used actual Korean content (on Youtube etc) as a learning tool and wish we did that more (maybe even a majority of the time....)",
                "Strengths: Lim ssn!!! The class was well-organized, and Lim ssn was able to foster a really nice class dynamic.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: This is a class where you can learn Korean in a pressure free environment.  Mistakes are learning opportunities, and the class and professor are all extremely supportive.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.  This is the most fun I've had in any class at Yale.",
                "PHENOMENAL CLASS WITH PASSIONATE INSTRUCTOR!!!!",
                "I thought the course was great in terms of structured learning and going over topics and themes in an orderly fashion. I wished the course had involved more speaking, particularly in improvised/impromptu scenarios, as that is a skill I feel could be worked on more. I would also love to do more listening exercises whenever possible.",
                "Im Ssn. is an incredible teacher and the pacing of the course was flexible and well-thought-out. The tests, in-class worksheets, and instructor lectures felt adequately challenging and balanced."

I definitely still think that the best way to learn a language is not in a class but rather through engaging with cultural materials directly, but this class was definitely worth it because of the comfortableness I feel with certain grammar points and how nice the atmosphere was .",
                "Yes.  If you are in L3 and you have the opportunity to continue on, you absolutely should.  Not only will you learn a ton and have your Korean improve drastically, but due to the kind and supportive learning environment, you'll gain confidence in your abilities too.",
                "ABSOLUTELY, WITHOUT A DOUBT!!!!",
