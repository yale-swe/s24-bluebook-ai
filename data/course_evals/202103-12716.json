            "comments": [
                "I learned how to code in Programming and Arduino as well as CAD skills in Onshape and 3D printing. I also learned about the various engineering disciplines and how to approach engineering solutions to problems.",
                "Learned some CAD, programming, and about different fields of engineering.",
                "This class was the best engineering 101 to take. I learned everything from programming to CAD, and I was able to fine tune my skills I had beforehand like electronics and machining. I learned things beyond designing and mechanics, I learned about commercialization of products and how to simplify processes.",
                "Going into this class, I has little to no engineering experience. This class was a complete crash course on all the equipment, coding and CAD used in the projects. I learned so much during this class--probably more than any other this semester, in terms of practical knowledge and skill gained. I am so thankful this class allowed me to become so familiar with the CEID early in my Yale career, and it opened my eyes to both the fun and the commitment it takes to carry out engineering projects to the end. The first part of the course,  learning about different branches of engineering and gaining a base-line knowledge in coding and equipment, could be both a bit boring and frustrating, but office hours were extremely helpful and the things we learned in the first half were so valuable to our projects later on. \r\nThe second half of the class, like I said, was full of hands-on learning and insight into engineering at Yale that I am so lucky to have gotten in an introductory course.",
                "I learned basic overviews about the different subsets of engineering. I developed many unique skills in a workshop setting that can be applied to building and manufacturing. I also learned much about long-term group work and the planning needed for that.",
                "The basics of electrical, mechanical, chemical, and environmental engineering. How to ask for help during first semester of college. How to use CEID resources. How to use office hours. How to design and prototype a solution for a client with a real world problem.",
                "Skills: Engineering design, prototyping, CAD, programming and electronics for Arduino, Processing language, introductory circuits and sensors\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the semester, Yale-based clients give projects for groups of 3-5 to work on. This is the part where your knowledge from the first half of the semester really gets tested, and where you learn extra skills that are needed for your particular project, eg. some groups had to use wi-fi connectivity, bluetooth, and email functions with their Arduinos, while other groups had to learn more mechanical skills like working with gears or water pumps.",
                "During the first half of the semester, we study a different type of engineering every week to have an idea about what it looks like. Electrical engineering and CS were some of the first ones as they are useful for Arduino, which is heavily present throughout the course. After that, we start working on projects and it was very helpful to learn more about design thinking, CAD (computer-aided design), 3D printing, soldering, coding, Arduino, sensors.",
                "I learned so so much in this course. I learned how every type of engineering works, learned about CAD and onshape, got a taste of coding and programming, and my favorite, a bit of electrical engineering and how wiring works. I came into this class with almost no knowledge on engineering, and I feel like I have come out with a lot more skills. I also learned how to work in a team more effectively with the final project.",
                "How to define and approach a problem, work through the iterative process, evaluate possible solutions, choose between them, and work with an actual client. In terms of more technical skills, I learned how to make circuits, program an Arduino, use different kinds of sensors, work with CAD, and 3D print.",
                "This course helped me gain a better understanding of the various areas of engineering and develop some basic coding, 3D printing, and engineering skills. It also helped me understand the process of developing a solution from idea to prototype to functional product.",
                "What engineering is and what it is like. Practical skills of engineering (soldering, coding, CAD-ing, etc.). What are common tools/equipment/sensors for engineering and how they are used. How to work well in a team.",
                "Knowledge:\r\nI learned what it takes to be an engineer and create a device based on a problem. \r\nThrough creating a device, I learned how to use an arduino, how to 3d print, how to laser cut how to ideate, how to innovate and more.\r\n\r\nSkills:\r\nCollaborating with teammates on ideas and actually designing/ working on those ideas\r\n\r\nInsights:\r\nWhat it means to be an engineer, how to come up with a good idea",
                "A lot of new knowledge of engineering and design with a lot of hands on work, that helped me think the way engineers do. I learned all about different types of engineering and used them. That way I have seen how each of them has different challenges.",
                "This class helped me learn a lot about the engineering field. We surveyed multiple different disciplines of engineering and also performed various labs that applied to each. It was very insightful. The final project also allowed us to bring all those ideas together and really see how to create something ourselves.",
                "I learnt a lot about the different fields of engineering and how to apply it to real-world problems",
                "I learned about every type of engineering and their basic principles. I also got to experiment with each one through the labs.",
                "I learned about different types of engineering and gained collaboration skills in a STEM setting",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Instructors were very dedicated, general atmosphere of peer group was collaborative and welcoming.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures and homeworks in the first half of the course were sometimes boring. In the second half of the course, the instructors expected 6 hours per week of additional work in the CEID outside of class time, but this was not communicated anywhere on the syllabus.",
                "Strengths: Very engaging labs, great intro to the CEID's resources, teaches you about all the types of engineering, really flexible office hours, great feedback from the teachers, free Yale engineering swag\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of extra work outside of class, especially in the weeks of the final project.",
                "It was a very fun course.",
                "Strengths: you get to work closely with the Dean of engineering (incredibly funny, nice, and helpful) and Larry aka the coolest and most knowledgeable engineer; the psets are just challenging enough to keep the class fun but also not a gut; you learn a LOT about teamwork and collaboration, or else you will probably not do well on PSETS, its okay to ask for help! ;you learn about the variety of engineering Weaknesses: you dont go into an insane amount of detail for each type of engineering; if you get assigned a good group youre set and work isnt so bad, if you have people credit/d/failing you might have to put in a more significant amount of time",
                "Weaknesses: The first part of the class could be a bit of a drag sometimes, but it was also fairly light on workload and was easy warm up to the class. I did feel like the separate units (divided by types of engineering) were not super useful in helping students choose which branch of engineering they were interested in--all the units instead just functioned as an introduction to generally useful equipment, methods and tools for engineering projects. While it did not help me get a great picture of the difference between different engineering branches, the beginning of the class was still very useful (especially for someone with barely any experience with coding or building) and Larry and Dean Vince were always very helpful and understanding during office hours. \r\n\r\nAnother possible weakness is how much the time commitment of the class varies. This is not really a weakness, as long as students are aware what they are getting into--the class starts very low on the time commitment, so students should come in fully aware that once the project-based part of the class starts they will be spending a lot of time in the CEID. It's great, but they need to be sure they are willing to spend a lot of time on this class later in the semester.\r\n\r\nThe last weakness is that because so much of the class is project-based, a lot of your experience in this class will depend on which project you are assigned and who your teammates are. All the projects are very cool, so that isn't too much of a worry, and you will be supported by the instructors no matter who your group is. Most students in class spend a huge amount of time on their projects by choice, but keep in mind that this class is huge on the group-work aspect and everything that entails (but this is also a positive thing and really useful to learn as an engineering student).\r\n\r\nStrengths: SO MANY. This class was my biggest time commitment once the project started, but it was so worth it. The satisfaction of finishing a project at the end of the semester was unparalleled, and the guidance we had along the way was constant. There was never a moment I did not feel supported by the instructors. The projects were SO COOL. We got so much access to awesome equipment for free, and so many chances to learn how to use it. I can not stress enough how much cool, hands-on engineering we got to do, considering most of the class was freshmen. The 3D printers were always running for our class, and the energy in the CEID was amazing toward the end of the semester.",
                "The strengths are that the CEID provides the perfect environment for this class, letting each final project create almost whatever they can dream up. A weakness could be that since there is no selecting groups or topics for the final project, you may be stuck with a 1/2 semester project that you don't necessarily enjoy (Not me, just could happen).",
                "Weaknesses could be more formal checkpoints of knowledge like exams or quizzes. Lectures could have used slides to present information more clearly. More meeting classmates and group activities.",
                "Strengths: the course is really engaging because the projects are all challenging but interesting. Larry and Dean Vince are great lecturers and really helpful when you have any kind of question about your project. \r\n\r\nNot sure this course has any weaknesses. It's a lot of work, but that's something that you decide to accept going in.",
                "I think it was organized greatly, the professors and TAs are amazing, and it was most of all, very interesting. The class required a lot of time and effort, but it was very enjoyable. This was easily my favorite class of the semester.",
                "Strengths: a very clear presentation of the different types of engineering, the weekly assignments are easy to follow, the office hours and support outside of class are incredibly helpful, during the final project, the professors guide you through every step but give you enough room to learn how to work with your client.\r\nWeaknesses: teams for the final project are randomly allocated and sometimes don't produce the best matches. Some weekly assignments are way more challenging than others, so the workload can change week to week during the first semester.",
                "Strengths: The final project (it was a great look into what exactly a career in engineering could/would look like, and the project itself was also very interesting and people wanted to work on it for the sake of having a good final product, not just for a grade). The professors (they are equally, in not more, invested in the project as you are. They are also very reasonable and are willing to help you in any way they can. \r\nWeaknesses: The only thing is that in the first half, the workload is about a 2/not alot, then when the final project starts about halfway through the semester, the workload really ramps up. This can't really be fixed though, and I would not change anything about the course.",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe design project: Learning what it means to actually BUILD and ideate something that comes from a problem that needs to/ could be addressed\r\nWorking with clients in one of the Yale departments\r\nWorking with a team for over 5 weeks and collaborating\r\nDean Vince , Larry, the design aids, and the TFs who helped teach how to code/ 3D print/ laser cut/ solder and more.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nAlthough the first 5 weeks of the class were very informative and provided an overview of each engineering department they were not as exciting as the last 6 weeks mostly because the last 6 weeks involved a design project. However, they do help you learn how to arrange wires on an arduino and breadboard to create just about anything in any discipline of engineering.",
                "Strengths: Very helpful when it came to learning about engineering and the teachers were very helpful aswell\r\nWeaknesses: Time consuming towards the very end but managable",
                "Strength: Very hands on!! Great course for anybody interested in engineering disciplines. Honestly nothing bad about this course! From the curriculum to the professors and mentors, everything about this class was amazing. If I could, I would definitely retake this class!\r\n\r\nWeakness: Very time consuming (But this isnt really a flaw as all hands on projects should take time)",
                "Strengths are the numerous people there to help and weakness would be the amount of work required at the end of the term.",
                "I greatly enjoyed the course",

                "Yes, if they are relatively inexperienced in engineering and looking for a solid overview of the major subdisciplines.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who's thinking about majoring in engineering since from what I've heard, it's one of the few really hands-on engineering courses at Yale. However, although the beginning of the class has a relatively light workload, it really ramps up in the last 8 weeks due to the final project. You will spend a lot of time in the CEID working, but it's definitely fun work to the point that I spent time working for this class to procrastinate on my work in other classes. Nevertheless, it's really amazing to be able to actually design a solution to problems that the clients present from scratch!",
                "Yes",
                "Yes I would especially if you are interested in engineering but not totally set. The quality of mentorship and resources is unlike any other introductory course I have taken so far and just the people are fun to work with. This class was never a burden and only a good time.",
                "YES. If you are interested in getting a feel for engineering at Yale, take this class. If you are willing to put in the work and want to complete an engineering project, take this class. It is insane how much someone is able to accomplish and learn in this class without much prior experience. Do not be intimidated if you are sure you'll be able to keep up--the level of experience student to student varied greatly, but everyone grew a lot and the professors were so helpful. This class isn't for everyone, but I came into Yale wanting to get a feel for whether I was interested in engineering, and this class was brilliant. The amount of resources and support I got in this class truly made me remember that I was at a world-class institution with amazing resources and teachers.",
                "Yes. If you like to build/design/make things, this course helps teach the baselines and beyond. I would not recommend to someone who is looking for a gut class. You need to be very involved in order to have the best experience.",
                "Yes especially for students interested in interdisciplinary learning and for hands on activities. A break from traditional STEM lecture courses.",
                "This class is so rewarding, I would recommend this course to any student interested in engineering. My favorite part  was that it was so hands-on. The first half of the semester, you listen to lectures on different types of engineering (electrical, BME, meche, etc), and then the same week, you get to apply those concepts in lab, such as by making a certain kind of circuit and program with the Arduino. \r\nYou get exposed to so many different engineering concepts, and I can directly name so many concrete skills/knowledge that I gained from this course and some useful applications for them, which is a great feeling that isn't always given by more theory-based courses. \r\nThe one detail I have to mention is that in the second half of the course, there's a HUGE jump in workload. In the first half of the semester, I didn't need to do any work outside of class and lab hours. In the second half, I spent 10+ hours in the CEID every week working with my group on our project. Out of the classes I took this semester, this one was the most work but also the most rewarding.",
                "Definitely! It is a great course with an emphasis on hands-on learning. For the final projects, you work on real problems for clients and it is an amazing experience to work on the solution. The class is entirely in the CEID, which is also an extremely positive aspect of the class to improve your engineering skills, especially as a freshman or sophomore.",
                "If you are considering engineering, but not sure if it's for you, or not sure what type of engineering you should go into, I highly highly recommend this course. It is very intro and accessible to anyone, even if you have no knowledge on engineering.",
                "If you are remotely interested in engineering, I highly recommend this class. It gives you an overall picture of the various engineering disciplines, what each focuses on, and the abilities needed to major in each of them. The final hands-on project is very engaging and teaches you the progress behind designing and creating a solution. Even if you decide not to go into engineering after taking the class, the tools and abilities you will learn in class can help you approach almost any problem.",
                "yes, especially to students looking for a hands-on introduction to engineering! It was very fun to work in the CEID on a unique problem with a team and a client.",
                "Absolutely. This was one of the best classes I have ever taken. This course was great to help you decide if you really like engineering and if you could see it in your future. Also, the final project was extremely rewarding and really helps you learn and develop very practical skills. The final project is a lot of work, but I found myself actually wanting to do the work, not just to get it done. Also, the professors are very understanding and helpful. Another nice thing is that your grade feels like more of a completion grade. That's not to say that it is easy to get an A, but you can be certain that if you put in the work (especially with the final project), then you will get the grade you want.",
                "Yes for any student that is interested in engineering or even might be. Although this course is not a distributional requirement, you get to build, design and innovate a device that could potentially be used by the University, state, world you name it. Not to mention that you are building your resume by creating a device in less than 5 weeks and working with a team on it. Plus, if you believe your device is good enough at the end of the semester, you can continue working on it through the Center of Engineering over the summer and continue to build on that resume.",
                "I would recommend if you are interested at all in engineering.",
                "Highly recommend! ENAS 118 is my favorite class that I have ever taken!!!",
                "I believe this course is a good insight into the real world of engineering, so if engineering is one of your interests i recommend this class.",
