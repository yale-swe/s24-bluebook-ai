    "Yes! It was a really interesting and exciting course. Our discussions made three hour long classes fly by. We got to look at classic movies in a new light, and were provided with ample background information to aid our in-depth analyses. It's intriguing to pick a film apart and identify all of its flaws, nuances, and triumphs.",
    "Sure. Getting better knowledges about musicals is beneficial for our reading and critical thinking skills. Also, it provided us with more background sources when we learnt about the history of certain eras."
