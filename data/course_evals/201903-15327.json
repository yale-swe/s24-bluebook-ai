   "comments": [
    "Banko does this thing where she doesn't explore the conflict in a boring linear way, she studies it narrative by narrative, story by story. This gave me a better sense of each nation's imagined history and the main points of contention between the two. Readings sometimes get a little theoretical and push the reflection beyond the historical facts and into a-- very muddy -- philosophical realm.",
    "I learned to be a better writer and think critically about controversial issues",
    "I learned more about the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the implications of the history in the modern conflict, and the different meanings of the ideologies. This course was my favorite this semester, and I learned I have a true passion for these issues.",
    "A comprehensive overview of the ideologies and histories between the states of Palestine and Israel, touching upon content from all the back in the Ottoman Empire all the way up to today. Creates an amazing, in depth foundation of understanding the development and growth of the conflict.",
    "This course presented a very comprehensive history and study of the conflict in Palestine starting in the Ottoman era and going through the Second Intifada. Whereas this conflict is very difficult to study, as most histories of it are quite biased, this class presented a generally even and neutral portrayal of the conflict with sources and historical perspectives from both the Palestinian and Israeli voices. In addition, apart from the class content, as a small lecture, we were able to all practice how to question, debate, and discuss such a difficult topic as Dr. Banko often moderated and directed the conversation to be constructive rather than destructive.",
    "Banko is amazing! Love her! This class is a great primer to Israel Palestine and an understanding of the important ideologies and personalities connected to the conflict. I really like how Banko exposes you to many different parts of Israel Palestine so its not an end all be all, but a survey in a sense of the conflict",
    "Professor Banko exposed me to new ways of approaching the issues focused on in class.",
    "This course provided a great overview of Israel Palestine conflict. It is rooted in more of the origins and history of the conflict and less on the present day.",
    "This course helped students think critically about the dynamics and history that has shaped conflict, national identity, and ideology in Israel and Palestine. Professor Banko helped students expand their personal understandings of contemporary conflict while historicizing the issues.",
    "A very good foundation for understanding the Israel Palestine conflict."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Maybe there was too much content, and it truly pains me to say it, but I think less would have made for a better structure in the course. The great strength of this class for me was how the conflict was tackled narrative by narrative, ideology by ideology instead of event by event.",
    "Some of the lectures got off track as we had varying discussions, but the overall structure and content of the course was amazing.",
    "Again, one of the biggest strengths of the course was how evenly and complete all the information was presented. It really did not feel as though one specific point of view was being supported or denied which was a very unique experience, largely guided by Dr. Banko who clearly is such an expert on the topic to where she was able to navigate conversations about the history that was very comprehensive. If anything, the only weakness was that sometimes the lectures felt a little all over the place; the slides could be a little overwhelming and it was hard to feel as though we were going in order rather than jumping all over the place. I think maybe having clearer lecture slides would be helpful. The assignments were really well spaced and actually really great ways to individually explore topics that we were each interested in. Having the class as a small lecture is a seemingly perfect format as we were able to have conversation while still being taught the information by Dr. Banko.",
    "I think a strength is that Banko is very well researched in the issue and there are really interesting topics and ideas that she talks about. However I would say that I wish the class had more discussion but otherwise it was great",
    "The course presented both sides which is very important when discussing a polarizing issue.",
    "As a small lecture, this course was wonderful. Professor Banko helped field questions that related to the subject matter and allowed the class to involve itself. The only real weakness to this course arose out of this strength - it was easy for the class to get tangentially side-tracked, which I felt made covering all the relevant information difficult.",
    "The lectures were extremely informative and engaging, and so were a lot of the readings. I would say one thing might be to have fewer readings and really tell us what we should focus on in the readings."

   "comments": [
    "YES. It is rare to see a teacher who is brave enough to teach this conflict and even rarer to see one who does it as honestly and passionately as Lauren Banko. Seize this chance to challenge your view on the conflict and to think critically about the concepts surrounding it: Nationalism, colonialism, legitimate violence. The material in the readings is fascinating, subverts expectations and rattles your beliefs on the conflict, whatever those are. Banko is extremely knowledgeable on the topic and will be there for you with every question you have.",
    "If you do not know enough or anything about the conflict and want to learn about the real history of these issues, I highly recommend taking this class.",
    "Absolutely. Not only is the content of the class extremely fascinating, but Professor Banko is an excellent historian with a plethora of information to share with the class that facilitates the development of new, informed perspectives on the historical conflict between Palestine and Israel.",
    "100%! Too often, people talk about Israel-Palestine while having quite literally no deep background on the subject at all, but rather form opinions on a very serious topic from superficial information. It is such a treasure to have Dr. Banko, who is clearly such a well-read, well-studied expert on the subject at Yale. The history from 1888-present is so interesting especially when honing in on Palestine as a region considering that usually this time period is recognized for other global events, overlooking the massive events that took place in the region at the time which have inevitably led to our present day situation. This is a very nuanced history course with room to use the assignments for historical analyses or perhaps a more social science analysis.",
    "Yes if you are interested in the topic. There are a lot of readings and tbh I didnt do all of them but there are only 4 assignments and you can get away with it, but you are sacrificing the knowledge on those readings",
    "I would certainly recommend this course as a gateway to expanding a student's knowledge and understanding of the contemporary middle east. I believe this course fits well in a cannon of non-Western or Western critical studies that simultaneously acknowledge the impact of European culture and colonialism on the middle east.",
    "Yes, absolutely."
