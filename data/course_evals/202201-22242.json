Developed intuition on how legislative policy lags behind technological innovations.",

                "The strength is that the course is a relatively low-workload class despite it teaching students essential things. The weakness is that some concepts were brushed over too quickly; this may have been a me problem though, because I did not have much training in science during high school.",
                "Strengths: Material is very approachable (especially for non-STEM majors) yet relevant to modern-day. Second half of the semester is spent learning from guest experts in various fields.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class is poorly organized; if you miss a class, it is not recorded and lecture talks provide information not adequately covered in slides. Midterm was a time-crunch, even if you knew all the content going in beforehand. Grading is very confusing and not transparent at all (done using a GPA conversion that is poorly explained and implemented). Although Professor Prober is an expert in his field, many times he would interrupt guest lecturers to comment on his own accomplishments which came off as quite rude. PSets were busy-work on content that was not properly introduced in class (but the TA was very helpful!!).",
                "Strengths: First half of term lectures were very interesting and informative; weaknesses: second half of term guest lectures were a bit hit-or-miss and sometimes very boring.",
                "The grading disparity for the psets was a bit difficult but otherwise fantastic class.",
                "Excellent science credit if you have some prior knowledge of the history of various modern technologies over the past 80 years.",
                "Strengths: it was cool to have guest lectures, problem sets were frontloaded so not bad at all, final project was great, no final exam - overall definitely a good gut science class\r\nWeaknesses: classes often went far too deep into how the different technologies worked, even though a lot of the concepts weren't on the midterm, as a result it was easy to space out in a lot of lectures",
                "I think this class exposes students to the various fields in STEM, from bio technology, to energy related technology to social and technical issues associated with machine learning algorithms. There were several guest lecturers who came in to explain several modern technologies and policies and how they apply in the real world. Weakness: it's easy to zone out during discussions \/ lectures.",
                "I think that Professor Prober makes the course very manageable in the workload but fails to make the content interesting.",
                "Unfair grading TA",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Detailed lectures\r\n- Friendly professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Lectures could be more engaging and related to each other",
                "This is not the most interesting class, partially due to the material but also partially due to Professor Prober's droning voice. The class is a gut in the sense that the material is not that difficult. The workload however, is quite unnecessary. Your grade is determined by a few psets, your midterm, and your final presentation. All of the psets are to be completed before the midterm, so the first half of the semester is comprised of doing a ton of work while the second half of the semester is comprised of doing very very little work. The class would be better suited if this work was spread out more."

However, lectures can be rather dull, and many students were not engaged. The second half of the semester is very light and just requires class attendance at guest lecture presentations and completion of the final project.",
