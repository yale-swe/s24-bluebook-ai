I learned how to think critically about and evaluate government policies and discuss complex economics subjects. Prof. Leibbrandt has deep expertise in this area and shared many insights from his experiences participating in policy discussions and conducting research on these subjects. I also advanced my research, writing, and presentation skills through the midterm and final assignments.",

                "This was an excellent course! Each class discussion was extremely engaging and I developed research, writing, and communication skills, as well as the ability to break down complex phenomena using Economic models. Prof. Leibbrandt was incredibly invested in his students and made the class a very rewarding experience. My one recommendation is to spread out the assignments more over the course of the semester, as the combination of the final presentation and final essay was a lot of work at the end of the semester.",
                "Strengths: Content and discussions were super interesting. Really enjoyed the readings, and Prof Leibbrandt did a great job of facilitating insightful conversations. Helpful feedback on papers & I always really appreciated his availability to chat about the course and\/or course-related inequality topics during office hours. Great engagement on midterm\/final papers, and super interesting to do a deep dive country analysis.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes not enough time to throughly complete all the assigned readings. In future iterations of the class, it could also be helpful to incorporate a more diverse array of authors from different parts of the world.",
                "I really liked this class. With two ten page papers I think its weird its not a writing credit. Clearer grades could be given during the course."

                "Yes! I found it very interesting and also a very rewarding experience. The only thing is that the readings are on the longer end they're all great readings, but I would only recommend the course if the other student knows they'll have time to do them, because it wouldn't be as fulfilling of an experience to go in each week without having read the assignments (the discussions are based on the readings).",
                "Yes! This class will not only make you an expert in the study of inequality, but will also teach you valuable skills in research, writing, and communication. In particular, I recommend this class to people who enjoy Economics and research, and are interested in inequality, policy, and international development.",
                "Yes! I learned a lot, especially different ways to analyze and approach different dimensions of inequality.",
                "Yes. If you're prepared to do the reading and participate in class, you'll get so much out of it."
