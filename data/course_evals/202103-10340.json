Overall, I feel like a much better writer than I was before, and I am more confident that I will be successful in future writing assignments.\r\n\r\nNot to mention, I have a much greater understanding of tourism, its impact, and the true motivations behind it.",

                "Strengths - The writing instruction in this course is great. After each essay, and throughout the writing process of each essay, Professor Newton gives a great blend of positive feedback and constructive criticism. The essays cover a variety of writing styles (close reading, research, personal experiences, etc.). Additionally, The topic itself is very interesting, and I found my outlook on tourism. entirely changed after having taken this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - My only complaint is that the first essay was hard to grasp conceptually, but I don't think this issue applied to everyone. I'm having a hard time trying to think of any weaknesses.",
                "The readings in this course were interesting and my writing skills improved. I can't think of weaknesses of the course.",
                "strength: the course is very engaging and teaches many useful writing skills, and the readings are really fun!\r\nweakness: feel like the second half of semester has a lot of writing-focused classes but less new reading materials, but may be better if adjust the balance a little bit and still have interesting readings as the first half",
                "Having one less essay would be nice to give me some breathing room. I enjoyed the discussions in class about tourism and how they evolved with each reading they did. I would like a day or two of more show and tell or for the professor to have us talk about our own stories of tourism and not other people's."

                "Yes. Professor Newton gives great feedback and constructive criticism on essays. As you progress through the course, the writing process becomes more and more independent, and the central research essay is a great chance write about something that truly interests you. The personal essay at the end is also a nice break from academic writing. Additionally, The topic itself is very interesting. Overall I enjoyed this class and I think it has improved my skills as a writer (and as a reader) drastically.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because the readings are interesting and it will help improve their writing skills.",
                "Recommend!! The readings are really interesting and thought-provoking if you love\/care about traveling. I have a more nuanced understanding of travel after the readings. Also, Pam is amazing, she gives pretty helpful feedback every time and it contributes a lot to further writing!",
                "Yes I would. If I knew a student who wanted a good intro to college writing course and they were into tourism, this course would be perfect because it includes both the amazing points of touring a new p[lace, but also the consequences of travel and how communities reel from the impacts."
