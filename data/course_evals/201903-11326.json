    "This course does a good job at providing a good laboratory environment for students to develop lab and research skills. I learned that a lab course does not have to be stressful given a good lab environment and helpful professors\/TAs. I was actually interested and engaged with doing the experiments each week. The professors and TA are very nice and willing to help students learn and succeed in the course. However, it connected only very little to the accompanying biochemistry lecture course I took. The course is well organized with 2 projects each ending with a lab report and weekly quizzes. The quizzes were straightforward and all that was needed to do well on them and prepare for them was to read the lab manual and\/or watch some videos. The TAs and professors were always willing to answer questions and explain topics further when needed. The example lab reports were also very helpful in giving students an idea of how to approach the lab report assignments."

    "Yes! This was the best MCDB lab I have taken so far. Very comfortable and welcoming environment with great, helpful professors and TAs.  I learned that a lab course does not have to be stressful given a good lab environment and helpful professors\/TAs. I was actually interested and engaged with doing the experiments each week. The two lab reports can be tedious, long assignments to complete but the only thing in the course besides these 2 assignments are weekly, straightforward quizzes. The example lab reports were also very helpful in giving students an idea of how to approach the lab report assignments.  Low workload overall, but just watch out for those 2 lab reports."
