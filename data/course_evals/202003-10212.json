                "Professor Nicholson asked us to think deeply and critically about all the texts we read, interspersing among the more traditional texts more modern takes on similar methods. Although discussions were my favorite part of this class, I think I grew the most in my writing, as she encouraged me to think critically, specifically, and meaningfully about our readings and develop a cohesive, streamlined argument.",

I also learned how to formulate and structure an argument about various texts, sometimes in comparison with one another. More personally, I learned that I was able to tackle challenging texts and comprehend them through practice and discussions in class.",
                "I learned how to organize and write better essays and more successfully engage with difficult texts.",

                "One of my goals coming into the course was to make English strange to me again. That goal was definitely fulfilled as soon as we started reading, because The Canterbury Tales is one of the most difficult texts Ive read. But I also took away many other insights, including a very helpful mode of reading that Professor Nicholson modeled through her guidance of our seminar discussions. Specifically, I now understand how helpful it can be to use a few key questions or concepts as through-lines of an entire book (e.g. narrative authority in The Canterbury Tales, reading Shakespeares sonnets as commenting on their own production, or evaluating the way Milton justifies the ways of God to men in Paradise Lost). Beyond sharpening my reading skills, this course was also a fabulous environment in which to read texts that I had always intended to read but never had the courage or stamina to do on my own, particularly Paradise Lost.",

                "This course is a very good introduction to English poetry. The texts vary in subject matter and style, and each is interesting in its own ways. We also read poetry from a few contemporary poets, which makes the course all the more engaging. The only weakness to this course might be a personal one--without a solid foundation in the Bible or Christianity, since that was the main religion at the time these texts were written, it was challenging to understand some of the texts to a fuller extent than if they were supplemented with knowledge of Christianity.",
                "It was just a really strong course! Prof Nicholson was particularly amazing. I dont really have any suggestions.",
                "Strengths: The professor was pretty engaged, and always a joy to talk to about ideas during office hours. I thought she led our class discussions well. We did a lot of writing but it wasn't necessarily overwhelming in terms of workload, though certainly you had to be on top of things.\r\nWeakness: The reading can be a bit much. I mean, it's old poetry. It's hard to read through. If you really don't like 17th century verse, don't take this class. However if you are really into old poetry, do take this class.",
                "I have only strengths to report! This is a lovely, well-crafted course, even over Zoom. Professor Nicholson is phenomenal. The texts are difficult, weird, wonderful, and a great blend of Early and more contemporary English poetry. And its a very dynamic course, the perfect balance of lingering and spending plenty of time on a single text, while also getting to try a lot of different writers, traditions, and texts."

                "We were really fortunate to have ten students in the class, so it actually adapted really well to the Zoom screen: I felt like I could see everyone, and, though to a lesser extent than in real life, got to know my classmates and how they thought about literature. In larger courses, I probably would have wanted to do more breakout rooms, but our discussions ended up being perfect given the size of our seminar."

                "Definitely, especially for prospective English majors. I think we often misconstrue \"foundational\" to mean \"elementary,\" a necessary prerequisite before moving on to more specificand more interestingcourses of study. But in this course, \"foundational\" establishes a higher bar, encouraging students to develop skills they will be able to use in all courses (English or otherwise) and learn how to love engaging with texts.",
                "I would recommend this course, as an English major it feels great to have wrangled with these canonical texts and have them in your repertoire and it was done in a way that felt very tailored to the student - the student actively engaging with the works rather than the works being impressed upon the students.",
                "I would recommend this class to students considering majoring in English or who have a strong like for Middle English poetry. The readings are not a walk in the park and the writing can be challenging, but this is a very rewarding course and the professor is EXCELLENT.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Nicholson was really hardworking and made the best of a challenging time. It was clear that she really enjoyed what she was teaching and made sure that everyone had the opportunity to feel included in discussions. While reading the course material I found it difficult and boring but after going to class and hearing Professor Nicholson and my other classmates talk I was able to see the poetry from a new light which made my writing and discussions better.",
                "Yes! And take it with Professor Nicholson. Also I can say that Ive read paradise lost now, which in my opinion is super cool.",
                "Yes, I would recommend. If you're an English major especially. Also if you're really into old poetry. Prof Nicholson is probs the best to take it with!",
                "I would absolutely recommend taking English 125 with Professor Nicholson. She is so gifted at bringing students from all different years and backgrounds onto the same playing field, so that we learned a lot both from the class and from one another. Professor Nicholson always gave really helpful extended introductions to each session, and she did a spectacular job of weaving together our (sometimes disparate) comments, insights, and takeaways. She often would respond to a comment in a way that integrated it into the larger conversation and helped us move forward, together. Professor Nicholson is just a really incredible pedagogue and person, a master teacher, and Im super grateful that she loves teaching English 125! \r\n\r\nThis course was my third and final foundational course, and it absolutely solidified my very high opinion of the sequence (even though I did it out of order). Far from being staid or outdated, English 125 weaved together our wonderful core texts (The Canterbury Tales, Shakespeares sonnets, and Paradise Lost) with more contemporary poets like Jos Charles, Terrance Hayes, and Jericho Brown. Whether or not youre an English major, I highly recommend taking a foundational course!",
                "No. Despite the instructor stating my papers greatly improved each time, I still received the exact same grade on each one."
