                "As someone who had never taken a philosophy class before, this was a fantastic introduction to some of the most well-known and influential European thinkers that have shaped modern moral, political, and social theory today. Literally everything that was taught was new to me, but Professor Shore taught it in such an elegant manner that it was so comprehensible, making some of the most daunting thinkers understandable. Basically any major thinker/intellectual you can think of, we learned about, and we learned about how all these thinkers build off one another or even contradict one another.",

                "The ability to read and synthesize broad ranges of information in the context of a historical progression is stressed in this course, and I gained skills in this area. Additionally, I gained insights into the tradition of philosophy from the enlightenment to the 21st century.",
                "I learned so so much in this course about many philosophers, both philosophically and through a historical lens. Not only did we learn about how these thinkers interacted intellectually but also how they interacted in real life which was fascinating to know.",

                "This course was very different than any course I had taken before at Yale, and I really enjoyed it. It had more philosophy and less history in it than I expected, but I ultimately appreciated the exposure to philosophy. I learned how to understand different philosophical arguments and general trends in thinking in European history. Through the midterm, paper, and final, I was able to critically think by synthesizing thought across various thinkers.",
                "I thought so much about the world in this class. I'd never taken a philosophy class of any kind but everyone told me I needed to take this class and I'm s happy I did! Frankly, I didn't do all the readings, but I diligently went to every class and section and tried to glean what these thinkers were trying to say from that.",

                "I got to know some of the thinkers I have heard of but could never really categorize and localize in intellectual history. I also learned to read primary philosophical sources.",
                "This class is so incredibly helpful for anyone who plans to major in the humanities, since Prof. Shore engagingly charts out Western philosophical development since the Enlightenment. At the end of each class, I felt like I was so invested in Prof. Shore's grand narrative that I was inspired to learn more.",

This course has enabled me to have a deeper understanding of different ideologies, political ideas, artistic movements, and more. I also learned to read philosophy more effectively, and to engage with it in a more enjoyable and interesting way. Overall, I think this course is a really wonderful introduction to the main ideas that have shaped our world. It was amazing!",

Knowledge on relevant historical topics (Communism, WWI, WWII, Nazism, Stalinism).\r\n\r\nMost importantly, I think this course provides an AMAZING foundation for all other humanities courses. I am a first-semester Junior and I seriously wish I had taken this earlier. To understand what authors mean when they say \"Nietzschean\" or \"Derridean\" or \"Foucauldian\" would have really grounded a lot of other readings from other classes. This course does not teach these intellectual frameworks, but also shows, I think more importantly, how they connect and interact.",

It was the perfect introduction to the history of Western intellectual thought and provided me with an incredible basis for future endeavors into learning more about philosophy. There are so many philosophical ideas I understand now that I hadn't even heard of at the beginning of the semester!",
                "Broad overview of key philosophers and thinkers from post-Enlightenment Europe. I learned how to tackle difficult (and frankly, often cryptic) texts. I also learned how to connect and situate philosophical currents with historical events.",

                "I learned so much in this course. Professor Shore took us through the entire course of modern European thought. I also feel like I learned how to synthesize a large connected web of ideas through the exams, as well as just hearing Professor Shore speak.",
                "We covered the intellectual history of Europe over the past two hundred years, involving philosophers and writers and how their ideas relate to one another. We didn't delve into any particular philosophy at length, but we covered the basic outlines of intellectual thought and discussion in Europe, categorizing them into movements and understanding how later thinkers built off of prior ones. I learned that intellectual history is both much more interesting and far more complicated than I had imagined, but well worth studying.",
                "Got a background in the history of european philosophy, getting broad overviews into many philosophers and their beliefs",
                "The course title is accurate. I learned about thinkers in Europe spanning about three centuries. I learned the historical context in which they worked, and I learned how to analyze their interactions across time with other thinkers. I was introduced to many incredibly interesting and influential thinkers that I otherwise never would have come across, and I really enjoyed that.",
                "This course provided a thorough, comprehensive overview of the major thinkers in Western thought over the last couple centuries. I learned a lot about how these people interacted with and built on each other. Before, I had only a loose sense of who these people were and what they had written, but this class built a cohesive history that placed each thinker in the appropriate context.",
                "Learned a lot of super relevant info about European philosophers and their main ideas",
                "I learned a lot about European philosophy and how different philosophers, since the Enlightenment, have been in dialogue among each other.",
                "I gained a survey-style knowledge of a broad array or European Intellectual thinkers including Sarte, de Beauvoir, Nietzsche, Foucault, Heidegger, Hegel, Marx, Lenin, etc. Lectures covered some of the most important points of each thinkers theory and Professor Shore would share interesting stories about these thinkers lives, as well as her own experiences reading and interpreting these thinkers. Homework consisted of reading primary sources which I found valuable and interesting.",
                "Gained some broad understanding of various thinkers, and their interconnectednesses.",
                "I developed the ability to think critically about historical figures and trace lines of thought throughout time.",
                "I learned how to interpret difficult thinkers, how to place philosophers in their historical context and to discuss their thought critically. There are too many insights which I learned to list here, so I will just state that I feel that I learned a lot about modern intellectual history and even the most difficult thinkers.",
                "The course provides knowledge and insight into many modern European thinkers. Students receive both a short biography regarding the thinkers' lives in lecture and an explanation of some of their thoughts, claims, or ideas.",

                "I gained a broad, survey-level understanding of all of the European philosophers that I have always pretended to understand. Not only did I learn about each, but I gained an understanding of how each thinker's ideas fit into conversation with other philosophers as well as the historical context.",
                "I learnt about philosophers views on the subject-object problem, morality, the Holocaust, and the problem of language all through the 17th century up to the 20th.",
                "The course should possible be called Continental (Mostly German) European Intellectual History Since Before Nietzsche.  That's what we learned about.  It was very interesting.",
                "I gained a very basic, baseline understanding of intellectual thinking over the past 200 years.",
                "Hands down the best class I've taken. Learned the key intellectual thinkers that address the legacy of the Enlightenment. Just look at the syllabus",
                "I learned a general timeline for the progression of European intellectual thought in the 20th century and developed a more nuanced understanding of key thinkers' philosophies.",
                "I learned about the general trends of intellectual history starting from the Enlightenment. Individual classes provided great insights into individual thinkers as well as the discussion between them.",
                "Really good overview of European intellectual history",
                "I learned a lot about many of the foundational European thinkers since Kant. I learned how theories and paradigms shifted and evolved from since the Enlightenment, and how many of these thinkers interacted with each other to either build upon or deconstruct previous ideas.",
                "This was an amazing class. It culminates in a really strong message about how to live your life and make decisions, and about how to analyze the world around you. I learned about how people have refined their perspectives of the world over time and got practice making connections.",
                "I learned about 19th and 20th century European intellectuals and ways in which their ideas together",
                "This course was a great overview of contemporary philosophy. Prof Shore is great at distilling thinkers to their essential points. It's great foundational information, especially if you are like me and didn't have much of a philosophy background. She does a good job of grouping thinkers and making their histories relevant.",
                "such a good foundation of influential European philosophers since the Enlightenment, ability to parse difficult texts, decent overview of 20th century European history",
                "I learned about European Intellectual history starting from the Enlightenment. We learned about the important thinkers, their main ideas, their influences on culture and intellectual thought and how they connected.",

                "Learned about philosophical thought from the late 1700s to today.",

                "I developed an ability to read complex philosophical texts, take effective notes, and write clearly.",
                "Broad overview of European Intellectual History from Enlightenment to the present.",
                "The class gave me a strong understanding of the various movements of Western thought over the past 200 or so years, with a strong introduction to prominent European thinkers (like Hegel, Husserl, Freud etc). Prof Shore also does a great job of \"tying\" thinkers together, so that we understand how later thinkers were inspired/built upon work of prior thinkers.",
                "I gained a very broad and shallow view of European intellectual history and the connections between different thinkers",
                "I learned about the history of European Intellectual (which I took to really mean 'Philosophical') History from the Enlightenment/birth of Modernity to the contemporary/Post-Modern era, covering thinkers like Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Arendt, Derrida, etc.",
                "I learned about European philosophical movements and how to situate writers within a long tradition of philosophical work -- everyone is reacting to everyone else!",
                "This course offered a broad overview of European intellectual history not since Nietzsche, but since the Enlightenment. It was very helpful in highlighting the connections between various philosophers.",

                "Lectures are very strong and engaging, synthesis of concepts could be tighter with regard to conclusions/end of class tying together the timeline.",
                "This course gives a really effective survey of many of the important thinkers of the 19th and 20th centuries. Because of how many people/schools of thought we covered, I sometimes wished we could delve deeper into specific ideas, but overall I think the course moved at a good pace and spent a fair amount of time on each person.",
                "Strengths - the material is fascinating and Professor Shore is probably the best lecturer I (senior) have had at Yale. Don't need to do the readings \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "This course was really good, Prof. Shore is an amazing lecturer and tells an amazing story across the class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Shore's lectures are absolutely wonderful and the content is interesting as well",
                "Strengths: manageable workload, interesting lectures, great narrative arc of course. \r\nWeaknesses: none.",
                "A strength of the course is the discussion sections because I had the opportunity to discuss the text with my peers. This process was deeply rewarding as I learned to articulate my position on topics that I'm not an expert in. An area of improvement would be to make readings more easily findable in the course packet by numbering the pages and creating an index.",
                "Professor Shore is an incredible lecturer, and I thought that her lectures were very interesting and well-organized. The handouts that she provided before class were very useful in orienting my notes, and the course was organized both logically and chronologically. However, the readings were quite dense, and I do not think that many of the students read them through. I think that if the readings were slightly shorter or pared down when they became that difficult to read, students would engage more directly with the texts.",
                "The strengths of this course are Prof. Shore's lectures and great TFs like Orel. The class is structured so well (after years of teaching it, I imagine) and it follows a very natural chronological order.\r\nThe second half of the course is a bit harder to follow - it might be helpful to introduce the first post-midterm lecture with a roadmap of where the class will be going next. Since we did that in the first lecture, I felt like I had a pretty good understanding early on but it felt more confusing later.",
                "Prof. Shore's lectures are incredibly engaging and memorable. That said, given how dense some of the primary sources are, I sometimes had trouble making the jump from the loftiness and articulate clarity of the lectures to the finer points of the readings, and section wasn't particularly helpful in that regard. I wish we had spent section working our way through the meaning of challenging texts before jumping into discussion; in my section, it felt like a lot of people were making wild leaps in analysis (myself included!) and could've used some grounding in the text.",
                "The strengths of this course include Professor Shore's lectures and the syllabus/readings. Areas for improvement would include maybe cutting back on the biographic information included in each lecture and focus more on the thinker's intellectual work.",
                "Strengths: curriculum includes a lot of thinkers, so I got an expansive overview of thinkers; thinkers were often contextualized in European history, which facilitated my understanding\r\nWeaknesses: curriculum included two women only",
                "Professor Shore is an engaging and entertaining lecturer, and the course is structured well for understanding how thinkers built on each other and how ideas transformed over time. One weakness is that a few lectures were a bit hard to follow because Professor Shore talked about so many different thinkers within the same general movement. It was much easier to grasp the key concepts in the lectures that just focused on one or two thinkers, so it would improve the course in the future to focus on one-two emblematic thinkers within movements instead of trying to cover a lot of similar thinkers.",
                "This class was very engaging and accessible, and I don't see any way it could be improved. Genuinely. I wish more professors at Yale structured their classes like Prof. Shore.",
                "Strengths: Professor Marci Shore -- she is such a passionate, caring, and motherly individual, and an amazing lecturer and teacher. She has an incredibly captivating energy and a unique way of making the concepts she discusses to stick in your head; TA Orel Beilinson -- what an amazing instructor! His sections were always extremely interesting and allowed me to engage in the material in a different way than the lectures did. He's absolutely brilliant.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think there's any. I really enjoyed this course. Having a cumulative final is kind of stressful but it was not that bad.",
                "Strengths: Fantastic lectures (Marci provided us with recorded lectures as 'podcasts' and I would listen to certain lectures 2, even 3 times because they were so good). Great reading list, which struck a nice balance between the classic texts and more esoteric pieces that were still very relevant.",
                "This course should be mandatory. It is fantastic, and the teaching is great. There are a lot of resources. It moves quickly at times.",
                "The two main strengths are Professor Shore herself and the breath of the material that we cover. Rather than focusing in on one specific thinker, each lecture was an opportunity to learn about a completely new school of philosophy (or at the very least a new philosopher). The connections between the philosophers and the ways they build off of and responded to each other were made very clear which helped make the class more understandable. One of the weaknesses is that despite covering a large number of philosophers, there was very little diversity represented in the thinkers themselves (90% of them were white men). The course is absolutely amazing, just know going in that it's very much a stereotypical introduction to the Western canon. Also, discussion sections were a bit all over the place and varied greatly depending on the TF.",
                "Incredible professor! Professor Shore is a marvelous lecturer, bringing alive and elucidating complex ideas with clarity and deep insight. Her anecdotes, too, were so fun to experience. My TF, Orel, was fantastic at unwrapping the layers of meaning contained within difficult readings with a wonderful sense of humor. No weaknesses.",
                "This is a brilliant course. I wouldve liked to have gone up to the present day rather than ending at the end of the 20th century.",
                "The strengths and weaknesses of this course are connected. We move so quickly over so much material, which is one of the things I loved most about the class. I learned so much and Professor Shore's lectures were so concise and informative. However, I felt that sometimes the class moved a little too quickly, especially when we moved away from the one thinker per week which was the largely the structure of the first half of the class and started to focus on entire school's of thought with many individual thinkers in the second half of the course. Perhaps focusing more on individual thinkers representative of those larger schools of thought would prevent that feeling of shallowness.",
                "This course had really great and engaging lectures, and the exams and essays were all reasonable. The one part which could be improved is the discussion section, which occasionally felt redundant. Perhaps even smaller discussion sections would have been better; at times it was hard to dig in to the material with so many people.",
                "This course is a large lecture. The lecture has no visual aidsyou simply listen to Professor Shore lecture for 50 minutes straight. Professor Shore is a great lecturer, but some students may find it difficult to take notes and retain information from these lectures.",
                "Strengths: everything is incredibly fascinating. I wouldn't change a single thing. I get to interact with these ideas in a low stress environment. Also, Professor Shore is a fantastic lecturer. I felt like I was in a TedTalk during every lecture. The only thing that I'd add is it would be cool if the syllabus had a few suggestions for optional readings for each topic. These wouldn't be tested, but it would be nice to have concrete direction on how to further explore the topics that I really enjoyed. Very minor comment though; I loved everything!",
                "The strength of this class is Marci Shore. She is an engaging lecturer who makes the material feel alive. The major weakness is that it felt like we moved too quickly. If you missed a day of class, you would probably miss the only class on a given thinker.",
                "Super relevant, engaging",
                "A strength is the course itself is soooo good and I wish I could take it multiple times. I wish that Professor Shore made herself more available to her students---more office hours, etc.",
                "Professor Shore does an incredible job at teaching the course in a manner that is understandable no matter your previous experience in philosophy.",
                "The most difficult part of the course for me was that I felt I couldnt really appreciate the ways that these thinkers fit together and influenced each other until the end of the course. I think the course could benefit from a greater emphasis/clearer explanation of the ways in which these thinkers all built on the ideas of the thinkers before them.",
                "For what it is, this is a good course. I often did not feel that Professor Shore did a sufficient job of making the importance of thinkers' concerns felt, especially before introducing the deflationary effect of putting them into historical context. Relatedly, I thought her lectures were often overly focused on biographical details--there is not enough time in 50 minutes for a broad overview of Nietzsche's thought (for instance), and spending half  of those on his biography doesn't help! (or it does, rather, but sub-optimally). \r\n\r\nAnother general qualm--I thought the \"death of God\" narrative structuring device, while clever, and perhaps useful (for many), was way too simplistic and reductive (especially as it plays into the unthought prejudices of many Yale students (probably the same ones who [at least think they] find it useful).",
                "The course has great lectures and reasonable workload.",
                "It's great! The issue I have is that each section, from what I heard, was completely different in how it was structured and what the intent was.",
                "Strengths:\r\nIncredible instructor Prof. Shore, who has an incredible gift for explaining even the most difficult issues and making them comprehensible and interesting\r\nExtremely interesting\r\nVery engaging \r\nCovering a wide time period \r\nCovering diverse thinkers, topics and themes\r\nCovering more than only Western Europe, but also Central and Eastern\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nToo much Marxism (3 topics regarding it) + if we want to learn about schools of thought that have led to the misery and deaths of millions of people then why don't we also cover facism? I would cut out one week of Marxism ( revisionist Marxism) and cover it quickly in existentialism. Instead, I would introduce the topic of the rise of sociology with Weber and Durkheim and a bit of Jose Ortega y Gasset (revolt of the masses)\r\nNot enough other types of sources - I think it would be useful to for example include (just as an extra thing) examples of paintings (impressionism? Giacometti? Boccioni?), music (Wagner for Nietzsche is the most obvious example of course), poems and movies to illustrate how the dominant intellectual trends were reflected in culture",
                "Strength wise the reading for this course is very manageable. More often then not less than 50 pages were assigned per thinker making it possible to read the material rather than skimming quickly. However, the material can be difficult to grasp and require a detailed explanation to understand. Sometimes the course moved on to other thinkers without fully explaining one's ideas.",
                "The lectures were very engaging, but I did feel that there was always too much to ever discuss thoroughly in section--but this is probably a weakness of the type of course more than this course specifically.",
                "The structure of the course works so well - from the very beginning, it builds on itself and always revisits earlier material that helps to reinforce what we had already learned. The lectures were incredibly engaging and Professor Shore carefully chose readings that were often challenging but really key.",
                "I thought the course was structured very well.  It was generally chronological, which is important for a history class, but also grouped readings/topics by theme to some extent.",
                "This course has no weakness! The professor was so great and charismatic in her teaching! Even a person who hasn't done any philosophy class or read any philosophy book before will appreciate this class.",
                "This course does not go into depth on most of the material, which is great if you want an overview of intellectual thinking but less fulfilling if you hope to engage deeply with thinkers. Marci Shore is a solid lecturer.",
                "Strength: you learn SO MUCH, and the insights are so fascinating. and you can apply SO MUCH to your personal life\r\nWeakness: engagement w instructor is infrequent.",
                "The lectures were amazing and do not need improvement, but my discussion section was significantly less engaging.",
                "Lectures were fantastic and really insightful. While I liked the readings, I thought sometimes they were tangential to lectures and werent thoroughly discussed in lecture.",
                "Good lectures. The readings are so dense",
                "Ill get the weaknesses out of the way first. This course was really well organized, however I feel like some of the Wikipedia-esque bios could have been left out of the lectures. Second weakness:  the TF selection/assignment was genuinely terrible (except for Orel, from what I gather, although I didnt interact with or hear anything about Wiktor or Megan). In my first lecture I was sitting next to a man who was constantly on his phone, frantically switching between all-caps keyboard warriordom on twitter and some phone game. At one point he played an advert OUT LOUD in the middle of the lecture. I told him to get off his phone. At the end of the lecture he closed his notebook and I was horrified to see that it said GRADUATE SCHOOL OF HISTORY - he then got up and made an announcement about his section time. This was appalling.\r\n\r\nThe positives: Professor Shore is amazingly intelligent not only as a thinker but also as a teacher. She knows how to get complex ideas to percolate (as she likes to say) in young minds. Her discussion of honestly some of the most complex reading I have done here is crystal clear and extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nIn future I would like to see Professor Shore vet her TFs better, because I had experience with two: the first, as I have already mentioned, lacked the mental capacity to concentrate through what I thought was a fascinating lecture, and displayed a disgusting lack of respect to the students, the professor and the subject itself. The second displayed a cool arrogance throughout my sections, never had any notes prepared, and rarely offered any of her supposed expertise to us curious students. Instead of teaching, which is in her job description, she decided that her only duty as TF was to be the arbiter of speech. This stifled discussion, and led to one of my worst intellectual experiences at Yale. The TFs names were Kamil Ahsan and Charlotte Kiechel. I really dont care about naming and shaming here because I am genuinely appalled at this and do not think that either of these TFs should receive whatever credit they think they can get towards their degree by simply showing up for 50 minutes and being thoroughly and consistently lazy and/or disrespectful.",
                "The strengths are the great readings and great lectures. One thing that could be nice is more structure for the essay, perhaps a first draft would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Shore's lectures are very fun and engaging, readings are usually not bad\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the readings were a lot, discussion section was not super engaging, and I often hoped for more specific things about philosopher's ideas included in lecture rather than a focus on narrative",
                "The lectures are incredible",
                "I loved Prof Shore's lecturing style. I did think she lingered a bit too long on her own academic interests (understandably, but still). We perhaps spent too long in the second half of the course on the same thinkers, particularly German and Slavic ones. I also struggled in discussion section because there was little consistency from TF to TF. We were given different assignments and graded differently. There was certainly a markable difference in quality too.",
                "literally no weaknesses. perfect class that everyone should take. Professor Shore is an AMAZING lecturer and explains difficult content so well",
                "Strengths: The class is a great survey of European Intellectual history and provides you with a basic understanding of important frameworks and thinkers. Marci is a great lecturer and is engaging. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class can go really fast and the lectures do not always connect to the readings.",
                "Great professor who provides clear explanations of the course material.",
                "Strengths: Strong emphasis on primary source readings. Professor Shore is also an excellent lecturer; her lectures are remarkably clear, insightful, and entertaining. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have preferred a greater emphasis on writing papers (either a term paper or a few shorter essays) rather than exams. I found my TF's implementation of weekly discussion posts beneficial to my understanding of the course material, as writing helped me better analyze concepts and organize my thoughts. The essay assignment had a similar effect on my learning. I think a stronger emphasis on writing original papers rather than completing timed assessments would allow students more time to ruminate on many of the philosophical concepts presented in this course.",
                "This class is fantastic. My only recommendation is perhaps more secondary source texts about some of the more difficult thinkers.",
                "No weakness, amazing course!",
                "The course really is \"European Intellectual History since Hegel\" for one - a good few of our first lectures focus on thinkers before Nietzsche. I also think the lectures themselves should be longer as they often felt rushed. 75 minutes would be a fair more reasonable number. Shore is also a very fast lecturer, and so taking notes during lecture isn't exactly the most fun of things.",
                "I think the strengths of this course are the broad overview one leaves the class with and Marci Shore's lecturing.  She's great at weaving the story of this intellectual history and it's usually fun to go to class.  I think the corresponding weakness is that you don't go too in-depth with any thinker; I didn't expect us to, so I wasn't disappointed, but I would be aware of that going in.",
                "Great lectures.",
                "Loved the lectures! the readings were sometimes very difficult but I could understand how they were relevant",
                "I thought this course was fantastic! It was truly a great survey of so many complex thoughts, and I left really feeling like I'd learned something.",
                "Strengths -- the subject matter was very interesting to me. Weaknesses -- I would have liked a bit more guidance on the creative paper prompt. I had never written a paper like that before and wasn't sure if I was wildly off the mark.",
                "Prof. Shore is a wonderful lecturer and the biggest strength in this course. She describes all of these complex topics, though mentions how she approaches them in different ways to find a way that allows them to \"stick\" for every student. In addition, the flow of the course using a chronological method, as well as how each week was broken up into units, was very effective. \r\nOne weakness of this course is that Prof. Shore has extremely limited office hours and as a result in a 200-person lecture, it didn't really feel like she was accessible. In addition, the late due date for the paper, while nice because it allows you to work on it over thanksgiving break and not overwhelm your workload in November, means that you don't really get feedback in time to help your studying for the final exam.",
                "Amazing class!!! Always looked forward to going to lecture and always found it interesting. Strengths: Prof. Shores compelling lectures and super organized teaching style",
                "Strengths: Professor Shore is great at explaining otherwise complicated and abstruse philosophical concepts by approaching it from various different angles. Weakness: The course reading felt somewhat too challenging and byzantine at times."

                "Absolutely recommend! One of my favorite-- if not my favorite-- classes taken at Yale. Truly eye-opening and makes me rethink how I conceptualize just about every social/political/philosophical phenomenon.",
                "Yes, if you take pleasure in Eastern European thoughts and continental philosophy.",
                "A fantastic journey from enlightenment all the way to post-modernism. I definitely recommend this course. But if you are not super confident with your philosophical thinking, do save a CR/D/Fail place for this course.",
                "Yes absolutely 12/10 definitely take it. These are hard thinkers, Professor Shore makes them so accessible.",
                "Yes, this course was engaging and fun, the concepts covered were fascinating and of cultural and academic value to study in context with the rest of the course, and Prof Shore is a great lecturer.",
                "Absolutely, it was my favorite class this semester and has actually changed the way I think about the world.",
                "YES YES YES. I am a senior and this is the best lecture I have taken at Yale. If you are remotely intellectual or interested in ideas, this class will be fascinating. A life changing course. A must-take before you graduate definitely",
                "Yes definitely, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
                "Absolutely! For a STEM student with no philosophy or really history background, I still found the course engaging and learned so much.",
                "Absolutely. This course should be required for any humanities major at Yale, as the topics we learn are central to understanding anything about history and philosophy since the 18th century. The lectures are fascinating and the readings are short - a perfect combo.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in a general overview of key philosophers, their ideas, and how they're in dialogue with each other. It's important to note that this course offers an overview of the thinkers, so students interested in a deep dive should consult the syllabus before taking the course.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking to understand European history. I think that it was a very useful overview and exposed me to philosophy in a very accessible way. The workload was very reasonable, and Professor Shore is a great lecturer who I think any student would enjoy listening to. It was also interesting to move from thinker to thinker and hear her distill their thoughts into principles that the students could relate to.",
                "Yes!!! Please take this class. Prof. Shore is amazing and the TFs (speaking only from experience with Orel) are FANTASTIC. It is structured well and the exams rely on material that you can understand just by showing up to lecture and section. It is a really wonderful introduction to European philosophy and I think everyone should take it!",
                "Yes, if you are ready to commit time to reading dense sources each week! I took this lecture as my 5th class and wouldn't recommend it on top of an intense workload in other classes or as your intended lighter load; while the workload was not overly challenging, the readings did require a few hours of focused time each week for me to feel like I was getting the most out of the lectures and section.",
                "If you're interested in philosophy, this is definitely a worthy class to take even if you are not a humanities major. The concepts and readings can be quite hard to grasp but given sufficient time, they will click and you will leave with a greater appreciation of the way the course is designed/taught.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it if you want a broad overview of European intellectual history or want a HUMS credit. You won't get much opportunity to dig into a specific thinker, as the course moves very fast and all the information you need is given to you by Professor Shore. The workload is very manageable and the lectures are accessible. Professor Shore is a great lecturer. However, if you're looking to do more close reading or study thinkers in depth, this course isn't for you.",
                "Sure, if you have an interest in exploring some philosophical movements that shaped Europe of the 19th and 20th Century. But the readings are quite challenging and feel almost overwhelming at times if you have no background in philosophy readings, even though this is an intro course. The course also has little focus on ethics, so it wouldn't be the best fit for someone who seeks out ethical ideas on modern Europe.",
                "Yes! This was my first philosophy course, and it was a great introductory/overview course for anyone interested in getting a broad picture of the major intellectual movements in Europe from Enlightenment to present. Professor Shore is a super engaging lecturer.",
                "Please refer to point 1.",
                "Absolutely! This course is a wonderful introduction to the ideas that have shaped our world, and Professor Shore is an amazing lecturer!",
                "Yes! Provides a great platform of knowledge. Not too difficult and endlessly interesting. Definitely inspired me to take more continental philosophy courses.",
                "Yes. The professor and TAs were some of the best I had. Everyone needs to read these thinkers to understand politics, philosophy, and think about ideological developments that contributed to important historical events.",
                "Yes! It's a fantastic course that gives you a great overview of some of the most essential philosophical ideas of our time.",
                "This course is a must for every Yalie! Approachable, intellectually gripping, and moderate in workload, it's an ideal introduction to the illustrious thinkers that inform so much of Western thought in the modern age.",
                "Yes. Anyone interested in the humanities should take this and take it as soon as they can. It will provide a foundation for anything you do next.",
                "I would recommend this course to everyone. It was so informative and interesting.",
                "I strongly recommend this course! Professor Shore is fantastic and her lectures are incredible. I knew nothing about intellectual history when starting this class but the material was captivating and I enjoyed the class and assignments much more than I thought I would. I recommend this course to anyone, if they have even the slightest curiosity about philosophy or history in Europe over the past two centuries.",
                "Yes. This is class you came to Yale to take. It's important as a citizen of the world to understand how the Enlightenment, Marx, Heidegger, and totalitarianism came to be and influence our world today. I can't recommend enough. Take a step out of your comfort zone; Professor Shore is fantastic.",
                "Yes! A fun, engaging class that covers all the people you need to know in one convenient package.",
                "Yes, I feel like it enhanced all my other courses and was info that everyone should have",
                "Yes, absolutely. The lack of busy-work makes you focus on really learning the material.",
                "Yes, please take this class! Prof. Shore is a fantastic lecture who makes every single lecture engaging. Each lecture is only 50 minutes, and you'll feel like the class passed by like a breeze.",
                "Yes! Absolutely!",
                "Yes! I think its a great intro to philosophy course for students who dont have much prior philosophy knowledge. You get to know roughly a dozen thinkers and their philosophy well enough that I feel like I could hold a decent conversation about them with a friend and have a solid foundation to learn more/read about them on my own.",
                "Depends on the student, and what they want out of it. For someone largely unfamiliar with Intellectual History, yes/sure. For others, only as a light fourth/fifth class.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in philosophy, particularly those who may be intimidated, since it focuses not just on the philosophy but an overview of the context.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, definitely. It expands one's intellectual horizons, it's extremely interesting, engaging and fun. A must take",
                "Yes. This course can provide a good intro to modern European thinkers. The material can be quite difficult but can be understood after discussing with TFs or reading several times. The workload is quite manageable and the TFs are rather lenient with grading.",
                "Yes, as long as you can keep a critical mind!",
                "Yes take this course! It was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale, and I'm so sorry to have waited until my senior year.",
                "Yes.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Yes!",

                "I am a senior who wanted to take a history course and also build up my knowledge of important thinkers. This wasn't a great class, but checked all the boxes of what I was looking for.",
                "Absolutely. I learned so much. Prof. Shore is also the best lecturer out there",
                "Yes. Dr. Shore does an amazing job making convoluted thinkers' philosophies digestible. You will finally understand pretentious philosophy students' references.",
                "Yes! It was a fantastic survey course that was a great introduction to philosophy and the humanities as a STEM student",
                "Yeah! Its a fun and interesting course.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course, on the condition that you have a good TF. Bad TFs will ruin this course for you, so if you are in a bad section, switch immediately.",
                "Absolutely. It was my favorite class that I took this semester and lays such a strong foundation for so many things.",
                "Yes, very enlightening and fun",
                "I would. I think this is an engaging way to learn about important ideas and history. I think Professor Shore is one of the great minds of the department, and it's wonderful to be able to hear her speak. But be warned that these lectures are repeated almost verbatim from year to year.",
                "yes!!!!!! sooo good. I was not necessarily super interested in the content going in and didn't know what to expect, but I loved it. one of the best classes I've taken at Yale",
                "Yes, it is a great introduction to European philosophy and is easy to follow along even if not a philosophy major. The class is more about the history than the actual philosophy.",
                "Yes it is a great introductory course to contemporary thought.",
                "Yes! This course is among the best courses I have taken at Yale. I am now better able to think critically about the intellectual trends of today and understand \"how we got here.\" One of the themes of this course is understanding and evaluating the legacy of the Enlightenment: was the Enlightenment a net positive or negative development in human history? Prior to this course, I had never considered such a question; the Enlightenment (and subsequent intellectual developments and reactions) were simply \"things that happened.\" This course has encouraged me to use my human reason in a more profound manner (incidentally, you can see what my stance is on the legacy of the Enlightenment :) )",
                "I would recommend this course. Professor Shore is a fantastic lecturer and the class is a must take for anyone interested in philosophy or history. This class should be required for many humanities majors.",
                "Yes  its a great survey of recent European intellectual history without a heavy workload.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "YES YES YES!!! Take it if you want to understand when people reference Hegel, Nietzsche, Girard, etc.",
                "Yes, but on the note that this course is most definitely not a gut - it's about as hard as most other humanities classes. The material is difficult, though the workload in itself (i.e. two exams, one essay and discussion sections) is pretty light. Though the material is difficult, it is both incredibly interesting and rewarding.",
                "I think if you want a broad overview of intellectual history and learn a bit about the names that are often thrown around it's a good idea.  Especially with the thinkers at the end, I realized that some widespread ideas today can really be traced to some specific thinkers.  I ultimately found myself thinking that a lot of the ideas put forward by the thinkers weren't concrete enough for me to identify with or be interested in - and I'm studying philosophy.  It's like when you learn about all the elaborate philosophical theories that revolve around there being a god and you're an atheist - they all just sound a little whacko.",
                "For Marci, yeah.",
                "Yes! Great lectures and fascinating content",
                "Absolutely! This is hands down one of the best lectures I've taken at Yale. Professor Shore does such a fantastic job of encapsulating really difficult thinkers/ideas in such a fun and approachable way. I always looked forward to lectures, and I'm left feeling like I've actually learned so much that I can apply to my studies and general life. My only regret is that I didn't take this class sooner: it should almost be sort of requirement for students in the humanities as the thinkers we covered (Marx, Arendt, Foucault, etc.) come up so often in other classes and vitally helped my learning. Definitely take this class if you can!",
                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this course to any student at Yale! I am a history buff but knew close to nothing about intellectual history prior to taking this course, and while I didn't understand everything at first, I feel that I left this course with a strong understanding of several key thinkers. The course is generous in not diving too deep into philosophical terms, and the handouts for each lecture allow students to understand the key terms and synthesize information outside of class.",
                "1000% -- a course you must take before graduation",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes!! One of the best lectures Ive ever taken. And so applicable to other subjects in the humanitieshelped a lot for art history and film classes as well!",
                "I would recommend this course to any student, STEM or non-STEM, who wants a gentle introduction to a history/philosophy class. Coming out of this class as a STEM major, I feel much more prepared and confident to take more humanities classes in this direction."
