                "I gained greater knowledge of the tradition of humor in contemporary American Literature. I worked on my analysis techniques by learning how to analyze the mechanical aspects of humor with discussions of the philosophy of humor. This class at its most basic level challenged me to examine why I find certain things funny and how humor actually works to induce joy.",
                "I learned a great deal about Latin American literature and the culture and history of Latin America.  It was a really good survey of writers from all over Latin America, with the course touching on Central America, South America, and the Caribbean.  While there was slight emphasis on big, well-known writers like Borges, Garca Mrquez, and Cortzar, the course still paid enough attention to other less-known writers from the rest of Latin America.  I mostly learned the importance of humor throughout Latin American literature despite the fact that the regional literature has a bit of a reputation for being dark at times and has often been used to bring light to many difficult issues.  In fact, I might even say that the course changed how I look at all Latin American literature, as it seems that most of it contains some aspect of humor or satire in it, even if indirectly or separate from any conscious effort by the author.",
                "I improved my Spanish skills, particularly Spanish writing. Additionally, I gained a knowledge of techniques and context of literary humor in Spanish-American works.",
                "I learned about the structures, purposes, and motivations of humor, by reading essays discussing those aspects of humor, and then reading Spanish short stories and discussing the elements of humor within them.",
                "This course led me to greatly strengthen my command of the Spanish language through engaging in class and the long final essay.",

                "I actually learned the theory behind humor and satire and was able to analyze texts for their humor. Some common themes were the use of hyperbole in satire, the clash of ideas and the incongruence of certain themes to generate humor, and the absurd. I read pieces by recognizable Spanish authors and learned how to analyze the works and the way in which humor could also be melancholic or provide a critique of society in the case of satire.",
                "I learned how to pick apart and analyze different forms of humor, how to delineate their interaction with other literary devices. Analyzing humor may not be for everyone, but I've found it to be one of the most practical skills I've learned this semester."

                "Strengths\r\n-Fun! and funny!\r\n-Profesor Gonzalez-Perez is passionate about the material and actually knows a lot of the authors we read about\r\n-The workload is very manageable, and the readings are generally really short\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-the professor doesn't give the students as much time to discuss the literature. He talks a lot, so sometimes it feels more like a lecture than a seminar, which is still cool because he knows a lot",
                "It was sometimes hard to stay engaged over Zoom and the discussions often felt slightly stilted. However, the readings were engaging.",
                "This was a very effective and enjoyable course. It was well taught and featured a selection of excellent works that were really worth reading. Keeping it small made it feel intimate like a good seminar should.",
                "I think that the humor angle was particularly conducive to introducing us to very specific elements of Latin American culture and history that a typical literature class might overlook simply because some of the jokes required explanation.  Because of this, I believe that the best part about this class was its ability to cause us students to really rethink how we approach literature, particularly Latin American literature, with respect to the context and circumstances of its writing.  I didn't really find many problems with the class, though I guess I wished there were more assignments rather than three essays, with the final essay comprising more than 50% of the final grade (though this is honestly a minor complaint since the class itself was really enjoyable).",
                "It is taught entirely in Spanish, and the workload is not too high, allowing the student to focus on understanding and appreciating the readings. A weakness is in the style of the seminar. I wish there was more opportunity to speak or discuss in a less formal setting. A lot of that is due to the online format though.",
                "I really appreciated that the class emphasizes discussion. The stories were also short, funny, and enjoyable. I also liked the structure of exploring essays about humor, and then delving into stories that utilize the aspects of humor we had just learned about. I don't think I have any complaints!",
                "This course felt like an interactive lecture more than a seminar. This is great if you have some hesitation about speaking all of the time in class. There is always the opportunity to speak more and share opinions.",
                "Strengths: Introduces you to theories of humor from philosophers worldwide and helps you evaluate them not only in Spanish literature but other literary traditions everywhere.\r\nFair workload that introduces you to works of esteemed Spanish authors\r\nReally helps skills in writing in Spanish (I wrote almost 30 pages throughout the semester) and fair grading\r\nProfessor Gonzalez is very passionate and knowledgeable about humor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nGrading is a bit tumultuous and lopsided with the percentages (two essays each worth 20% of the grade, then a final essay worth 60%). Shouldn't be a problem since Professor Gonzalez is fair with grading but nonetheless it's a bit scary to hit the submit button on the assignments\r\nProfessor Gonzalez loves talking insightfully about humor and the authors we read, but to the point that the large seminar format dissolves into a lecture format. This class is definitely meant to improve your writing skills, but speaking not so much.",
                "Strengths of the course were definitely the readings chosen. The readings by authors were engaging to read and the way that they presented humor actually made me laugh at times. However, the theoretical humor readings were a little heavier but necessary. A weakness of the course was the participation in class. Mandatory participation seems very high-school like but it might be a way to foster more engagement with the class and the material which as mentioned before I believed was one of the strengths.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Gonzalez-Perez is an interesting lecturer; well-selected reading syllabus; a very manageable workload\r\nweaknesses: this was partially the online format, but classroom discussion quite often slowed and seemed unproductive"

                "I think that the roundtable approach was able to be transferred fairly well into Zoom (perhaps even better than an actual Yale discussion section).  I'm not entirely sure what could be improved upon.  I also like how most of the readings were provided to us by the Prof.",

                "The Canvas-Zoom integration succeeded with this course but assigning things solely through Zoom could be improved. Instead of relaying a basic idea of the message through Zoom, I would've liked if for every essay we got an email on Canvas detailing the prompt so that we could have it available with us at all times. Also the first prompt was a little fancy and confusing, so just a simple outline of the requirements and things we could focus on sent through Canvas would have worked better so the assignments and requirements were clearer.",

If they want to learn about the culture and history of Latin America in a different way from the typical Spanish class at Yale, I would also recommend that they take this class.  Quite honestly, anyone with an inkling of an interest in Latin America or literature would benefit greatly from taking this course, especially with Prof. Gonzlez-Prez.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course. Anibal is a great professor who leads intriguing, detailed, and relaxed discussions about humor and Spanish stories. The course content was always interesting and the stories were fun to read. The stories were often quite short and not dense in terms of reading, and class discussions were chill. Classes are not recorded so you need to go to the live Zooms, but there was never any pressure to participate. There are only 3 essays in the entire course that contribute to your grade, which are fun to write. There are no regular assignments other than reading the stories ahead of class. It's a very chill & enjoyable high level Spanish course.",
                "Yes. It is a great upper level Spanish course. The topic is very interesting, and the professor makes an active effort to remain engaging.",
                "Yes, very interesting course material that is hard to come across in other courses. Be comfortable with writing large papers in Spanish though!",
                "I would recommend this course only to certain students. For people looking to take an L5 Spanish course in an interesting subject, it works well. The readings are interesting and if actually analyzed provide some interesting ideas. However, the level of engagement is wholeheartedly on the student whether they want to participate or not and the amount of reading that they actually do.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in learning about humor and about a new range of Latin American authors. The course material was thoroughly fun and engaging. I don't believe it's the best class for learning Spanish as a second language, though. Discussion can be slow, so much of the learning occurs while interacting with the texts by oneself and writing responses. I would warn that this class operates more like a mini interactive lecture than a seminar, so don't expect the latter."
