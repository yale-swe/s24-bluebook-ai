I learned about colonization, racism, neocolonialism, racial capitalism, fascism, non-citizenship, genocide, the global war on terror, and the criminalization of migrants. Most importantly, I learned about people power, those most marginalized in society, and their many forms of resistance against power.",

Wide variety of weekly readings that provide new insights and perspectives, and the assignments were very engaging and allowed students to consider the impacts of music, movies, novels, etc  in society and their relatedness to discussed themes.",

                "Strengths: Exceedingly welcoming environment (seriously - the most welcomed I've felt at Yale). Truly discussion-based, as opposed to pushing one view or opinion. Dedicated teaching fellows. Wonderfully kind and encouraging professor who was able to achieve student engagement despite the limitations of virtual learning.\r\nWeaknesses: Live lectures did not engage students enough. Only a select few students consistently participated. (Not true for breakout\/discussion sections.)",
                "Strengths- everything!! professor camacho!!!! great workload, wonderful readings, interesting assignments, material is perfect. \r\n\r\nWeakness- I guess we couldn't go into depth of some of the things that we learned about, but that's expected in a introductory course!",
                "strengths\r\n-interesting and engaging readings\/topics\r\n-fairly engaging lectures\r\n-phenomenal professor (I love Prof. Camacho!!)\r\nweaknesses\r\n-discussions felt a bit forced at times",
                "This course is a good survey. However, it was difficult to engage with, as a student with little to no background in these topics, because so many of the students in the class were ER&M majors at the end of their Yale careers who already had a good grounding in the subject. It was really interesting to listen to their discussions, and I learned a lot, but I didn't feel like I could really contribute anything. I'm not sure if that's really a weakness of the course, though.",
                "Discussion sections were too big, and lectures started to feel a bit repetitive. I think this class would have been better served by the traditional format of 2 50 minutes lectures and a 50 minute discussion section each week, rather than two 75 minute classes that rolled it all together",
                "strengths: Professor Camacho is wonderful and the TFs were so helpful and responsive; well-adapted to pandemic times; engaging lectures\r\nweaknesses: because it is a survey course, the class prioritizes breadth over depth",
                "This class is a great introduction into these key and relevant topics as it covers a broad range of racial and social issues. I think my only complaint, if you can even call it that, was that I would have liked to explore more in-depth on a couple of topics more. However, given the scope of the issues we needed to cover, I guess this would have been logistically very challenging.",
                "The class is extremely fast paced, so sometimes it feels as though we don't get to really understand certain concepts because we can only learn so much about a time in history in one week. The lecture was also not engaging enough, and it made it very easy to lose interest. The discussion sections were incredibly helpful.",
                "The readings were very great and varied. I wish we had had more time in section rather than in lecture, because I found that section was the way I got the most out of the readings.",
                "There is so much content and it is never clear how much or what we need to retain. The first few lectures are deceivingly confusing, it gets better afterward. The professor and TFs were nice. \r\n\r\nI think there needs to be more clear communication on what we need to know after each lecture. The Professor also went over time constantly. I think it would be helpful to get more direction on how we should write our assignments and what they're looking for. Maybe even just providing a sample for each would be great. It felt like there was just so much that was just unclear, even though it was a manageable course and the content was interesting and important.",
                "A huge strength is the breadth of topics covered, respecting so many important historical events as well as different peoples. I appreciate the mix of lecture and discussion section because lectures are super informative but can be overwhelming because of the intensity of the content, so it is good to have a space to digest that in smaller groups. It should have more time, though! We often did not have enough time between lecture and discussion, so maybe the way we split up the two components could be improved.",
                "i wish that the lectures themselves offered more opportunity for class engagement. it was hard for me to do nothing but listen for up to 75 minutes. otherwise the professor (and all of the TFs) were always very kind and helpful, the readings were always applied well, and discussions were very generative.",
                "Strengths: a wide range of interesting topics discussed, lectures were always engaging, light workload, AMAZING professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: discussion sections were not as lively sometimes",
                "Strengths: The material is so interesting and so important. Professor Camacho is absolutely amazing! One of the most caring professors I've ever met\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes due to the intensity of the material, and to the online format, participation in our small group sections was lacking which made them less enjoyable.",
                "Sections were rather large so discussion was a little difficult.",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nThe lectures were not engaging it all.",
                "The course could be more focused and it often glosses over periods. It also can benefit from incorporating more non-US history.",
                "With short readings and large discussion sections, it is easy for students to get through the course without learning a lot. With effort, though, it served as an insightful class.",
                "I loved the incorporation of multimedia into the course and how student interest helped influence the syllabus. It was well-organized",
                "This class connects many elements of the ERM major, and gives brief overviews of lots of things related to ethnic studies, it provides a discussion space for people to learn about them for the first times",
                "Strengths: Class assignments allow you to be very creative, class readings build on each other, though this course is a survey course, it allowed me to gain robust understandings of some key concepts which I can look more into in future ER&M classes\r\n\r\nChanges: I think it would be helpful to have a few more slides with images!",
                "I wish the Canvas page would have been updated with lecture overviews consistently.",
                "The professor is very smart and knows a lot about a wide range of topics, but at times discussions in class weren't very smooth.",
                "I thought that this class worked really well as an overview of the topics. However, I think a few things that could make it better are making more connections between topics and reading more fundamental readings. For the first of those, I think that there were connections that were made across weeks, but they were less specific to the topics of the class like capitalism, resistance, etc. I would be interested to have traced more of the specific ideas like indigineity in conversation with the Middle Passage or anti-Semitism or Orientalism and terrorism or Orientalism and colonization of the continents currently known as the Americas. As for the second suggestion, I specifically remember that a lot of references to the book 'Orientalism' by Edward Said were made but that we had other readings those weeks instead. These occasional weaknesses speak to the strength of flexibility in this course though. This was a very, very challenging semester to learn and to exist, and Professor Camacho was very attuned to the difficulties students were facing. Fingers cross future semesters will contain less trauma in the globe, and these changes can have the space to be considered.",
                "Good class overall! Definitely harder to be engaged over Zoom but the discussion section component was helpful.",
                "i wish there was more time to go in depth during lectures but really I had no complaints.",
                "Professor Camacho was a great professor and the class was well structured with clear units and readings.",
                "One major strength of this course was Professor Camacho who is special, intelligent, kind, humble, and so accommodating towards students. She made the course accepting and a safe place for students. I also like how the course is organized starting from race, the overarching theme in the class, then to indigenous studies and then so on in a timely order until the present.",
                "Professor Camacho introduces students to a wide variety of racial relations but theres a specific focus on only a few groups (Black Americans and migrants from South America). Most of the classes are in a lecture style and there is little time for students to actively participate.",
                "Strengths: the variety of topics that were covered, the professor's profound understanding of the course material, the relevant weekly readings Weaknesses: communication over assignments and expectations were not always clearly stated.",
                "Strengths: This course was phenomenal. The entire teaching team is incredibly understanding and wants to see you thrive and learn. \r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "strengths: The content is interesting, engaging, and relevant and lectures weren't too long. The readings are also very manageable and interesting.\r\nweaknesses: sometimes section felt a bit unnecessary",
                "I wish we had more time in discussion section but this course was a great survey course.",
                "i thought the setup of this course was very good, especially the conversations we got to have in discussion section.",
                "I think this course could improve from a more structured time frame. At times, the live lecture would go over, and we would have little time during the virtual seminar. Discussing our readings was my favorite part of the class, and a better balance and management of time would be a great improvement.",
                "The overall organization of the layout of the course was a major strength as it is what allowed me to make connections between material of various weeks at all points of the semester. However, I felt that the individual presentations at times required more structure as it seemed like the excellent ideas and interpretations Prof. Camacho presented didn't always correlate with the visuals on the slides."

                "I really liked the fact that there were small group discussions alongside the lectures. Also within these small groups, doing breakout rooms with even smaller groups initially was helpful to gather one's thoughts. I also liked sharing music\/video through zoom and thought it was a good way of taking advantage of this new virtual learning world.",
                "my discussion was rather big, but breakout rooms did help a bit.",
                "Although the discussion sections after each lecture helped me stay focused during the lecture and engaged throughout the course in general, there was often minimal participation and commentary from peers. Although breakout rooms were incorporated to get people discussing the themes in a smaller and potentially more natural environment, there was often little talking in those as well. I think the online nature of the discussion sections made it hard for people to get excited about contributing, and I don't have a clear way to fix this, but I think narrowing the question might make it easier to answer. Or, it might be helpful to treat the discussion part of the class as a mini class itself where students can go through a video or article and talk about that specifically rather than the huge themes discussed the hour before.",
                "I am not sure how the class would have been in-person, but sometimes the lectures took up most of the class time and didn't leave much time to have group discussions.",
                "Having discussion sections will always be difficult in the time of COVID, but breaking up the time so only half of the hour and 15 minutes were lecture, the other half section, helped a lot with engagement",
                "The closed captioning and recording of lectures were very helpful.",
                "The attempt at doing the Global Playlist was good, but it was difficult to get 17 people to work together over Zoom. I think in person the assignment would've been fine.",
                "more all in person discussion\r\nwas good but a lot of the engagement was negatively affected by the virtual format.",
                "Online lectures with a 100 person class did not feel very interactive. However, Professor Camacho's lectures were very good.",
                "I wished the lecture outlines were posted before class so we can prepare for lectures better. The lectures were recorded in the beginning of the semester, but Professor Camacho stopped doing that later during the semester. Some of the lectures were quite long and took up discussion time. I really wished we had more time to discuss with small groups since there were a lot of people in the class. A separate discussion section (not part of class time) would be helpful for the class and will allow students to understand the material better.",
                "There could be more opportunities for students to actively discuss and participate in smaller groups",
                "Succeeded: small breakout rooms during discussion section helped to encourage student engagement. Could be improved: getting students to participate in the large lecture setting.",
                "Professor Camacho made it interactive over zoom and she was also cautious of Zoom fatigue!",
                "Including a seminar portion of the class made it far more engaging than it otherwise would have been with only the larger lecture component as the smaller setting mitigated anxieties about speaking in classes.",
                "i thought the virtual lecture was efficient, but made it harder to engage during lecture since we couldnt always see visuals and be face to face.",
                "I think all practices succeeded.",
                "I felt that the conjunction of both live lecture and the discussion section discussions of the assigned reading that followed immediately after was a major success in helping my learning during the pandemic. My only suggestion for this course would be to find or develop activities that could encourage student participation during the lectures themselves."

                "Yes!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, regardless of their major. I believe that this class covers materials that are essential to learn before graduating college, largely in order to be able to navigate the word around us and be mindful of the people in it.",
                "Yes. I had no idea what I was getting into with this course, but it surprised me. The content, learning environment, and leadership (professor AND teaching fellows\/assistants) were excellent.",
                "Yes! This course provides a solid foundation for seeing the world and the inequities perpetuated by settler colonialist structures more clearly.",
                "Absolutely! Truly wonderful class. I feel like I was introduced to so many new perspectives that I had not thought about before. I feel like everyone should take this class.",
                "Absolutely amazing course that invites students to think critically about the continuation of colonialism, origins and implications of \"race,\" \"gender,\" and \"nationality,\" and so much more! Wide variety of weekly readings that provide new insights and perspectives, and the assignments were very engaging and allowed students to consider the impacts of music, movies, novels, etc  in society and their relatedness to discussed themes.",
                "Yes! Professor Camacho is so kind, and this is a great introduction to ER&M. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn outside of the colonial construct of regular academia.",
                "I'd recommend this class.",
                "I had long been wanting to take an ER&M class, and a I was just a little disappointed in this one. It felt like we surveyed too broad a range of topics to really get much depth on any of them. That said, lectures were interesting and the workload was fairly light, which makes this course appropriate for a broad range of students and desires.",
                "Yes, I think everyone should learn about issues of Indigenous sovereignty, Black liberation, etc. Because it is an introductory course, I would also recommend supplementing it with other classes in the ER&M department!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student (STEM majors and non-STEM majors alike). Especially as a STEM major myself, I think it's critical that we also get exposure to some of these issues to become better educated on these topics. To this end, this course is a very good introduction to many of the racial and social issues surrounding our world and I think it gave me a much better understanding of the underlying causes and potentially where society can go from here.",
                "Yes, because you will learn a lot. You will also read so much important literature in the anti-colonial anti-imperialist canon. Also, it is not a stressful course, so you can learn without anxiety of many assignments.",
                "Yes, this is a great class. You learn new ways of thinking about topics you might have discussed before. It is also a great addition to any semester!!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student if they were already interested in the material and already knew it before coming into the class. Otherwise it's difficult to contribute in section. \r\n\r\nThe lectures could end up being very long and boring, even though the material itself is interesting and very important to learn.\r\n\r\nIf you take this course you can't be certain you'll have feedback on written assignments. You'll most likely feel a bit confused as to what you should be doing and learning.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to learn more about the topics discussed. However, this course can be difficult thematically. Professor Schmidt Camacho takes special care to make sure we discuss the topics gently and respectfully, but at the end of the day, the subject matter of this course is emotionally taxing (especially when it addresses issues or people groups you identify with). I highly recommend this course to all students but would advise someone to make sure they're in a good place mentally before enrolling.",
                "Yes, it does a great job at introducing you to very complex topics. The professor and TFs are also always there to help you.",
                "Definitely. It is very different from other ER&M courses that tend to focus on specific topics. That is very important, but this foundation is crucial to understanding how race and ethnicity have developed as concepts and systems in this world. The assigned readings are super well-chosen and thought-provoking. It is a very heavy class emotionally because of how it details oppression, but it can also be uplifting in the knowledge that we gain and the community we form within the class.",
                "If you are interested in receiving the pre-req for various cool ER&M courses, yes.",
                "if you're looking for a solid overview of this field, then yes. if you're looking for something very specific i would shop around to see what best fits you.",
                "Yes, I already have to several people. Love this class. Learned so much. Very interesting. Amazing professor and instructors",
                "Yes! Even if you're not an ER&M major the class is super interesting and it discusses topics that everyone should be exposed to! The workload is also very manageable and engaging!",
                "Yes I definitely would! If you're interested at all in the topics and issues surrounding ethnicity, race, migration, POC studies, etc. then yes take it!",
                "Yes! please take it. It is amazing and you learn so much. The assignments are really cool and most of all you gain a community.",
                "Yes! This course is a must-take during your time at Yale. The ER&M Program is wonderful and Professor Camacho is the kindest professor I've had at Yale.",
                "If you're looking to cover as many topics in ER&M as possible then I would highly recommend. If you're looking to engage with a specific topic then I'd look at other ER&M courses before taking this one.",
                "100% Although the course will not provide you with the answers to the issues and inequities presented, it will give you the foundation needed to continue examining issues of race, ethnicity, migration, capitalism, and colonization. During the course, I often felt as though I was not retaining much information, but when I began to write my final paper, I realized that I was more confident and prepared to discuss certain topics. This even extended to discussions with family and friends. Even if you're not majoring in ER&M, this is a great class to take, as it will push you to learn more about the world and current movements and struggles. Professor Camacho is extremely kind and wants you to do well, and it's important to interpret this as a reason to try even more in this course and stay engaged because you will only get out what you put in. Additionally, the readings are not overwhelming in terms of length, and many lectures\/readings focus on art as a means of resistance, which was wonderful!",
                "Absolutely.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! As a STEM student, it is easy to stay in that bubble of STEM-centered classes. However, this class helped take me out of my comfort zone while teaching me so much about the world around me.",
                "Yes but if you have a more in-depth background in issues of race and identity some of the curriculum will feel old\/redundant.",
                "I would recommend this class to everyone who isn't an ERM major, because I think a basis of this history is helpful for everyone. For everyone who is an ERM major, this class is required, and although it isn't my favorite I've taken for this department, it is great for people who want to learn more about what ERM majors learn about, in a broad sense",
                "YES! I think everyone at Yale should take this class. It is so important that everyone has some exposure to these histories and studies!",
                "Absolutely. Everyone should take this course.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. If you haven't engaged in critical theory before, this is a good place to start. If you have, this class is often criticized for not containing enough new material, but I think it's the kind of class that everyone can get something out of.",
                "Yes, I think it made it possible to engage with many different cultures and groups and allowed me to have a different perspective on the world",
                "Yes. I think it's a great course to learn about the histories of minority groups in the US and the discrimination they have faced.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course because you have the opportunity to meet Professor Camacho and caring TAs. The class gives a general overview of some very important concepts that everyone must know and care about.",
                "I think this is a great class for any student, regardless of major, to get a better understanding of race relations and how modern society has a tangible trace to colonial and race practices from the past.",
                "Yes, I would strongly recommend this course to any student of any major. This course in an excellent introduction to both historical and contemporary discussions on topics such as indigenous sovereignty, slavery, resistance movements, and immigration.",
                "Yes! Everyone should take this course before they graduate.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to everyone! The professor is amazing and all the material covered in class is knowledge applicable in the real world and history we should all know. The work load was very manageable and the staff is very accommodating. I looked forward to doing the readings (that says a lot) and coming to this class every week. Readings were good lengths and the assignments we had were very manageable - you also had great freedom in choosing your topics and end up learning a lot from the tasks. Grading was also really fair and I felt like my work was valued!",
                "yes",
                "I would if you are majoring in ER&M (major requirement) or if you don't know too much about the department\/ethnic studies. It's a good course but definitely a survey course.",
                "Yes; this course is a comprehensive beginners overview to developing an anti-racist pedagogy and vocabulary in one's life. It should be made a Yale requirement to take this course.",
                "if you are looking for a good humanities credit, i would recommend this course! the workload is very manageable, and you learn a lot and get to have very good discussions!",
                "Yes! Definitely! This is just a really important class for any student to take, and the professor is such a joy that truly cares about her students. All the TFs are passionate and great as well.",
                "Yes, I would recommend to all students (no matter the major). This course allowed me to learn about history in a completely new lens which may feel a bit awkward at first for many as it is a form of learning that you may not be used to in comparison to the history classes you have taken in high school, but it is this new perspective of analyzing the past that allows you to recognize patterns you wouldn't have otherwise noticed had you not taken this class and is what makes this course so unique!",
                "Yes, everyone should take it."
