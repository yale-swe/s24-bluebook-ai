                "This course does an excellent job solidifying French grammar skills ranging from the pass compos to the subjunctive. I also appreciated the introduction to important French literature. The films were very helpful for building listening comprehension skills.",
                "I learned so much in this class, even beyond French language. This has been my third semester of French at Yale, and it was the first where we delved into culture, literature, and film. Discussing the books we read and their contents not only made me a better french speaker, but also impacted my critical thinking and analytical skills.",
                "I improved my french listening and reading skills greatly.",
                "I learned so much, even though I felt behind the entire time! I learned more about reading and writing French, although speaking was difficult.",

                "This course has a very heavy workload. While some units were more difficult than others, I was spending two or three hours per day doing the homework, studying for quizzes, etc. during some weeks in the semester. Some of the homework is honestly outdated, and the Jim et Jules MMP's were sometimes disorganized. The Course Packet was helpful to a certain degree, but I wasn't able to really learn the material until it was explained in class. The homework felt like busy work most of the time, and I felt like I was devoting too much time to just filling out worksheets. Additionally, I felt like I was being assessed in this class very often. The bi-weekly exams were manageable, but there were some weeks when I had two or three quizzes/tests in a row. I also don't think it's fair that French classes have finals, while most other language classes do not. That came up in my conversations with my peers, and it was just frustrating to have another exam on my plate that other departments don't mandate.",
                "Love that it is really fast-paced! I would love for discussion practice.",
                "I thought the MMPs were very helpful for understanding the audio assignments. The course packet exercises did not always clearly outline the grammar rules, but the grammar explanations in class were very helpful. The fiches that we were given were also very helpful for understanding the grammar.",
                "I found no weaknesses with the course! I liked the variety of activities we did when learning grammar and vocabulary, and also enjoyed the way each unit was about the same amount of time, giving us two weeks to discuss each piece we looked at.",
                "One strength of the course was that I was able to learn a lot of grammar and my listening skills improved a lot. I also felt that the course was organized well and was on a nice schedule. One downside of the course was that we rarely ever spoke in class. My french speaking actually got worse in this class because we spoke in french so little. I wish we had more time to speak about things that weren't grammar or the book because sometimes i was hesitant to speak about those because I was still learning. I also felt that the gap between how I felt I was doing in the class and the grades I got on the tests was very big. I also disliked the workbook that we used and it didn't help me at all. The level of grammar perfection asked of us was really high and I found it really discouraging how this course was formatted.",
                "There is so much work! Please, let us catch a break! Other than that, the course was great.",
                "I think that if homework were checked regularly, it would make for a more engaging experience."

                "Given the difficulty, I would advise another student to consider taking another language unless they are particularly interested in French. You have to really care about the language, or care enough about your grades, to succeed on each exam, quiz, essay, etc.",
                "It is a lot of work, but if you love French, I definitely recommend it!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It is very helpful for learning French grammar.",
                "I would definitely recommend French 130 to other students. I feel like I learned more than just a semester's worth of french and am so much more confident in my speaking skills. It is really all encompassing and is the first step past just learning the structures of language.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. I personally felt that this course was overly difficult, especially because I didn't improve my french almost at all. To really improve my french, I think I could have taken classes over the summer at a community college near my house or online french. It's also frustrating when I see my friends in other languages making more progress than I am. I am not the type of student to slack off and am determined to become fluent in french, however, this course was not a good way to work towards that goal. The best part of this course was Prof. Bedoui and if i were to recommend one of my friends to take french I would recommend her.",
                "It was, after all, a requirement, so. I don't have much of a choice but to recommend it haha",
