On a skill-based level, I learned more about lighting, sound, and the art of the interview and how to use all of those aspects to achieve a good documentary.",

I'm not entirely sure about a weakness for this class, the professor was great in making sure the class went well.",

Nearly 4 hours. And most days it did go until the last minute. Some of the docs we watched were really long and experimental. The readings were also pretty niche."

It's also just a fun class where you can freely express your creativity.",
                "Well, it depends. If you're into documentary theory, then yes. If you have a documentary idea in mind and want some way to execute it, then sure. But otherwise, I would proceed with caution. The class is extremely long and can be really draining if you're not super interested in the content. The readings are similarly long. Steiner is great! I just wish this class was split into two days, so it didn't have to be 4 hours long."
