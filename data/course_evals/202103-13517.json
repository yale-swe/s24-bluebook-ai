Other general topics I learned a lot about was cathemerality in owl monkeys, sleep changes with age, sleep and mental health, sleep disorders, improving sleep, how sleep changes in various conditions, and impacts of sleep deprivation.",

Though some of the facts were indeed very interesting, they sometimes felt disjointed throughout the course. However, we did learn very useful skills about improving your quality of sleep which I am definitely applying to my personal life. I do feel like I gained a better understanding of the concept of sleep, which I believe is important as it's one of few actions that all people partake in.",
                "I was nervous about this course because in general, I haven't done well in STEM courses at Yale. I was pleasantly surprised by how accessible this course was for non-STEM majors! I feel as though I have a really solid understanding of the science of sleep and its implications on general wellness, thanks to this course. I also gained a much better understanding of introductory neuroscience, especially the ways in which the nervous system impacts physiological and psychological health. This is really valuable information that will allow me to better take care of myself. Thank you!",

I was super interested in the content of the class and have always been fascinated with the topic of sleep science, but somehow the professors made the content particularly unengaging and boring. Some of the guest lectures were amazing, but other in that I gained very little from this class. It seems like the professors hardly care at all about the class and put the minimum effort in to check the boxes and move forward in the class.",
                "You will learn the basics about sleep in science, the history of sleep science, and some developments in art and psychology that have heavily featured sleep topics. \r\nYou will learn how to keep a sleep log and how to calculate different parts of your sleep such as social jet lag, total sleep, sleep onset latency, etc. \r\nYou will also hear from many leading experts in diverse fields of sleep science.",

After having taken PSYC 160, The Human Brain, I was excited by the opportunity to take a deep dive into the phenomenon of sleep from both a psychological and neuroscience-centered perspective, but was met with a conglomeration of trivia facts that tenuously connect to the theme of sleep. I do not think this course should not be listed as a science distributional crediteverything scientific about the class was covered in half a single lecture in The Human Brain. I respect the professors' goal of making science accessible to non-STEM students, but I believe they could do it in a way that results in the more than the accumulation arbitrary and often outdated knowledge about assorted accidents that have to do with sleep, sleep in art and literature, and the state of sleep research. The examinations were one area that could have been improved. As I mentioned, they were effectively trivia that have no bearing on the subject whatsoever. I was unfortunately disappointed by even the little bit of information I learned in this class that had to do with sleep science.",

            "comments": [
                "A big strength in the course is all the guest lecturers that visit the class, it is very interesting getting to listen to many people from Yale's faculty and their research, especially how it can be applied to sleep. They give some of the most unique talks that are nice to listen to. The course material is also very easy to understand and is easily applicable to daily life or those around you. Only weakness is that all the readings for each class are much more supplementary than the syllabus implies. A lot of time is saved without the readings without any loss of understanding.",
                "The readings were pretty unnecessary as anything that would be important for the class was covered again during lecture. The strength of the course probably comes from the way it tackles sleep from many different angles, making it so that people with varying interests can still be engaged. Also, although the presentations on the last day were funny and some of them were quite good, I feel like it didn't make sense to have presentations in a lecture course. The guest lecturers varied in content and quality.",
                "Strengths: cool information about sleep\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could definitely be more engaging and there were way too many assignments\/final projects in the last two weeks of the course",
                "The content of the class I think could use some rearranging. For the exams, I didn't know what to study\/what was and wasn't important from the readings and classes because we covered everything from art history to formulas about how to calculate sleep lag and whatnot. Also, I truly do not think the finals package for this class needed a pset, final paper, final exam AND a final group project (which is already hard to do without being in a lecture that doesn't have section where you can't really talk to those around you).\r\n\r\nI appreciate how they structured the readings and always posted the slides. Also the care the professors seemed to have about their students' mental health.",
                "Strengths: I liked that the material covered lots of different subjects: sleep in art and literature, evolutionary biology, cognitive science etc. I also appreciated that there was a variety of different types of assignments: a creative piece, 2 tests, a scientific paper, a project, etc. Weakness: majority of the assignments concentrated around the midterm and final.",
                "The strengths of this course are that the professors really know what they are talking about in terms of sleep science. If you talk to them after class or email them with a question, they are extremely knowledgeable and have nuanced understandings of the content of the class. In terms of strengths, that's about it. The main weaknesses of this class are that it is really difficult to put lots of effort when the professors don't really care about the class. Also, the content could be made much more engaging than just talking to the lecture hall. Questions could be asked to elicit feedback from the class, discussion sections could be held regularly, etc.",
                "Mandatory attendance was quite pointless for a lecture course during a pandemic. The instructors seemed kind but at times were not responsive to emails. There is also absolutely no reason to have a final exam, final project, final presentation and a final paper. For a class that did indeed teach me about the importance of sleep, it sure took a lot away from me during the last few weeks of the semester. Exams were tricky and tested minute details even when we were told to study big picture concepts. The class got super repetitive by the end  the first half of the course was way more interesting",
                "The strengths of this course are its organization and its passion. So many of the guest lecturers who came in were thrilled to share their research with us. Professor Kryger clearly has put a lot of love into this course, and before every break, he gave an impassioned speech about how much we mean to him in keeping this course alive.\r\nThe course also offers great flexibility in terms of its assessments. I wrote a short story for my midterm combining the wizard of oz with Alice in Wonderland. So when the description says SC for humanities students, it is true. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the weaknesses of the course far outweighed the strengths. Personally, I am a quality over quantity type of student. For our final, we had four different assessments, and each of them were very ambiguous and easy. However, each of them required a great deal of time. Why not choose one and make it meaningful? The lectures were long and uninteresting, and I do not know a single student who did any of the readings by the fourth week of class. I did not take this class intending to take a gut, but I found it next to impossible to treat the class as even a real class almost immediately based on how boring the material was and the quality of slide shows. \r\n\r\nI mean, picture this:\r\na gif of a dog falling down\r\nclick\r\ncaption reads: What is this?\r\nClass shouts out: A dog!\r\nclick\r\ncaption reads: narcolepsy \r\nend of powerpoint, no real science discussed for another few classes\r\n\r\nThis is an extreme example, but it shows you how basic this course was and truly felt like I was not even enrolled in a class.",

                "The workload comes in chunks that can lead to a lot of stress (you could have very little to do for a month then have a paper due and a quiz in the same week) and the material can be repetitive at times, but it is very important information we learn and",
                "Strengths: breadth of topics and how sleep affects them and how important sleep is; weaknesses: repetition of information",
                "The lectures were very boring and it would be better if they were more engaging. It's a mystery of sleep class, which I guess meant it had to be engineered so you'd fall asleep during it.",
                "This course was really well tailored for non-STEM students and offered a ton of variety of content on sleep. Much of the knowledge and art regarding sleep that we were exposed to in the course was extremely Eurocentric. During the lecture of sleep in art, the professor explained that his book contained art involving sleep of all cultures and he simply did not have time to include art from all cultures. I think this was an easy way to not be mindful of representing how other cultures have had significant ideas regarding sleep in the past and currently. This is something that could be discussed in almost any topic of sleep- not just art. Several cultures have had ideas regarding sleep for millennia and the timeline of sleep history gave the impression that only Europeans have been asking philosophical and scientific questions about sleep. This is once again harmful not only harmful for non European students, but also it gives incomplete information to students.",
                "Strength: it offered opportunities for students to learn about sleep in an interdisciplinary way\r\nWeakness: the course lacked the science depth I was hoping to get from a class like this. Additionally, the assignments sometimes felt open-ended to the point of nebulousness which wasnt ideal.",
                "The strength of this course lies primarily in the fact that, if you know and care very little about science, you will still be able to do well. It is easy, both in terms of workload and grading; you don't have to do a single reading in order to understand the class, and most of the readings offer little beyond intuitive knowledge of sleep. The assessments included fun essay prompts and a final project in addition to benign exams. There were a couple interesting guest lectures, the only opportunities I found in the class to learn something that was of scientific importance. The poor nature of the class could be attributed to a lack of rigor that made it easy, but not all guts have to be useless. Realistically, the weakness of this class comes from disorganized and unscientific content combined with classroom instruction that was not engaging. Things like the instructors simply reading the repetitive information that was on the slides contributed to this lack of engagement.",
                "This courses weaknesses include lectures that may be un engaging due to increased scientific content within a sample size of mainly humanities students.",
                "Strengths: this is an under-instructed subject and I appreciated the education on it. It definitely helped me understand how to improve my sleep schedule and that was helpful. The teachers were lenient with deadlines and that was very appreciated, especially during final stressors and amidst the pandemic. I appreciated the review sessions before the midterms.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures were honestly not engaging. The slides had a lot of information on them, and it was generally unclear as to which information we should know versus the information we should not know. It was a mix of Science and Humanities-based information, and it was hard as to how deep we had to understand each concept.\r\n\r\nPerhaps following the 9x9 slide technique (9 words, 9 photos, etcetera) would make the lectures more engaging. When there was entire paragraphs on each slide, it became easy to lose engagement and mind-wander. Also, maybe catering the slides more to relevant information nowadays would be helpful! There were definitely some real-life examples, but they were few and far between. The class being 4-5:15pm probably contributed to the lack of engagement during lectures, as it was hard to stay awake at this time of day. Perhaps moving the class to an earlier time would change the feel and energy.",
                "I liked the lectures a lot and thought they were engaging. Having guest lectures was particularly interesting and a great feature of this course. The professors were very kind and receptive to requests for outside assistance despite their busy schedules.\r\n\r\nHowever, having so much of the guest lectures tested on our examination was difficult, because the guest lecturers taught in a way much different from the professors so it was hard to study what they said.\r\n\r\nAlso, this course seemed to unload a multitude of assignments all in the span of a week or two during midterm and final season. This was incredibly hard for me to manage as these were the times in which my other courses were also holding examinations and assigning papers. I wish our big assignments had been given to us throughout the semester rather than all at once. It would have made me relax and incentivized me to explore the topics of the course much more deeply. \r\n\r\nI also would have wanted to see which questions I got wrong on the exams, as I still am not sure of what I know and what I dont know.",

It's accessible to students across all academic disciplines, which can be a rarity at Yale. Moreover, the knowledge that students gain from this class is easily applicable to everyday life and general wellness. Everyone should take it if they can! This course would also do really well on Coursera or another online module; I think people all around the world would be interested in it!",

While it is indeed a gut, the finals schedule is insane and frankly abusive (a 10 page paper, an exam AND a creative project? Literally unheard of.) Do yourself a favor and DO NOT TAKE. The only mystery is how I didn't sleep through every single class.",

The topic is incredibly interesting and importantI will definitely use some of the things I learned in this course for the rest of my life. For the most part, the workload was fair, but it was bit much in the end (a final exam, a project, and a paper all due around the same timewhich could have easily been more spaced out). The exams (all multiple choice) also felt a bit like playing sleep trivia with high stakes instead of testing our understanding of the main concepts in the course, but they don't count for that much of the grade. Overall, I would definitely recommend this courseprobably one of the best SC credits you can take because it's such a valuable topic to understand.",

                "Yes. It was very interesting and a fantastic science credit",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about sleep and\/or who is nervous about finding an accessible science credit.",
                "Yes. Its a fun and relatively easy science credit",
                "If you're a humanities major looking for an easy STEM credit, definitely. I did virtually none of the readings, stopped taking notes in class a month into the semester, and studied for two hours max for each of the two exams and still managed an 85 on both of them. It's not a total gut, since the two 8-page papers are a decent amount of work, but I'd rather take a slightly harder class about sleep (which is interesting) than easier but deadly dull alternatives."
