    "This class had the most impact on the way I view the world out of all my classes. I think every college student should be mandated to take this class. It is truly so enlightening.",
    "I learned to interpret dense pieces on facts, truth, and objectivity. I also developed my writing to reflect deeper analysis.",
    "I developed my reading and writing skills by taking this course.",
    "What is truth? Why do we care about it? How has the concept of truth changed over time and how does the media play a role in truth?",
    "Basic knowledge on politics is needed.",
    "Through this course I greatly developed my writing and reading skills. I feel as though my ability to critically read and evaluate pieces of text has developed immensely.",
    "Writing skills, research abilities, and reading.",
    "I became more cautious with the specific words I choose and the meaning I want to convey. I've also become better at thinking of the big picture goal of my writing, thinking about what my problem is, what my claim addresses, and how I evidence this. Lastly, I left the course with a keen eye for political deception and misleading information within the news and other media sources.",
    "Putting my thoughts to words with greater clarity. \r\nTaking what people say with a grain of salt.",
    "I learned a lot about, as the title says, \"Telling the Truth,\" among a number of other political philosophy topics. I learned a lot about how to write proper essays, and improved my command of the English language significantly."

   "comments": [
    "The class was great, although I do wish we spent more time having discussions about the readings.",
    "Strengths: fascinating\/challenging readings, detailed feedback on every paper\r\nWeaknesses: essays had similar prompts",
    "The strengths of this course were the discussions. Hearing everybody's thoughts on the readings was very insightful and helped me learn a lot. In addition, the professor's feedback on papers was always very thorough and clear, and the primary reason I was able to improve my writing.",
    "Seminar style with a great professor and lots of feedback for your academic writing. No weaknesses.",
    "The 11-student seminar is still too big to have sufficient discussion.",
    "Professor Riley was a fantastic teacher of this course, it was very very thorough and broad in the types of reading and writing that we were required to do, and I feel that it is the perfect course for those who are wanting to improve their writing skills.",
    "Strengths: excellent teaching, engaging environment, useful knowledge.\r\nWeaknesses: possibly none.",
    "The course is fantastic for improving the focus and precision of your writing. The readings provided also force you to think deeply of political deception.",
    "Its a complete package for academic writing in Yale. The section focused on American politics, which is relevant."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It entirely changes the way you think about truth and the world.",
    "Yes! Professor Riley challenges her students to think critically, but also show fairness to the authors we analyze. Overall, I felt that my reading and writing skills noticeably improved.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course changed how I view politics. It also helped me make my writing more clear and concise.",
    "Yes; everyone needs to take an English 114, theyre so helpful",
    "Take this course",
    "Yes I would recommend this course for anyone who needs essay writing and critical reading skills for their studies.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in improving their writing abilities and learning about conducting research for a paper.",
    "You should take this course if you feel as if you need help with your writing, and you NEED to take this course if you think you don't. Also, this class is important in the modern political atmosphere with deception and misleading information rampant throughout the news.",
    "I would, if the person is interested in American politics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Riley is there to make sure you improve as a writer, but also as a thinker. She will meet with you to help improve your essays, your writing, and in turn, your grade. She is good at facilitating discussion and the readings (although at time difficult) are intellectually stimulating. I don't have any knowledge of how interesting other English 114 courses are, but this one most certainly is."
