                "Knowledge about the macro models of monetary policies and how the Fed uses its tools to effectively support the economy. \r\nWe first introduced macro models for our discussion, inclusing New Keynesian models and Phillips Curves. Then we learned about how the Fed implements monetary policies. People may think that interest rate control is the only measure for the Fed to support the economy, but it is not actually true. In addition to that, we talked about some unconventional policies the the Fed has used since the Global Financial Crisis, including forward guidance and asset purchases (a.k.a. quantative easing), together with discussions on their efficacy. In addition to that, Professor English also introduces other tools used by other central banks, especially in response to the pandemic crisis. Last but not the least, I learned a lot about how to communicate policy proposals to others, either by essays or in discussions.",
                "I learned models of the macroeconomy (New Keynesian, DSGE, etc.) and how rules-based and discretion-based policy both affect the Federal Reserve's practice of monetary policy, as well as new frameworks like inflation targeting. I was also able to learn how monetary policy differs in emerging market economies and how it was used to address the economic calamity that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, I learned the different monetary policy transmission channels, how to write a policy briefing\/memo, and the academic theory behind monetary policy. Overall, I learned a lot about the structure of the Federal Reserve and how it conducts monetary policy, which is an increasingly salient question for the macroeconomy overall.",
                "I learned about the various frameworks by which monetary policy is enacted and the factors the go into making these decisions. We took models learned in intermediate micro and macro and applied them to the decisions that a central bank makes.",

                "Strength: I think Professor English is a great instructor. Monetary policy is hard, but he talked about these ideas in a clear way and gave really insightful points from time to time. I like the structure of the course. Also the design of a combination of problem sets for macro models and essays for policy discussion really improved my understanding of monetary policy. Moreover, the class kept talking about new economic updates. You would have a better idea about what reports or statistics the officials at the Fed are monitoring and how they think about the strong output growth or inflation hikes. Another element that I liked about the class is the Tabletop exercise at the last class. We mocked the discussion of the Committee on a potential economic outlook case. It is so interesting to see that the class, despite small in size, shares varying views, some hawkish and some super dovish.\r\nWeakness: I think sometimes we may talk about a same topic for several times over the course. For example, I wrote on the Fed's new framework as my topic for first essay (we had some hints on this already by then), and after that we had another guest lecture on this topic again. Maybe it would be better to slightly adjust the structure.",
                "Strengths: The three papers all had interesting prompts and the content is very interesting. Prof. English is very nice and willing to help.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the papers were returned a little bit earlier to allow us to have more time for the paper rewrite. The course is very math-based and theoretical at the beginning, which is a bit hard and murky to get through, whereas the ending is much more interesting.",

                "Strengths are the careful design of the course material and thoughtful written feedback on all the papers.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness might be that as a WR credit, the final exam itself still counts for 40% of the grade."

                "I definitely recommend this class to other students. You would learn a lot from Professor English, who himself stayed in the Fed's system for more than 20 years. There are both theoretical and practial aspects in this course. From my experience, I learned about both the macroeconomic models and the practical ways to implement monetary policies. The workload is a bit higher with 4 problem sets and 3 essays, but I think it worth the efforts and you will learn a lot from the feedbacks from Professor English.\r\nOverall I love this course a lot. I would rate it as one of the best Economics courses I have ever taken here at Yale.",
