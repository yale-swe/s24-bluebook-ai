    "Learned a lot about the processes in development.",
    "I now have a basic understanding of how embryogenesis works in various model organisms, and why a small subset of signaling pathways can effectively and spatiotemporally control all of development. I am also better at understanding experimental design and interpreting data, and connect themes surrounding cell fate and differentiation between this class and other previous biology courses (eg. genetics, evolutionary bio).",
    "Learned a ton about the developmental pathways of many model organisms. Also lots about the experimental techniques needed to do high level biology.",
    "This course gave an incredible overview of important themes, concepts, and experimental techniques in developmental biology. I learned about the development of the embryo from fertilization through gastrulation and beyond, cell movement mechanisms, signal transduction pathways and morphogens, establishing the body plan of an embryo, development of different organs and body parts, stem cells (techniques, experiments, medical uses, and controversies), and even evolutionary development.",
    "Almost none. Genuinely learned very little",
    "Evolution, interpreting dense research studies",
    "I learned a little bit about the principles of development.",
    "I learned a lot about vertebrate development.",
    "Learned about various developmental concepts, and about stem cells.",
    "I learned how organisms develop starting from a single cell to the entire organism in pretty excruciating detail. I really learned how to study on my own with very little help\/straight up unhelpful or detrimental advice from teachers or staff.",
    "all the knowledge i learned was from the textbook",
    "I learned an abundance of details pertaining to MCDB related topics.",
    "I felt as though my biology knowledge really came together in this course. I was able to put together themes and patterns I had previously learned and really cemented them and advanced them."

   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the small lecture size; it made for a welcoming classroom environment where one could ask many questions and directly speak to the professors.",
    "The course is very well organized to facilitate learning, weekly quizzes really ensure that you stay on top of the material but aren't so difficult that they are a stressful experience. TA and professors are very approachable for help\/questions\/feedback.  Professor Holley's lectures and powerpoints are clear and informative, definitely a strength of the course. On the other hand, Professor Kankel's lectures could be better, his website slides often lacked key information and this made studying from them difficult when it came to the quizzes and exams. However, he is a good lecturer and explains things clearly in class - you just need to pay attention the whole time (which admittedly can be quite difficult in a 75min lecture.).",
    "Strengths - Professor Holley's lectures were very organized and clear. The weekly quizzes were helpful for understanding the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Professor Kankel's lectures were confusing and unorganized. He really should use PowerPoint slides all students can access whether they are on yale wifi or not, especially if there are midterms immediately after October and Thanksgiving breaks. There were no clear office hours. The course could benefit from a Peer Tutor like other science classes have.",
    "Honestly, I didn't think that there were too much strengths to this class - perhaps that we got through so much information, but all of it did require brute memorization which was not great. \r\n\r\nI didn't like the switching of lecturers.  I thought that sometimes it was difficult to go through Professor Kankel's website to find the slides needed. I thought that some of the quizzes were unnecessarily incredibly hard and sometimes the test questions were on things we were told we didn't have to remember.",
    "The course size is small (around 25 people), so there is ample opportunity to speak one on one with the professors after class. The weekly quizzes keep everyone on top of the material, and the 3 non-cumulative midterm structure takes a huge burden off of Reading Period. Lectures are really fascinating and structured well, and professors always ended on time or 1-2 minutes before the true end of class. Professor Holley is especially good at speaking at a reasonable pace so that students can take notes, and he pauses when talking about important concepts. That being said, the level of detail in the midterms is not reflected by the quizzes, and the midterms get more and more detail-oriented and challenging as the semester progresses (which I liked, but most students did not). There also isn't too much opportunity to ask questions during class. I would also have preferred to take notes on the lecture slides, but the slides were not uploaded until after class. Practice exams are usually offered, but there wasn't one for Exam 3 (which was also the midterm that we needed the most guidance on in terms of what to study for).",
    "Kankel and Holley have really different lecture styles, and Holley especially doesnt always space out his lectures well in terms of content. Kankels lectures are sometimes hard to follow bc of the powerpoint he uses.",
    "Quiz questions and some of test questions were way too broadseemed like the profs just wanted you to regurgitate everything you knew",
    "Strengths of the course are lack of homework and grade breakdown. There is very little work week-to-week yet I still felt that I learned so much. Weekly quizzes keep you up to date with the material, while 3 non-cumulative exams round out the rest of the work. Holley and Kankel are leaders in the field which is also great.",
    "I really appreciated the structure of the course. Having weekly quizzes covering only two lectures each, and three non-cumulative midterms, was very conducive to learning and retaining information. One weakness of the course was disparity in teaching styles\/ structures between the two instructors.",
    "Its taught very disorganizedly. Information doesnt build, it comes in scattered splotches. Compared to the intro bio sequence it was both easier in that there was less content, but also MUCH harder because it was so hard to follow how things were supposed to fit together, or grasp why they might be important.",
    "Strength: breadth of information covered, research focuses\r\nWeakness: some lectures, arbitrary grading and assessments",
    "Weaknesses- tests are made to wreck you! Honestly too much content for questions that are too broad",
    "The course was very poorly organized, taught, and tested, and it greatly impacted the course overall. The biggest weakness overall was the lack of transparency on the grading system, averages on quizzes, etc. The professors need to be way more clear about this because students have no idea what to expect and the range of scores in this class on exams and quizzes was incredibly wide, which points out how bad the teaching was. I think the class completely needs to be run by a different professor(s), with a complete overhaul of the content structure, syllabus, testing style, etc. I think the class would benefit from having a problem set structure rather than the quiz structure.",
    "The course is very well organized. The weekly quizzes + 3 non-cumulative exam format is great because it forces you to keep up with the material without being overwhelming. The course is also generally taught well and is really interesting. I would say the only weakness of the course is Prof. Kankel's lectures - they were often confusing, rambling, and slides didn't have text (which didn't pair well with the aforementioned rambling). They felt less organized and focused than Prof. Holley's lectures.",
    "The teachers are good. The grading is super opaque, however, and some lectures are just incredibly hard to understand. The material can be interesting, especially the end stem cell lectures, but it is a good course overall. Keep in mind that there is no curve.",
    "This class is straight cramming and then regurgitation. One strength is that there is no cumulative final at the end of the course. That would be just absolutely horrific. The weekly quizzes are also good for making sure you keep up with the material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses is that the class is not very cohesive. It's unclear how all the developmental processes are related to each other so it's pretty difficult to remember how the same signaling molecules are used in different combinations for all the different processes. Also Holley and Kankel's lectures are SO different so it's difficult what we need to know for exams. Quizzes and exams are also very ambiguous with wording so it's really difficult to know what they are asking for or what details they are looking for. They also do not hold office hours and the TA was not very helpful either. It is pretty interesting stuff but presented in such a dry and confusing manner. They also simplify a lot of things but don't tell us what they have simplified which can become very confusing when studying. They also don't give lecture notes out before hand which makes taking notes extremely difficult. It's difficult to follow especially because Holley talks pretty fast and Kankel has very disjointed sentences. Also Holley and Kankel straight up LEAVE 5 minutes into the exams and just leave the TA, but the TA doesn't write the exams. They tell us to look through the entire exam in the first 5 minutes and ask them questions before they leave which is ridiculous. Also the TA doesn't grade the exams so when we asked her questions she also didn't know how to answer our questions sometime which made exams extremely stressful. They also didn't post the previous exam for midterm 3 (which is helpful to get an idea of how in depth we should know information) and the reason for not posting it was that they usually don't make a key for that exam which doesn't make sense because it was supposedly last year's exam so the professors just seem kind of lazy in regards to making sure students do well. Also the professors nor the TA hold office hours for this class which makes getting help more difficult and makes the professors seem unapproachable.",
    "The weekly quizzes are a great way to keep up with the material and also understand the formatting of he midterm exams.",
    "strengths: none\r\n\r\nweaknesses: everything about the course - both professors did not seem to care about the classes; everyone was always confused, I was better off just reading the textbook and not coming to class; the TF did nothing and the review sessions never helped",
    "strengths: VERY interesting content, weakness: INCREDIBLY difficult, with harshly graded essay questions",
    "The quizzes are definitely a strength. They were challenging enough where I felt very dedicated to studying for them and doable enough to where I felt they were fair. I think that the memorization aspect of the course is a bit of a weakness but hard to avoid."

    "This course was awful. It's as if it were purposely structured for the least efficient way of learning. Lecture pdf's aren't posted until after the lecture, and the types of questions asked on the exam are either tiny details are entire narratives that are not explained well, as the lectures just feel like fact after fact without conceptual connection.  The lectures will stress the effect of pathways and detail of what genes are expressed, and then the test question will ask for the entire developmental history of an organ, asking something that technically was covered in lecture but the lecture not was framed in a way that would make that a fair question. For example, in heart development, transcription factors like gata4, ndk2.5, cmlc, and vmlc are discussed in class and the organogenesis (physical development from heart fields to cone to tube to heart) is blown through quickly in class (implying that it's not that important) but then the test will ask for the organogenesis of the heart. This makes the class incredibly frustrating to the point where it feels unfair. Review sessions aren't helpful and then the posted slides are difficult to sift through as they're only organized by date.\r\n\r\nIt's a lot like the intro bio sequence in that the concepts aren't really hard, the class is just hard in that it's so poorly taught and the difficulty lies in knowing what you need to know for the exam rather than the ideas taught in class. It's hard for reasons unrelated to the material making the class very frustrating..",
    "YES! Very interesting material, and A LOT to study for certain chapters, but the class teaches you about these biological processes in great detail. I enjoy seeing connectivity in different pathways as you get further on in the class, and I truly felt like I learned so much about developmental bio.",
    "Definitely recommend, I think having taken other MCDB classes helps a lot (especially genetics) as developmental bio integrates cell biology\/molecular biology\/genetics etc. I found this class interesting and not too difficult when you put in the time and study for quizzes and exams. Questions on quizzes and exams often straightforward with no trick questions.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student only if they are genuinely interested in development. The course definitely taught how organs and systems are formed, but it felt disorganized and disjointed between the lectures.",
    "Probably not. I would recommend a different MCDB core class instead of this one unless someone was very interesting in development specifically.",
    "It's a really awesome class if you are somewhat interested in developmental programs. If you are, then you'll pick up on the key themes and learn to appreciate the details as variation from a fundamental evolutionary template. If you are not, then the level of detail gone into signaling pathways and tissue movement mechanisms will feel burdensome, especially toward the mid\/end of the semester.",
    "Youre probably taking it bc its a req. its not easy to get an A. Most exam questions are worth 20 pts and theres no partial credit.",
    "Best MCDB core course, hands down. Lots of cool information, good professors, and very little work. Grading is very fair. Rare to find classes with little work that teach so much material, so this one is truly a gem.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It's very well-organized and conducive to learning, and all of the quizzes and exams are very fair. There is plenty of review material and help available, too. I will say that there is a lot of material to learn, and it is dense, but if you are interested in developmental biology, it is a great class.",
    "No, only take it if you really have to. The instructors clearly do not care about this class that much, although they are very nice people. I think they would be more fun as friends or lab mentors rather than professors. It was difficult to learn things from them, althought I believe that they may be much better one on one, they are both super knowledgeable and kind!",
    "Do not take thinking to fulfill the MCDB core",
    "No",
    "No, please do not take this course. It is so poorly disorganized, and I had to Credit\/D the class simply because the grading on the first exam was very harsh and it was implied there was no curve at all.  The professors refuse to give any transparency about grades and you will have absolutely no idea what grade you have at all for the entire semester. There were students that were not even sure if they were going to pass the class, even though they weren't that far below the average. The quizzes and exams themselves were also not representative of the class material. The quizzes were incredibly specific, and there was almost no way to know how to prepare for them, but they constituted a large chunk of the grade. The exams were not too bad, but the material wasn't taught clearly, so it was very easy to perform poorly. Mostly the lectures were really bad and super detailed-oriented rather than concept-based, which is fine to a certain point, but after 30 minutes naming every protein in a pathway when this is not a signaling or cell bio class and it will never be tested upon is a waste of time when the actual basics of developmental biology are not being taught. I was really fascinated with developmental biology coming into the class, but this class managed to take what is, in my opinion, one the most interesting fields of biology and turn it into one of the most boring. Kankel's lectures were also impossible to follow and understand and there was never any text on his slides, so there was no way to study at home in preparation for the quizzes\/exams.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone that has an interest in developmental biology and\/or needs a solid MCDB core class. Most of the lectures are well taught and the format (weekly quizzes, 3 non-cumulative exams, no section) is the best.",
    "I would say the harsh grading, especially the fact that you don't know where you stand in the class unless you go talk to the teachers. However, it still is a very interesting course. I was deciding between this and another class that was at the same time, and if I had gone to the other one and then decided to take Developmental Biology I would have had to drop the first quiz as the material on the VERY FIRST DAY of the class was tested on the second.",
    "It's a whatever course. It's no worse than other MCDB cores so if you're looking for another core this one is fine, but not great. It can be really frustrating. You also have to be at least slightly interested in Dev bio to make it through this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "honestly i was excited for the content but the professor were not good so maybe only take this course if you are truly interested in the content",
    "I would recommend if the student is willing to self-teach.",
    "I would! I enjoyed the course and would recommend it to any MCDB major."
