                "Learned about the fluid mechanics in trees, from leaves to stems. Flow at low Reynolds number and flow of bacteria. Transport of slime molds. Marangoni flow and the Ouzo effect. And more that I am forgetting now.",

                "I learned a great deal about a wide range of fluid mechanical phenomena at play in nature and about the latest state of knowledge in the field. I also learned about the different ways these phenomena can be studied and understood.",

We discussed various types of phenomena that occur naturally, including the transport of fluid in plants, geological pattern formation, \"motor-like\" bacteria motion, and drinking strategies in various organisms."

            "comments": [
                "The biggest strength of this course was the almost seminar style formatting. Reading the papers and discussing them in class was an approach to a STEM subject that I have not experienced so far in my time at Yale, at least not as successfully as this. It was well organized, covered a range of topics in a digestible depth while still feeling like an advanced class on fluid mechanics. This class could really only be improved by adding a second smaller project towards the beginning of the class to get people more familiar with the materials available to them in the lab.",
                "Very unique structure that needs to be seen more in this major. The class is taught by the professor who is EXTREMELY competent in all of these fields of research. The professor gives the fundamental knowledge and research that the field revolves around, and then the students are tasked with reading selected papers from the field and then one group of them gives a more in depth look into one of the papers. The papers are selected so that your small group receives a paper that you are interested in. It was a very engaging and unique way of learning that should be applied more. A weakness is that we probably could have done more work. Specifically, I think we could have looked at or done some of the larger derivations for homework, that way we had more class time for discussing more papers and their conclusions, without getting bogged down with sometimes days of derivations.\r\n\r\nYale should take note. This is what happens when you let professors teach their own subjects.",
                "The class has a wonderful structure that allows the students to dive into the topics that are really interesting to them. Students (either in groups or alone) are able to digest a paper and present it to the rest of the class, mirroring the structure of a journal club. This structure helps to develop both the skills of critical reading of (dense) scientific papers and presenting research. One weakness of the class is that it straddles the needs of undergrads and grad students who are at different places with their mathematical understanding of fluids. While this is not an unavoidable divide, ensuring that all students can grasp the physical system/problem will help give students something to chew on.",
                "Strengths : visualisation to explain physics across phenomena and paper reading and presentation \r\nweakness: limited interactions with students. Having assignments and office hours can enhance learning",
                "Strengths:\r\ni) We were familiarized with a lot of contents associated with the latest developments in the field, in a way that was more emphasized than in the rest of the courses.\r\nii) The number of topics covered was fairly broad.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\ni) It wasn't as well-organized and the contents were not as well-defined as in the other courses.\r\nii) Grading was not as transparent or as properly, quantifiably defined as in the other courses.\r\niii) Some topics would seem a bit less accessible to beginners in the field.",
                "One difficulty with a course like this is fitting as much as you can into it. There is a vast spread of topics that can be covered, but in order to properly cover them, sufficient time needs to be granted for each topic. Thus, it is tough to pick enough subjects with enough range but also not too many to the point they will be glossed over. A strength of this course is the seminar-like structure to the presentations and projects. Looking at papers helped me to understand what we had learned in lecture in a better context, and the project allowed me to test my own abilities and understanding in a beneficial way."

            "comments": [
                "Absolutely. From an engineering point of view, this class was certainly a breath of fresh air. It took an approach to learning in a STEM environment that I found to be incredibly engaging and genuinely re-igniting a desire to learn about new material. You still get the equations and the math and the scientific understanding of the material, but it is presented in a digestible and fun manner.",
                "Yes! If fluids are interesting to you or you want to learn more, this is the class will teach you more than almost any other. Even if you are only vaguely interested, I would say give it a shot. The class goes over so many topics that at least one is bound to be interesting to you.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student that was interested in either engineering/physics research or fluid dynamics (or natural phenomena). The ability to dive into a new paper was an excellent skill both for undergrad upperclassmen and for new grad students. It's a fun course where you can really let your curiosity guide your engagement with the material.",
                "Yes \r\nFor those looking to pursue fluid mechanics but are unsure about the sub fields in fluids",
                "Certainly!",
                "I definitely would recommend this course to someone interested in the intersection of fluid mechanics and biology/environmental phenomena. This course covers a ton of interesting material, and while difficult at some points, if you have an interest in the topics you will be able to manage. Also, I feel like I haven't had a STEM course like this at Yale, which was very refreshing."
