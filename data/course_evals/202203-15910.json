                "Great course; Prof Park is really great, wants everyone to do well and does everything in her power to make sure that that happens\r\nCovers a lot of ground quickly, which makes it a bit difficult",
                "Lecture slides are organized, learn a lot of content, problem sets are good, office hours very very available",
                "The course was extremely comprehensive.",
                "Strengths: accessibility of materials; number of office hours; walkthrough videos for homework; coding sessions alongside the professor in class; breadth of knowledge covered; a professor who cares\r\nWeaknesses: I think some of the more difficult topics at the beginning in Python were maybe rushed (sometimes we wouldn't finish in-class coding exercises), but we would use an entire class to go over ethics in CS; while I think ethics and other topics covered later in the class were important, those lectures maybe should have been beefed up or we should have cut them to half a class so we had more time to learn the intricacies of classes, for ex.",
                "Strengths: Conformative to whatever needs you have for your learning style, office hours every week, willingness to help\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: High tempo / Pace",
                "Strengths: office hours, there were 15 hours of office hours and all the ULAs and Professor helped a lot every week for the psets. The homeworks were just challenging enough so it was doable and made you learn. \r\nWeakness: there was a lot of material and classwork psets to cover during one class so it felt rushed at times and hard to keep up. but as long as you grasp the key concepts, you should be able to do the hw psets.",
                "Poorly designed syllabus, too ambitious, sought to cover both intro CS and data science. Instructor ended up rushing through every lecture in the second half of the course and gave no time for students to process new information/actually understand the topics. Badly taught lectures.",
                "Structured course with supportive professor and TAs\r\nWould be better if more in class exercise provided (or more detailed instructions on in class exercise)",
                "Strengths: I could go to office hours and be helped consistently. The class taught you a lot about Python in a useful way and did not assume any prior knowledge. \r\n\r\nWeakness: it was a bit fast paced for those in the humanities.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Park truly wants you to succeed and dedicates so much of her time to making helpful resources \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The data science part of the course seemed to pop out of nowhere and was a bit difficult to really grasp if you have no prior stats knowledge",
                "The pace was very fast in the second half of the course, but the professor was very kind.",
                "Strengths: very kind, empathetic, smart, and talented professor who clearly cares a lot about her students. Very well-prepared lecture/module materials that gave students very helpful references to well-written python code.\r\n\r\nTo improve: better paced lectures to optimize learning of students. Less pop-up quizzes completed during class (as opposed to before class starts). More time going through code lectures as opposed to PowerPoint slides. Better pacing to integrate data science methods relatively earlier in class to not backload as much.",
                "Strengths: Amazingly committed Professor, Sohee cares a lot and is willing to go the extra mile everytime. Weaknesses: This time around there were a lot of things still being figured out in running the class so there was sometimes confusion and I would say the final project has too many tasks and components to it. Regardless, you'll still learn a lot.",
                "Concepts should be taught more in-depth in class, things are gone over very quickly and you need to go to a lot of office hours to actually understand what's happening in the class/do well on the p-sets. The final project had way too many components and wasn't well structured so I didn't feel like I knew what I was doing and ended up credit/d-ing the class because grading wasn't posted so I didn't know how I was doing over all.",

                "Yes! Absolutely it's a great introduction to coding and data science and was really fun. I will say that a huge caveat is that it was a bit overwhelming for people who had never done stats or had any coding experience, so keep in mind that it will be more work in that case, but I still think it is a better/easier introduction than CS 50 or some of the other options out there.",
