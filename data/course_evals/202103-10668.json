                "I loved this class. So interesting, and presented so well.",
                "I learned about the carious conflicts within Africa, interstate and intrastate and the different ways outside European countries, the U.S. and Canada attempted to helped the different African countries deal with these conflicts.",
                "I learned about the theories of IR, systems of aid in Africa, and peacekeeping missions.",
                "I learned about Africa in international relations and a lot about IR theory and peacekeeping.",
                "more about international relations as a discipline than individual African countries. the application of IR theories (realism, liberalism, etc) to subjects like aid, internal conflict, etc",
                "This course is a decent introductory class for issues in Africa. The historical context provided at the beginning of this course is useful for looking at the present day issues, and how their impacts are trans-continental as opposed to isolated instances.",
                "I learned a moderate amount about African history and politics. I learned a lot about the topics I wrote my papers on, and a fair amount about peacekeeping.",
                "This class teaches students to understand African nations and historical events through a variety of different perspectives on international relations--realism, liberalism, constructivism, and a regime security approach. Students learn about decolonization and neocolonialism, aid to Africa, the Pan-African movement, the OAU and the AU, African wars and conflicts, and the history of peacebuilding in Africa.",
                "I was really pleased with this course and learned a lot about African politics, theories behind international relations, and the problems affecting intra and inter-state dynamics. I particularly loved learning about the effect of aid to African countries on development in these nations, since I think this issue is often treated as simple by Western politicians (who say that aid = growth), but this course examines the problems with aid with such a careful eye that totally reshaped my understanding of this topic. I also learned a lot about the peacemaking/peacebuilding efforts that take place in African countries, and the benefits and drawbacks to these missions, which was really interesting. Overall, despite the class' focus on Africa and African development, I left the course with a much broader and more complex understanding of international relations more generally, including the political theories underpinning international relations."

                "Strengths: testing format, I really like the quiz and essay format. Suits several styles of learning, professor Simon is incredibly kind and knowledgeable  \r\nweaknesses: Lectures sometimes hard to follow, not as clear-cut",
                "Lecture can be a little better organized.",
                "I think readings could have been selected more efficiently",
                "Professor Simon is a phenomenal teacher-very available and willing to help whenever needed.",
                "I thought the class was wonderful. I really enjoyed the readings (I thought there weren't too few and weren't too many), the guest speaker, and the structure of the course. I wish instead of some readings there could have been some other media included, such as videos or podcasts, but these were usually included in the lectures.",
                "Strengths: Professor Simon really cares about a students. Weaknesses: there was much too much reading, so very few people in the class did it. This made class much less engaging! The class period was also too long for the material. It was difficult to stay engaged for the whole 75 minutes. The syllabus originally said that there would be a TA and group discussions for the last section of class. This would dramatically improve the course.",
                "strengths: interesting subject matter, Professor Simon is such a nice guy\r\nweaknesses: lectures could be a bit dull, unorganized; little incentive to do readings",
                "Strengths: interesting topic and material with fairly straight-forward lectures that do a great job summarizing the concepts, readings, and grand themes\r\nWeaknesses: unclear grading structure for assignments and insufficient feedback on submitted work",
                "This course may be more useful as a full lecture with teaching assistants. While presented as a smaller lecture, course engagement was limited because of this. It would have also been more helpful to get another clarifying lens (from a TA) or through more robust discussions.",
                "Strengths: the topics, on paper, are extremely interesting. And it's a pretty easy class, with not too much work.\r\nWeaknesses: Poor lecturing makes learning difficult and class time often boring. The readings are often dense and not very interesting.",
                "The material in this course is very interesting and teaches students to think critically from the perspectives of different theories on international relations. My favorite part was the last on peacekeeping, and Autesserre's \"Peaceland\" is definitely a keeper.\r\n\r\nIf I could change a few things I think I might make the readings a little shorter or have Professor Simon highlight which ones are especially important to read. Some of the articles were definitely dense and difficult to understand, and when they were too long, students were discouraged from reading them. This definitely showed, as sometimes Professor Simon would ask questions, but no one would have answers. Shortening these readings or finding a way to make them more digestible might encourage more fruitful discussion!\r\n\r\nI would also have loved a discussion section or TA for this course. It could get a bit difficult to focus during the last parts of lecture, especially after sitting in a stuffy, hot WLH room for an hour. I know Professor Simon said the original plan was to have a TA lead mini-sections during the second half of the Thursday lecture, and I think that too would have ensured students understood the readings.",
                "I think one strength of this course is the size of the class; although it is a lecture course, having a small number of students enabled us to have discussions of the material and made it possible for students to pose questions or offer up their opinions, which I found really interesting. I also think that the way the class' material was organized was beneficial, since Professor Simon began by giving us a broad overview of the history of African politics/relationship to international relations (including a focus on the colonial and independence movements). Another strength of the course is how it gives students a foundation in the study of international relations, despite its specific focus on African countries. The course examines and illuminates dynamics in international relations that apply across the world, not just in Africa, and I know I will use my new knowledge of these dynamics and issues in future courses that study international politics. I also really enjoyed all the assignments/essays and found them really, really interesting prompts that inspired me to do a lot of external research while also drawing on what I had learned in class."

                "I would recommend this course to someone if they are really interested in international relations theory and peacekeeping. It was much less about Africa and much more about IR related to engagement with Africa. One should only take this course if they are VERY passionate about the material and prepared to sit through LONG lectures. If not, take something else.",
                "yes, if you want to have a pretty easy poli sci class and learn about international relations. Lectures feel very long at times",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in learning more about Africa in a general context, but not particularly for an in-depth look. While aspects of international relations were present, it looks more at case-studies that are to some degree disjointed.",
                "I would not. I didn't think it was very interesting. Overall, this course was highly disappointing.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but know it is a political science class, not a history class. The course discusses African international relations from the perspective of several different theories on international relations (realism, liberalism, constructivism, regime security). If you are not interested in IR theory and only want to learn about African history, then there are probably better options at Yale for you.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, although I think that to appreciate and enjoy this course requires having an interest in African relations and African politics. The course goes into such depth on African history and politics that students uninterested in the intricacies and dynamics of these topics likely wouldn't glean much from the course overall, so I think that I would only recommend the course to a student who has a basic background of knowledge on the topic. But it's a really interesting course and very well-taught, so I would definitely recommend it to anyone already interested/familiar with the topic."
