                "Very challenging intellectually",
                "Strengths: the course was very related to real-world applications, and problem set questions (as well as class discussions) often centered around real data and questions you might face outside of the college setting",
                "I thought the assignments and Professor MacDonald were very fun, engaging, and informative. Ed discussion posts and office hours were also extremely helpful. Not many weaknesses to be honest",
                "Strengths: The course was well organized and we got to work with interesting datasets. Brian is a kind and likable professor. Weaknesses: I am coming away from the semester with a hard time nailing down what I actually learned. Sometimes the lectures felt more like tinkering with code for an hour than learning concrete concepts.",
                "Strengths: It was a relatively chill class (except for when the psets were randomly very burdensome). Lots of practical content (knowing when to use certain models based on the characteristics of the response variable), and theory was superficial but enough so that you can succeed in an interview. \r\nWeaknesses: Not sure why there was a final exam, should have been a final project to demonstrate we had learned the skills. Class lacked direction at times and was sometimes unorganized, but it was also Brian's first time teaching the course.",
                "Have many hands-on experiences and includes the usage of some novel packages. Can incorporate a bit more theoretical knowledge.",
                "This course is just a mishmash of random stats topics that just regurgitates topics from other more foundational courses like 242 or 312. It was okay\/good R practice. The walking through examples was slow and not really giving.",
                "The professor tried to make this class not a gut, but in the process of doing that, he explained things weirdly and I feel like most people who did not have a strong stats back ground did not really understand what was going on. This class sounds like it was better taught in the past. Instead of trying to not make it a gut, I think we should keep it as it was. Or in fact, change it so that it focuses more on questions that are asked in Data Science interview questions (like keep ROC\/AUC, performance metrics, different types of regressions, and add other stuff like sampling techniques, spend more time on bootstrapping, etc).",
                "This was the prof's first time teaching the class, so there were some bumps in the road. However, I think this class is one of my favorites in the stats major. Learned more than any other class. I think it's a shame this course has 3 exams, this is the perfect course for a final project to apply the information that we learn.",
                "The course goes over some very interesting material, but the pacing felt awkward at times and the lecture recordings were very hit or miss",
                "Problem sets are great; they help you understand the material better and they complement class stuff well.\r\nSometimes the timing of things was off. We'd occasionally spend a long time on a simple topic, then cram in a more complex one in one or two lectures. I imagine that this is partly bc this is the first semester that  BMac has taught this class, so it may not be true in the future.",
                "weakness: not engaging, material ramps up too quickly",
                "I think the workload, exams, and grading were very fair, and the problem sets made sure you were keeping up with the material. I appreciated the courses focus on practical data analysis skills while still touching upon the theory behind them. I think it might be interesting to use a slightly more diverse array of datasets.",
                "Strengths: Brian is an amazing professor! He's very engaging and clearly passionate about what he does. He breaks down complicated concepts with ease and brings practical applications to what could've been an overly theoretical class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class felt like a topics course as we bounced around from topic to topic without a lot of cohesion. This wasn't necessarily the worst, but I think I would've appreciated a bit more linkage as to how everything related. Also, some of the problem sets were really hard, but manageable if you went to office hours.",
                "The class felt a little disorganized but there was always help present if we needed anything.",
                "The course had an odd balance of moving either too fast or too slow, but overall it didn't feel like we learned very much.",
                "I think the class could have moved a bit more quickly. I think it should also maybe operate from the assumption that everyone has taken S&DS 230 because the beginning of class was a bit slow.\r\n\r\nOther than that, it was a fun class where I learned a lot through the activities and the group work in class.",
                "Strengths: One of the most practical stat classes I have taken at Yale, very engaging assignments",
                "Strengths: The class material was tremendous and useful. Macdonald is a great lecturer who obviously cares about his students learning. He is very personable and was approachable, even though I hadn't taken a class with him before.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The TF staff was terrible. I don't think I've ever left a negative comment about grading on a CourseTable review before because we are in college (and at this point, who really cares), but I cannot imagine what was going through their minds. Hopefully, when future Yalies are taking this class, the TF staff will be different.",
                "Strengths: This course covered a lot of topics and gave me the opportunity to practice many of them.\r\nWeaknesses: I felt as though more time could have been devoted to certain topics.",
                "Overall really good introduction to statistical modeling using R. Only improvement I would suggest is to have more thorough course notes.",
                "Strengths: topics\/skills learned are very useful and applicable to jobs in statistics. Homework assignments help build these skills as opposed to being busywork.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: most of the important information from lectures is concentrated in 5-10 minutes of the 75 min class (and often kinda rushed through), making it hard to focus.",
                "course recordings needed. more useful interesting material needed.",
                "I liked Brians lecturing style and how we followed along on an Rmd document during class. I also think having a pedagogical partner was really helpful  he suggested having practice exams which I really appreciated.",
                "This course was great in terms of giving us a glimpse of what real world data analysis is like. This course felt a bit scattered at times since Professor MacDonald made us do ggplot animations, R shiny apps, and some maximum likelihood estimators for the normal distribution. There were also instances where we would get points taken off on our homework because they didn't think the formatting of our plots was \"clean\" enough which felt a bit subjective at times.",
                "Course material is well thought out to provide students with a solid background in data exploration and analysis",
                "Overall while I do think the materials in this course were worthwhile, there seemed to be a wide range of students in this class with different backgrounds, and it seemed like there was some challenge in keeping a pace that was appropriate for every student.\r\nI found it somewhat difficult to stay engaged in lecture sometimes because many of the topics were ones I was already familiar with and I didn't feel like I was learning anything new. Sometimes homeworks seemed tedious and uninteresting.\r\nIt seemed like also there was a small disconnect between what was covered in class lectures and what was asked on exams - perhaps more focus could be done in class about deciding which model would be appropriate given a dataset. \r\nAlso - while interesting and really cool, I think some of the topics involving animations and Shiny could maybe be moved to the end of the course since they didn't seem that relevant to the course as a whole and time could have been better dedicated to other things.",
                "The large nature of the class meant there was a wide difference in peoples abilities. Perhaps separate undergrad and grad sections might make things run better.",
                "Strengths: manageable workload, important material. Weaknesses: you kind of have to teach yourself a lot of the material.",
                "strengths - engagement, learning, interesting psets",
                "I think Brian is very experienced and knowledgeable in his field. I do wish we had more time with him explaining what model he would consider instead of just coding a single model. I think choosing the model is the fun part and the boring bits can be left to HW. I also think Brian can let the class take over sometimes and we get less done. But he is new and already really good.",
                "For the first half of the class, we reviewed linear regression, how to use basic R packages and made a Shiny app. After this, the class seemed to complete change pace and difficulty. We rushed through all of the new content, making it feel like Professor MacDonald had a clear vision of how the course was meant to progress. In order to understand any of the problem sets past the one about ggplot or Shiny, you had to go to office hours, but the only useful hours were with one of the TFs. Further, it feels odd that the class is final exam based and not project-based. A class like this would be perfect if the skills we gained were used to level up to a project, but instead we got an extremely simple and misleading first midterm, then a poorly-made and extremely confusing second midterm which we were ill-equipped for, based on the lecture (and the fact that Professor MacDonald declined to provide a practice exam for the second midterm, because he believed that the first had been \"too easy\").",
                "good coverage of topics but more applied than theoretical",
                "I really enjoyed using datasets multiple times to become more familiar with them, and as a sports fan I enjoyed how Prof. MacDonalds sports analytics data science background shaped many of the examples in class",
                "Strengths: Brian is great\r\nWeaknesses: parts of the homework can sometimes be tedious\/frustrating",
                "Rework Github into the course, maybe do an introductory GitHub workshop or lecture",
                "lectures could be more interesting",
                "Strengths: The material was relatively easy to understand and learn. The psets and exams weren't very difficult either.\r\nWeaknesses: I do feel like my understanding of some of the topics taught in class was very surface-level i.e. we didn't go very in-depth with theory with much of the material. This is probably the way the class was designed, but I think some more context to some of the R that we did would've been nice."

                "Yes, good S&DS elective for sure.",
                "Yes, this feels like a natural extension of S&DS 230, although I wish it could've been more organized (as at times it felt like it lacked direction, but it was also the first time the professor taught it), so we could have covered more content. Obviously, come in with strong R experience, since it is a high-level R course. I really enjoyed Brian's industry perspective, and the many practical skills he taught (prep for interviews, important libraries in R, insight into the sports analytics industry). I feel confident applying many of the models he taught. However, I feel like a final project would have been better than a final exam, since the class was more focused on R than theory, per se. I think the scatter plots on the exams were a great assessment\/opportunity to learn when to use each model. The exams often had questions straight from the HW, to make sure we actually learned the content and didn't just copy from other ppl\/TAs\/etc. You should take alongside\/after S&DS 242 though, as you won't appreciate the theory as in-depth otherwise. For exams, be sure to attend TA Shinpei or Brian's office hours. I feel like in class, we sometimes breezed through some content which made exam topics seem scary, but Brian and Shinpei did an excellent job of (re)-teaching the content in an understandable manner. Brian is also very accommodating to class\/students' requests.",

                "I think if it's taught the way it was in prior years, then yes I would recommend this class. Students who have taken this class in prior years have told me that this class was the most useful class they have taken, as it was well-taught and went over a lot of common data science topics. This year, this class had some of the most annoying psets I have ever had to do.",
                "Yes! U learn a lot. PSETs are challenging at times, but I learned some much more R and I thought I was already pretty good at it.",
                "Yes, if you want to work in industry this is the course for you; Brian is a great teacher and the course is very applied.",

                "Definitely! I would probably take a couple of other statistics classes before or alongside it (230, 241, 242, etc.), but you'd probably do fine without it. I'd also make sure you pay attention in lecture and really understand all the coding that you're doing on problem sets, and you should be Ok!",
                "Yes, once the class gets more standardized, I see this being one of the better Stats courses in the certificate and major.",
                "Eh. Not too hard but didn't learn that much.",
                "I would recommend it for a good practical class to follow up from S&DS 230. I think that everyone serious about data science should either take this one or S&DS 363. I think both are good classes. This one focuses more on effective data visualizations and generalized linear models, and I think is probably a little bit less work.",
                "Yes. If you like the coding aspect of stats like myself, then I definitely recommend that you take it. It helps you learn and realize how much more you can do with R. I have always used R for psets and completing pre-written markdowns. But working with different cases as well as shiny apps in this course showed me that I can do so much more with the stats knowledge that I have. I am looking forward to expanding on this and working on personal projects based on the shiny platform.",
                "For sure, definitely take this not only if you're a stat major but also if you're doing the cert. If MacDonald is teaching it again, even better. He's a great prof.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because of the more practical aspects of the course.",
                "Yes",
                "no, didn't learn much\r\ncould learn everything more easily independently",
                "Yes, I was looking for a class to take after 230 to keep practicing with R and I liked it a lot.",
                "Absolutely! One of the easier courses in the major, and Brian is absolutely one of the kindest and easygoing people in the faculty.",
                "I would if they were an S&DS major or if they were interested in doing data analytics. This course should only really be for students who have already had exposure to R and know how to program in it.",
                "Yes, amazing for analyzing data",
                "Yes. Data exploration is something I have used in my career very frequently.",
                "Yes, I do think this course is worthwhile for a student in a similar position to me. I think the methods of data analysis learned in this course are very useful especially for a student interested in working with real world data. I know I will be using the topics learned in this course as part of future studies and analysis.",
                "Sure, the material is interesting, but I only learned it all when I studied for the final, because Macdonald didn't teach us too much. Also, the first midterm had like a 98 average and then a bunch of people bombed the second one because he put some random stuff that he mentioned briefly in class on the test. So if you do take it, pay attention to everything he says in class.",
                "Yes for hands on experience in R",
                "I would, although with the preference there is little theory and a lot of coding",
                "Without restructuring, I would not recommend this class to another student. The DUS strongly recommended this class, but I assume this is because the of the course and the syllabus look promising (as I thought, too). However, students looking for thorough explanations of the concepts and methods they'll be exposed to in the class should look elsewhere. Of the Spring 300-level S&DS courses, I might recommend Multivariate Stats, isntead. The lack of project\/application-based classes in this department is unfortunately scarce.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, especially those looking to go into data science and statistical analysis areas. This class helps develop lots of essential skills.",
                "I would recommend it concurrently with S&DS 242 (theory of statistics), but maybe not if you've already taken another class that covers similar topics (such as S&DS 265\/365 machine learning).",
                "Yes. Taking this course from someone who worked in the industry was awesome. The applications felt relevant and real, and In feel better prepared to utilize my data analysis and visualization skills out in the real world",
                "professor is nice",
                "If you are looking for a relatively easy and chill S&DS elective, definitely take 361. The psets aren't very difficult and don't take very long, the material is relatively easy to learn and understand. If you are looking for a more theory-heavy class, then you are not going to be learning much of it in 361: the class material is very much tied into learning data visualization and regression analysis in R."
