This was my first art history course ever and I am so thrilled by everything I learned!",
                "Great survey of not just 19th century French art, but also the political and economic events that underlied it. We explored all different styles of art throughout that time period. Importantly, as someone who hasn't taken art history before, it made me appreciate what goes into artwork, and different styles much more. It also made me much more confident in critical analysis of art.",

                "I learned more about French art and the trajectory of 18th and 19th Century European art more broadly. I understood the key facets of Western art (style, form, genre, etc, etc) and how they changed over this roughly 200 year period",
                "I honed my analytical, writing, and memorization skills in this class. I learned how art and themes can develop over a century and now understand how very famous French paintings came to be.",
                "I gained a deeper knowledge of French art, from around the Rococo period to Post-Impressionism. We covered key artists and works as well as themes like modernity, city vs. country, Orientalism, and gender politics.",
                "As my first art history course at Yale, I gained so much insight not only into 19th-century French art specifically, but also art history as an entire discipline through this course. Through the two papers and two exams, I learned how to concisely yet effectively write about and analyze art and its historical context. As a history major, I am particularly excited to utilize this new knowledge and skill set to bring more cultural content into my historical research in the future. I am also excited by the prospect of taking future art history courses at Yale, for this class was a great introduction to the department."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Armstrong is incredibly knowledgable and I really enjoyed the selection of artwork she chose for the course. I am a STEM major who has never taken an art history class and the course was still very accessible. I enjoyed learning about both the paintings themselves and the relevant history and external context.\r\nWeaknesses: some of the readings were far too long / convoluted, it would be nice to only need to know decades for the less important paintings because it does amount to a lot of studying to have to memorize the artist, title of the work, and date for ~250-300 important paintings in the class. Also, I wish the prompt for the first paper was more related to the actual content we were learning because we were asked to write about Manet but didn't study him until a month or two later. And one more thing - I think my understanding of the readings would have been greatly enhanced if the entire reading schedule was pushed back a week so I could see the paintings in class and learn a little bit about the painter/movement and THEN take a deeper dive into the readings...I think that would have really helped with my understanding and appreciation of the readings.",
                "The lectures and sections were really great and informative in helping me understand the material. The readings were good, though a bit overwhelming in terms of the density of what was assigned - in that sense, I don't think that facilitated me fully appreciating the art historical readings.",
                "Strengths: the sheer VOLUME of content. Covering more than a century of a particular topic is always hefty, and there were a lot of artworks introduced (~400). Lectures had so much information in eachas an extremely extra notetaker, my notes at the end of the class ended up being 119 pages (as bullet points) on a Google Doc. The Professor and the TAs were so, so knowledgeable.\r\n\r\nThe class also always felt very structured, with a guiding theme for each lecture and section. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I really wish that the professor was able to asterisk the most important works. Even though she says that the exam IDs would concentrate on the major works and that is pretty much true, it is often hard to sus out what \"major\" exactly means. The ~200 in the first half and ~250 works in the second half to memorize for IDs were tough and sometimes felt very pointless.",
                "Strengths: lectures were engaging and interesting, my TA (Isabella) was truly amazing. Weaknesses: we often didnt get through the entire lecture and would have to spill over to the next one, and the lectures and sections were usually a bit out of sync.",
                "The latter part of the course felt rushed compared to the beginning, it would have been great to spend more time on the impressionists and the post impressionists and discuss underlying causes for the change",
                "Strengths: Carol Armstrong knows what she's talking about!! I felt like I gained a LOT of tangible knowledge from this course. Because it's such a niche subsection of art, you kind of have to do the readings (which is definitely part of the reason I felt so engaged in this course). Also, the second half of 19th century French art is objectively cool (I'm talking impressionism/neo-impressionism onward). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: My biggest complaint with this course is that sections did not align with lectures. This course could have been even more enriching and fulfilling if section was used as a time to really explore the time period/artists discussed in lecture that week, rather the sections felt disjointed in terms of the course content.",
                "Lectures were a good combination of historical context and discussion of artworks. Sections helped to reinforce course material and solidify our understanding of course readings. Only weakness is that the course felt too fast-paced at times.",
                "Strengths Professor is good lecturer and especially good at visual analysis. Fantastic TFs; fair assignments/exams, although there were too many IDs. Weaknesses  real disconnect between lecture and section, which were often out of sync material-wise. Sections covered much more difficult primary source / secondary readings material not covered in lecture that was interesting but not relevant to assignments.",
                "The lectures are not always organized well, so timelines can sometimes be confusing. Other than that, Professor Armstrong is a fantastic lecturer and describes artistic themes and paintings in a way that opens my eyes to new ways of describing art. Lectures always feel rushed because there is always more information to learn. Section gives us a good opportunity to practice analysis and look at different perspectives of art criticism throughout the 19th century.",
                "Strengths: great lecture courseorganized, clear, and interesting content. If you're interested in French art at all it is a great overview, and it will also deepen your understanding of more general movements like Romanticism and Impressionism. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: hard to study for as the midterm and exam have no list of key images",
                "The strengths of this course were its content and its enthusiastic teaching team. I greatly enjoyed coming to the lectures and discussion sections each week, as I found the content and the conversations we had around it extremely engaging. It was especially cool to trace the larger themes and developments of the art we studied while preparing for the final. However, the weakness of this course was that I sometimes felt that we had too much content. Sometimes, we could only spend a minute or less on a painting during lecture. Our weekly readings were also incredibly long, meaning that we could not discuss everything to its fullest extent during discussion section. Although this high level of content gave me a fantastic idea of the overarching themes and movements of the course, I occasionally wished that we spent more time in the details in order to gain a deeper understanding of the pieces and artists that we studied. However, this weakness is common to Yale courses in our short semester schedule, and I also appreciate how Professor Armstrong tried to expose us to as much art from the period as possible."

                "Absolutely! I'm a STEM major who has never taken the art history course but I've always had a fondness for impressionism and I've been waiting three years to take this class - well worth the wait! I thought I would only start to enjoy the course when we got to the impressionism unit towards the end but I actually loved learning about the earlier neoclassical and romantic painters. It might be helpful if you have some background in French history but I didn't and was absolutely fine. I watched a couple of Crash Course videos on the French Revolution and that gave me a solid base haha. The readings can be a bit dense some weeks but they're on par with other humanities courses. My only other critique is that the first paper topic was based on Manet and we didn't even start to learn about him until a month after the paper was submitted so I felt like I didn't really get a lot out of that assignment. I would have preferred to write about David or Ingres or a movement that was more relevant to what we were learning in class at the time.",
                "Yes! Highly recommend. I thought this was a great survey of 19th century French Art. As someone who's never taken art history before, I learned so much about not just art but also the political and cultural forces at the time. I now feel more confident in my ability to critically analyze and appreciate art. The really cool thing for me was when I went to the NAtional Art Gallery over spring break and recognized a ton of the paintings we had discussed - the class really enriched my museum going experience. It is definitely manageable, even if you are not an art history major.",
                "Yes, absolutely! I usually have found it very hard to listen to lectures, but there was something about these (probably the torrent of info in each haha) that made me very engaged. It's nice to see gorgeous works of art and listen to their background (and some funny anecdotes about the artists' lives). Sections were also very very well led. Isabella is super great, and wrote very detailed feedback for essays.\r\n\r\nJust know what you're getting yourself intothere is so much content. I'm an art history newbie, but the other class I took (200-level) only had like ~120 works that were asterisked for IDs throughout the entire course as compared to this one with ~450 (bc there were no explicit \"asterisks\"). Another course review from a previous year had mentioned that the mnemonic major system (associating numbers with letters, so like \"sierra\" meant 04 because \"s\" is 0 and \"r\" is 4) was helpful, and that was such great advice for me. Made memorization soooo much easier.",
                "Yes, I learned a lot about French art across the 19th century (though more of the course was in the 18th century than advertised). Beware there is a ton of memorization for the midterm and final. And two papers.",
                "Yes the course did what it promised",
                "YES! Absolutely. As a non art history major this was one of the most engaging courses I've taken during my time at Yale and I really feel like I walked away with a lot of tangible knowledge, which is extremely gratifying. While it felt like I was crash coursing the foundational knowledge to art analysis, I feel like I was still able to catch up/do well in the course with no prior knowledge.\r\n\r\nAlso, do not be afraid of the memorization associated with the course. Making a Quizlet about a week or two in advance is pretty much all you need to do to get most of the paintings down and the paintings in the second half of the course are easier to discern intuitively. Having to memorize/understand different artist's styles was another really gratifying element of the course because now I feel like I have a more comprehensive knowledge of french art (and could probably identify most paintings from that time period, or at least the artist who created them).",
                "Yes! Fantastic art history course that felt both broad, and focused/detailed. I came out of the course with a much deeper understanding of 19th century French history and art. I enjoyed the fact that the course covered artworks in the typical western art history canon and works outside of it.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes if you want to become more fluent in 18th & 19th century European art / increase your enjoyment of a museum visit. But probably not going to change your life!",
                "I would highly recommend this course. It has been one of my favorite art history course I've taken at Yale. If you pay attention in class and engage in section you gain so much. The only thing is the memorization around midterm/final can be a lot, up to 500 paintings. It's fulfilling to be able to pull themes over the century across different artistic movements.",
                "Yes--good lecture course and interesting content. But be prepared to study hard for the exams.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Armstrong's course is a great introduction to Yale's art history department, and it covers an absolutely fascinating region and time period. Her teaching in lectures, in addition to the two amazing teach fellows, made every class session incredibly engaging and enjoyable. Moreover, I loved how much this class utilized the YUAG. It was fantastic to spend two class sessions at the museum, and the paper assignments pushed me to visit the gallery outside of class time by focusing on works within Yale's collection. I look forward to continuing that practice during the rest of my time at Yale. As a history major, this class exposed me to an entirely new way of looking at the past. I am interested in employing the knowledge and skills I learned in this course in future history seminars, and I am definitely planning to take another art history course before I graduate. This class was just a breath of fresh air."
