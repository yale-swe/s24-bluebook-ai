It was intense and (at times) stressful, but it also reminded me what a joy it is to have ample time and space to sit with a primary text of interest and explore its meanings/forms!! I learned a lot about writing critically, doing literary research, close reading, synthesizing ideas, contextualizing a text in the broader critical conversation about it, etc... of course. But I also learned a lot about budgeting time for such a big project, managing stress about a senior essay, and the revision process.",

                "Ultimately your experience working on a thesis depends so much on who your advisor is. I feel lucky to have had a brilliant and supportive advisor. The weekly meetings were definitely helpful in making the experience less isolated and more communal. A lot of students didn't show up for these meetings, though, and I would have liked to have spent more time hearing about other people's projects and research methods.",
                "I loved working closely with my advisor, Professor Mukhopadhyay. She is really so brilliant, amazing, and reassuring! This senior essay would not have been possible without her extensive support. Lukas, who helped lead the senior essay cohort meetings, was also very responsive and supportive. He read through last minute drafts, provided detailed edits, and was generally very calming!",
                "There could have been some more centralized guidance from the english dept itself outside of meetings with Lukas. Some kind of rubric/formatting expectations would have been nice. Also younger students in the English department should be given more guidance on the process of choosing an advisor/starting the project because I had to learn how to start thinking about my senior thesis mostly by word of mouth and guidance from older friends. Otherwise, working with Professor Mukhopadhyay was absolutely wonderful. She is a brilliant and receptive advisor and her expertise in the subject area was evident. She has been an invaluable mentor and resource, working with her has been one of the highlights of my time at Yale."

                "YES! Writing a senior essay isn't for everyone, and it also is not a requirement of the major, but this was a wonderful way to give closure to my much-loved time with the English department at Yale. I really loved the joy and luxury of spending extensive time with my work of interest, and I LOVED working closely with my advisor. I also received SO MUCH feedback on every draft that I submitted; I really feel that I grew in this last semester with regards to the kind of writer, editor, and organizational thinker that I am.",
