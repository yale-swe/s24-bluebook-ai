Its a shame because the subject-matter itself is so interesting, but not a lot is taught directly from the professor to the student. Student presentations at the beginning and end of the semester took up so much time, that the actual class itself in between then felt lack-luster. I suggest for the professor to restructure the class to be more lecture based rather than discussion.",
                "Strengths: she provided theoretical background needed to understand whats at stake surrounding the topic, the students in the class were also really engaged, genuine and insightful. The final project also felt really rewarding and she gave us full latitude to do explore whatever we wanted to.\r\nWeaknesses: the readings were sometimes long and convoluted, some of the activities didnt always resonate and when that happened they felt a bit burdensome but it was all manageable and the rubric and feedback didnt always make sense."

I personally came into the class wanting to be able to gain a better picture of the problem but I'm leaving the class basically the same way I entered...6/12 of the weeks were presentations, 1 week was a tour of a temporary exhibit, 1 we rewatched a movie that was assigned in our readings, another 1 was a mock trial to return objects that everyone knows we have to return anyway. We didn't engage with the readings and we didn't going into the African art gallery. Whatever discussion we did have felt like a classic, fake humanities/SJW class with everyone saying the words \"colonialism\" without any real discussion. I wanted to be able to expand my knowledge so that I can defend my opinions and take my discussion to the next level. That's not really what happened.",
