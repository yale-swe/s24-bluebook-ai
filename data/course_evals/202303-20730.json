                "Strengths: Annette cares so much and is super dedicated, you get to do a show for credit, 4 hours a week of guaranteed rehearsal time, doing a show with the best of the best at Yale, did i mention it's a show for credit?\r\nWeaknesses: Would have loved to talk more about the show itself and delve into the text\/material, but given the difficulty of the show, there was no way any rehearsal time could have been given up",
                "The biggest strength of this course is the hands-on experience that it provided. There wasn't much direct instruction as I've experienced in other courses, but I feel like I learned so much just by being in the course and doing a show."

                "Taking a production class like this is a wonderful way to get as much as possible out of a show. You of course get to produce the show, but the class offers an additional layer of learning and background on the show to understand where it comes from. The resources and time dedicated to the production are also greater than typical student productions so that made the experience all the more worthwhile and engaging. The class related assignments, journal entries and writing, were geared so that they actually help you become closer with the production and not just \"throw-away\" assignments.",
                "If you get the chance to do a production seminar, it doesn't come around often, do it!!!",
                "This course is probably never going to be taught again, but of course I would recommend it.",
                "Absolutely. In Great Comet I had the opportunity to combine the pieces of acting theory that I have learned with real performance. I hope that there will be more production seminars in the future for Yale undergraduates because I have found it to be a particularly fruitful combination of learning and doing.",
                "Absolutely. If you ever get the chance to be a part of a production seminar, take it.",
                "Yes! Do not let the (likely) 5.0 workload rating convince you not to do a production seminar. Being able to do a show (which, if you're looking at this, you were probably going to do anyway) and get credit for it is amazing -- I have done more shows at Yale than I care to count, and I spend *that* much time on a production even when it's extracurricular (while balancing a full corse load and student jobs), so to be able to take some academic weight off of my shoulders was great. (Though let's not pretend it's not challenging, Annette will push you regardless of your role, whether it's acting, designing, stage managing, producing, etc., and it was definitely the most time and effort I've spent on a show here.) It was also nice to see that the course is open to everyone working on the show, not just the cast, allowing the production team to feel included from day one.",
                "Yes!!!! This was one of the best experiences I've had at Yale so far, and I've learned and grown so much because of it.",
                "I cannot recommend this course enough. The performance seminar was a truly special experience. The course was challenging in the best way--I learned so much as a performer, student, and consumer of musical theater. I came to every class and rehearsal excited to work and left with that excitement rewarded. Everyone in the class was passionate and hard-working. Annette is an amazing teacher and director, and I feel lucky to have worked with and learned from her."
