I also learned to view education as a product of one's sociopolitical context, which is something I hadn't really explored before.",

This course also often introduced political philosophy concepts, which allowed for a interdisciplinary survey of philosophy. I gained a wide array of theories of education that were informed by diverse positionalities, including European philosophers, Black Feminist Theorists, Critical Race Theorists, and more!",

I particularly enjoyed the wide array of scholarship that we studied, including European philosophers, Black Feminist Theorists/Critical Race Theorists, etc.. I also appreciated the wide latitude that we were given in the essays, as offering multiple prompts ensured that I could write on a topic that resonated with me. Professor Stanley really created an inclusive educational atmosphere, he was very accessible and communicative, and charismatic.",

If you are more interested in a general / international perspective on EDST, I recommend a different course. However, if your interest is in the politics of US Education then this is a good class.",

There is so much flexibility with our assignments that you can make it interesting for yourself. I also think that in terms of the philosophy we read and engage with is so much more interesting and useful than other philosophy offerings.",

                "If students thrive in an unstructured learning environment, I would recommend this course to them. The course moves quickly and Professor Stanley is fun to watch, but his disorganization, sarcasm, and interrupting made it difficult for me to enjoy the course. However, for someone who likes spontaneous, comical professors, I would recommend this course."
