Beyond that, an insight this course offered me is a better understanding of what logic can and cannot do. That is, what we should and shouldn't expect of formal systems. This course is good practice in proof-writing (though no proofs on psets are particularly difficult.) The professor at times will gesture towards larger philosophical ideas at play in the material, but usually sticks to the logic.",

                "I appreciated that this course was a problem set class, as I believe the material took time to process and could not be evaluated with exams. Professor Shin is also an excellent professor who takes time to explain the bigger picture of what we are learning in class, and ensures that all students understand the course material. I believe the class should be more explicit about the background knowledge that is necessary. As a humanities student who has no mathematical background, it was difficult to adjust to the class and the language it used.",
                "Great lecturing and professor. Think it would be good to have a TF.",
                "The lecture notes are extremely helpful.\r\nLecture at times may seem slow and/or tedious, but this is just the nature of the material  I do not think it could/should be taught otherwise.",

                "I think the material is difficult and having more online resources or posted notes would be useful.",
                "No weaknesses. I really enjoyed how the course was structured. I thought the homework assignments were fair yet challenging and, at the same time, fun to work on. I love how Professor Shin provides handouts for the material covered in class. It really allows the students to focus on understanding the material during lectures rather than scrambling to copy everything down. Professor Shin provides a clear explanation of the material and insights that you can't get from just reading a textbook on the material.",
                "I love Prof. Shin's lecturing style and how the course was taught. I though the pace was just right for lecture, and Prof. Shin made the material a lot more interesting! I also appreciated that the psets were 100% of the grade, since it helped me focus on learning the material then, rather than somehow cramming the material before the final. I think this was the most solid class I had this semester!\r\n\r\nThe only weakness for this class were the graders. They were sometimes overly strict, and I personally felt that it didn't facilitate any learning. It just made me spend an extra few hours to make sure I put every single detail in my solutions, even though it may be extraneous."

                "Yes, but only with Prof. Shin. Shes so good at helping you succeed and shes dedicated to the subject. I will say that there is very little room for error, since all assessments are problem sets and most people do very well.",
                "Yes, definitely!",
                "If you're interested in what logic is (beyond just how to do it) i.e. you've heard about Godel and want to understand what he was on about  this is definitely the course to take. I would also recommend this course to somebody who would like to learn about pure maths without \"jumping into the deep end.\" This course will thoroughly teach you a fairly important part of mathematics. Otherwise, if you don't already have an interest in logic or math, I would neither recommend nor dissuade you from taking this class.",
                "Absolutely. I thought this was an excellent course.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys proofs or is interested in logic.",
                "Yes! If you at all interested in logic/mathematics, you will gain a deeper appreciation by taking this course. If you are already well-versed in math proofs, then you'll have an easier time on the psets but some of the questions can still be quite challenging, yet fun to work through. You will also already be familiar with some of the material in the first couple lectures but it's still worth paying attention to because Professor Shin goes into more detail than other proof-based math-related courses do. For example, she provides a clear logical explanation of mathematical induction, and strong induction, that makes you appreciate it and understand it much more, not to mention a clear explanation on how induction works in general and not just on the natural numbers! Computer science students would gain a lot by taking this course because of the importance of logic throughout the field. The various theorems we prove about sentential and first-order logic are very interesting and, in some cases, quite surprising!",
                "Yes! Please take this class if you have a little bit of a background in proof-based math. This will really solidify your knowledge on why certain logical systems work and help you formulate the basis for logic. Prof. Shin is an excellent lecturer, and she is a really cool and funny person to be around, so office hours is fun too!"
