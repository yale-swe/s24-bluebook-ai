The selected readings are fantastic and the way to actually get something meaningful from the course is to do them and study them closely. I think I learned most of all that anything can qualify as the Journalism of Ideas, or more broadly as something an audience wants to read, if you have the right frame of mind when writing it. And I found that thought immensely comforting."

Weaknesses: class time is devoted to summarizing and discussing the ideas in the articles as opposed to talking about the writing techniques used to present the information which made it more difficult when it came time to write our own journalism pieces because we were simply expected to learn how to write journalism via osmosis.",
                "It was not a super organized class. The readings were all interesting but there was no structure to them; every class felt kind of like a one off seminar.",
                "Loved the professor",
                "The stength again, is the selected readings, which are diverse, almost always politically forward, and thoroughly engaging. On top of that, the way Professor Suroweicki manages the open forum style of class leaves room for ideas to be fully fleshed out in discussion, not just for everyone to give a hollow preprepared comment on each of the themes of the piece.\r\n\r\nI think the weakness is that the guidance on the papers was not very present, and sometimes the discussion could turn into meandering confusion. However, these far from outweigh the pros, and are likely an unavoidable side-effect of a course approached with Suroweicki's mindset, which is a valuable one."

The course showed me that as long as I continue to stay in tune with the world around me, I can make writing a career and use that as a skill that uplifts that world. Also, it was just a lot fun!"
