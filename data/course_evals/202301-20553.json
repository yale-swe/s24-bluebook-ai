The course placed an emphasis on practicing speaking Japanese through various presentations and speaking sessions during class. We were also taught about Japanese culture, all of which were strengths. One of the weaknesses of this course was the expectation that every student would be on the same level of language learning in terms of speaking the language and reading. This was not conducive to a learning environment.",

The only caution I have is to keep in mind this class will take around 3 hours everyday for completion of assignments and review.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to any student looking to advance their Japanese level after L3. The class meets daily so it is a commitment but it is worth it if you are dedicated to learning Japanese.",
