                "Enjoyed the class discussion style. Could be improved by not discussing HW assignments in class and touching on other topics instead. Liked the skits and presentations format but maybe there were too many",
                "This course focused on putting Japanese into practice in speaking, writing, and reading. The course placed an emphasis on practicing speaking Japanese through various presentations and speaking sessions during class. We were also taught about Japanese culture, all of which were strengths. One of the weaknesses of this course was the expectation that every student would be on the same level of language learning in terms of speaking the language and reading. This was not conducive to a learning environment.",
                "The course requires a variety of daily coursework (voice memos, grammar worksheets, etc.) so it helps you reinforce your previous knowledge of Japanese in your every day and challenges you to use newly learned knowledge.",

                "Yep! If youve taken L3 this course is a very natural step up!",

                "Yes! I could feel that all aspects of my Japanese improved tremendously in this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student due to the great organization of the class and the amount of Japanese that one gets to practice on the daily. The only caution I have is to keep in mind this class will take around 3 hours everyday for completion of assignments and review.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to any student looking to advance their Japanese level after L3. The class meets daily so it is a commitment but it is worth it if you are dedicated to learning Japanese.",
                "For those interested in learning Japanese, this is a great way to improve"
