            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Interesting topics\r\nWeaknesses: Grading was too harsh given the open-endedness of the pset specifications. We would learn a lot about different sound synthesis techniques but I wished we learned more about how those techniques could be used. A lot of the stuff seemed so arbitrary",
                "Very nice mix of practical and theoretical; arts based with technical backbone. As with all technical arts courses, there's usually a broad range of tool familiarity and tool pickup speeds.",
                "Strength: the class resources- links, .scd files, supplementary readings- are great. If I ever want to dive deeper in just about any Computer Music topic, these all provide a jumping off point, which is great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nI stopped doing the required course reading a few weeks in. I'm pretty sure it was about around assignment 2 where, between the normal weekly reading and the SC book chapter, the \"required\" reading was 70 pages in a week, on top of the actual assignment. Even if it ends up being worth it long term, that is a lot in the short term.\r\n\r\nWould you mind *not* framing the blogposts as something that happens with every assignment? For the first half of the semester, that is true only 50% of the time. The end result was that I lost faith in your ability to accurately describe the requirements for assignments.\r\n\r\nYou typically encourage us to take the time to read the SC docs, look up functions to do exactly what we want, etc. The general idea is that it will be a worthwhile long term investment. However, many (probably most) students will not extensively use SC after this course. This has a severe effect on what exactly constitutes a worthwhile investment. If I followed your advice, I would have taken the time to better understand how Routines work. However, I never used Routines in this class, so there is a pretty good chance that *following your advice* would have been a waste of my time. Also, keep in mind that students can be very busy, and might not have the time to invest in things useful outside of assignments unless they want to work on homework until midnight.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you want some thoughts on SuperCollider:\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate if SuperCollider had better error messages. Line numbers for syntax errors would be great. Is there a way to get line numbers for errors? Because otherwise, the callstack is such an information overload that it is essentially useless.\r\n\r\nSuperCollider's documentation is very complete. However, when I tried to look up flatten, I had to sift through over 600 hundred potential methods in all the vaguely collection-like superclasses of Array. It took around 20 minutes for a rather trivial task. The end result is that discovering information is not *impossible*, but very, very slow. I ended up spending 20 minutes on similar trivial tasks (looking up functions, debugging out edge cases) several times on assignments. Is that a worthwhile investment? Maybe. But it also means that coding proceeds rather slowly, more slowly than you might realize if you've been an expert in SuperCollider for years.",
                "The course moved extremely quickly, and the learning curve for SuperCollider is incredibly steep. Partner work made assignments more approachable.",
                "The course touches on a large number of concepts. The lectures are too fast to understand what's going on in the experiments, so one has to spend a large amount of time to reproduce the observed effects.",
                "Strengths: good survey course in various synthesis techniques\r\nWeaknesses: few and delayed feedback",
                "The open exploration enabled in the course meant that we could explore exciting creative horizons. I do wish however the homeworks were a little more clear on the expected outcome.",
                "The strength of this course is the subjects being really interesting and the overall pace is great.",
                "very interesting but very new language, should have moe tutorial",
                "I think the class was sometimes tough to follow having not enrolled in the prerequisite course. If I had a recap session or additional course material devoted to some of the learnings from the prerequisite course, I would have been able to follow along with the lectures and assignments more closely."

Scott is a pretty good lecturer with a fun personality and he is definitely really knowledgeable and willing to help students learn. But, the worst part of this course is definitely SuperCollider, the language you use to do everything. It's the most bizarre language I've ever used with some of the strangest quirks. Debugging is extremely difficult because this language has the absolute worst error messages I've ever seen. The official documentation is really helpful for some things and basically useless for others. And, since it's such a small community, good luck finding any help online. I was always frustrated working on the PSETs just because of SuperCollider and that brought this course down for me. But, other than the language, the course itself was actually pretty good.",
