                "I learned about a lot of great fiction authors, some key notes about the craft of fiction, and great advice on writing. I learned a lot about myself as a writer, and hopefully my writing got better.",
                "Being able to read a wide variety of stories has helped me gain more of a sense of the different ways stories can be successful. It has also helped me learn more about what I would like my own voice to be.",
                "I learned the elements of a good short story and the beginning of how to write one.",

            "comments": [
                "While this class is not exclusively a creative writing class, I think it could benefit from getting more feedback on the written exercises and having the opportunity to submit second drafts that build on that feedback.",
                "Strengths: Michael. He's an excellent professor entirely devoted to his students. On the course itself, I'd say the greatest strength was the opportunity at the end of the semester to have a workshop on your own work. The first 2/3rds of the semester are reading published stories, and then we turned into a workshop to critique each other's. It was a fantastic experience, and Michael gave huge amounts of comments to everyone. It's wonderful to have an environment in which you can take this stuff seriously. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure there were any big weaknesses. I didn't love every story we read, but that wasn't the point.",
                "The strengths are the readings, which are generally fantastic, and the professor, who brought excellent practical writing insight to the table. The short assignments are also good. The weakness of this course is the fact that only one short story is written for the course, and a revised version is never submitted. That means the poorly-crafted stories will never be revised, and it's hard to motivate line editing when you know the story isn't going anywhere. Considering how \"competitive\" the application for this course was, the students were surprisingly the least interesting part of the course.",
                "This course offered a very good introduction to creative writing, though I think there were points at which the assignments could have been more challenging so as to really push us in our writing.",
                "I felt that the writing exercises didnt develop my skills as a writer, they only taught me the elements of a short story. As an introductory course, I wouldve liked more emphasis on the development of prose itself. That said, I learned short stories well and feel equipped to begin writing more.",
                "The course is strong in its readings, which are completely wonderful. My main suggestion would be that you dont offer responses to every story others write; instead, it could be structured so that you had to provide more in depth feedback to, say, two or three people. It was difficult to provide so much feedback every week and feel like I was giving the best criticism I could.",
                "The professor is the course's greatest strength. Not many people get to learn fiction writing from a Pulitzer winner. \r\n\r\nIf you don't fully engage with the course, it might feel like you aren't getting much feedback. Cunningham is wonderful, but you have to put in an effort and speak to him outside of class to get the most out of him."

                "Yes - it offers a really great catalogue of short stories and very engaging discussion of their various elements. Just keep in mind that Creative writing/workshopping is only one small part of the class",
                "I'd unquestionably recommend the course if you can get in. Make sure you attend the info session for the Michael-taught sections; as far as I can tell, you have no chance of getting in if you don't. You don't need to be an English major to get in, for the record.",
                "Probably not. If you're looking for an introductory fiction writing course, take Intro to Creative Writing or Intro Fiction Writing. If you're looking for a more advanced seminar, take the higher level 400 courses. For anyone who would like to become a better writer, this is not the most efficient place to do so. That being said, if you want to read a bunch of great stories, or are interested in writing as more of a hobby, or simply want to meet other aspiring writers, this is a fun course at the end of the day.",
                "This is a really cool class for seeing great short stories and engaging with them with an amazing professor and intimate group of students interested in writing!",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in doing creative writing at Yale who would like to gain a solid grasp of the foundations.",
                "I would, but perhaps not with Cunningham. He made a number of comments that were inappropriate regarding gender, sexuality, and class, and I did not feel comfortable bringing them up with him. That said, the structure of the course and the readings were good.",
                "I would! But I especially would if the workshop format was reimagined.",
                "Yes. Anyone who wants to get into fiction writing should be ecstatic to take this class. It is an ideal introduction to the craft."
