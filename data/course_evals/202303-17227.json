                "- I wish Haskell was introduced earlier, or made more explicit in the lecture. Its use in the course projects seems divorced from the class material. That said, I'd like to make clear: I LOVED the Haskell parts, and am very glad that it was covered in this course. Many props to Ben. \r\n\r\n- I feel like the lectures weren't well organized in terms of the contents. Some lectures jump behind and ahead of each other. Even little things like a clear table of contents for the lecture slides would help. (or lecture numbers! Every slide show looks the same, and because they start with 10+ slides of \"recap\", it's very hard to find what you need when you're reviewing. There _is_ structure, but it might need to be made more explicit)\r\n\r\n- The course didn't feel \"cumulative\" -- largely because it usually isn't made clear beforehand how each new topic fits into the big picture. SAT solvers build on our work with Dafny; this is clear. But how does abstraction checking fit in? After some thinking, you can figure it out -- but if we have a clearer big picture map before, then it helps us when learning something new.",
                "The professor is fantastic and the TA Ben is probably the best TA I have ever had at Yale. The strength is how much information is covered and all the projects are highly relevant, no busy work. The greatest weakness is the lack of structure in the projects, especially with Simplex I would have liked more algorithm guidance especially in the second step. However, the support is there when I ever needed help. Maybe some more detail in the instruction s would be fantastic.",
