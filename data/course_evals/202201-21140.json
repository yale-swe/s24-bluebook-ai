                "I learned how to analyze art.",
                "I learned how to properly analyze a piece of art and a survey on Russain art.",
                "I gained a lot of knowledge about the trajectory of Russian art, which informs my knowledge about art in other countries as well.  I became better at writing out art analysis through practice, and I had much practice thinking about Russian artworks critically.  Further, I was able to really think about this course critically with the advent of the war between Russia and Ukraine.  Viewing Russian art through that lens was fascinating.",
                "Learned a new type of analysis  visual analysis which is such a useful skill for any humanities student and any museum-goer\r\nWonderful survey of Russian culture in conjunction with literature",
                "Left class with more solid sense of Russian \/ surrounding land history.",
                "Broad survey knowledge of Russian art, as well as how they interacted with similar movements in Western Europe. Especially deep coverage of post-1900 modern and abstract work that I feel like is missing from many other art history classes.",
                "This class was incredible, without contest my favorite class of the semester. This was an art history class, but it was also equally a class about the history of literature, of culture, of an empire; the list goes on.",
                "I learned a ton about the history of Russian art (especially from 1850s to the present day), and learned a lot about how to analyze and discuss art, as a non-artist STEM major taking an art history course for the first time.",
                "I learned a lot about analyzing art, as well as history.",
                "I learned so much about Russian history and Russian art!",
                "It was a special class to take during this point in history. Loved the design of the course, including the discussion of art in the context of international relations and politics",
                "I learned so much about Russian art and some of its history, through gaining insight about the contexts in which different art movements began and ended. I was hesitant about taking this course, thinking it would be too niche. However, I was completely wrong. This course and all of its content turned out to be so interesting and valuable. I loved learning about the complex intersections between art and politics and realizing how art could make such an impact on people. This course gave me the skills to better analyze so many different kinds of art, ranging from realistic to super abstract, and how to make connections with different points throughout history. I feel as though this course opened many doors for me, and it opened my eyes to understanding the amazing intricacies of not just Russian art, but art in general."

                "I would have preferred a few longer assignments, rather than frequent short assignments.",
                "No real weaknesses! Would have appreciated a bit more guidance on the writing assignments as someone who has never taken art history classes before, but overall it was doable. Great class. Going to the galleries was definitely the highlight.",
                "I think there were two many short assignments. A couple in depth assignments would have been better than 6 smalls ones.",
                "Strength: Interesting lecture, fun sections",
                "This course is overall very strong.  The timeline that we covered was massive, and I felt fulfilled and knowledgable in each section of time.  I do not think that this course had any weaknesses.",
                "Everything was great except the classroom choice and lecture! The lectures were very one sided and there weren't chances to ask questions. Also Prof Brunson would read off a scipt so it felt like we couldn't interrupt to ask things. Also classroom was way too dark and people would just fall asleep. I think a normal classroom would be better.",
                "Incredible lecturer, Professor Brunson is one of the most eloquent speakers I have ever heard. Her lecturers are very well-planned and so thought provoking.\r\nLOVED the sections at the YUAG, Caterina was a wonderful TA",
                "All great TBH.",
                "Strengths: The art that we study in class is awesome  having 50 minutes twice a week dedicated to looking at these pieces was a great experience. Prof Brunson's lectures are well-structured, easy to follow, and did a good job making connections. Most importantly, the YUAG sections!!! Not only did we look at pieces currently hanging, we also got to examine stuff they pulled especially for our class, which was amazing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The short writing assignments (at least all but the last one or two) were actually pretty complex prompts that required research and planning. There were a significant number of them and often they were due in quick succession. I feel like a midterm essay + final essay system of assignments would be much preferred.",
                "I honestly cant think of a weakness. This class is phenomenal in every aspect.",
                "Strengths: lectures are fantastic. The art is great, especially if you already have a prior interest in Russian culture and history. The assignments are well spread-out and not insanely time-consuming, and I deeply enjoyed the final exhibition project. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The sections spent at the art gallery and the Beinecke, though very fun, were not very substantive. Perhaps it would have helped if the TAs had more knowledge of Russian.",
                "It was a very fascinating and well-taught class, though occasionally subject to historical bias.",
                "The course was great! I have no complaints!",
                "Loved every aspect of the course.",
                "One of the main strengths of this course is the lectures. Professor Brunson is an amazing lecturer; her material for every class was interesting and engaging. I also enjoyed that we had several short writing assignments as opposed to one or two long assignments. It allowed me to explore many different topics from class in greater depth. The only downside of these short writing assignments was that I was often left with an urge to speak more on the topic but couldn't do so because of the page limit. Regardless, I think the many assignments is a better alternative because not only was I able to learn about many different topics, but I was able to get feedback more than just once and apply that to future assignments, without too much of my grade depending on a single writing assignment. The only other weakness would be the reading assignments. The material was always very interesting, but sometimes the amount of assigned required readings was difficult to manage, especially with other course work."

The professor is an amazing lecturer and each lecture is well planned and effective, I felt like I learned so much after every single lecture. The section is super informative too and straight to the point. The assignments can get a little hectic especially when they start pilling up towards the end of the semester, but overall was a fun class!",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes!  This course was a fascinating exploration of Russian and Soviet art, as well as an exploration of how artwork formally moves from the traditional to the abstract.  There was also an interesting lens of East versus West present within the course.  It was truly so dimensional, and Professor Brunson is such a wonderful lecturer.  Sections were amazing, and the range of works that we explored in person, up close, was mind blowing.",
                "Yes",
                "YES YES YES YES a 100 times yes. I have never taken an art history class before and this class opened my eyes to the joys of visual art analysis, and to so many elements of Russian culture. Top 2 classes I have ever taken at Yale.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes. It's a niche you likely will never get to explore again. The YUAG + Beinicke visits were phenomenal (even getting to physically handle some of the print material one week) and make it worth taking just on their own. The teaching team also did a great job.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student regardless of what they were studying. More than ever, studying the complex and difficult history of Russia and Russian Art in a time like this is necessary. Professor Brunson is outrageously inspiring. The material is challenging, but made accessible not only by the chosen readings, but also by lecture, and cemented through the teaching fellows.",
                "Absolutely, especially if that student has any knowledge or experience of Russian culture. I would only recommend getting started on the writing assignments with time (they are harder than they appear, for sure!). It's a fantastic class and Prof Brunson is an excellent lecturer.",
                "Yes, it was a fascinating and fun class with a dedicated prof and TAs.",
                "Yes! The TFs and professor are incredibly kind and caring, and the course was incredibly interesting!",
                "Absolutely! It was a great opportunity to learn more about Russian culture and art history in general.",
                "I honestly would recommend this class to anyone. It is such an enriching course, and certainly my favorite so far at Yale. You'll be able to appreciate so many variations of art so much more, and of course especially Russian art because have you'll have some more understanding of its history. I don't think you need a background in art history or Russian history at all for this class; Professor Brunson and the TFs are there to help you along the way, and the readings\/lectures provide you with all of the knowledge you need."
