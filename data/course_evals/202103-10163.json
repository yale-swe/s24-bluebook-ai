It would be nice if he chose one online textbook as the single optional material rather than list several and let us hunt for the information, but that is really a minor complaint. Given we get the two attempts, our quiz content could stand to be a little more difficult to better reflect the exams. There are lots of office hours, wonderful TAs, challenging exams, and interesting lectures. Gradescope is a nice feature."

The coursework is not extremely difficult to handle because the work is interesting to do! It is very easy to find help and collaborate with others in the class too.",
                "Absolutely! Just because this course wasn't \"hard\" (only class that hasn't made me cry) doesn't mean you do not learn a lot. It was reasonably challenging and office hours were a good way to make friends. If you have had AP stat take this course, you'll learn about minitab or R and more advanced regression. If you haven't had AP stat take this course, you'll learn important life skills!"
