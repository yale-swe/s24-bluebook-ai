    "I learned to think more deeply about the historical roots of American racial inequality, and especially the modern ghetto.",
    "I learned a lot about the historical framework of themes that are very prevalent in national discourse today including urban ghettos, mass incarceration system and institutionalized racism.",
    "I learned how to effectively read through large amounts of text.",
    "This course offers a solid presentation of and engagement with the sites of the plantation, prison, and ghetto. Though it encompasses a strong grounding in the more straightforward histories of these spaces, its inclusion of fiction, more imaginative chapters and essays, and media reflects additionally a creative means of thinking through these various sites."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I felt like some of the readings were not that good, and even when the readings were good I usually wished our discussions centered more around them: there was a habit (which Professor Carico could have done more to fight) of getting off on tangents about any racial justice issue\/talking point of the twenty first century, regardless of any connection to themes of the readings.",
    "The professor, the syllabus and the reading was great.  Only weakness was in how the discussions were set up, the discussions in the beginning were a little unstructured and didn't encourage anybody to speak and share their ideas.  But later in the semester, Professor Carico provided a little more guidance to what we should focus on in the reading which made discussions much easier.",
    "I loved the syllabus, what we read, and all of our assignments. However, class was not as great as expected because I think Carico dominated the discussions instead of letting them be student driven as I would have liked.",
    "The course has wonderful readings and information. The perspectives are diverse and give everyone something to think about. The discussion part of the seminar is highly disappointing. We didnt come away from each seminar with more understanding of what we read and I m disappointed because its such a personal subject for me. There was not active engagement."

   "comments": [
    "Honestly the reading list is pretty great and I learned a lot overall, but I feel like there are better classes to take if you're interested in the main themes of the class.",
    "As in any seminar, it's all about the people you take it with: I would highly recommend shopping this class, but if the class was going to consistently have the issues with engagement that this semester had, I don't think it would be worth taking.",
    "This course is great if you want a better understanding of the history behind ghettos, mass incarceration and institutional and systematic racism.  The readings are comprehensive and relatively easy to understand and Professor Carico does a good job of integrating current events into class discussions.  As an engineering student, this is a great class to take if you're looking for a low commitment but insightful class.",
    "I would, but would warn other students it was not as great as I expected. I did not love Carico and thought he overexplained and dominated class discussions. However, I think I learned a lot from the course material and doing the assignments- 6 reading responses and 2 long papers.",
    "Honestly, no. The books we read and the documentaries we watched were so powerful and impactful but the seminar section didnt efficiently expand the knowledge that we were exposing ourselves to. I also feel like the class wasnt as open to other perspectives like It shouldve been. This may be attributed to our specific class but my Froco also felt the same way as well when he took the class. Our discussion of the plantation, the prison, and the ghetto was so lofty and idealisticbthat It was near impossible to actually apply It to the people who are actively inhabiting these spaces. I didnt feel like I had the space or opportunity to humanize the people we were discussing, which led to me feeling extreme discomfort because these ideals directly affect my life as a black woman from a low-income neighborhood.",
    "Would recommend! Take this course to have a more grounded understanding of how we can create a better, more livable and just world. Given the realities of today, I consider the stakes of a class like this to be high. Every student in the class should take the coursework seriously and find ways to incorporate that knowledge into organizing work."
