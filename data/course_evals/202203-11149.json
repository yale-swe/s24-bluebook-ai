Some of the skills include my knowledge in Chinese and learned how to write and speak in Chinese. Some insights I got from this course was that I want to continue my classes in Chinese.",

                "The biggest strength of the course is that it is extremely organized. There is a learning curve at the beginning, but once you understand the weekly calendars and the assignments we do for each unit, you do not feel overwhelmed despite the massive amount of content we are taught in a single semester. The only downside is that because there is so much to cover in so little time, there are moments when you feel rushed. However, the in-class practice and homework supplement the learning so you don't feel unprepared for too long.",
                "I sometime felt like our dictations used characters that we had not been expected to learn, but other than that I loved everything about the course!",
                "I think the strengths was that the concepts taught were very useful; however, some weaknesses included slowing down. I think we were moving along too quickly in the lessons in the book."

                "Most certainly. It's a tough course, but you'll learn a ton.",
                "Yes. I had the opportunity to take L5 in another language, but choosing to learn Chinese turned out far better than I had expected. As I said, the learning is very organized and there is no lack of support because they understand that Chinese is very different from other languages. Now, I have friends I met in the Chinese program who I continue to text in Chinese because there is a great desire to learn and improve. Chinese is actually very fun.",
                "Yes, absolutely. I feel like I learned more in one semester than I have in many other Yale courses that I have taken.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because I think the concepts and language taught are very useful.",
                "I would completely recommend taking this class if you have the extra overhead to do a lot of work and really want to learn Chinese. You learn so much in such a short amount of time and although theres a lot of work, its spread out consistently everyday through homework and coming to class."
