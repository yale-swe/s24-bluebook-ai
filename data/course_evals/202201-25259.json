                "This course was a broad introduction to 19th/20th/21st-century literatures of the Chukchi Arctic, Central Asia, the Caucasus and Eastern Europe. We discussed changes in Russian/Soviet imperial projects with special attention to race/ethnicity, nationalisms, politics of translation, censorship, gender/marriage, Islams, Sufism, war and displacement. Being in this class during the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and being able to go many events hosted by the Slavic Studies department was an amazing experience.",
                "We read literature from a wide variety of countries and cultures in and surrounding Russia. It was very interesting to learn about the dynamics between Russia and non-Russians within the Russian Empire and Soviet Union, as well as the racial, religious, gender, and class dynamics within these societies. I found most of our readings pretty interesting and I think my writing and close reading skills improved throughout the course."

                "It was a really small seminar, so everyone got to participate a lot, which was great! The readings were usually relatively short, which was nice workload wise, and that also allowed us to examine them in more detail. As someone with not a lot of background in Eastern European and Central Asian history, I probably could have benefited from a little more background given about the texts, perhaps a few additional readings."

This was my first literature class at Yale and I will definitely look for more like this.",
