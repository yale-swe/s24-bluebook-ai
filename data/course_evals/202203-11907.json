                "I learned how to read research and research papers. Professor Aldrich was great at walking the class through how to look at data and asses studies.",
                "I learned how to read a political science journal in depth and determine what information was most important in understanding the journal.  I also got comfortable with reading political science journals. I also learned all about women in politics, from the barriers they face from entering office to quotas to how women are represented. There were a variety of topics covered which were interesting and relevant.",
                "I learned a lot about the gendered lens of American politics.",
                "Learned about women's issues and interests, minority-majority coalitions and overlaps, the intersectionality of gender with other demographics, women and conservative politics, and reasons why women are underrepresented in government and politics. We also discussed data analysis and how to become better at analyzing quantitative papers.",
                "Knowledge wise, I learned so much about why women enter politics, how they are prevented from doing so, and what factors are at play in women's representation in politics. We also touched on really interesting facets of politics like violence against women in politics and corruption. Skill wise, we did a lot of analysis of scholarly articles and studies. At the beginning of the course, I was scared of these dense texts. Now, I understand how to unpack them and can read tables, interpret graphs, and know how to find the main thesis. Overall, I learned so much about the subject matter and the skills involved in the political science major!",
                "An overview of the political science research concerning women in politics. This includes the challenge to define \"women's issues,\" research on descriptive/substantive representation, intersectionality between gender and other traits, the success of gender quotas in politics, and voters' ultimate choice of who to elect."

                "I enjoyed the seminar format and loved Professor Aldrich. I did not know the course was extremely theoretical heavy, but I enjoyed learning about the information. Professor Aldrich is also very nice and made the course engaging.\r\n\r\nI think it would be helpful if outside material was brought into discussion. Our discussions were primarily about the reading, but it could be nice if information outside of the reading was brought in.",
                "The course is very interesting and organized really well. All the assignments are helpful and the readings are great. If discussion was less about summarizing the readings, it would be better.",
                "Strengths: The final paper being built up over the semester reduced stress; emphasis on growing and feedback was highly appreciated; good selection of papers, although maybe some more quantitative work would have been appreciated; Professor Aldrich!!! She's the best and genuinely cares about her students succeeding and learning from her class. Weaknesses: Sometimes, we would go overtime breaking down papers we had read; more discussion would have been better; also, maybe more quantitative work being done, but the class doesn't require this background, so this makes sense.",
                "The organization of the course was great -- everything was on Canvas, the readings were well structured, and all of the material built off of itself. The subject matter was engaging, especially since weekly journal entries focused on how your individual experience connected to themes. Discussion often centered around interpreting the articles but also how we connected to the issues. A weakness would be the perhaps over-emphasis on sticking to the readings. A majority of class was going reading by reading and figuring out what the authors were saying. While this was helpful in the beginning, I think it would have been helpful to trust that we learned the skill and move on to discuss more broad, overarching themes in the class.",
                "This course is well-organized on canvas and easy to follow throughout the course. Discussions were well facilitated and everyone in the class is invested and interested in the subject material. I would have appreciated more guidance on the expectations on the final project, because many of us do not have statistical backgrounds and could have used some help."

                "Yes, this class touched on a wide array of topics related to women and politics, and I was always excited to go to class each week. Professor Aldrich selected very interesting readings and was super knowledgeable because of her own research.",
                "I would! Professor Aldrich is great and I learned a lot. I would specifically recommend this to someone interested in theory or the conceptual aspects of political science.",
                "Yes, this course is very important for anyone studying political science and Professor Aldrich is amazing!",
                "Yes!!! It's a fun and chill class where you learn more about the connections between women, political systems, and government. The class never feels overwhelming or stressful, and the research you read is interesting. Professor Aldrich alone is a reason why you should take this class. She's incredibly relatable and loves teaching the subject. Probably one of my favorite Professors here at Yale!",
                "Yes! I learned so much about the subject matter and developed skills necessary for future Yale classes. Super interesting, engaging, and the final research project allows you to really dive into a topic of your choosing.",
                "Yes! Especially if you are interested in women's representation in politics. Just expect this class to be driven mostly by political science research and theory, not broad social commentary on women's place in politics. It was an organized, well-rounded course that offers great insight into women's political representation internationally."
