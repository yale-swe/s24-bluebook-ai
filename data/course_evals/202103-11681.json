            "comments": [
                "Impressive width and breadth of material covered: I now feel confident in talking about and understanding MENA affairs! The syllabus was well constructed, and readings were a nice compliment, rather than merely a repeat, of lecture material. Professor Lotito was a fantastic instructor and presented the material in a clear and engaging manner.",
                "This course was not taught like an IR, but rather a history course on the Middle East. Very little time and attention was given to core IR concepts (levels of analysis, theories, etc.) while we spent a lot of time overviewing the region's history. This had its merits, but I was expecting to delve into the theory more. I think the course could be improved by incorporating more theory, as this would add a richness to discussions and prevent them from just being summaries of historical events. Also, the course had a LOT of reading and I felt a lot of it was unnecessary. I would actually split the weekly readings with a friend and would usually spend upwards of 3 hours on just my half. In section, we would usually only discuss one of the readings and never come back to the rest.",
                "Strengths: lectures (Professor Letito is a great lecturer), balance of theory and information (I feel like I learned about IR theory without getting too bogged down in it\/removed from everyday realities in the region, which was fantastic), interesting readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings were quite dense and didn't get discussed at all. Also, I wonder if a different structure might enable the course to get into more depth or cover some of the countries that get left out. The structure of the course in two halves (1st half thematic overview, 2nd half country by country) does have some advantages, but sometimes it felt like trying to have it both ways meant covering less. It's a lot to juggle things chronologically, geographically (ie, by state), and thematically. Perhaps the course could take the first two weeks to do a chronological overview of the region and introduce IR theory concepts (in general, speeding up the beginning of the course), and then spend the rest of the time going through the countries in more depth, bringing in the themes along the way.",
                "Strengths: Does a great job of summarizing a HUGE topic in a very short amount of time, good reading selections, solid lectures, appropriate assignments\r\nWeaknesses: Totally not their fault, but I was really hoping dive deeper into the topics than we did. I guess I didn't realize how necessarily thin we were spread",
                "Strengths: lecture was engaging, and I learned a lot about foreign policy in the Middle East. Workload was very manageable, with interesting readings that supplemented lectures well. Weaknesses: I wish we had more structure for discussing the readings in section and connecting larger themes across the semester, rather than just walking through the content of the readings each week.",
                "Lectures are nothing more than just reciting what readings said without any new analysis or meaningful synthesis. Readings are good, especially at the beginning",
                "I like the system of doing a different country each lecture (approximately).  I do think it might have been helpful to spend a bit more time on the different theories of international relations, as I never felt I really mastered those.  I understood them in principle, but I didn't spend enough time with them that I could call them to mind while analyzing different situations.",
                "No weaknesses stood out. The well-organized structure of lectures was definitely a strength, priming a broad view of themes consistent with individual MENA countries before the midterm, and using the same framework to explore countries individually after the midterm was beneficial. Professor and TA were both passionate about the course material and communicative. .",
                "The section participation could be strengthened, by maybe having students prepared questions or somthing for each section to better engage with readings.",
                "Lectures were interesting and the the professor and TAs were very helpful and understanding when it came to assignments. The reading load was somewhat heavy at times and felt unnecessarily so.",
                "Professor Lotito does an excellent job of covering a very immense region in only one semester, obviously there is a lot more detail than was given but considering time restrictions I think the content was interesting and engaging.",
                "This class did a great job of discussing the commonalities of the politics of the region, and also the specific country policies. The course was well-organized: it began with the international relations of the region at large, and then narrowed its focus to specific countries.",
                "Professor Lotito did an amazing job leading lectures and keeping the class engaged.",
                "Strength: readings offer broad and varied perspectives; class well managed to facilitate understanding\r\nWeakness: lacks contemporary Arab scholarship for a class on the Middle East",
                "Great course - Lotito is impressive",
                "Professor Lotito is a phenomenal lecturer, and I very much enjoyed every class. I think it was difficult to schedule office hours through Canvas, but honestly the lectures were so thorough and the posted slides so well developed that it was incredibly easy to get the answers on your own.",
                "The topic covered a broad number of countries and issues within them. Struggle to find any faults with the course. The assessment structure was brilliant and a true reflection of learning.",
                "It was interesting that the course was structured by talking about general themes in the ME first, and then going into individual countries for the second half. I thought this was a good way of introducing the ME, but some things ended up being repetitive.",
                "The course was great, very well structured and organized. Prof. Lotito is a great lecturer and supportive of students.",
                "The course was well organized, lectures were interesting, and the readings added to the concepts in class rather than merely reiterating them.  The Zoom option to take the course led to class attendance steadily declining which was unfortunate, since engagement in the lecture hall was quite low as a result.",
                "Strengths are that the course and lectures were well-organized and informative. Weaknesses were that not enough time was spent on theoretical frameworks and background information, and readings were long and somewhat inaccessible.",
                "Strengths: I loved Prof Lotito's lecture style. I looked forward to going to each class. The readings were also fun and the midterm\/ final essay topics were extremely reasonable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None really",
                "The strength of the course was the layout. It was extremely easy to follow and Lotito is a very engaging professor who makes extremely complex issues much more digestible. The only weakness is its nature as a survey course, which keeps us from learning as much as we might like about each region.",
                "I appreciated Prof Lotito's flexibility in providing a remote learning option, his frequent communications with the class, and his clear and transparent syllabus. He was a good lecturer, and I felt that he developed the curriculum in such a way that I learned a great deal.",
                "Strengths: \r\nReadings, lectures, structure of class\r\nWeakness:\r\nTime limits on test. Seems silly to have such limited time to write essays in tests. Doesnt demonstrate knowledge, just speed.",
                "I think it was sometimes difficult to gain an understanding of the overall history of countries as the readings often looked at specific issues."

As a non-major, this material served as a great introduction to the MENA region and international relations theories in a very approachable way. The workload is also very manageable, and the readings are interesting and worthwhile. If you're looking to understand the dynamics of the Middle East, this course is ideal!",
                "Yes! I would recommend the course to anyone interested in the region (even if you're not interested in IR or poli sci). It's fascinating to learn about the politics of the region, and the theory of how states interact with one another can be really interesting. I genuinely looked forward to lecture, section, and most of the readings. I found myself using and talking about what I learned in this class constantly (granted, I am studying the Middle East and Arabic, but I think it gives you a valuable perspective on issues like the refugee crisis, Israel\/Palestine, popular mobilization\/Arab Spring, etc regardless).",
                "Yes. Great course and super well-run",

                "I found that this course served for me more as an introduction to the Middle East, rather than specifically to international relations.  For someone unfamiliar with the region (like myself) I think it's a decent place to start, but if someone was specifically interested in the field of international relations I would encourage them to look elsewhere.",
                "I would recommend this to a student looking for a course to develop an understanding of International Relations and or the structure of IR in the Middle East.",
                "Yes, it is a good course for an overview of the Middle East and if you are interested in the history and politics of the region it is a good course, but if you want to go into depth with a few countries instead of an overview of many this is not the course for you.",

                "Yes - It is well organized and has engaging lectures, and I walked away really feeling like I had a better understanding of the region, which given foreign politics today, I think everyone should be aware of various trends and events unfolding in the Middle East.",
                "Yes if you want an extensive overview of the history and international relation of the Middle East. The content is not too challenging to grasp and is very interesting and topical.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student, mainly because it informs you well about topics that are so relevant and important to our lives and the world at large. The Middle East is very complicated, so being about to digest the information in a well organized classroom setting is great.",
                "Yes, this class was interesting and teaches real world knowledge that can be applied to daily life.",
                "Yes if you would like a better\/general understanding of the Middle East but do expect an orientalist approach",
                "Yes",

                "Yes",
                "Absolutely, the MENA region is pivotal in current IR and an extremely interesting way to study politics in the modern era.",
                "I would because the ME is a very important region of the world that I do not thing people generally are educated on unless they seek out information, and this course was a really great introduction for me.",
                "Yes! Prof. Lotito is excellent and the course is a must take for political science majors or other students interested in Middle Eastern relations and politics.",
                "Yes.  The Middle East is a crucial region to understand regardless of what major or interests you may have.  After the course you will feel more knowledgeable about the subject, and will be prepared to discuss key issues in the region at length.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are strongly interested in and have some prior experience with the material. The course did not feel very introductory, and I felt like I was getting a lot of information each week without a clear framework within which to contextualize it. There was some theory, but this is more of a content course than a theory course (which some may prefer).",
