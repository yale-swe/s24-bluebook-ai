I think Professor Dorfman does a great job at dedicating a lot of time to looking at a script from the audience's perspective rather than as an actor, which was the background of almost everyone in the class. I don't think I will ever look at a script and just read it without analyzing it first and carefully making notes about my ideas.",
                "I learned how to analyze dramatic texts from a holistic (rather than character-based) point of view. Hands-on practice helped me gain experience directing short scenes, working with actors, and devising theater."

            "comments": [
                "The performance opportunities and assignments are a great addition to the course. I enjoyed the plays we read and I enjoyed our approach to text analysis.",
                "Strengths: You get to direct 2 scenes and present them to a Professor Dorfman who gives great feedback. You get to analyze a script in a way that really helps you start your engines going and have a great, productive time with your actors and prod team. You get to discuss areas of theatre, from a director's perspective, and makes you appreacite your team even more.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel that more focus on blocking and how to deal with prod team memebers would have been good. I appreciated learning how to disect a text, but I feel that I'm still a little lost on how to use the stage properly and give useful blocking. Also, it was a little difficult to find time to rehearse as demanded by Professor Dorfman. A lot of times, I could only rehearse an hour with actors for a scene that required more time and my greade was affected. I feel that either rehearal time during classes or having people designated to act on these scenes would be better than scrambling to find actors and only have 2 people available for an hour.",
                "Strengths: The small class size and seminar style meant that I always received detailed feedback on my work from both my classmates and Professor Dorfman. This also made class discussions very engaging. \r\nWeaknesses: Some assignments necessitated a great deal of outside rehearsal/work time. This, along with the fast turnaround on certain projects, meant that certain work felt rushed or incomplete.",
                "My one suggestion would be to modify the scene directing assignment. While I found it very helpful to direct two scenes and receive feedback on them in the class, I feel that, in its current form, the assignment asks too much of students not enrolled in the course. This was especially evident during the second scene assignment, where multiple directors were forced to recast. Students, and actors in particular, are so busy that it did not feel fair to ask others to dedicate upwards of 5 hours to rehearsals for a class they are not in. I wonder if this class could pair with an acting class, who could make the scene work either an assignment or extra credit. I think it's crucial that the assignment remain on the syllabus, and I found it to be one of the most helpful activities we did, but I think it needs to be modified. Besides that, I feel I learned a ton in this class and really enjoyed it."

                "Absolutely. I look at theater entirely different after a semester in directing. Regardless of whether or not you'd like to pursue it, it's a great course to engage with.",
                "I would definetly recommend this course for anyone interested in doing a thesis in directing or just interested in how they can imporve as a director. Yeah, you may not get much directionality when it comes to blocking, but you will learn to look at a play differently and it is very helpful.",
                "Yes. This class really pushed me to look at dramatic texts in new ways and gave me many opportunities to develop directing/theatrical skills through hands-on projects. The class is definitely a commitment, and you need to put in a lot of time and effort to get something out of it, but if youre interested in directing, its worth it."
