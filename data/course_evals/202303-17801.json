            "comments": [
                "This course is very engaging and moves through a wide range of material quite quickly. The material is very interesting and goes much beyond the scope of fluids.",
                "Strengths: The class is usually pretty small so you get a lot of one-on-one time with the professor and it is generally pretty flexible. Exams are very similar to practice exams so there are limited surprises on test days (although this doesn't necessarily make the exams easier). Weaknesses: The class is somewhat disorganized, and the notes sheets aren't incredibly helpful to understand concepts. The class tends to be focused very deeply in the theory without many attempts to contextualize the theory in a way that makes sense for students.",
                "I think that the lecture notes are great, they are very concise. One issue is that sometimes Professor de la Mora can explain things very quickly and act like the topics are very intuitive, even though aerodynamics is far from intuitive. This was not an issue as long as I read the lecture notes closely before or after lectures, though.\r\n\r\nAnother great aspect of the course was the use of Mathematica. I think a lot of engineering courses focus too much on theory and mathematics and do not use enough computational tools (which is what is being done in actual engineering)."

Its a very interesting course, but the amount of work necessary to get an understanding of the material is likely more than is reasonable for most students.",
