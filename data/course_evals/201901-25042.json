    "The course surveyed the economic and political history of Japan and China since the 19th century (the early Qing relations with the West, the Opium Wars, the Meiji Restoration, the Sino-Japanese War, the two World Wars, the Great Leap Forward, Japan's postwar boom, etc.), covered major models in the history of economic development (Rostow, Gerschenkron, Solow-Swan), and explored specific aspects of the development literature (conflict and mortality, infrastructure and trade, globalization and post-industrialization).",
    "I learned so much about the history and development of China and Japan. Great contextualization with other world powers as well.",
    "I learned about the history of economic development in China and Japan. Though the class felt more like a history class, we learned about economic models for development such as Rostow, Solow, etc. We also used China and Japan in discussions of larger economic questions. We addressed the effects of imperialism, country size, geography, natural resources, and more. \r\n\r\nIn terms of skills, I learned how to more critically analyze readings and practiced presentation skills. For the final paper, I was able to apply econometrics to analyze Chinese data, which was great preparation for a thesis.",
    "I learned not only a great deal of factual information regarding the development of China and Japan, but I also learned how to critically analyze academic papers in the realm of Economic History."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The course broadly surveyed many important events in the histories of modern China and Japan, taught both historically important and more modern models, and demonstrated many interesting studies from the literature. It's a good look at how economists think about development. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because we spent so much time discussing the historical events, there wasn't as much time to do in-depth exploration of the models outside of student presentations.",
    "John Tang is INCREDIBLE. He went out of his way to help us learn material, as well as always making class conversation engaging. Weaknesses honestly, there really werent any. It was a small class, so attendance and participation were necessary but everyone there was interested in the material so it worked out.",
    "A strength of this course was Professor Tang's lecturing- he had a lot of great insight and was extremely knowledgable about the subject. Another strength was the material. The readings were really interesting and paired well with our class discussions. Professor Tang also typically ended class with broader discussion questions that better helped me understand economic lessons reaped by studying the history of China and Japan. It was nice to always connect to the bigger picture.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the syllabus, a strength was Professor Tang's completion system. Rather than being graded on a continuous scale, some of our essays and our presentations were graded based on completion. This took pressure off, and left room to take more risks in our critical analysis of the readings. \r\n\r\nThough weaknesses were few, I do have a suggestion for the syllabus. It was set up with readings that needed to be completed every 2 weeks. I think it would be more helpful to assign readings for each class, because completing the readings before the two week module meant that by the end of the module, the readings were not as fresh in my mind.",
    "I thought this course was excellent! It was a great balance of listening to insights from the professor and engaging in discussion questions and presentations from students."

    "Recommended for anyone interested in East Asia or economic development more broadly. Meiji Japan was the first non-Western country to successfully industrialize; understanding how a far eastern backwater managed to leapfrog into the ranks of great powers within the span of a generation provides many insights into the process of modernization. Chinese economic history over the last two centuries is crucial for understanding the country's current policies.",
    "Absolutely. John Tang is SO COOL. Also incredibly knowledgeable about the field of economic history; we read some of his papers in the class, but hes very modest about his work. The material is SO INTERESTING also. Such a great mix of history and economics. Also all coursework except for the final paper was a completion grade which was HYPE.",
    "Yes! The information I learned was really important for better understanding China and Japan and development economics. Through discussion questions, I have a better understanding of larger issues of development. I also became familiar with development frameworks that I could try to apply to any country. Class lecture was always enjoyable, and the class didn't feel like too much pressure, a nice breath of air in the economics department. The workload was fair, and great practice in writing critical analysis. Lastly, Professor Tang had so much insight to give to the class, and created a welcoming class atmosphere.",
    "Yes! Particularly to students interested in East Asia"
