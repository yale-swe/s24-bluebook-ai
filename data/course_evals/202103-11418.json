                "The strengths of this course are the speaking activities. The one weakness for me was the final project; I found that it added a lot to my workload while not really improving my German.",
                "Though intimidating, the class being fully conducted in German helped me gain a lot of knowledge of the language quickly. I think the main focus was slanted slightly towards grammar and structures, but I think that this was very helpful in gaining overall competence of the language. I do wish we spent a bit more time practicing and integrating the vocabulary. The class was very interactive and got us speaking and writing a lot with other students, which helped improve skill and confidence.",
                "Strengths: very systematic and organized. Prof. Gehlker was also very accommodating and kind.",
                "Strengths: \r\nGood in class pace\/discussions\r\nTeacher uses German at an appropriate level in class\r\nEffective homework exercises\r\nAppropriate tests\/grading\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nRepetitive homework (we have been assigned the same exercise in class\/Connect\/asynchronous\r\nI think we could have watched a bit more of \"real\" Germans speak, since speaking to a classmate is not very realistic, and their German is usually very poor.",
                "The homework was brutal. I felt as though it took me hours on end and most of my time and energy was spent on German class as opposed to the several other classes i was taking.",
                "Strength is the helpful textbook and weakness is the large amount of busy work that takes forever to do.",
                "Sometimes a lot of repetitive homeworks etc, would prefer to spend more time on some concepts",
                "The material is delivered in a systematic way which made it easier to retain. The biggest weakness was communication regarding certain assessments. Sometimes they appeared without much warning."

                "Yes! I think that the German courses can be tough, but they are challenging in a way that is extremely helpful. You get out of this course what you put in, but this course really advanced my knowledge of the language.",

                "German is a great language and if you like it then you should definitely take this course.",
                "Yes, it is a useful language",
