I think the main focus was slanted slightly towards grammar and structures, but I think that this was very helpful in gaining overall competence of the language. I do wish we spent a bit more time practicing and integrating the vocabulary. The class was very interactive and got us speaking and writing a lot with other students, which helped improve skill and confidence.",

                "The homework was brutal. I felt as though it took me hours on end and most of my time and energy was spent on German class as opposed to the several other classes i was taking.",
