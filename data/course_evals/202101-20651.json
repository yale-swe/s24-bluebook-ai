The first half was very foundational and provided us with a pretty good background of information about different climate systems. The second half consisted of a series of guest lectures about several different climate issues/ new technologies. I definitely learned a good amount about how our climate systems work and interact with eachother, but I think a lot of the information went over my head.",

                "Strengths: the guest speakers were really awesome and provided a real-world perspective on the information we learned in the first half of the course. The TAs were super awesome and willing to help on the PSETs and the literature critiques. Workload wasn't terrible but I wish there was a review session before the midterm. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it felt like this course is aimed more towards graduate students. A lot of the information was super detailed and felt too high-level for me to really understand.",
                "Strengths: The professors care about the subject and students, and lectures are both easygoing and engaging.  We also had a large number of guest lectures, which were almost all cool and informative.  The amount of work is also just right to learn things without anything that feels like busy work; I especially appreciated that we did paper reviews the 2nd half of the term, it was a great way to understand current research in a basic way and tie it to class concepts.  Weaknesses: Not much! Since we did spend the last few weeks on recent models and they were all guest lectures, it would have been nice to spend a little more time in class reviewing them or talking about CMIP generally for context.",
                "The p-set problems were sometimes unclear or required a lot of background research. The lectures were usually interesting and it was helpful when we had discussions about real world issues."

Both halves are chock-full of interesting and critical information. It's really accessible as a science credit and you're guaranteed to learn a lot.",
                "Yes, absolutely! It is a great foundation in climate change, and you don't need more than a basic background in physics/chemistry to understand the concepts.  Would recommend for anybody studying environmental/climate policy, or who is starting out in earth sciences or env. studies.",
