                "I learned a ton about the sociology of norms and deviance. We discussed some basic sociological concepts about deviant behavior, the self, and different approaches to studying societal norms. We read Prof. Anderson's books in-depth, and it was really cool to hear his own perspective on writing them and doing ethnographic research. I feel like I am much better now at articulating how marginalization and labels of deviance occur on a theoretical basis. It was a lot of breaking down racism and the stereotype of deviance of Black people into very clear theories that followed its historical basis and how it manifests today.",
                "You get a really thorough knowledge of labeling theory and the discussions around norms and deviance in the 70s, as well as Prof. Andersons work.",
                "i developed a deep understanding of the way norms work, and how deviance is reigned in by society.",
                "In this class I learned key insights from the sociology of deviance, centering around the many ways that social norms are created, enforced, and broken. An  important distinction was made between objective and subjective approaches to the study of \"deviance\", and that term itself was broken down in terms of the many meanings it has taken on in popular perception as well as social research. I gained important new perspectives on the makings of social identities and social interaction, drawing from theoretical papers, ethnographic studies, and real-world examples.",

            "comments": [
                "The main weakness of this course is its lack of organization. Every week Prof. Anderson assigns a *lot* of readings, and we don't actually end up discussing most of them, so it feels like a waste of time to try to finish all the readings when only 1 or 2 are the actual focus of class discussions. I would have preferred to do those few readings more in-depth and be able to devote more time to them. There's not really a clear progression or structure to the course, and I think it would've helped to even just give each week a clear theme/topic. The seminars themselves were not really organized either; it was mostly Prof. Anderson rambling (although it was super interesting rambles!) without any discussion questions or real topic. So really it was just pretty disorganized. We also didn't find out about deadlines until a week or two in advance, so it was difficult to plan around those assignments. We ended up with 3 essays - one reflection paper in February, a midterm paper in March, and a short essay final exam due at the end of reading period. So workload-wise it wasn't too bad, I just had no idea in advance when those deadlines would be. \r\n\r\nAlso, the scope of the course is pretty limited. It mostly covers the deviance of Black men, which is obviously a very important topic, and I think the class as a whole would've benefited from broadening that scope to other forms of deviance - women, LGBTQ+ people, disabled people, how forms of deviance and marginalization intersect, etc. Prof. Anderson had said he wasn't very familiar with those topics, which I suppose is fair, but it would've been nice to have a broader scope, especially when a lot of the same frameworks that we did discuss could be applied to tons of different marginalized groups. I think every single reading he assigned was written by a man, which was pretty annoying because there's a lot more scholarship out there that was neglected in this class. \r\n\r\nBut overall this class was great and I learned a lot in spite of those weaknesses. He was pretty good about giving feedback on our essays and trying to engage students in discussions. I think the main strength was just how knowledgeable and experienced Prof. Anderson is; he's very good at explaining these concepts and making it clear how applicable they are to everyday life.",
                "The readings are amazing and Prof. Anderson is kind and knowledgeable. I wish class discussions had a bit more structure to them",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe Professor was extremely knowledgeable, especially in regards to race, and was open to examples from different fields. \r\nThe readings were insanely interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI feel the class would benefit from more open discussion -- with students responding to each other, rather than the Professor's points. Some guiding questions could help in this regard. \r\nSometimes, the prompts given to us for essays were slightly vague. They would have benefitted from some extra information on guidelines, so that we could know exactly what we had to do.",
                "This course benefited from an excellent selection of readings, covering a range of approaches within the sociology of deviance. Course discussions were engaging and always connected to real-world events and experiences. Despite the variety of topics covered, recurring themes helped to connect them all in fascinating ways. That said, I think the course could also be improved by a more formal laying-out of those themes, and a more explicit roadmap of how the readings discussed are to be viewed relative to each other.",
                "Some may say that it was slightly unorganized during the lectures but I think that helped our discussions get as deep as we went."

                "Yes, I would. Despite some flaws in the course content and structure, I learned a lot in this class and it was a really fascinating perspective from an incredibly talented sociologist. Definitely worth taking if you can deal with the lack of organization and come prepared for the limited scope of deviance that was the focus of most of the class. You will certainly learn a lot and it's super applicable to your day to day life.",
                "Yes! The class is a little disorganized at times but If you were disappointed at the lack of depth of SOCY 151, this course is perfect for you. Learning from Prof. Anderson is also extremely worth it",
                "Yes -- anyone who studies sociology/anthro/polisci should take this course! The Prof is extremely knowledgable, and the frameworks learned are widely applicable.",
                "I would recommend this course to all students, regardless of their backgrounds. The title of \"norms and deviance\" might seem intimidating or obscure, but  what it really covers is the glue that holds society together, the labels that we use to define ourselves and others, and the ways that we must each constantly negotiate the expectations that others have of us. By the end of the course, I was much more convinced by the notion that the study of deviance sits \"at the heart of sociology\", and I think its insights are relevant to everyone with an interest in the society and social groups that they inhabit. I think most important for students who take this class is to be prepared to take those insights into their own hands, ready to apply them to the issues that interests to them the most.",
