The class is structured so that you receive such a clear path forward and a clear understanding of expectations.\r\n\r\nI think only thing to be mindful of is that you are going to get so much feedback from different ppl that it may seem overwhelming. Remember that this is a good thing, and really time block the time you spend with your capstone so you dont drown in it.",

The process to decide on your topic is great, and it ensures that you really leave with something youre passionate about. I cant say enough about the way that this class is set up, I feel like I have such a clear idea of whats expected and how to get there. It makes the page-length ultimately required feel so much less daunting. I feel very lucky to have done this class before starting the thesis process for my major, which it does not seem like offers nearly as much comprehensive advising.",
