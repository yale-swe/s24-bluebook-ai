                "I learned a lot about Korean history and the ways that religion has affected it and been intertwined with it. I learned a lot of skills in self-reflection and began to question my relationship with religion in a way I never had. I also really loved the week on North Korean religion. I also was able to get a basic understanding of the philosophies of many religions which helped broaden my worldview. The distinction between religion and spirituality was discussed often in this course.",
                "I learned about different types of religion and culture in Korea. Through class discussion on various interesting topics, I was able to develop a greater insight into how people practice and define religion. All of the readings and guest lectures were very insightful as well. The class was divided into lecture and discussion, which was a nice balance.",
                "everything about religion in general, a deep dive into all of the important world religions. A whole new outlook on human nature, and of course Korea. I would recommend this class to ANYONE interested in learning more about all religions beyond just a Korean context. It's important knowledge you'll savor for eternity.",
                "I learned an extensive history of religion in South Korea, and I also engaged in deep discussions with the professor and my classmates regarding the influence of religion on Korean culture.",
                "Knowledge in comparative religions in Korea culture. Insights into the nature of religion provided by Prof. Kim.",
                "In this class, I learned how to deconstruct established definitions and broaden my perspective to re-appreciate the world I live in. Through a careful examination of religion and culture in Korea, I developed a newfound understanding of how religion fundamentally helps people, regardless of the stigma perpetuated by society and the media. I learned that a religious or spiritual experience doesn't necessarily have to involve notions of the Church, prayer, or even God, but it can be broadened to include any experience in which you are making a conscious effort to intensify joy and confront suffering.",
                "I gained a deeper understanding of the role and history of religion in Korean society, and I also developed a stronger understanding of my own faith (why I pursue it, what exactly I am pursuing...).",
                "I acquired a broad-ranging knowledge of the history, practices, and beliefs of various religions in the Korean peninsula. In particular, not only did the class provide exposure to historic religious traditions and modes of thought but also their intersections with the developments of political ideologies and economic arrangements in Korea. The class also provided insight into the construction of religious categories within the broader public discourse of South Korea as well as configurations of religious freedom within North Korea.",
                "I gained a new understanding of religion through an exploration of various theories, events, etc.",
                "I learned a lot about the role of religion in Korea, and also about ways of thinking about different forms of religion\/spirituality.",
                "We looked at various papers, movies, and articles discussing religion, specifically in the context of Korea.",
                "It was a genuinely one of the most interesting courses I've taken at Yale-- all the readings were actually really fun to do and the course structure\/discussions gave deeper insight to how religious beliefs affect every aspect of a homogenous country such as Korea. Though I thought of myself as an atheist, the course allowed me to make sincere reflections on how religion has actually personally affected my upbringing, my family's immigration, and our varying cultural viewpoints. The class also allowed me to get a deeper insight and historical background of various East Asian religions and even mainstream religions such as Christianity.",
                "before coming into the course, i didn't really know much about religion. however, each week focused on a particular part of Korean religion, so i feel as if i was able to get a comprehensive overview of religion and culture in korea.",
                "I learned a lot about different aspects of Korean religion and culture, including nonofficial religions like Shamanism, Confucianism, Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, and marginal religions like Islam and Shincheonji. The context behind these religions is also very tied to history, so we also gleaned a lot of historical background.",
                "Learned about Korean religions",
                "This course provided a broad overview of Korean history with respects to different world religions, and it helped me understand the contemporary religious, political, social, and cultural landscape in South Korea. The weekly reading responses also pushed me to practice my writing every week. The readings were interesting but not difficult.",
                "I learned a lot about Korean culture, history and religion that I had not known previously. Further, the class got me thinking about religion more generally in new ways I had not considered before.",
                "Religion and culture in Korea, how to analyze religion, understanding history through a theological lens, critical analysis, East Asian religions",
                "I learned how to look at religion from many different viewpoints. This was the first time I was able to be in an academic setting with people from all different religions, and I think I gained a lot of insight from this experience."

            "comments": [
                "This course was amazing. The only weakness I can think of is that discussion sometimes got circular and was a little bit difficult with 40 people but by the second half, they split us into two groups which definitely helped. I wish we'd spent less time on discussion and more time with professor Kim lecturing though because he really is an amazing speaker, definitely one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of taking a course with. Another strength of this course is the way the mid-term\/final essays push you to reflect and apply what we've learned to your lived experience (something that kind of surprised me given that religion and Korean culture are kind of distant form the focal points of my life).",
                "A strength was that there were both lecture and discussion session in every class, so it was easy to get questions answered and clarified. The readings were very helpful in understanding class content.",
                "N\/A",
                "Strengths: plenty of opportunity to participate in class discussions, manageable homework workload",
                "Class is a good mix of lecture and discussion and readings are very engaging. The class benefited from splitting into smaller sections for discussion (we started this about halfway through) so switching the whole class to this format would be an imporvement.",
                "I appreciated how the readings were fascinating but never particularly long. I only wish the lectures, which were super informative, were extended, and the presentation\/discussion time, which wasn't always all that engaging, was reduced. I also enjoyed the guest speakers and would have liked to hear from more!",
                "This was one of my favorite classes at Yale. This course had many strengths. I enjoyed the structure of the class: weekly discussion posts reflecting the readings and the lecture\/student presentation format of each class. Both Professor Kim and John were very educated in this field and taught each class with enthusiasm and integrity. I can't think of any weaknesses of this course.",
                "I really liked how to course was split into a lecture half and a discussion half. It never felt like students didn't have a chance to speak and, at the same time, I felt like Professor Kim and John were both able to share their knowledge with us fairly abundantly. The class split into two separate discussion groups towards the end of the semester. Although the discussions did feel more intimate, I personally preferred the larger group setting; after the split, I found myself wondering what the other students were discussing in the other room and what they might say about some of the questions that were posed during student presentations.",
                "Strengths: Knowledgeable, passionate, and caring instructors; broad selection of reading across faith, philosophical, and religious traditions in Korea; robust overlaps with other classes in East Asian Studies particularly with reference to the three teachings from China\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Better management of large class sizes would have been preferable; greater depth of engagement with different strands of religious thought may have been better; breadth of the scope of the class meant that the overall themes of the class could get muddled or lost",
                "Strengths: Professor Kim was such an enthralling lecturer and the readings were incredibly fascinating.",
                "I think this class is great. It's very welcoming to all majors and you honestly learn so much even if you know nothing about the topic.",
                "One of the main strengths was the reading content for the course. This is genuinely one of the few Yale courses where I was actually excited to complete the weekly readings\/media assignments and personally reflect on it. The discussion afterwards, aided by the course's structural format also allowed me to gain new perspectives and spark conversations that were constructive towards personal reflection.",
                "strength: levels of engagement from students was high, liked that it wasn't an atmosphere where you were pressured to talk, which i think made the discussions more engaging\r\nalso liked the format of the course, as it was both a lecture and discussion",
                "I thought this course was incredibly strong. Classes were structured in an engaging format, and all the readings were really interesting. I would say that splitting up the class halfway through the semester did improve things because this is a very discussion-oriented class. However, that split led us to miss out on both professors' input, so it's a give and take situation.",
                "The readings were interesting. Student presentations sometimes felt tedious though and I would have liked to hear from the professor more.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings, weekly reading responses, format of the class was really helpful (half lecture, half student discussion)\r\nWeaknesses: there was more time for discussion after we split the class into half, and I think a smaller class size was more engaging",
                "Strengths: John and Professor Kim were both always engaging lecturers, happy to answer questions and effective in leading discussion. I also thought the readings were well-selected, and that the lectures did a good job supplementing the reading with historical context, additional facts and further questions to consider.",
                "Strengths: Amazing professor, super interesting readings, enlightening discussions, fun assignments, structured in a way that's incredibly thought provoking, awesome lectures\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: Professor Kim and John were always so open to questions and comments. I always felt comfortable speaking up in the class and offering my own opinion. They respected every student, and they truly wanted to hear from everybody.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had split the classroom into two classes sooner! I thought splitting the classroom definitely helped with student engagement."

                "I definitely would recommend this course. I'm sure it's more engaging if you're religious\/Korean but I still feel like it very much impacted me and was a great course to take while beginning my college experience and growing as a person.",
                "Yes, because you get to learn a lot about religion, history, and culture in Korea in a very engaging and fun way with friends. Readings are interesting too.",
                "YES YES YES YES professor Kim is everything.",
                "Yes I would! This course is very enlightening, especially because my family is from South Korea and I wanted to learn more about my ethnic culture.",
                "Absolutely. The class is very easy but very engaging. Prof. Kim is a great instructor and his insights alone are worth taking the class. Bonus points if you are interested in Korea or East Asia.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in an introduction to religious studies, Korean history\/culture, or both! Prof. Kim is so cool, I am glad I took a class with him. I do think class time could have been organized better. But all in all, if you are looking for a low-workload class and the topic interests you, go for it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to every student at Yale, regardless of their major. This course was very unique and eye-opening. Each week's reading was followed by a deep, honest, and intellectually challenging conversation about religion.",
                "Yes!!!",
                "Yes! Although religion isn't talked about too heavily among Yale's general student body, you realize in this course how deeply involved elements of religion are in our day to day lives and the institutions that we live among. If you are interested in learning more about Korea as a country\/Korean politics\/Korean society, this course might especially be a good fit, as I now find it hard to not mention the role of religion in modern Korea's sociopolitical engagements.",
                "Yes. Excellent introduction not only to the religious landscape of Korea but, by extension of religion's imbrication in Korea's political, economic, and social life, a valuable introduction to Korea at large. Beyond the expertise and passion of the instructors, guest speakers and lecturers were excellent and insightful.",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in the content. It is set up with low workload, so you can get what you want out of the class.",
                "Yes, this course is great. It makes you invested even if this is not a topic you are particularly interested in.",
                "Yes!! This was the course I spent all semester raving to my friends about-- Even if you're not from an East Asian background, and especially if you are one, I think the course is an amazing opportunity to open the doors to cultural discovery that we never learn about from the Eurocentric historical perspective. It's genuinely so thought provoking and interesting, and at times heartfelt.",
                "yes! even if one doesn't have much knowledge or background about Korea, this course is still valuable to take and learn",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to gain a deeper standing of Korean culture, religion, or both. Even if you're not an East Asian Studies or Religious studies major, this is a really amazing course to take--particularly if you're in need of a Humanities credit.",
                "Yes, the professor is great!",
                "Yes!!! I highly recommend taking this course, especially if you want to explore your own relationship with religion and spirituality. While the course does not directly deal with personal beliefs, it provides the knowledge and skills you need to develop your own outlook on these topics. I also feel a lot more connected with my Korean heritage and feel more knowledgeable about Korean and religious history. The workload demand is not high, but it is incredibly rewarding. Professor Kim is also wonderful to work with.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! Not only did I learn a lot about Korean religion and culture, but I got the opportunity to reflect on my personal relationship with religion in interesting and thought-provoking ways.",
                "100% you should take this essay if you have the time. It is probably the best class that I have ever taken. It's enlightened me a lot about how I perceive the world through a Western lens, breaking down preconceptions that I've held about religion, recontextualizing history and my own beliefs. If you have the opportunity, please take this course! Professor Kim is amazing, and John was awesome as well.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to students who have never gotten the chance to study religion in an academic setting! Professor Kim is very knowledgeable about pretty much every religion. He is so open to discussion, and you will get so much out of this course if you put a lot of effort into it!",
                "Yes! Professor Kim is the absolute best. He is kind, supportive, and really cares about his students' learning. This course changed how I view religion and everyday life."
