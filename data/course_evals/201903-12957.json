    "I learned a great deal about film music and was inspired with a newfound passion to watch many more movies in my life.",
    "I learned about the history of cinema, the role music played from the conception of film, and the process contemporary composers use to score films.",
    "I learned a great deal about the history of film and music by taking this course, arguably more than I have learned in any other class at Yale. Though I expected to learn about film music specifically, a surprising side effect was that I learned a great deal about film history I hadn't known before.",
    "Critical listening to many different genres of music; in-depth critical viewing of cinema; identifying common movie score and storytelling techniques; reading (very dense) scholarly sources and picking out the bits of info relevant to the course; conducting research and writing a paper summarizing it",
    "Knowledge about music history in film and a new perspective on films in general!"

   "comments": [
    "It was a good class. Lectures were a bit unstructured or repetitive at points, but Mauceri always brought it back around.",
    "The strength is definitely Professor Mauceri: he's the kind of person who casually refers to John Williams on a first-name basis. He's an incredibly interesting lecturer, and the highlight of the class was definitely Howard Shore's visit, as well as Skype calls with Danny Elfman and Austin Wintory. The course did feel pretty disorganized, though: there was very little explanation of the final project\/ paper, no one knew when deadlines were, etc.",
    "Professor Mauceri is a great lecturer, and made the course fascinating through its selection of films and readings as well as the lectures. Overall, I loved it. I think that one downside is that there wasn't a great deal of synthesis between the lectures and the outside of class materials. Additionally, it was supposed to be a seminar, so I think that a greater level of in-class engagement would have been helpful, but I loved the lectures so much that it didn't really matter. Also, it was incredible that Professor Mauceri made it possible to speak with real, professional, and very successful film and media composers.",
    "Improved by adding more seminar elements like perhaps a student online forum; setting up more discussion and sharing between students",
    "Amazing content; amazing professor. Every class was a gem.\r\nWould have liked more peer interaction and discussion."

    "It's a cool class. Prof. Mauceri is awesome and a total expert in the field - really depends on whether you like his lecture style.",
    "Yes, and you don't need to have a deep background in music or film to take it!",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course. I learned so much, and became incredibly fascinated with the material through the course of the class and especially through the final projects.",
    "Yes!! Wonderful set-up, fun assignments, and incredibly interesting content",
    "Yes! Super fun, amazing lectures."
