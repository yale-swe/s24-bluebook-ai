We started by developing the theory of affine plane curves: algebraic sets, varieties, coordinate rings, local rings etc. Then proceeded to affine intersection theory to roughly finish the first half of the course. After that projective varieties were introduced and corresponding theory was developed. The big results from the class were the Bezout theorem and Riemann-Roch. This class helped me see the power of algebraic structures in describing geometries of curves.",

I think this course should include modern as a prerequisite, although you can take it without, if youre willing to stretch yourself a bit or just assume some results without complete understanding.\r\n\r\nThat saidthe grading is super fair, the professor is really knowledgeable and encouraging, every class had its full notes posted on Canvas afterward so you could review them, and we generally followed the textbook pretty closely, so you could consult that if you got too lost.\r\n\r\nThat said,"

Not the highest workload (definitely not as intense as something like 305 with Minsky or 350 with Miki) but very rewarding. I walked out having learned stuff which cannot always be said about classes in the math dept.",
