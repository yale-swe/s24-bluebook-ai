    "DS helped me grapple with difficult philosophy texts, improve my writing and interpersonal speaking skills, and increase reading fluency and speed.",
    "I learned about the major movements, thinkers, and works of modern Western philosophy. This class taught me how to analyze these texts and reconstruct the arguments.",
    "how to engage modern philosophy, a sufficient understanding of modern philosophers and the major contesting philosophies of the day, a critical reading of the text and growth in understanding of its meaning",
    "Early modern to 20th century philosophy, essay writing, philosophical analysis",
    "I learned a lot about different philosophical schools which I hadn't known before."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Darwall was very eager to help us understand the demanding subject at hand. We learned so much about the history of modern philosophy, but its clear that DS teaches a little about a lot rather than a lot about a little. Thats ok though, I still think DS was such an amazing investment in my intellectual career.",
    "The syllabus for this course is extremely strong: among all the DS courses I found this syllabus to be the most consistent.  What I disliked about this course was the philosophy lectures that tended to either give a poor summary of the work in question or focus on a single part of the text, instead of giving an overarching view of the works message and its implications for Western thought in general.  This problem was also present in sections, where it felts like our only goal was to understand arguments that were disconnected from the overall message of the work.  A more focused direction to the course would have been helpful.",
    "Strengths: covered the major modern philosophers, felt logically organized and sequential in readings, gained a working understanding of the major philosophers as much as one can given the amount of readings and time given for the course \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Iris Murdock and Simone de Beauvoir (and Kierkegaard to some extent) did not seem to fit in with the \"core\" philosophy readings, especially since we missed Locke, Leibniz, Fichte, and several other influential philosophers who seem to be more influential in the field",
    "The syllabus is clearly designed to encourage students to make connections between texts and analyze a linear development of philosophy from Descartes to Murdoch. I also appreciated the way the final exam itself is a learning process and helps students synthesize their understanding of different texts. The sheer breadth of the course made me feel at times that we were overlooking certain philosophers and lacked the time to discuss whole chunks of our readings. I also would have enjoyed a more centralized section structure to ensure that we covered necessary arguments within each text, which I think DS philosophy requires more than the other DS courses."

    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely! You wont regret taking DS, and your decision to take second semester solidifies and completes your adventures in western intellectual tradition.",
    "I would recommend this course as a good intro to philosophy, but because it is part of DS it depends on more than the students interest only in philosophy.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class as a great intro to modern philosophy course (knowing full well that you will cover more philosophers at the expense of covering deeper philosophy) (a tradeoff which I think suites the course perfectly)",
    "Yes! In conjunction with the other DS courses, DS Philosophy has given me so much insight into the intertextuality within the Western canon. I even find myself applying ideas from this course to my daily life.",
    "I loved Directed Studies as a whole, so yes."
