                "Learning about basics of the law in Spanish, with focus on law in spain and other Spanish speaking countries.",
                "I learned a lot in Legal Spanish! I barely knew anything about the topics covered in class, even in English! I loved the structure of our biweekly classes - in our Tuesday class, we were lectured on a specific legal topic, and then in our Thursday class, we discussed the podcast and articles we'd been assigned for homework. I learned a lot about current events in Latin America!",
                "I already spoke Spanish fluently before this course since it was my first language, but after moving to the U.S. I only ever really used it to talk to my parents, so I had a hard time writing and speaking formally. This class was great for improving in that regard, aside from the raw practice, Professor Carreras always made sure to check all of our assignments pretty thoroughly.",
                "Learned lots about Hispanic culture through social political and economic events and reforms, etc.",
                "I gained basic insights about legal terms and concepts in Spanish ranging from the concept of a constitution to the meaning of crime.",
                "The course does a great job delving into the different facets of Roman civil law legal systems (ex. contracts, constitutions, the sources for laws, etc.). Although there is not as much of an emphasis on grammar, the weekly assignments and in-class discussions helped improve my written and spoken Spanish. Additionally, the weekly assignments offered insight into pertinent current events in the Spanish speaking world.",
                "I learned some legal vocabulary and basic legal framework. There is also a large focus on current events in Latin America and Spain. Since there's a lot of busy work for this class, you get quicker at writing in Spanish."

                "I appreciated the small class size because it fostered an environment of engagement and participation. I got to know my peers and also Profe Carreras!",
                "The relatively small class size and class discussions made for both a great opportunity to think about how I talk in Spanish, and also created a slight sense of community. I also enjoyed the up-to-date podcasts\r\nOne slight improvement I would have liked is being able to turn in work digitally. Although it doesn't take much effort or money to do so, having to stop by a printer every time work was due made for yet another thing to keep track of, and it forced me to carry a binder for only this class, since every other class I took this semester was practically paper-free.",
                "Strengths: it was not centered on the US concepts of law and focused on Latin America and Spain which helped gain a broader perspective\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the homework assignments were extremely long ranging from 30 to 40 podcast questions on top of summaries and article reviews. However, Profesora was very understanding when it was a busier week with midterms and made some exceptions to help with the workload. All my Spanish professors at Yale had a Latin American accent, so it did take a few weeks to get used to the Spain accent.",
                "The type of work assigned weekly is consistent and you know what to expect. However, how time consuming the different weekly assignments are can vary greatly. Some of the homework podcasts can feel like busy work and the amount of questions asked makes it difficult to work on listening comprehension, as you have to pause the podcast frequently. Overall, the class provides a comprehensive overview of the Roman civil law legal systems found in various Spanish speaking countries. Additionally, the structure of the class provides students with several different methods to improve their Spanish skills via in-class discussion, writing assignments, and the use of videos and podcasts.",
                "There is a good balance of legal teaching and real-world events coverage. However, there is a lot of busy work assigned that can be heavy at some weeks. Mercedes is really flexible though if you tell her you couldn't complete all the work for the week."

                "Yes, great professor. Really interesting",
                "Yes, great course for understanding basic legal concepts in Spanish and having a space for open conversation!",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend if you are interested in learning about the legal systems in Spanish speaking countries. The course provides you with a solid foundation in the reasoning and structure of Roman law legal systems. Additionally, the class expands your vocabulary to incorporate more legal terms.",
                "Yes, if you're at all interested in pursuing a legal career or want to improve your writing on a weekly basis. However, this is not a light workload Spanish credit, although the course is not that intellectually difficult, so if you're just looking to complete your language requirement, this might not be for you.",
