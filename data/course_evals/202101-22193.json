Alongside the improvement in my writing, which was facilitated by Professor Soles' constructive and helpful feedback, we discussed the themes of memory, nature, meaning, knowledge and more through the array of texts we read in DS literature.

While in high school, it was all about discussing certain broad themes, this year, I learned about how awesome and valuable close reading can be as a means to understanding a text. I think that DS lit has definitely demanded (as well as allowed for) a certain amount of creativity more than any of my other DS classes; I felt like I was able to look at a text and actually come up with something new and entirely my own!",

                "Strengths: Professor Soles was my favorite professor of my entire first year at Yale. Not only was he incredibly passionate and knowledgable about the subject material, he truly cared about each and every one of us. He always strived to make class fun and interesting (even in his paper prompts, which included a series about a magical genie) and understood the various unique challenges this year presented both academically and mentally. He hosted a space for us to be together in the wake of tragedy and adapted whenever we needed a break. I felt particularly attached to this class and always looked forward to discussions rather than dreading getting on a zoom. I also felt that Professor Soles connected each of the pieces together even whenever I felt as if the connection between each of the works on the syllabus didn't seem to feel cohesive. He was also very flexible on submission times on papers, which took some of the pressure off and helped me to actually spend more time on each paper. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Overall DS gripes (lots of works, not enough time, large workload, still a considerable lack of diversity) were persistent. I also do not think that a timed exam (and this goes for all three classes) is a great way to measure our learning in this course. For example, (although I have yet to take the exam) our exam will be writing one or two essays in a three hour period. Considering we do not use timed writing anywhere within this course, I feel as if it is not an accurate measure of our knowledge. In addition, I felt as if this semester's works did not feel super connected. Last semester, there was an intense focus on greek tragedy, ancient life, religion\/belief etc. This semester's connection was not as obvious and sometimes felt random (although like I stated above I think that Soles did an excellent job of trying to establish those connections). None of the weaknesses have to do with Soles as a professor.",
                "strengths - amazing staff, great content, insightful discussions\r\nweaknesses - workload, definitely became difficult to manage at times",
                "Strengths: Although the readings were heavy (as per the nature of DS) my section drew connections across the curriculum routinely so it felt as if the texts were in a conversation with one another which helped ameliorate the breadth of the syllabus. The feedback I got from my professor was in depth and constructive; I felt that I was able to grow as a writer and thinker. My close reading skills became much stronger and my professor routinely incorporated poetry into our class which often sparked new insights into a theme we were discussing. The seminar environment in my section was vibrant, supportive, and engaging despite the virtual format - so much so that we joked that the world wasn't quite ready for our section to meet in person because of the energy and enthusiasm of our discussions. I also found myself more engaged and interested in the literature spring syllabus with Don Quixote, Racine, To The Lighthouse, and Omeros.\r\nWeaknesses: At times the pacing was fast and the reading heavy, however this is true for the style of DS. Literature was my favorite track of DS both semesters so I do not have as many DS literature specific weaknesses.",
                "great books, not a lot of time - typical of DS",
                "I'm not sure there really were any weaknesses. I thought the course was wonderful, and I enjoyed it greatly.",
                "This course is excellent. Professor Soles is an amazing teacher, and I greatly enjoyed class dicussions.",
                "Weaknesses: Not enough time to read all the texts assigned; such long readings!!\r\n\r\nStrengths: Fascinating, beautiful texts; wonderful instructor; excellent writing advice and office hours"

Professor Soles is an incredible professor and I felt supported, challenged, and engaged throughout the entire semester which helped me find my voice in seminar and helped me become a better writer. The texts in DS literature paired well with the texts in the fall and by the time we read Omeros it felt as if our class had come full circle - while acknowledging the ways literary traditions had changed and remained the same.",

                "Yes! As with all DS classes, there is of course the caveat that you should only take it if you are genuinely interested in the subject matter. But for anyone who is, I found DS lit to be an extraordinarily rich experience, and I especially loved the works that we got to read second semester!",
                "Definitely - everyone should take DS! Professor Soles is amazing and provides detailed feedback.",
