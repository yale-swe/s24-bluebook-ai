    "I learned a lot about working within Maya for 3D modeling. I learned good workflows when modeling.",
    "I got exposure to a number of incredible types of software and technology that I can now use for my future artistic endeavors. I feel less intimidated by tech-art and VR, which is a great feeling! I also learned to always stay conscious and considerate of the hidden implications of these new technologies.",
    "Basic understanding of 3D modeling, unity, and creative applications in VR and mixed reality",
    "some basic modeling knowledge",
    "I learned how to 3D model in Maya, program in Unity, and use VR. I got to use VR, which was cool. Moreover, I got to think a lot about 3D modeling as a medium and how to use it best, what it means, how it can affect our world, what issues it brings up, and what useful things come from it too. I learned how to think about a new medium of art too and what it means to have a new art medium.",
    "I learned an introduction to Maya and Unity software. I also became more familiar with 3D printing and other resources in the CCAM.",
    "Skills to model anything in 3D confidently and discuss topics of VR."

   "comments": [
    "It is very informative as far as basic information. It did delve into far more art theory than I felt was necessary, especially when it took away entire class times to do so.",
    "The freedom of exploration in this course was invaluable. That being said, the course had no structure or syllabus which was also very frustrating and actively made class time unproductive and repetitive. Thus, it was motivation for students to skip and arrive very late every class, and it seemed to go without issue. We were left mostly all on our own to figure out how to do the assignments, some of which required extremely difficult to get equipment for their completion, causing some confusion and undue stress. I think if there was more structure, we could have gotten a lot more done and gotten a lot more comfortable with the technology we used. Our class critiques were too broad and meta - we discussed the possibilities and limitations of this technology in general (which is still an important topic) but never addressed the strengths or weakness of our own pieces or their concepts much at all, which felt demoralizing and like I could have better used my time that I had devoted to thinking though how to execute my projects. If the critiques had a more directed format that would have been very helpful. I don't regret taking the course and I think that it has a lot of potential to be incredible - it just needs tightening up.",
    "A tad disorganized but good material",
    "It was the worst organized class I have ever taken.",
    "The course was very interesting and I learned an amazing skill that I will definitely take with me into the professional world. The assignments were enjoyable; the class offered a great platform to learn the programs, and the crits were a great time to think about it the medium. At times, the course felt unorganized, which I didnt hate, but I wished we would have kept to a stricter schedule. I also wished we learned other programs, as well.",
    "The strengths were that our projects were independently chosen and motivated projects so we were allowed to truly explore what we were interested in. Justin made an effort to make sure we were doing a project we were passionate about.\r\nThe weakness was that this was the most unorganized class I've ever taken. \r\nThe professor should use Canvas more consistently and communicate better with the class. Our TA was also not particularly knowledgable and didn't join our class until a couple of weeks into the semester.",
    "Good pace and mix of structured requirements with self-learning\/exploring."

   "comments": [
    "I would as far as learning the basics of Maya and some Unity. I might not though if they arent willing to learn a lot about art theory.",
    "I would recommend it if the student is highly self motivated and wants to have the opportunity to explore new technology, but I think that student could get the exact same experience in a much more efficient fashion from visiting the CCAM during their free time and asking questions of the (amazing) faculty who are all very excited about and receptive to student engagement.",
    "If you want course credit for learning 3D stuff sure",
    "Do not take this course. It is all over the place. The plan for the semester was ditched in the beginning and was improvised which meant we often did nothing.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn how to 3D model, to use VR, and to think critically about a new medium of art, and how to meaningfully use the medium.",
    "Do not take this class if your sole mission is to learn this software.\r\nFor the average student taking 9 classes during one year at Yale, each class is worth about 6,000 dollars. \r\nIf what you want is to really learn how to use this 3D modeling software, there are plenty of online programs that are much more affordable and more effective. With your leftover money, you could buy a top-end computer and maybe a VR headset too. \r\nJustin uses a significant amount of class time discussions which can be exciting but can often turn into excessive rambling.",
    "Yes"
