                "Strengths: Professor Levine was an incredible instructor and it's clear how much she enjoys talking about and analyzing these poets and their poetry. The readings she selected for the seminar were diverse (which is super refreshing and awesome to see!), engaging, and helped us trace a clear historical arc, from Pope to Trethewey. The poems selected were also just in general really interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: There's A LOT of poetry, which is to be expected; the problem is that we often don't get through much of it in class. It'd probably be helpful to focus on certain poems over a lot of poems, but honestly, this is a minor complaint.",
                "Wonderful syllabus with a wonderful professor!",
                "I'm not sure that there were any weaknesses! I always enjoyed going to seminar, where I feel that we engage with the material deeply and in a way that both encouraged engagement and broadened my perspective",
                "Strengths: Improved diversity of poets from previous iterations of this course, variation of assignments (some creative writing of poems, some papers with diverse prompts), very manageable readings for homework, interesting discussion, good feedback on assignments.\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion structured relatively the same each day, which was helpful to know what to expect, but sometimes a bit repetitive; sometimes the discussion questions were a bit too leading, but overall a great class.",
                "Professor Levine is a direct asset to the course and makes material that would normally be intimidating seem manageable and engaging."
