No one knows what goes on in class because normally the topic is something weird on which there's like one paper about. The homeworks are literally broken and you can't do them. This class has a lot of potential in terms of content (deep learning is a hot topic) but this class is not worth it currently.",
                "The course teaches concepts at a high level, which is nice for those who have less of a math background. The course staff are helpful and generous with accommodating student needs. One weakness might be that while the lectures were high level, the class assignments required implementing the concepts, often without examples or guidance other than broad documentation of the coding library, which made some problems difficult.",
                "good",
                "strengths are that we learn about all the main current deep learning models, weakness is that it can be hard to follow sometimes",
                "Can incorporate more coding instructions to fill some knowledge gap that may exist.",
                "The TAs did not show up to office hours.  The assignments were very poorly organized, and the last one had to be extended several weeks.  They took far too long for terrible reasons - the packages would not install, or we could not figure out how to use some new library that we were never taught.",
                "More organization for the course would be appreciated",
                "Overall poor course design and dry lectures. Smita is a bad lecturer despite her prowess in the field. Psets were poorly designed and infrequent",
                "The course was really good in getting my feet wet in the subject, however as someone who is not a computer science person it was very difficult to get immersed in the subject. I believe those who were computer scientists/ statistical people also had a difficult time with the course. The pace was very harrowing, but I think the real weakness, I am sorry to say, is with the instructor as I was not very engaged in a subject that would otherwise be very engaging and did not feel that she was very passionate about the subject or approachable. The housekeeping piece and organization was also, unfortunately chaotic.",
                "Course covers a lot of interesting topics. But the homework could be more organized and helpful.",
                "I think this course is currently functioning as two courses at once, and it would be better experienced as a sequence of two courses, where the first is a survey course of deep learning methods and the second is a graduate research seminar where students work on a project for the majority of the term.",
                "the content of the lectures is great and smita is an amazing professor",
                "While the content taught in class was super interesting and useful, the PSETs got harder and harder, and pset 3 felt almost unreasonable for what it asked of us. It took so long that it cut into time that couldve been spent on the final project, and I didnt feel like I gained much out of that assignment.",
                "To me this course is great. There's no significant flaw.",
                "I found the last problem set to be frustrating and somewhat disorganized.",
                "The course covered a wide range of topics in neural networks, which initially seemed promising. However, the lecturers attempted to cover too much material within a limited time frame. As a result, many important details and practical applications were skipped, making it difficult to obtain a basic understanding of the subject merely through the lectures. I had to read and supplemental materials to fill in the gaps. \r\n\r\nWhile the first two assignments were well-designed and aided in digesting the course materials and applying theoretical concepts to practical exercises, the same cannot be said for the third assignment. It seemed to have been assigned without thorough reviewing. \r\n\r\nThe class would have been better if it had been administered in a more organized and effective manner. Particularly regarding the third assignment, the TFs and ULAs were unable to provide adequate assistance. I don't believe it was entirely their fault, as they did make an effort to help within their means.  The class topics indeed required a graduate-level understanding. I think it would be the responsibility of the instructor to adequately train their staff members.",
                "Course pace is too fast, the mathematics are not well explained.",
                "One weakness of the course it was that i did not see code lectures. Also, the content it was so wide and difficult.",
                "The overview of topics is great. I loved learning about all the different methods. A fun addition to the lectures would be a couple of examples of how each method/architecture has been used across a variety of fields.\r\n\r\nThe final project is a great part of this course, allowing students the opportunity to experiment with these methods.\r\n\r\nThe homeworks were well-structured for learning and I appreciated getting to try out so many different things. However, the third homework was difficult to manage. Perhaps breaking this homework into a few smaller assignments--or even assigning one problem at a time (maybe one per week) as each topic is covered in class would make it easier to work through these problems and help ensure maximum potential learning.",
                "Strengths: Covers a lot of ground, and builds the theory well (ie you should understand what actually happens inside NNs at the end of this course, which allows for building better models and better debugging)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The course is quite inconsistent in terms of the maths required. At some points its moderate, at others, considerable. This is particularly the case for Graph NNs, Neural ODEs, and some of the later material  on GANs. The course could do with some more support here, for example, preliminary notes that walk through the maths more slowly, or more dedicated time in recitations. (Aside: recitations were a good concept and I attended a few, but they tended to be mere repetitions of course content. They would be better as in depth, slow preparatory maths / theory primers for the upcoming material).\r\n- The assignments are super applied and practical (good). However, little time is dedicated in class to practical implementation of NNs. Eg, we learn the loss function for a GAN, but not how this is implemented (ie creating a tensor of zeroes and inputting this to the loss function). Instead, I was left googling somewhat aimlessly to work out how to actually implement the model architecture. It would be helpful to reduce theoretical content somewhat and focus more in class on exactly how to implement the NNs. \r\n- more broadly, there was a need for ongoing support in PyTorch and its functionality. The primer was good, but I certainly didnt become an expert, and was often googling somewhat aimlessly to complete assignments (again, on how to implement).\r\n- Finally, as was noted during the course, the final assignment made use of a large number of new and not fully stable packages. For a course such as this id prefer to stick to one package, even if it has less functionality (eg even if we need to use a gradient tape and code the forward / backward step manually,  rather than relying on some black box package to do this).\r\n- Finally finally, the final project ended up being good for our group, but Im not sure the idea of each group choosing its own topic with relatively light guidance was ideal. It ended up leading to a lot of time scouring for data sources and doing lots of data cleaning, and while I got good at project management, only a minority of our project was the NN part. A better option would be to provide an (almost) ready dataset and a possibly difficult research question or set of questions to implement on it. This would have allowed us to focus more on the NN part.",
                "Strengths: Focus is open-ended and expectations are relaxed, which is a must since sometimes newly-updated neural net modules we're supposed to use just don't work (and haven't yet been fixed)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures went WAY too fast; programming projects were buggy and too separate from class material",
                "I think this course is very content heavy, and the content is very recent and updated, which is good given how fast the field of machine learning is going. However, sometimes the content feels too fast and not well explained, so the understanding of the content is more limited than I would like.",
                "Strengths\r\n- Very in depth, few things were left untouched\r\n- Lots of hands on programming problems, this was one of the best parts of this course. Very little hand holding, I feel confident in my ability to pursue future ML projects on my own.\r\n- Recorded lectures were very helpful for studying!\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- Some homework problems referred to ideas which had very little documentation (The Neural ODEs problem)\r\n- Often possible to solve the homework problem without actually understanding what was happening (like the \"just shove it into the pile of linear algebra\" xkcd comic). When time was tight, I admittedly sometimes resorted to this. More short answer problems might help this?\r\n- Having more, smaller assignments would have been nice. It was easy to procrastinate, and nearly everyone waited until the last week/week and a half to start, resulting in office hour pile ups around deadlines. Also, the large assignments combined lots of different topics, so it would have made sense to have them be their own assignments.\r\n\r\n\r\nArea for improvement: This course should have more perquisites listed. In particular, MATH 241/242 (Probability Theory and Statistics) and MATH 246 (Ordinary Differential Equations) were assumed to be learned for some topics, and they were absolutely needed to understand things. Listing an analysis class such as MATH 255 would also not be unwarranted, and would be helpful for parts of the class",
                "The course was slightly disorganized with the structure of the problem sets and lack of communication between the teaching staff and students. The lectures also felt slightly rushed.",
                "Strength: Professor Krishnaswamy is incredibly kind and supportive.\r\nWeakness: However, I do feel her lecturing style could be improved. It was hard to follow at times and I found she went through some topics too quickly when it would make sense to take more time to understand the foundationals.",
                "Well structured in theory but deficient in execution. Homework tend to have little to do with course materials, and it is taught in a way that is very difficult to handle for someone who hasn't had been exposed to deep learning.",
                "The homework is a bit difficult",
                "The assignments are good, but a relatively hard to complete based on what we learned in lectures. Maybe provide more demo codes might help.",

                "I think this course is wonderful. I learned a lot.",
                "The strength of the course is that the homeworks are very engaging and helpful during future applications. However, one weakness is that the lecture does not really help with the homework, so students have to spend a lot of time doing it."

This course would be enjoyable for those who already have experience in this field.",

                "No, the course load is too high, while the instructor does not emphasize on teaching the topics properly. Multiple knowledge gaps were unaddressed. Apart from some of these concerns, I feel that the assignments were designed really well and nudged us to learn more independently. I learned a lot from this course and will continue to apply some of the learnt topics in my projects.",
                "Maybe you can learn a lot, but the commitment and hours requires to do so are out of proportion with the reward.",
                "Yes, it was a fun class with a reasonable workload",
                "I would, on the condition that it improves the way the course staff has promised. The fundamental problem with this class at the moment is that deep learning theory has exploded so much as a field that fitting it all into a single course is no longer possible. The sheer amount of content that was in every single lecture made it really hard to actually absorb any of it, and the programming projects felt really distant from what we were talking about in class. Specifically, we would go over something at a really high level in lecture, only to be later forced to using those building blocks in a much lower level Python implementation, using packages we had never used before (and often had bugs in them due to their constantly being updated across the world). Smita is a great person to be teaching this class - she has the requisite knowledge and personal compassion to be an amazing professor - I'm just afraid that at the moment she is more research-oriented than teaching-oriented. This was made obvious when her slides were way too verbose and often spent more time talking about recent research developments than hammering home the mathematical theory necessary to actually understand everything. In the future, I'd recommend that this class be divided into three courses, with the first one following the mathematical theory presented in the textbooks (we didn't follow the textbooks too closely, but I think they're an excellent roadmap for someone with math and CS background to get started with deep learning), the second one being more programming-intensive as an introduction to implementing all the theory using the NN packages, and the third one being a deep dive into recent research. I truly believe deep learning is that big of a field that such a transformation will be beneficial in the long run. I also have hope that the staff (especially Sumner, who was always open to feedback) will read these reviews and use them to improve the course - after all, it is a class on learning from training algorithms and loss functions, and they are all committed to being true to the philosophy of the course and the field.",
                "I would recommend if you are prepared to do a lot of self studying. There is so much content that there is not enough to explain all of the math/ideas behind them so you will have to review the slides. Otherwise, I would recommend this to anyone that wants to get a deep (pardon the pun) dive onto deep learning",
