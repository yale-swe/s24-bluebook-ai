    "strength: Profesor reymundi was excellent and seemed to love what she does despite teaching the same thing 3 times a day 5 days a week\r\n\r\nweakness: workload is a burden each week, moves very fast, by the end I was honestly just trying to get by and finish the class since I'm done with language after this",
    "The online homework was helpful, and having so many repasos to study for the exams was extremely beneficial.",
    "strengths are that you read a lot in spanish and become more connected with the culture, weakness is that it moves very quickly and is easy to fall behind",
    "Lisette is a really nice woman and good teacher. I think this course was well taught, I just really dislike Spanish so I didn't enjoy it. It was definitely strongest when we were reading stories and having discussions about them because it made you think critically about what you were reading. The times when we just had to work on grammar worksheets were really boring.",
    "The strengths are the repition the course requires in the learning process and a weakness would be an excessive amount of reading.",
    "Strengths: clear instruction and time to speak the language"

    "Yes, the class very thoroughly teaches the language in an engaging manner.",
    "yes it is a good way to learn spanish if you already have some knowledge on the language. it is a lot of grammar review",
    "Yes, if you're genuinely looking to improve your Spanish. If you just need it for the requirement the workload may seem less worthwhile",
    "If you love Spanish or need to take it for distributional requirements I guess.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes I feel I became a much better Spanish speaker",
    "I would recommend this course because it helped improve my Spanish and taught me about other cultures."
