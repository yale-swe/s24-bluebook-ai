I learned to think about musical theater more critically -- one of my favorite classes was when we discussed the merits of famous musicals, and what could be deleted from them. It was a great exercise in editing, and it is a skill I will continue to use throughout my writing career.",

There was no definitive grading system, at least that the students were privy to. There was no reading or material to consume to further our learning, instead, we were undirected for the week until the next class.",
                "Access to Marsha is probably the best part of this course. She's a very unique figure and has many fascinating things to say about musicals, life, and theater.",

Without a great deal of time and individual drive, it's difficult to leave the class with a put-together piece.",
                "I would cautiously recommend this course. The homework is not often clear, and the lessons are sometimes unorganized, but Marsha is an amazing librettist.",
                "Yes, I think that if you need a 5th credit, this class is great. Low time commitment, you have fun with the professor, and it's a class to take for the Marsha experience.",
                "If you are interested in creating a work of musical theatre, then absolutely! This course was a great opportunity to focus on a creative project and receive constructive feedback. The classes were not very structured  every week, we would each be asked to provide an update on our show, whether that was a lyric, a scene, or an outline. I felt very motivated to create something new for every class and loved hearing the ideas\/projects of those around me.",
                "I found the course very helpful. It's not highly structured, which I liked and found helpful. I enjoyed the conversational explorations of our work and the weekly updates on everyone's personal projects."
