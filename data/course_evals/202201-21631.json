                "The biggest strength of the course was the class discord. It made communication with the professor\/peer tutors very easy. The problem sets were way too difficult, many of them were impossible without going to office hours and even then they were very hard. I felt that it was so difficult that I didn't have the time to learn and spent more time just trying to get the pset answers.  Some problems also didn't seem to follow from the lectures.",
                "Strengths: Discord server; office hours; clear, straightforward, and fair grading; take-home exams (as opposed to in-person); everything you need for hw and exams is in the lecture slides and the lectures. Weaknesses: none.",
                "- it was fun and solved particularly important problems in the field\r\n- however, it was too disorganized, there was not a clear schedule of things, exams were announced two weeks before, and usually homeworks only made you solve hard problems but never really master the basics.",
                "The class assumes a lot of previous knowledge, but the instructor does his best to make himself available to students in person.",
                "gave a good overview of the different topics in discrete math; seemed a bit disorganized",
                "Strengths: discord was helpful, engaging professor and ULA",
                "The course is well-organized and PPTs on all biweekly lectures are posted in Canvas, so you can easily reference them for PSETs. However, there is a steep difficulty curve between earlier and later PSETs, especially with regards to later HWs requiring more original and creative thought rather than reflecting direct concepts learned in lectures so be prepared! If you like creative problems and puzzles and especially proof writing, you will enjoy this class a lot - however, if proof writing or lack of lecture structure in PSETs is something that intimidates you, I recommend taking CS 202 instead which covers less discrete content and is noticeably easier. There are no direct weaknesses, but I do recommend find others to study with and\/or making use of office hours!",
                "Speaking as someone with no proof-based experience, the class has interesting material. It starts out in a somewhat accessible place, but the pace does pick up and office hours become critical to make up for intuitions that I simply wasnt able to develop fast enough.",

                "Yes! Since the really brutal evaluations from previous semester, it's clear that the professor has really upped their game and made all parts of the class more accessible, clear, and overall approachable. DO NOT go off by previous semester evaluations!! The course has been changed a lot in terms of shifting content around, difficulty, AND workload! A lot more doable than I expected. Math background and proof experience HIGHLY recommended. You might still be okay if you can pick up proof techniques quick but first few weeks might be brutal.",
                "yes, but only if he is prepared to get an overview of discrete math in a hard way",

                "Yes, very applicable concepts",

                "Yes, if you are especially math inclined or a proof-writing enthusiast, I think you will get a lot out of this course (note that the beginning few lectures are quite introductory and easy, but the content becomes more novel, diverse, and difficult throughout the semester). However, if you just want to learn the fundamentals of graph theory, have no proof background, and\/or want an easy A, I recommend taking CS 202 instead for the discrete math credit.",
                "Yes, very good foundation in graph theory and counting",
                "Yes, the content is interesting and relevant to the degrees that require, but expect a challenge and time investment.",
                "Yes, it is a relatively easy course without much work, and the material is interesting.",
                "It depends. I've hard that this course is much more manageable\/easier when a different professor teaches it, or during the summer with Cosmin. The material itself felt a bit dry \/ unsatisfying to learn, but that might just be my personal opinion. If you enjoy \"competition\" math or things like graphs, algorithms, and combinatorics then this might be the right course for you. Just know that you are taking the harder version of the class if you take it with Cosmin during the semester (although Cosmin himself is a super nice guy and very receptive his students' needs and concerns). The problem sets are very difficult so I would definitely recommend going to office hours. That said, they were only every two weeks and there were just 6 of them (and you get to drop one), and both midterms and the final were take-home. So overall, the class was more of a challenge conceptually than in terms of workload.",
                "Yes. It's a key course for CS majors because there are many related topics."
