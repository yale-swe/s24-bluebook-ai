                "Course is a really great way to not only learn about investigative reporting but work on some pieces ourselves and be able to speak with journalists who've been doing this type of work for years. I did feel like the timeline was hurried at time  two big investigative pieces in one semester when we all also had other class commitments did feel like too much, especially since we're also expected to revise at least one of them. I felt like the quality of my pieces suffered given the timeline.",
                "Strengths: You really do have to write to longform essays. While that was really difficult and often felt like a negative, I'm ultimately SO glad I did it. I now how two publishable pieces that I'm more proud of than just about any essay I've written at Yale. Doing is the best way to learn, and while Professor Stillman holds your hand through some of the process, it's really up to you to request information, conduct interviews, and write the damn thing. The workshops are also very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the discussions about other articles sometimes seemed superfluous to the workshop process, filling the 2.5hr time slot (which could be shortened).",
                "sarah stillman is incredible! its a great opportunity to have a reason to write and workshop longform pieces",
                "I loved this class. Prof. Stillman is an incredible and dedicated professor who is so generous with her time and mentorship. It's also a great way to work with talented writers/reporters from many different background. However, I did find that the two assignments were a lot of work it would be great to have focused on making one polished reporting piece throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Stillman is the most kind, compassionate, supportive, warm professor to walk this planet. I learned so much not just about writing, but also about teaching and about being a good person from her.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I thought the workshop format wasnt the MOST effective - we each wrote a 150word comment to each person whose draft was going to be workshopped, and a lot of the discussion in class was kind of repeating the somewhat surface level comments we already wrote. Could experiment with writing partners to edit more in depth, or small group discussions about pieces?",
                "Strengths: Professor Stillman and the amount of time she makes for students\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I didn't really know how to go about getting started on public records, etc., and feel presentations could have happened earlier in the course"

You get learn from Sarah Stillman who's an absolutely incredible reporter, and get to embark on two projects of your own. But I would recommend treating this class as your main commitment  otherwise, your pieces will suffer,",
                "If you're at all interested in investigative journalism, yes. There were some days where I was overwhelmed by the work I needed to do in this classit's more outside work than just about any seminar, and the pieces feel higher stakes because you're engaging with real people and intense subjects. I took this class while writing my thesis, and some days I had to ignore this class or my thesis to finish work in the other class. All of this being said, on the other side, I am so glad I took this class. I now have two publishable pieces, an incredible mentor in Stillman, and have learned so many of the basics for journalism.",
                "yes, fun class with good learning",
                "Yes! Absolutely! One of the best writing classes at Yale for sure.",
                "Id recommend if you dont have a lot of reporting experience. If you do, be prepared for the class to feel intro level, but youll get an amazing mentor and meet amazing classmates out of it.",
                "I would! I haven't met a professor more passionate and student-centered than Professor Stillman. It's a tough, demanding course, but you will always have friends who will relate to your troubles and joys.",
                "Definitely, if you're interested in justice oriented writing. Professor Stillman is an amazing person and the most incredible editor!"
