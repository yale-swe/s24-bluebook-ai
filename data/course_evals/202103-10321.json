It also helped shape my direction as a writer. I left the course with concrete ideas on where I could improve as a writer and what courses I might want to take to continue to improve.",
                "I developed practical tools to write research papers, and a knowledge and experience with Yale writing resources.",

                "Great class, super nice and supportive professor who truly wants you to learn.",
                "No weaknesses. Alison is an incredible teacher, the class environment is very communal and I made great friends in this class, and the assignments and readings are very helpful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Coleman is an amazing professor and her approaches to teaching and learning, such as through journaling, are very engaging and enjoyable! Weaknesses: None!",
                "A strength was that there was a lot of guidance in writing papers and helpful introductions to resources I used while writing my paper. A weakness was that sometimes there was a time crunch in submitting drafts but there was always enough time for revision of the final draft.",
                "The course was paced extremely well. The ideas we worked on developed well upon one another and continued to be important even in later assignments. Also, the seminar format of the class was beneficial, with interesting class discussions and group feedback on one another's writing.",
                "The strength is that Professor Coleman is incredibly kind, enthusiastic, and understanding and always willing to help any student as best as she can.",
                "Strengths of this course load is flexibility of assignments and the creative freedom we had with essays. It felt much easier to feel motivated to write when we were free to choose topics that we were passionate about and use creative approaches to prompts. \r\n\r\nSome weaknesses of the course were the slightly heavy workload. I found myself dedicating many hours to the course and feeling stressed about assignments. This could be improved with fewer small assignments.",
                "The strengths are that it was very engaging, and Professor Coleman created assignments that were not only helpful for learning but also fun.",
                "There was clear, helpful, detailed feedback on student writing during class, via Canvas, and during multiple 1-on-1 conferences, instructions and syllabus were laid out in advance and deadlines were clear to all. Multiple times, I felt we spent too long on a single topic or reading, as well as too long reviewing instructions for assignments in class. Most of our assignments dealt with breaking apart and analyzing the writing\/argument structure of an author writing, but often times, these pieces themselves were about how to write, which started to feel repetitive. The course did not assume prior knowledge of how to write and the components of an argument. which is something to be aware of. I think the course could be enriched by analyzing the writing\/argument structure of pieces that deal with other topics. More class discussions would also be great as this felt like the time when the members of the course were most engaged. It could also be useful and fun to discuss logical fallacies, to hold a debate, or to provide more assignments for students to practice persuasive writing and argumentation about interesting topics of the professor's or their choosing."

                "If you have the chance to take ENGL 114 with Professor Coleman, do it. She really cares about teaching and her students. Her feedback on our essays was so thorough and valuable.",
                "Yes, this course is extremely helpful in learning close reading and argument techniques.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to improve their writing skills and prose, or who seeks a greater understanding of the practice of writing. If you take this course, pay attention during lessons, give due consideration to feedback, and put effort into the assignments, you will become a stronger writer.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student looking for an easy class with little workload or challenge, but not to a student looking for stimuli or interesting class discussions.",
                "Yes, the course prepares students for future writing demands and teaches many useful skills. I feel much more prepared for future courses and feel very rewarded by the efforts I put into the course. My writing has been able to improve significantly in a short span of time. I would recommend this course to anyone who would like to improve their craft and become a compelling writer.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students. If you are a first-year this is. must take course. It lays the groundwork for academic writing that will be needed throughout college.",
                "Yes, depending on the student. If you are looking for a low-stress introductory writing and argumentation course that deals primarily with the structure and how-to of writing, this is the course for you. However, if you already have experience with the structure of writing, are looking for a fast-paced course, or are looking to learn\/read pieces about topics other than how to write, this may not be the class for you.",
                "Absolutely, if you need a freshman writing credit, I highly recommend this class. The teacher is amazing and you truly learn how to improve your writing, while writing about topics you are interested about."
