    "The only weakness I can think of is that the atmosphere in the class depends on the people who take it since it is always small. I was lucky to be with people who are all so wonderful and different, it was exciting to come to every lesson to see what everyone had to say. The strengths of the class lie in the same reason: we are all so close that everyone knows what's going on in each other's project. Classmates bring interesting ideas, everyone respects and roots for everyone else. And, of course, Jon Andrews is the best: he cares immensely for the class."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely would recommend the course to anyone who loves film. This is a safe space: stakes are low, support is strong. If you have any idea that you would like to become a film over the course of the year, take the course. The class covers the narrative and creative aspects of the film as well as the practicalities of putting a production together. It is a great time, so many possibilities to play and make mistakes without huge consequences -- so rare in the real-life film world."
