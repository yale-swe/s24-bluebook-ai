                "I was able to greatly expand upon my current knowledge of ecology, ecosystems, and climate change. Being given opportunities to learn skills outside of the course curriculum such as statistical analysis and programming were particularly interesting, and the labs we did during class were enjoyable. While I was initially underwhelmed by my own performance in the class, my interest in the content caused me to work even harder to improve my work ethic and make up for poor grades.",
                "This class was a great foundation to many different concepts in ecology and was able to tie them all together very well.  It also provided a-lot of practice with understanding equations and graphs as well as connecting topics across fields.",
                "I learned many things that deal with ecology.",
                "I learned so much from this course. This was my first E&EB course at Yale, and I learned so much about ecology, but I especially appreciated the last unit about global change. Biology and ecology courses I had taken before Yale would lay out subjects, but not talk about how natural phenomena change with the presence of humans. I have a more tangible understanding of community dynamics around me, and a more critical eye for how they are impacted by people.",
                "During the course, I learn more about ecological theories and methods to apply said theory in real world contexts. Skills that I learned was what was needed and what they look for in a research paper. Also, the skills needed for a perspective paper. In addition, insights was, as mentioned earlier, its broader application to world wide changes. An example is urbanization and metapopulations. A concept that I would love for further explanation is more on landscape ecology, looking at a very broad picture, which was briefly touched on in class.",
                "I learned about the foundational principles of ecology",
                "Interpreting graphs of population dynamics, concepts of general ecology",
                "Learned about lots of models and approaches to understanding ecological phenomena.",

                "This class could be improved by providing more practice problems, and having a clearer connection between p-sets and exams. I think the p-sets did support my learning, but they were not indicative of the content that would be on the exam in my opinion.",
                "This course is friendly even to a student who has limited to no experience in the field of ecology. It is easy to follow, enjoyable in its content and the way in which it is taught, and is a great primer to science at Yale.",
                "This course was poorly structured and did a bad job of teaching the topics at hand.",
                "I",
                "The class was organized very well. I feel like the sections were not very helpful.",
                "A great strength is the way the course is set up. Having two midterms and two papers allowed me to focus more on this class when big assignments came up because they were not conflicting with the typically midterm and finals periods, providing me greater focus in preparing. Help was always available during office hours, and I found having lecture 3 times a week was also helpful for asking my peers questions and working through the content with them.",
                "The strengths of the course is the connections. By the very end, we saw how many of these theories connected to world-wide changes. One of the most impactful for me was the R value and its connection with COVID-19. In addition, I enjoyed how the problem sets were more actually \"problem-based\" instead of being random questions with answer. However, this brings into some of the problems. At times, it felt that the support was not too strong, especially for problem sets I found myself many times scrambling for help - at least for the p-sets. Perhaps making more open and clear office hours would help - somewhat like how the MATH 115 classes does it.  Finally, some concepts and theories, like island biogeography, I would love for more explanation on how it is currently viewed nowadays. During the paper, I found myself looking at research that completely refuted its argument, saying that just the habitat proportion mattered. Maybe discussing more about the nuisances in class may be helpful on that end.",
                "i think it's pretty heavy into the theoreticla stuff but i appreciate that it gets more applied as the semester goes on. I also like the focus on section psets and lab reports instead of exams, i thought that was a better way to engage with the course",
                "Strong survey course of general ecology concepts, but there was not a lot of support to practice problems before the midterm.",
                "A large focus on modeling with only briefly touching on shortcomings of some models. Gave a practical understanding of how an ecologist approaches problems.",
                "For me, the biggest shortcoming of this class were the \"laboratory sections.\" I thought that spending the section collecting \"ecological data\" by counting beans on a piece of paper or estimating the heights of trees was not the most effective use of this time; I would have preferred to review the material presented in class or analyzing a sample dataset together instead. I thought one of the strengths of this class were the lectures; Professor Vasseur did a good job organizing the lectures and highlighting the key ideas. I also know that the class was restructured this year, and from what I have heard from older students, I think the restructuring of the class was hugely positive."

The course material was engaging, and the major papers assigned throughout the year provided students with opportunities to explore their own individual interests. The final paper in particular required students to think \"outside the box\" and apply concepts learned in class to a concept that they were interested in. Not only does this class give students a better understanding of the world around them, but in a way asks them to reflect on their own citizenship in the environment as they explore the impacts of climate change in the final paper.",

The unites covered were all very cohesive in terms of what we learned, and each built on the next. As mentioned above, I would also recommend it to students who want to understand ecology is a current sense or who are interested in climate change/ human presence and how it impacts other living things.",
                "I really would. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and the applications it has for other matters. Perhaps the only thing I would caution is that at times it feels very theoretical. Other than that, however, I enjoyed it and got to learn a lot more about our world through an ecological lens.",
                "maybe?? it's good if you like the theory stuff and like Ecology ecology. or if you need it as a prereq",

                "Yes, it was an interesting introduction to the field.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students who have no background in ecology and wish to learn more about the field. In my opinion, this course was fairly introductory, and so students who have a strong background in biology will likely find that they have already encountered some of the material in this course. With that said, a few majors require this class, and I would argue it is better to take sooner in your Yale career rather than later."
