I think the only thing which could be improved is providing more opportunities to get help-such as more office hours with Prof. Hammes-Schiffer or a discussion section with the TF.",
                "The biggest strength for the course is the professor's engagement, ability to convey clearly, and immense knowledge of the subject.  Where this course was potentially lacking is in understanding what the exam would consist of, seen as the problem sets were very \"plug and chug\", and the exam was much more conceptual.  Overall, an excellent course.",
                "This course has many strengths: straightforward notes that are closely related to the book, thorough mathematical descriptions of the problems without getting too bogged down in class-long derivations, in-class demos and labs to help students understand the concepts, and a homework difficulty that strikes a good balance. \r\n\r\nThe only improvement I can think of would be to share the midterm review sheet at the beginning of the semester so that students can start becoming familiar with it and referencing it on the homework. It is a very good, concise resource that helped me organize and contextualize all the concepts when studying.",
                "Great prof",
                "Slides are posted before class and include a couple in-class questions that are reviewed and updated on the slides after class, problem sets are from questions in the book so the related material is easy to access, Professor Hammes-Schiffer cares about students' understanding and is very approachable. The only improvement could potentially be including a few more visuals in class, but this might be more applicable to the material in the next half-semester course anyway."
