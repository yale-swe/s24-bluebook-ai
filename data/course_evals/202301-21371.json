                "This class was a TON of info thrown at you but I learned so so much it is unreal. The class was split up into into 3 sections: Sherman Act Section 1 cartels/collusion, Sherman Act Section 2: monopolization, and Clayton Act Section 7: monopolistic mergers and acquisitions. All had important antitrust litigation examples that we went over in great detail. Then, we had class presentations about current antitrust litigation (ex. DOJ v. Google Ad Search , Epic Games. v. Apple, FTC v. Meta-Within, etc.)",
                "Understanding the importance of competition and antitrust from both an economic and law perspective",
                "I learned the ins and outs of anti-trust policy, a new framework of thinking to approach competition and markets. It was fascinating.",
                "I learned about different types of anticompetitive behavior. I learned how to think critically about a businesss actions. I learned how to connect theoretical microeconomic concepts to real world behavior.",
                "i learned how to apply a lot of the introductory microeconomics to real-world scenarios. i also developed the skill of asking questions and being involved in a classroom setting",
                "I can say confidently that this is the course I learned the most practical analytical and practical skills out of all the econ classes Ive taken as an econ major. We learned to apply theoretical concept to real-life analysis of mergers and antitrust enforcement as well as ro read and interpret complaints or current cases with a critical eye.",
                "We covered the different antitrust legal regimes, what kinds of conduct they forbid and why, and how they are enforced in the United States today. We also covered dozens of recent and historical case studies of anti-competitive conduct and how the economics of a particular industry might facilitate it.",

            "comments": [
                "The course offers really interesting case studies. As to weaknesses, the lectures would improve if the professor offered more analysis instead of simply summarizing our readings.",
                "This course was the highlight of semester, and there is honestly very little I would change about it. Faster grading turnaround on some of the mid-semester assignments would have been nice, though not a huge deal. The 8:30 class time is brutal, but, if you can get yourself out of bed, it's amazing.",
                "If you are an Economics major, take this course. It will be the best ECON class you take, hands-down. Professor Scott-Morton is truly impeccable, the readings are phenomenal, the pace and structure is excellent, etc. \r\n\r\nIf you're not an Economics major, still take the course. It's one of the few (perhaps the only) ECON class that's interesting and applicable enough that non-Economics majors would still benefit greatly from it.",
                "The strengths of the course lie in the fact that there seems to be an equal split of law, SOM and undergrads in this class and I think each contingency brought a different perspective to the table and asked good questioned. The main strength of the course is truly Professor FSM. She is truly an expert in her field. The readings and slides were extremely thorough and everything complemented each other very nicely. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course is the fact that there is no discussion section like component which I think would be particularly helpful to undergrads catch up to speed with the material/legal jargon and ask questions outside of the class environment, where the questions tend to be dominated by the law students (who do ask really good questions that I learned a lot from). I think a discussion section would help solidify concepts from the week so that it would be easier to prepare for exams. The grading rubric/feedback for the midterm was also a little unclear.",
                "The best economics elective I have taken at Yale. Professor Scott Morton is a fantastic lecturer  informative and engaging. The balance of undergrads, MBAs, and law students is a great opportunity to hear from students with different interests and backgrounds. Class always made up for the early meeting time. Cannot recommend it enough. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No major ones, though assignments did take very long to be returned, so it was difficult to gauge how we were doing in the course.",
                "This course is fantastic!!! Only have positive things to say except that there are not very many assignments so the tests are high pressure.",
                "Strengths: such interesting material, economics clicks together when you get antitrust. You really learn from someone who is hands on in the field.\r\nWeaknesses: it can be a little intimidating to participate as an undergrad.",
                "Overall great course. Lectures are great. Exams are fair. Readings are interesting and useful.\r\nI thought the one problem set was not very useful. The modeling was good, but the analysis questions did not seem connected to course topics and did not make sense. Theres only one though and its pretty easy so its not a big deal though.",
                "the course is designed to be inclusive of law school, MBA, and yale college students, as there was an intersection of those topics in the way we learned the material. \r\n\r\ni think it would have been a better experience though if the cap was smaller, so people would feel more comfortable speaking up and contributing.",
                "Amazing lectures full of content and great balance of theory with practical application. I enjoyed the readings which were all relevant to each lecture and our lively discussions in class.\r\n\r\nPresentations felt too rushed but this might be inevitable due to the class schedule. I believe sections will be extremely helpful for smaller setting discussions and further reinforcement of the materials.",
                "Strengths: Professor Scott Morton's lecturing style is truly spectacular - she speaks freely, is readily understandable, she's funny and engaging, and she does a great job facilitating student involvement. Even though the class is taught in lecture format, there are so many student questions at times it feels like a seminar.\r\nWeaknesses: None really.",
                "Professor Scott Morton's extremely engaging teaching style, the clear structure of the lectures and course material, the challenging assignments (i think the presentation assignment at the end of the semester is a great way to keep the students even more engaged with the material) are definitely among the course's strengths.",
                "Strengths: Amazing breadth of information, incredible clarity in explanations, and reasonable assignments and readings appropriate to the work. Another huge strength was having business professionals, law students, and business students along with undergraduates, as much as they might be intimidating. Weaknesses: I will confess there were not a lot of checkpoints in the bulk of the beginning of the class. We had one PSET which was graded at the end of the semester, the midterm was quite chill, and those were pretty much the only assignments throughout the semester. We did have an immense amount of feedback on the final project, though, meaning that overall we were able to reflect on our learning and get feedback throughout. One improvement could be sections to talk over more complicated Econ topics and to allow time for questions that take up time in class.",
                "The course teaches antitrust concepts that are relevant today, and uses cases to convey concepts. \r\n\r\nOne suggestion for improvement is making the slides more clear by including more explanations and definitions of relevant terms and concepts."

The opportunity to take a class with FSM, a leader in the antitrust field, and brilliant YLS students is something Econ undergrads should definitely take advantage of. Yes, it is at 8:30 am and there are times where I asked myself why I took it, but I learned so much and walked out glad that I went.",

                "I would definitely recommend it if they are interested in competition economics. They will get advanced knowledge from a professor who is a legend in the field.",
                "Yes! This topic is so fascinating and relevant. The course gives you all of the updates and sets you up well to have intelligent things to say when people discuss antitrust law, whether you are seeking to enforce it or skirt it. I rarely ever felt the reality of it starting at 8:30 AM, at a 20 minute walk away from my dorm, and I enjoyed all of the assignments. Keep in mind it will be very heavy at the end of the semester, with a proposal, draft slides, a final presentation, and an eight-page paper in addition to a final exam. Make sure to prioritize the balance between your classes so you are not overwhelmed in the final few weeks of classes, but please do take this course!"
