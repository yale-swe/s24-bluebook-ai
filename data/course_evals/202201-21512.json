The sheer volume of work forced me to incorporate nonfiction reading and writing into my everyday life, and as the semester progressed, I could feel the tangible, positive effects it had on my technique. Clarity, honesty, and voice are all emphasized in the course.",
                "ENGL 455 absolutely made me a stronger prose writer, but it also made me a better reader and editor. I feel now so much more prepared to engage with my peers work and to approach the genres of memoir and personal essay from a standpoint not only of craft but of ethicswhose story is whose, and what right does one have to tell a given story?",
                "I learned so much in this class! Anne has so many techniques and tips that she has compiled over the years that are massively helpful in developing your writing abilities. I also learned so much by reading other students' work and from our class discussions. You will walk away learning things you didn't even know you needed to know!",
                "This class will teach you how to produce and revise high-quality essays on a variety of topics as well as how to read model essays for applicable techniques. Every other week, you will write a new essay and spend an hour with Anne revising the work. You will also practice writing critiques for other students' essays.",
                "I learned about personal essay writing, including essay structure, sentence structure, narrative voice, word choice, and many other ways to write compelling personal narrative essays."

                "This is a very carefully and tightly structured course with rarely a dull moment. However, I do feel that at times the course moved a bit too quickly, and conversations were cut a little short by the amount of content packed into the course.",
                "Anne is a fabulous instructor. The course is meticulously organized from its readings, writing assignments, professor-student meetings, all the way to its mini grammar lessons (super helpful by the way!). Loved that every week was structured around a certain theme (i.e. Love, Loss, Joy, Family, etc.), and almost every single reading was excellent. I also adored how supportive and friendly our class environment was. The ultimate strength of this class is that you WILL be a better writer by the time you leave. As for weaknesses, I wish the reading load was more balanced week-to-week. Some weeks are very manageable, while others are really enormous.",
                "I cant think of many weaknesses for ENGL 455, other than the mere fact that three hours of anything can be somewhat hard to sustain. But if theres any class Id choose to sit in for three hours, its this one.",
                "Strengths: the amount of writing you do by virtue of the assignments in the class, the comments you get from peers, the one hour conferences after each piece of writing with Anne where you go line by line through your writing, the structure of the class being very well thought out, and the amount you get to edit and receive edits from peers. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the three hour class period is definitely long, but it does go by quickly because the discussion is interesting.",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe 1:1 time you get with Anne outside of class. You will get very personal care and attention, and you DO become a better writer. \r\nThe course is impeccably organized, down to the minute of each class. You will never not know a deadline or an assignment from the first day of class.\r\nThe course is designed to foster a community. You will get to learn about the other 11 students in and outside of class. \r\nYou become a much better editor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe course is far too long-winded. Sometimes, simple concepts are given 15 minutes to explain. \r\nSince the course is so structured, there is little room for open discussion/spontaneity. \r\nThe course has a bit of a cult following. People tend to treat it like the most important thing in their semester. You don't have to do this, and you don't need to get sucked into the bubble of stress that surrounds the class. Take it, write, learn, and have fun.",
                "One strength of this class that I really enjoyed was the workshop aspect. It was really helpful and inspiring to get to read and workshop each others work."

                "Yes, it is definitely a very enjoyable course with a caring teacher, and will introduce you to many interesting writers in the Yale community whom you will grow close with throughout the semester.",
                "Absolutely, with my whole heart. There is no other class like it at Yale. Anne is deeply invested in her students, and if you put in the effort (which this class demands a lot of!), you will be a better reader and writer, without question. It was a lot of work, but it is so worth it. If you have the opportunity to take it, please do so. You will not regret it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend ENGL 455 to students interested in creative nonfiction writingespecially on a granular level.",
                "Yes! You absolutely must take this class! It is definitely a lot of work, but the payoff is so so worth it. Your writing (and editing) skills will improve so much, and you will get to know the other people in your class pretty well too. Its been one of my favorite classes at Yale so far, and I think it has pushed and challenged me more than any other writing class has, which is really rewarding!",
                "Yes, if you have the time and drive. This course is for people who want to focus on their craft and who want to implement notes week to week. Although I had heard about the insane workload, I really did not find it to be a huge time commitment at all (give or take a few weeks in the semester). You will read great essays and learn better writing techniques.\r\nThis class is not designed for students who like to go to the beat of their own drum. Anne will teach you her way of doing things. If you want that, take the class. If this much prescription annoys you, there are other classes!\r\nAll in all, Anne is a very passionate teacher who clearly loves this class. I would recommend it, and I am finishing the course feeling like I have learned and improved.",
                "Yes, I would. Professor Fadiman genuinely cares about her students and really cares about this class. I felt like I learned so much about personal narrative essay writing and creative non-fiction. It was very engaging and one of the most unique classes Ive taken at Yale."
