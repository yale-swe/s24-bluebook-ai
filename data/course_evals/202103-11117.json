I learned how to send and detect sinusoidal signals in noise using template matching, and how to use certain techniques like bit repetition to reduce error. I learned how to balance the energy cost of signal production with the accuracy of signal detection (how to minimize detection error at the cost of more signal energy needed). I got an overview of machine learning. I learned how to do spectral analysis (make a spectrogram), and I learned about spatial frequencies. I simulated transmitting images through space. I learned about the Fourier transform, the difference between time domain and frequency domain, resonant frequencies, and digital filters like first- and second-order autoregressive filters. I learned how the vocal tract and formants work, and how to generate synthetic human speech. I learned how to use signal processing to detect certain vowels and pitches in human speech via template matching. I learned how to model a DC motor's transient response by two RC low-pass filters and simulate those filters using digital FOAR filters, and how to create an analyze a P-like motor controller.",

                "Strengths: Prof Kuc is enthusiastic. That's it.\r\n\r\nCons: No feedback. We had 15 HW submitted and 2 big projects. None were graded. Nobody knew their grade. We did not have a TA. We did have a ULA but he was useless. Prof Kuc would go on these super long dialogues in class and you would be just super confused and learn nothing. He would keep messing up the homework's so you would spend hours on homework's and projects just so you come to his office hours for him to say Oh, I made a mistake! So stupid... The stuff we were learning was not impossibly hard, but because of the disorganized nature of the professor and the class, it was impossible. Oh also he would sometimes see a mistake in the project and submit a revision, WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE. Like you would submit the hw and 20min before the deadline you would find out he changed it. It was just so frustrating.",
                "The class was taught with Matlab code. Although comfortable with Matlab, coming from a CS background, I struggled following the lines of his code and understanding the theory. I wish he first covered the theory in slides and then showed how it worked on code level. Instead, all the lectures were taught on code and we had to figure out what all the variables meant and what all the lines were doing (even the irrelvant ones like plotting figures and initializing arrays). I feel like I haven't much learned about the theory and concepts from this class. I figured out most of the things myself to submit projects and the experience was not pleasant at all obviously. Also, all my homework was graded a week before the end of term and this was super annoying. We didn't get any chance to get feedback and improve during the term. The professor didn't seem to be a terrible person; I think the course was poorly designed that made a lot of the students confused.",
                "Strengths: the content is really cool. Weaknesses: this class is not well taught or well organized. Unfortunately, every assignment was on Matlab, so I never fully understood the theory behind much of what we were doing.  Additionally, the lectures were a bit boring since they were taught from a MatLab live script. There was also a lot of focus on specific projects, which were cool, but the instructions were a bit unclear.",
                "Weaknesses: The class was quite unorganized. It sort of taught Matlab but lacked an engaged TA or sufficient resources for students without coding experience to gain adequate help. The class also lacked resources for reinforcing concepts, because again, help outside of class was lacking. The professor offerred office hours that I attended but a peer tutor coud have gone a long way for answering conceptual questions and providing a more casual environment for getting help with homework and concepts.",
                "Signal processing is something that, to be fair, seems difficult to teach well. MATLAB is definitely a great choice for teaching this course. The MATLAB lecture documents were a great way to learn, but a terrible way to lecture. They also often contained a lot of typos and were sometimes hard to understand because they abbreviated so much. Commenting the code more would help. The lectures were pretty much pointless, since they just consisted of Prof Kuc reading off the code and notes in the document. The course was terribly organized, probably worse than any course I've taken at Yale. What we ended up studying each lecture did not match the syllabus on Canvas at all, and neither did the grading scheme or the project topics. We didn't receive any homework or project feedback until very late in the course. Deadlines for the projects and homework were changed too many times. Things said in class sometimes contradicted the feedback we got on homework and projects. The homeworks often didn't test students' ability to write or even understand the code, which made doing them feel pointless. Strengths of the course were that, luckily, one could learn all the material alone by just reading the lecture notes and code. The code was overall well-designed to illustrate the concepts we learned.\r\nTo improve the course, it might be helpful to focus more on getting students to understand the theory (like the equations in the textbook) better before they dive into the code. So maybe the instructor could prepare slides for each class, like EENG 200, and then the homeworks and projects can be done in MATLAB. \r\nIt would also be good for students to write more code, or at least for the homeworks to test students' understanding of the material better (not just copying lecture code). The projects were nice, especially the first project, since it asked students to both write code and analyze it. The third project was disappointing, since it just asked students to answer some questions about given code. That doesn't seem like how you produce good engineers. You should make engineers build to learn. People who just answer questions about code are consultants. I guarantee that most of the class did not actually learn or understand the underlying concepts of the third project.",
                "This class had no strengths.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses include terrible lecturing style: reading directly from matlab code in a way that facilitated little to no intuitive understanding of any of the topics at hand. Lecture material: completely disjoint material taught in a fickle manner which would sometimes involve focusing on minute and even simple details for tens of minutes, and other times would involve the assumption that students would understand complex math and system functions after talking about them for a matter of seconds. Assignments: the class projects were somewhat interesting but were only given after weeks worth of confusing or trivial homework assignments that did not help to cement my knowledge in the class. The homeworks and projects were often riddled with mistakes that made them either contain redundant or poorly written questions, or made them impossible to interpret. One of the biggest problems with the course's assignments and the associated feedback was that WE DID NOT RECEIVE A SINGLE GRADE OR PIECE OF FEEDBACK UNTIL AFTER ALL BUT 1 ASSIGNMENT HAD BEEN TURNED IN. I spent the entire course not only having no idea what was going on, but having no feedback from my professor or TA on how I was doing or how my learning was going relative to the expectation.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how to help this course. It was without a doubt the worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. It was not necessarily hard, but I gained next to nothing from it. Most basically, this course needs to have a complete makeover in how it is taught. Reading off of matlab live scripts and expecting any student engagement or understanding is a lost cause. I assume if the course material was refined and taught via lecture slides or some generally more visually engaging manner the course would be far better. Second, the course must be adjusted such that complex concepts and equations are given ample explanation, and even practice problems to illustrate their function. There were many lectures where an essential equation or functionality of a system was explained without giving students any time to get comfortable with it, these points were often where I would completely lose track of what was going on in the lecture. The best suggestion I can give for this course is to either remove it completely from the electrical engineering curriculum, or have the entire department collaborate on how to overhaul it.",
                "It is a very interesting course and the projects were fun.",
                "Strengths: the projects were very applicable and the concepts were interesting\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures were sometimes hard to follow because the professor would move too quickly. It would have helped if they were recorded, or if he posted lecture notes before each class so we could come in prepared or refer to the material if something wasn't clear.",
                "Strengths comprehesinve.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses organization was very poor and the work was very difficult to understand. Also the homework took a long time to be graded.",
                "Strengths: Kuc was pretty intelligent. Weaknesses: this box can only hold 4000 characters. This was one of the most poorly taught courses I have ever taken here. They expect us to come in with a strong coding basis, missing that would make this course impossible. Until 2 days before the Cr/D/F deadline we had not received a single grade in the class for the 20+ assignments we had submitted. After lecture ten I am certain 90 percent of the class did not follow anything the professor was saying. The projects and homeworks were very confusing and Kuc would often put out the homeworks with errors and it would take 5 of us to band together for him to realize his mistake before he corrected it and put out a revised version without telling anyone.",
                "The assignments were not organized well and instructions were often unclear. At the same time, a lot of assignments can be finished in 10 minutes. Since all the code is pre-written by Kuc, very little problem-solving is required.",
                "Interesting content but overly reliant on matlab and few real world applications (all simulations)",
                "The course gives a decent introduction to digital signal processing and a few other topics. You learn to use Matlab, and Professor Kuc is very organized. \r\n\r\nA weakness is that it was difficult to feel engaged with the course at times since we completed most homework assignments and projects on our laptops in Matlab. It would have been great to be in a lab environment from time to time or to get some hands-on experience. This was an engineering class perfect for an online-only semester, even though we had access to labs and the classroom now.",
                "Class needs a bit more focus, we learn matlab and communications theory, but neither skill in depth enough for me to say that I'm comfortable with either. It does serve as a nice survey class over the big ideas of how various communications systems are implemented.",
                "The courses only strength is that it theoretically provides a very solid foundation in the field of signals processing. However, this course needed more cohesiveness with its content. It seemed like the three units we had had nothing to do with each other. Also, the content needs to stick closer to the textbook; since many lecture topics were not in the text, it was impossible to prepare for lectures beforehand or understand the lecture content through another source. \r\n\r\nAlso, the MATLAB homework assignments didnt make any sense. There were frequently errors within the code or discrepancies between different homeworks that made the assignments extremely confusing to do."

If you think you'll learn from Kuc's lectures, don't take it.",

If you have to take this course because you are an electrical engineer, rest assured that the course is not very difficult to obtain a good grade in; however, it will make you completely lose faith on the capabilities of the electrical engineering department at Yale. This course is an absolute embarrassment that will teach you nothing and leave you confused after every class meeting.

                "Prof Kuc is a very energetic and supportive teacher but I'd say this course doesn't quite reflect well on him. The problem is that in this class you neither learn a great foundation or matlab nor deeply engrain yourself in the theory required to understand the particularites of some of the later concepts such as discrete forier transformations which require a strong mathematical foundation. I can understand the idea of this class being a survey over important communication topics, but since we are often not really writing the code nor doing the background theory work but rather just copying Kuc's matlab implementations from lectures and homework, it never feels like a very meaningful class. We often gain surface level understanding of the concepts which is nice for people who maybe aren't quite planning on majoring in ee or eecs, but if you want a deeper understanding this class doesn't seem like a fantastic basis for it. I think the class is trying to do too much which makes it seem more chaotic than necessary. I didn't dislike it as much as some of my other classmates as I do see the intentions and how we were able to learn the big idea behind some of the systems we \"implemented\", but I will say that considering that I had a difficult time following where we were going for most of the class, I can't quite recommend it to most students who aren't required to take this class. That being said, I will say that Kuc's is an entertaining and definetely knowledgable professor, just this class doesn't seem to reflect him well.",
