   "comments": [
    "Primarily close-reading analysis through the works of John Milton. This class also forced me to question the narratives I \"know\" to be true, and think about them at a deeper level. Professor Rogers and my TA (Andrea Walkden) also provided tremendous feedback on the essay assignments.",
    "I developed close reading and critical analysis skills related to studying poetry; I also learned a lot about the Christian canon which I wasnt super knowledgeable about before.",
    "A great survey course of Milton! Both develop close reading skills and learn a bit about the historical context in which Milton wrote",
    "I learned how to write better. I also learned how to identify ambiguities and propose interesting questions from the readings.",
    "We learned about the history, context, style, politics, worldview, and complications of Milton's work. In particular, we delved into Paradise Lost in close detail, parsing through its contradictions and convictions together. I loved the attention to detail in Professor Rogers' lectures and the openness with which the professors encouraged new ideas during our meetings. I also learned a lot about the conflicting attitudes toward matter\/soul, science, free will, poetic form and authority that were percolating in society during Milton's time. (In terms of full text material, we also read Samson Agonistes and Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials dystopian trilogy.)",
    "How to analyze works of literature and poetry better. An understanding of how an author's philosophical and political ideas may influence a work of literature. A deep understanding of works by John Milton and a lot about Milton himself.",
    "I gained knowledge of not only Milton's works but also the historical, political, and social contexts that informed and influenced his works! I also really enjoyed learning about Milton the man and the way his context, himself, and his works continue to influence literature and thought today.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about John Milton and the social, political, and economic context during which he wrote his masterpieces. Professor Rogers also provided amazing insight into the world of analyzing literature, and how to critically evaluate a text through writing."

   "comments": [
    "This is an amazing course and everyone should take it! It is thought-provoking, engaging and fun.",
    "Fantastic Professor and TA that were very helpful throughout the course. They were also very generous with their time, helping set up meetings beyond the normal office hours.",
    "The strengths of this course were the fluidity of discussions and the great ideas everyone brought! Weaknesses were mainly due to zoom and I would have used some more break out rooms.",
    "strength - great selection of Milton's writings \r\nweakness - the class was too large to have meaningful seminar discussions over zoom and allow everyone the chance to participate and the Pullman read felt unnecessary given we didn't have much time",
    "Prof. Rogers and Prof. Walkden were the best part of the course. The pre-recorded lecture series is fantastic and the in person meetings were well led and very interesting. The other students had great ideas which made in person discussions very helpful. Also working on essays with both professors and the writing tutor, Emma Brodey, was great!",
    "Readings, video lectures, and online discussions were very fruitful and engaging. Professor\/Tf essay feedback was also detailed and thoughtful. Perhaps it would be helpful to condense the work load (e.g. requiring fewer video lectures per week).",
    "The professors are the strength of this course ! They did a wonderful job adapting to the online format, and engaging all students. I also appreciated how generous Professor Rogers and Professor Walkden were with their time, their insights, and their support. Another strength of this class - as with any of Yale's well-designed English classes - is its robust opportunity and encouragement for discussion. It was wonderful to connect with my peers about exciting material, complex questions (Who is to blame for Man's Fall? Is God a tyrant, or is Satan? What are the limits of God's intervention, and are they justified? What is the dynamic between Eve and Adam, and what characterizes the \"love\" between them? How is the Miltonic cosmos organized?) . \r\n\r\nI would say the only weakness is that it was entirely conducted over Zoom; unfortunately, this could not be avoided during a pandemic. (I also wish that there was more time to discuss the Philip Pullman trilogy! Though I am also not sure that this can be changed given the five-week time frame of YSS classes).",
    "I liked how organized the course was and how there was a clear topic for each class.",
    "Great instruction and explanation of the course material. The course is organized and does a great job covering the content. No weaknesses to me.",
    "There are no weaknesses. Professor Rogers and Professor Walkden are both extremely engaged with and interested in the material, and are fantastic at balancing providing a structured lecture\/conversation with the chance for student participation and discussion. They also both take the time to look through your essays in detail and provide incredibly helpful feedback.",
    "One of the greatest strengths of this course was how the online live seminar discussions were run. Prof. Rogers and Andrea encouraged the use of the chat feature on Zoom which allowed everyone to participate and more than one main idea to be discussed simultaneously. I also loved the paper prompts, which inspired creativity and curiosity, and felt very supported by the professor and TF in embarking on these explorations.",
    "The only weakness of the course is how short it was it would have been nice to spend more time studying Milton and his greatest works, or even having more discussion sections during the 5-week online course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!!!!!!!!!",
    "Absolutely.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! John Rogers is amazing and really encourages you to take different approaches to the material. It was great if you are a science \/ stem major and want to do something humanities or liberal artsy for a bit!",
    "Yes, if you want to learn about Milton, Professor Rogers is the best",
    "Great course! Prof. Roger's love of Milton truly demonstrates Milton's greatness.",
    "Certainly. Even a non-English major can benefit from reading Milton's poems and writings. Milton offers a lot to think about and certainly invites you to reassess your perception of the world, religion, and divine power.",
    "Yes! Milton grapples with such urgent and fascinating questions that I think that any opportunity to reckon with his work is a good one (especially if it's organized and led by these expert professors!) As aforementioned, if you are at all interested in 1) the story of the \"Fall of Man\" and its implications, 2) ideas about the organization of the universe, 2) democracy vs republic vs hierarchy, 3) gender politics, 4) free will and pre-determination... these themes crop up repeatedly throughout the class (you will not be able to avoid them)!\r\n\r\nAlso a wonderful chance to strengthen your writing, argument-building, and close-reading skills. Professor Rogers and Professor Walkden give copious, detailed, and line-edited feedback.",
    "Yes. Professor Rogers is very understanding and generous with his supportive comments!",
    "Absolutely, I've never been a fan of reading and writing classes but I am so glad I took this class. This is the first English class I can say that I truly loved because it goes into more than just plot elements and how to write. We talked about culture, philosophy, history, and politics and how they all related to Milton's works or how Milton's works affected them. If taken seriously, it will give you a greater appreciation for works of literature.",
    "Absolutely. My favorite class at Yale in all four years. Do not miss the opportunity to take this class.",
    "A hundred times yes, and an even louder yes if the works are going to be contextualized and explored with the same level of care with which Prof. Rogers and Andrea presented them and if Pullman's His Dark Materials will also be taught!",
    "Yes, wholeheartedly. Professor Rogers and TA Andrea Walkden were both incredible in sharing their adoration for Milton with the class and in facilitating extremely engaging discussions on the course material. I am 100% a STEM student and this was my first writing \/ English class at Yale, and it has inspired me to take more literature classes in future years. Before Milton, I despised English and writing in general, but Prof. Rogers and Walkden taught me to enjoy writing and literature."
