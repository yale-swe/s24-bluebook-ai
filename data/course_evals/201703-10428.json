    "Skill on Adobe Suite, better consciousness of composition, and increased breadth of artist knowledge.",

   "comments": [
    "class was slow moving and generally not very engaging.  having the content move faster and having more interesting assignments would greatly improve the quality of this class",
    "Strengths: lots of variety and opportunity for feedback\r\nWeaknesses: because of the size, critiques often took multiple classes - it would have been nice to split into two groups each time.",
    "More readings and theory",
    "I thought that it was a good course overall, although it was difficult to know what the courses led to overall.",
    "Very good teaching style that accommodates different interests and foci in the art department well and with a great degree of attention to each and every artistic interest presented.",
    "Strengths of the class would definitely be the diversity of projects that we were assigned. One request I have would be more crits but faster paced.",
    "My strengths were that I was able to switch between media and projects pretty easily and adapt to new ideas but my weaknesses were that I lacked some experience in a few areas and I sometimes struggled to estimate the time needed to finish a certain project."

    "very little work so if you're looking for a low intensity art class this is the one for you!",
    "I'm not an art major, and i felt like this course was a great opportunity to get a taste of different visual concepts that could help me better think about the visual impact of my work in other fields.",
    "Yes I would recommend this to others because it is a good introduction course that eases you into art theory and talking about art.",
    "It's required for the art major.",
    "Absolute must-take for any student with an interest in art of any kind looking for a way to explore artistic methods and media, alongside helpful feedback to improve whatever works you enjoy producing.",
    "Yes! This is a great course that dips into a variety of media that I otherwise wouldn't think to use.",
    "Yes, this is a good course to take if you're just starting out in art or you're open to doing multiple things. The pace may sometimes be a bit slow for some people as there are a few lectures but it is a great beginner's course for learning the fundamentals of art and visual communication."
