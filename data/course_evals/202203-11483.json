                "At the beginning of this course, the background on international law was a little theoretical and might have turned off prospective students who felt a little lost. However, as the semester progressed and we began discussing specific issues and hypothetical scenarios, everything started to come together. Dr. Hasin also designed the course very well--the readings provided excellent background and seemed to build off of each other. There was also a good mix of news stories and legal scholarship. He also created a relaxing environment of free-flowing discussions, and was kind in the flexibility he provided for the 3 memos and final paper. Indeed, I thought that these assignments were very educational and relatively stress-free, which is exactly what assessments should be like.",
                "Strengths: knowledgeable professor and great collection of readings\/literature; fascinating area of study.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: minimal feedback received on assignments; seminars would too often go on tangents unrelated to daily topics + eventually, entire schedule ended up being shifted back one class (would've benefited from more instructor-led focusing).",
                "Class would be better with more people. We only had ~8 students. \r\nIt would be more interesting if we talked more about actual policies. This class was a bit too high-level. \r\nGuest lectures were great, we should have more.",
                "Discussions were usually pretty interesting, but it was not uncommon for Gershon to lapse into lecturing. Consider more questions and how to ask questions such that it promotes more discussion among students.",
                "Strengths - huge expertise of instructor and ability to share anecdotes. Weaknesses - Difficult to carry on concepts from previous class since only met once a week, so a quick chalkboard review would be useful each session; more writing on the board in general."

                "For students who are willing to engage with legal concepts that are not always the most straightforward, yes. Dr. Hasin is extremely knowledgeable and kind, and the syllabus provided a deep and broad introduction to key issues in space governance.",
                "Yes! It's a fascinating, emerging field of study that every student would benefit from learning more about.",
                "Yes, if there are more people in the class.",
                "Yes - even if you have limited legal understanding this taught you a lot about what the future holds in terms of policy challenges. In life, you will be faced with similarly ambiguous challenges, so this course helped you learn how to find all the answers\/possibilities out there thus far."
