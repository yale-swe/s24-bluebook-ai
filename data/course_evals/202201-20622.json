                "I was able to gain a deep understanding of Russian politics and how the country developed the government that it has today. We were given an overview of the history of Russian politics from the imperial period up until today and learned about different arguments that are used to describe the outcomes of political procedures. In addition to this, we also talked a lot about comparative politics and Professor Lazarev does a great job explaining how different comparison methods are used in politics and how we can use them in our papers.",
                "I learned about many different facets of Russian politics and society, mainly from the Soviet Union to the present. We also focused on comparative analysis.",

                "strength: most readings are interesting, love the assigned movies\r\nweakness: very very low engagement and the course curriculum overall feels like a superficial crash course on a small part of Russian politics. You will be bombarded with lots of information but it's hard to memorize anything or understand the deep reason behind it. The feedback and guidance on paper is also very very limited.",
                "I think the course does a great job overviewing Russian history and politics, but it could use a bit more structure\/connection of lecture to the actual assignments.",
                "I think that this course was wonderful and I really enjoyed it. I learned a lot from Professor Lazarev and I really liked the structure of the course and they way the subjects were organized. I felt that they really built on each other. The readings were also incredibly interesting and added to the lecture material very well. I do not think that there were any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: informative slides, interesting readings, the professor was very knowledgeable on the subject matter. Weaknesses: assignments did not have much to do with the course material --- you didn't need to have taken the course to have done the assignments, engagement in lecture was low as a result. Grading was a bit unpredictable.",
                "This class was much less interesting than it sounds in the description. Professor just reads off notes\/powerpoints, only student participation comes with questions. Assignments are not related directly to course material in that they don't encourage engagement with the material as it is taught in class. To make matters worse, this course assigns more pages to write than a WR credit (which it is not!) and the grading is incredibly and unnecessarily harsh."

                "No if you want a deep understanding of Russian politics and society, especially no if you become interested in Russian culture because of Russian literature or arts as this course is really just a political science class.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to learn about Russia today. Professor Lazarev is very knowledgeable and always happy to answer questions during lecture.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it provides",
                "I would recommend this class to somebody that is comfortable with an open ended research project where they would have to independently research a topic of their choice.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone truly interested in Russian politics who needs little encouragement to be engaged, because for someone who was not particularly interested before the class it was hard to stay engaged. Assignments (3 papers) were manageable but the grading was a bit unpredictable. The professor, while not the most captivating lecturer, was very knowledgeable about Russian politics and society.",
                "No, its not structured to make the material engaging\/interesting (this is coming from someone who is deeply interested in the material otherwise), grading is harsh with very little meaningful help, and it is way too much writing to not be a WR."
