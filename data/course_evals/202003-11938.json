                "This course was a great intro to basic lab techniques, materials, and proceedings. I got to perform 8 or so experiments in the lab with varying goals, spending around 3 or 4 hours in the lab each time. I hadn't done research before, so all of the cleaning, preparing, and experimental procedures were new to me, and by the end of the semester I felt a lot more confident about what lab work looks like and how to approach it. Weekly lab reports were also new and challenging, but by the end of the semester I felt very comfortable with the format and workload.",

We were also exposed to many experimental procedures throughout the semester, allowing students to develop scientific intuition and thinking processes and challenging us to reason why experiments proceeded (or had not proceeded) a certain way. Typically, the experiments included in the lab provided tangible representations of various chemical concepts that I learned in high-school chemistry or provided experimental proof to the concepts that I had learned in my aforementioned high-school chemistry course.",

                "Watching the prerecorded lectures of doc g doing the lab and then the TA do the same thing on lab day was pointless.",
                "Very little strengths.  The actual lab itself was interesting, but working without a lab partner was difficult.  The online labs were terrible.  The lab was taught robotically and to do well you didn't have to be a scientist, but a computer.",
                "I thought the course was very organized and the assignments were very clear. The labs usually correlated with the topic we discussed in lecture. A weakness of the class I found was the post lab quizzes. While the pre-lab quizzes were very helpful and made sure I understood the material, I felt like the post labs were tedious and did not contribute much to my learning. I tended to do lab reports right after finishing the lab, so after a week has passed, I felt like I had to relearn the lab alongside a new lab.",
                "You will learn how to function in the lab. The instructions are extensive and you will be required to keep to the guidelines. This is very helpful because with so little room for error, you learn how to function well. However, the work load of this class is very high, and frequently a lot of it feels unnecessary. Because of the virtual environment this year, everyone had to watch long pre-lab lectures, these could be 1-2 hours long. While the lectures were useful, I often found the videos that just walked you through the lab to be unnecessary for someone who would then be performing the experiment with the help of a TA and a detailed lab manual. \r\nThe lab repots were also very long and take several hours to complete well. You will understand the data, but parts of the report can just feel like box checking.",
                "the most time consuming of all my classes despite being only half a credit",
                "The lab work was usually fun and engaging. The lab reports were brutal and sometimes graded very unfairly. There was too much deviation in grading that didn't depend on the work itself, but rather the TA's who graded them.",
                "The course could have done away with the majority of its assigned busy work, which was truly not helpful in the least.",
                "Strengths: the experiments themselves are quite interesting and fun to conduct. Weaknesses: I understand in real scientific papers that the details must be very meticulous, but the grading was too meticulous, so much so that the points I lost had nothing whatsoever to do with my conceptual understanding.",
                "Strengths: personally, I thought chem lab was very enjoyable. The work load is a lot but manageable. This should not be thought of as a half credit course.",
                "Strengths of this course include the in person labs, the resources provided before each lab session, Dr. G, and the labs themselves which were challenging, but mostly engaging and exciting. Weaknesses include the workload, some of the TA's, and the grading which could be variable and very rarely reflective of true learning.",
                "the course can improve because most of the work is front-loaded towards the day before the lab day. The fact that the post-lab and pre-lab quizzes are only made available the day before the lab made it difficult to juggle lab work during the week since most of the assignments were not made available until the day before. It was quite difficult to manage during the semester.",
                "Strengths: A wide variety of lab experiments gives a good basic yet broad overview of lab work. Both Dr. G and my TA were great at being available to help with anything I was struggling on both in the lab and outside with lab reports.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The post lab quizzes often had questions that the lab class never specifically taught, and it was assumed that students had either learned it in their Gen Chem lecture class or from previous high school chemistry background. However, different Gen Chem sections went at different paces, the units in our lecture class sometimes didn't align with the concepts of that weeks experiment, and people come into the class\/lab with varying levels of high school chemistry background. For a General Chemistry lab that is supposed to be designed as the intro\/starting point for a student in chemistry, the quizzes are sometimes unfairly biased toward students with previous\/more experienced chemistry backgrounds. I personally have a very limited chemistry background so I often struggled on the post-lab quizzes because of the basic fact that I was being tested over something I had not previously learned in detail yet. The time restriction also did not help because showing all our work meant typing out equations and subscripts in an organized fashion into Canvas. I appreciated that Dr. G gave us an extra five minutes because he understood that the online transition slowed things down, but it wasn't enough and I often found myself running out of time mid sentence.",
                "Honestly, just deal with it LOL. It's Dr. G, everyone has to go through it.",
                "I learned a lot in lab and it was structured well. But, I did more work for lab than some of my other classes, and it was frustrating that the lab is just 0.5 credits for all of that work. Lab reports were very tedious and I got many points off for graph details, which I know I need to do correctly but can still be frustrating.",
                "Strength: in-depth learning\r\nWeakness: little time to take prelab and post-lab quizzes",
                "I think there should be more time for pre lab and post lab. Really appreciated the in-person lab experience, though.",
                "The strengths of this course are the experiments in the lab. They are very well planned and executed by all faculty involved. \r\nThe weakness is the amount of time it takes to prepare for lab, do all of the quizzes, do the experiment, and write the report.",
                "I believe that the pre-class videos could be shortened, as they repeated a lot of what was covered in the lab manual.",
                "One weakness to the course I think is that in order to test the students' knowledge base having timed test works against what this course ought to strive for. The time crunch for prelab and post-lab quizzes are very spotty. As educators, it is given that students all work at different paces so it's unfair to reward only those that are fast workers, not those who actually are learning from the class or those with the most correct answers. This practice goes against building practical chemistry knowledge. The way to improve this is to collect data and see what is a reasonable time in which the 75th percentile of students are able to complete this quiz and maybe use that as a starting point for how long a quiz should be. Or better yet, have untimed quizzes.",
                "The course was great. Dr. G was extremely helpful and mindful of the times we are living in.",
                "Strengths: instructor made himself available for help as often as needed; pre-labs were thorough and provided necessary information to succeed in the lab procedures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lab reports started out very lengthy (but gradually shortened as the semester went on). If possible, it would be greatly appreciated if some of the lengthier lab reports were shortened.",
                "Strengths: This course is very well organized and objectives are clear.\r\nWeaknesses: There is a high discrepancy between TAs for lab grading expectations. The prelab videos also often felt repetitive and I wish the postlab\/prelab quizzes were available before the night before lab",
                "The post-lab quizzes just did not give enough time for people to finish the questions, and I wish the grading distribution would be more clear, either outlined in a lecture or something, earlier. However, the TAs were actually nice with grading lab reports this semester. I think it will be more difficult without in-person lab next semester, as it is more difficult to write up the lab reports then.",
                "Dr. G is very approachable and useful in office hours. However, the way he runs his class is fundamentally flawed. The biggest weakness of this class is too much work for 0.5 credits. For one lab period, you would have to watch at least 2 hours of lecture, take both a pre and post lab quiz, finish a lab report, and then go to lab for 2-3 hours. It was all very tedious, but time consuming.",
                "Strengths: Doctor G. is a very kind, approachable and knowledgeable man. \r\nWeaknesses: So so so many. Why is this 0.5 credits? This course had so much work. It's ridiculous. We spent 5 hours just taking quizzes for a lab course. Why?",
                "The course allows students to be very independent and forces them to do their own research.",
                "Strengths include the actual hands on learning in such a weird time. The weaknesses were the work load as compared to the half credit earned and the disconnect between the TA and the students.",
                "Mathew Chow, my TF, was the strength of this course. This course, while not too difficult in concepts and material, had a heavy workload and Mathew was definitely a key factor in guiding me through it.",
                "Strengths: The online lab videos were extremely helpful as it gave me an idea of what I would need to do for lab. The lab manuals were also very helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class is a lot of work for 0.5 credits. I often felt extremely rushed for my pre and post lab quizzes.",
                "This course was honestly pointlessly difficult. The work was graded extremely harshly, and feedback was not very helpful. I felt no connection with anyone in the class or the professor.",
                "Hard to learn from the videos, wish more in person",
                "This course adequately demonstrates general chemistry concepts through the weekly labs; it is a good complement to Gen Chem 161. However, some weeks the workload associated with the lab course were much greater than the lecture course, which did not align given that the lab is only .5 credits. The lab coursework was many times overly specific and demanding, which led many students to focus on finding the correct answers quickly, rather than engaging in and enjoying the chemistry principles intended to be taught through the work.",
                "The workload and rigor for a half-credit lab was far too great. The post-lab quizzes in particular were unnecessarily vague, unclear, and difficult, especially in considering the online format of them, no thought was taken to increase time or make accommodations. This was disappointing. I also believe the General Chemistry professors and Lab Professors should make a great effort to coordinate material.",
                "The class had very long lectures and were very difficult to engage in because I was not personally doing the lab.",
                "I think Dr. G recorded very helpful videos that helped me to understand the experiment and feel prepared to complete the assignments. I always felt like there was very sufficient support for my learning. I thought the live Zoom lab sessions were not very helpful and they were repetitive because I felt like I had already seen the experiment be performed in Dr. G's videos.",
                "One strength of this course was its pre-lab lectures, which helped immensely during in-lab experiments. Another strength was how closely the content of this course related to its associated general chemistry course, as it contributed to a better overall understanding of chemistry.\r\nOne weakness of this course was the lack of instruction concerning the equation sections of lab reports. Much of the time, the lab manuals didnt explain the sequences of the equations used.",
                "The biggest weakness of this course is that it's incredibly demanding and often these demands are arbitrary (a quiz opening at 6pm, about 12 hours before it's due, so it was impossible to get ahead, changing definitions of significant figures etc.).",
                "Strengths: Dr. G is a really great instructor! He's clear about his expectations and his approach to teaching the course, his recorded content was very concise, informative, and engaging, and he had a great presence in the lab when he was present. Preparing for and completing weekly labs and lab reports was challenging but very manageable. Valentina, my TA, was also a really great advisor during and before we started labs. \r\nWeaknesses: It's kind of easy to stack all up all of the work for one or two days during the week, so it's worth thinking through how you're going to organize your work so you avoid overwhelming yourself.",
                "Strengths: I think this class gives students a grand introduction to chemical reactions that are essential to discussion of different topics. I also think Dr. G is a very kind man!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the grading among T.F.s was EXTREMELY inconsistent. I received excellent grades on horrible lab reports from one TF, and horrible grades on my best lab reports for minor mistakes from another TF. The final grading system is designed to be a weed-out course, with poor grades for many students who may have actually done well. The fact that I can get an A by the numbers, but get a B depending on how my classmates performed is absolutely ridiculous. Also, the fact that there is no separate lab for 163 and 161 is horrible. If you are in 163, it is essentially like taking two different, independent CHEM courses since the topics in 163 and 134L do not even come close to lining up. We were learning the about quantum mechanics while doing titrations in chem lab. Additionally, the first few post lab quizzes were incredibly difficult, and the work for this course honestly exceeds the .5 credits for which it is allotted. Either the university needs to recognize that this course is worth more than .5 credits, or the course needs to be dialed back. I'd prefer the former.",
                "Dr. G made great videos to reference for the strictly virtual learners. \r\n\r\nIt was hard to make office hours especially toward the end when all in-person labs went virtual. \r\nIn the beginning, feedback was a little slow. I would have benefitted from early feedback in order to correct chronic mistakes on lab reports.",
                "Strength was that the professor provided lots of material that promoted a well rounded understanding. Weakness was that the course was not very engaging. Watching the recorded video of the lab prior to the lab day followed by watching the same lab being done again was not very engaging.",
                "The strengths of this course were the depth in which the material was covered and expanded on from the lecture class. The effort put into teaching the course by both the instructor and TF made learning in this course easy and enjoyable. The weaknesses of this course was the lack of time necessary to do well on the post-lab quizzes, as well as all lab assignments being due on the same day of the week. One way this course could be improved could be by extending the time on the post-lab quizzes and spreading out assignment deadlines over the course of the week.",
                "Most of the experiments were very engaging and rich with learning value. The manuals that our instructor provided us for the labs were really easy to follow and allowed us to learn a lot from the experiments. I do think however that the recorded lectures did not completely match the quizzes that we would have to take before the labs. However, the recorded lectures and demonstrations were a crucial part to my learning in this class.",
                "I think that this course required a lot of discipline, scientific reasoning, as well as good lab-writing skills. However, I do think that the workload for this course was very large given that it is only a 0.5 credit course. I think that the students should be given more time to complete post-lab quizzes, or maybe only have them bi-weekly. On top of the pre-lab quizzes and the lab report, they were truly time consuming to prepare for.",
                "This coure has a heavy workload for a .5 credit course which should be made clear at the start of the class. The lab reports are often unrealistic in terms of diffiuclty since it is hard to know what is worth points. Having a rubric for all lab reports would make this issue better. The pre and post lab quizzes were also often unrealistic and tested on obscure facts rather than an overall understanding of the lab. More well rounded quizzes would make the course better.",
                "Being remote, one of the benefits was not having to deal with failed or frustrating experiments. That being said, watching a 3-4 hour long zoom session of someone else doing a lab seems to defeat the purpose of lab and gets dull very quickly. There is also a lot of work and stress associated with the quizzes (some of which are too long for the allowed time) and the long lab reports. The grading of the reports are also sometimes very unreasonable and emailing the TFs is often not helpful. It is better to go directly to Dr. G about a grading question. There was also a lot of inconsistency between each TF where some would take off points for something explicitly stated by Dr. G to do.",
                "A lot of work, and the grading is inconsistent among the TAs.",
                "The fact that this course was 0.5 credits made me think the workload wouldn't be as heavy as my other classes, but it was a lot of work. I realize that's normal at an institution like Yale, but to me, the discrepancy between the weight of the course and the amount of work was frustrating at times.\r\n\r\nThis is small, but I was also always very unclear on appropriate significant figures. I would often check with my TF to make sure all my significant figures were correct, but then my lab reports would be docked points mainly because my significant figures were wrong.",
                "Dr. G and his late lab report policy. I accidentally submitted the wrong lab report on time. I did not get my lab report grade until 2.5 weeks after the lab. It was then brought to my attention that I submitted the wrong report however, I provided Dr. G with screenshots of the last time I modified the lab report and he still took off late points, even though I never edited the correct lab report after it was due.",
                "Weaknesses: I felt as though I did not learn as much about the concepts we went over. The lab reports were tedious as were the lab quizzes. \r\nStrengths: It solidified certain skills for me: graph making, significant figure rules.",
                "There is way too much work for this class for it to be 0.5 credits. It is the equivalent of 1 credit. The pre and post lab quizzes were very difficult, and 2 or 3 points should not have been taken off just for significant figures, especially if the test was only out of 20.",
                "I think the organization of the course was very thought out. The order of labs and what they taught made sense, as each lab built on the knowledge of the last. I also thought it paired very well with my chemistry course, and I would always learn about concepts before applying them to my lab, and I could draw in that knowledge when writing lab reports.",
                "I really appreciated how Dr. G gave us templates for the lab reports. This helped me know exactly what information he wanted me to get out of the lab before even completing the lab.",
                "The strengths of the course was that it was organized and easy to know what was expected of me. However, it was challenging to know how well I was doing in the course and the grading was very meticulous and easy to lose points even though I felt I understood the material.",
                "One of the strengths of the course is the in-person lab component because it serves as immediate feedback of whether we have mastered a skill or not. One of the weaknesses of the course is that a lot of the information required for the quizzes, you had to know or teach to yourself, so if your specific chemistry lecture wasn't teaching that or you didn't have a strong background in chemistry, you were at a disadvantage compared to other students. Additionally, the expectations for the class weren't always clear. For example, to get points on the lab report, you had to do very specific things, but we didn't always know what was expected.",
                "I wish that things were not graded so harshly. Dr. G instructed his TAs to never give partial credit, and it often resulted in unfair grading practices.",
                "Strengths: well-explained content, helpful professor\/TA\r\nWeaknesses: --",
                "No strengths. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: SO much work for a 0.5 credit class, it was actually unbelievable. Spent more time working for this class than for some of my 1.0 credit classes. Pretty strict about the lab report grading and frankly, I think it really depended on which TA was grading your report that week. I also often got points off for questions that Dr. G specifically helped me with. The quizzes, specifically the post-lab ones, were sometimes difficult to complete in the amount of time given.",
                "Unnecessary work and very very tedious. Honestly most students are there to fulfill a STEM major req and it shows.",
                "Longer time for the post-lab quizzes would be beneficial, it was hard to type it in the computer and to also think about how to answer.",
                "A strength is that you do get a very basic introduction to doing a chemistry lab (or pretty much any wet lab in general). It's very valuable to learn all of these skills with pretty low stakes experiments (even just things like lab dress codes, how to use a buret\/other equipment not in many public high schools, how to write a lab report). The biggest downside of this course is that it is way more work than 0.5 credits. Purely time-wise, we have many hours of prelab videos, prelab quizzes, lab for several hours, postlab quizzes, and then lab reports. This meant that often students had to sacrifice truly learning the material for trying to get through it quickly because there was so much.",
                "Strengths: Engagement of TAs in their teaching, the clarity of directions given prior to lab time, amount of material given before lab time, availability of help for lab reports.\r\nWeaknesses: Strictness of lab grading after lab report guides stop being given.",
                "Great learning experience to be in-person.",
                "The pre- and post-lab quizzes ensured that all necessary knowledge was acquired prior to the lab, which was very helpful in assuring appropriate procedures in the lab. This course was very helpful in my learning how to write a formal lab report and the expectations thereof. The only downside was that only 0.5 credits were earned for this course, while it was of a considerably greater workload than any other course I took this semester.",
                "Strengths: It provides basic experience in a chemistry laboratory.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the majority of my time spent on this class has been more about tending to the technicalities on the syllabus than chemistry.",
                "The strength of this course is that it was accessible. I was in an online section, so I was able to take the course remotely the entire semester. It was very convenient. However, that made it much more difficult to stay engaged with the course and the material. Regardless, it was nice knowing the labs were being performed in real-time.",
                "I loved my lab TF and the content of the labs was interesting. The lab quizzes did not provide enough time to complete well, especially having to show all of your work on a computer, that took up a lot of time. It was very difficult to do well with the time crunch.",
                "The strengths of this class were the success of the labs (if you follow the procedure, your data will look good) and the fact that we learned practical lab skills. The main weaknesses were the structure and grading of this class. For only a half credit this class takes up a ton of time and it is very difficult to succeed. Worser yet, I felt like the thing holding back my grade was wasn't my understanding of the labs but rather minor errors on lab reports and the time crunch of the quizzes.",
                "It was a bit rushed. Especially during COVID times; it felt like an endless loop of lab reports on top of lab reports. The TAs and Dr. G are great and are very enthusiastic to teach and help the students learn, but I would spend on average 9 hours on lab reports and many more hours on studying for the quizzes.",
                "The strengths were that the instructors were very passionate about chemistry and really wanted us to learn, the weaknesses were that it was often hard to focus on a zoom call of that length. My TF did give us breaks during the zoom which was helpful, but I think maybe somehow making it more interactive would help. It is just really hard to do that in a virtual format.",
                "I think that the labs were engaging, informative, and fun. They did not take too long, but they were not too easy. My only issue with the class is that it is obviously geared towards CHEM161 students more than 163 students. I understand why this is and it didn't bother me that much. It just made it feel like I was taking two chemistry classes rather than one which had a lab portion. This isn't a problem, just not what I expected this semester.",
                "I thought this course was great. I think I learned a lot, both in terms of the content of the course and then just about being in a lab and doing experiments in general. The instructors were great. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "I wish it would be more engaging during online lab",
                "The material was explained fairly well but the prelab videos were very long and sometimes the lab report instructions were a bit unclear.",
                "There isnt a lot of clear instruction and organization, and grades for weekly quizzes are heavily based on memorization, and often cover concepts that havent fully been explained yet. The TAs are all very nice!",
                "weaknesses: workload, inconsistent grading, time limits on quizzes were often not long enough\r\nimprovements; greater engagement with the students to ask for feedback",
                "Post labs were very difficult",
                "Overall course was helpful and lab manuals were detailed\/Dr. G's recorded lectures were clear and concise. However, course workload was overwhelming at times.",
                "This course was not graded at an even level for the entire class, as some students scored far better on graded lab reports, even though they had similar answers\/responses.",
                "The lab procedure and pre-lab lectures were very informative and helpful, and the TAs were always good at answering any questions. However, the lab reports felt more like fill-in-the-blank questions instead of actual reports. In addition sometimes grading was a bit slow for reports.",
                "Very comprehensive course I feel prepared for subsequent levels. Perhaps lab report requirements could be clearer",
                "Spent a lot of time working on the material outside of lab time for not much time actually spent there.\r\nKind of missing a synthesis component, maybe that should not be expected in a lab course",
                "A weakness of this course was the course load. A strength of this course was how much background information I received for each lab.",
                "I found it frustrating to type in the equations and steps for the post and pre lab quizzes as it was very time consuming given that the quizzes were timed. I could easily solve the problems but transferring the steps into the text box took forever.",
                "The strengths were that the teaching staff were all very helpful and were always willing to answer questions to the best of their extent. I think one thing that can be improved is the quizzes. I feel like the pre-lab quizzes were fairly easy and you had enough time to complete them, but the post-lab quizzes took so long to complete that it was nearly impossible to finish them on time.",
                "Strengths: in person when other classes were online; hands on; complex, high level labs offered to first years\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: prelab videos were often a bit boring and could have been shorter; a lot of work watching all those videos and then taking the quizzes",
                "I liked how the lectures were prerecorded and could be viewed at any time, but I dont have any suggestions",
                "I feel that this course sometimes seemed more like an attempt to create the perfect lab report rather than the learning of chem lab.",
                "I think it was really nice that it was in person, but I do think that theres a lot of time spent waiting for everyone to finish to start the next part that could be avoided to save time.",
                "This course is intense but teaches you very important time management skills. For that I think this course was successful. I learned a lot from this course, and I do not think I could have truly understood the concepts I was learning in Chemistry lecture without Chemistry lab. However, this course is very demanding, and the workload is definitely the same as a full credit course, not a 0.5 credit course. Because of this, I think that adjusting the quiz format to be more fair to students would be great. If there is any way for the quizzes to be taken on a paper format (i.e. scanning and uploading the quiz), it would immensely help students to apply their knowledge without having the difficulties of typing up complicated calculations or potential technical difficulties. In fact, because of a technical issue, I lost all of my work for a quiz, and with a paper format quiz, this would not be a problem. I hope that this suggestion can be taken into consideration.",
                "I learned how to organize all lab equipment as well as the purpose of many lab experiments.",
                "I enjoyed the in-person element of the lab. It was a great opportunity to meet people and do hands on work in a classroom setting. I also though the lab manuals and lecture videos were clear. A weakness was the grading. The post-quizzes had too little time to complete. Additionally the lab grading rubric was not clear and points were taken off for parts of the lab that did not represent understanding, for example titling a graph took off 3 points of my lab report. This class should be worth 1 credit.",
                "I thought this course was good because I was able to do it in person. I thought that for the most part, the experiments were interesting.",
                "Lab tutors with office hours would have been great. Connecting the data given with concepts learned proved a challenge. Waiting for a response from your lab TA by way of email about questions was absolutely annoying especially when they are due every week. And its even more disappointing when the response in the email was not at all clarifying, which restarts the process and wastes more time. Professor G. could be nice but it was disheartening to ask a question during office hours and get pressured into critically thinking about the concept one has asked about, along with him repeatedly stating its simple, and youre overthinking it. But in the end Dr. G and My Lab TA were helpful.",
                "This course was very good at enforcing chemistry concepts. The Professor and TA was always available to answer questions. I think it could be improved by giving students a longer time period I which they could take the pre and post lab quizzes because they often only opened the day before our lab and there was little room for flexibility.",
                "Lab days were fun, but the course was heavy busywork.",
                "The strengths are that the lab really allows you to learn how to complete the work on your own. The weaknesses are that the lab quizzes are very harsh grading and super short amount of time to complete. Also the lab reports are extremely tedious and the workload for the lab is greater than most 1.0 credit courses.",
                "I dont think we could have done anymore than what we did",
                "This class contains multiple interesting experiments, but they were overshadowed by the tediousness of the workload.  The amount of work is quite reasonable, but I don't know that I have ever felt more like I was just working for minute details in the grading rubric than I did while writing the lab reports.  Given the large role the lab reports played, this dominated my experience of the class.  I understand that formatting is important for science, but I find the focus on things like first person pronouns to be misplaced.",
                "I wish we had more time for the quizzes. I often felt really rushed and that I wasn't really processing things that well. The remote adaptation of this course worked fairly well, and I felt engaged during the Zoom sessions.",
                "virtual is very difficult - our TA Mathew Chow was incredible and very engaging\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\nwayyyy too many quizzes for something we are learning virtually\r\nleaves little room for growth or engagement compared to the lab reports which were very helpful and taught me a lot and helped my connect lab to chem lecture",
                "This course could be improved my having more explicit directions for the lab reports. Too many points were counted against the students for either details not discussed.",
                "The class was stressful and the quizzes were difficult.",
                "Strengths: general chemistry laboratory skills\r\nWeaknesses: Post-lab quizzes did not allot sufficient time",
                "Weakness: The Grading is TOOO harsh. I got points taken off for things like not creating the table chart boxes in the same size, which was impossible because when a phrase is too long, it goes to the next line, making the box size bigger. Ridiculous gradings. Also I do not learn from mistakes because they take so long to grade that once i receive the grade, i don't bother looking back because it's ancient and \r\nStrength: Dr. G is nice in person.",
                "The labs were nice although the way pre-lab and post-lab quizzes were structured made some days have significantly more work than other days.",
                "The weaknesses of this course is that it should not be counted as a 0.5 credit class due to the insane amount of work and preparation that needs to go into obtaining the grade you want. In addition, I felt grading was unfair and inconsiderate to students who come from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM (especially those who had never taken a rigorous chemistry class before) because your grade was based on a curve. The average grade which corresponded to a B was calculated given the scores of everyone taking 134L, which included people in Chem 163 who had more background in STEM. There were also a dissonance between the professor and some students taking the class in regards to the timed pre-lab and post-lab quizzes that were not indicative of the mastery of material given that you had to show work\/calculations to get full credit which took double the work considering it was typed. The strengths of this course were the TAs who made Chem Lab as enjoyable as possible, especially to those of us taking the course virtually.",
                "Large workload",
                "There is a lot of preparation time needed to get ready for the lab. A strength is that during this time there are many resources that are needed. A weakness is that for virtual labs these resources are ineffective . By this I mean that the virtual lab doesn't allow for the same level of learning as in person labs. Another weakness is that the lab reports are to be done alone, but working together would lead to better learning and understanding of the topics.",
                "Strengths - Comprehensive introduction to basic chemistry techniques\/knowledge and good application of the lecture course material. Also the pre-lab lecture videos, experimental videos, and slideshows were all extremely helpful and provided great context\/info for each experiment! I appreciated that they were all very detailed. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - It was often hard to follow experimental procedures since instructions were lumped into large blocks of text; little guidance was provided during experiments; instructions for lab reports were extremely specific, and any slight deviation from them resulted in lost points; it was a bit difficult to understand quiz content and background knowledge for the experiments and lab reports for students who are not currently enrolled in the lecture course.",
                "The course I felt went at a very rapid pace. However, it was rewarding and fulfilling to finish the assignments every week.",
                "The virtual lab was alright for me, I don't think anything needs to be changed.",
                "Strengths: ample time was provided to fix my mistakes by reconducting an experiment \r\nWeaknesses: the pre-lab videos, pre-lab quizzes, post-lab quizzes, along with lab reports were a very overwhelming and hefty amount of work. THe pre-lab videos were very long.",
                "The weakness of the way I took this course was the virtual nature of it. It is hard to be in lab without actually being able to do anything about it, but I understand this year's constraints very well. The professor and TA did their best to accommodate the needs to the students.  I will admit that the amount of coursework was challenging and it was very easy to lose points in lab reports and the two quizzes per week, but ultimately, students need to learn how to laser focus. Strengths: amazing Professor G who is always on call to answer questions, TAs are wonderful individuals who truly care about students learning.",
                "Strengths: As someone who has had no previous laboratory experience, this course introduced me to a typical collegiate laboratory environment for the first time. The experiments were ordered in such a way that only a few laboratory instruments were introduced at a time, allowing me to become proficient in utilizing the laboratory instruments without becoming overwhelmed. Performing the experiments with the chemical concepts gained from my high-school chemistry course in mind was also extremely interesting to watch since I already possessed a knowledge base for what was occurring in each experiment.\r\nWeaknesses: While the lab reports were helpful in allowing us to process and make sense of the data that we had collected in the lab, they were also extremely tedious and could be shortened in order to better fit more of a half-credit workload, particularly with the post-lab questions. I feel that many of the post-lab questions could be removed from each lab report without sacrificing the quality of the lab reports. The pre-lab and post-lab quizzes felt like typing tests rather than chemistry tests at times; I think these would be best improved by increasing the time limit of a few of them or by allowing us to answer the questions on paper and upload a legible copy of our work and answers.",
                "The course is very hands-on, instructions are clear, and teaching is thorough. There is a slight lack of communication of what is expected of lab reports and quiz answers.",
                "Less work in the day before lab, make the quizzes open prior to 6 pm so as not to make students have to cram the night before their labs its not efficient",
                "The time frame allowed for the prelab work is quite short. Perhaps if it was lengthened, it would ease a bit of the time crunch on the night before lab day. The prelab lectures are a strength of the course, they are very informative and help to connect the labs with our general chemistry lecture courses.",
                "It was very difficult to feel especially engaged in the course over Zoom, as lab session mostly just consisted of myself watching the TA conduct the experiment. In reality, some of the lab sessions felt relatively superfluous, since most of the coursework could be easily accomplished by reading the lab manuals and using the data provided by the TA. That said, TAs tried very hard to make these lab sessions engaging, sometimes converting these lab sessions into office hours to better explain some of the concepts being applied to the experiment. In any case, I did derive some value from observing the experiments in action. The visual aid helped supplement the written manuals, and the lab reports themselves were a welcome exercise in applying course material.",
                "Strengths: Mathew TA was very helpful and accommodating! He took the time to really help students and make sure we understand.\r\nWeaknesses: The lab report expectations and grading system is very arbitrary and it is difficult to know what is expected. Oftentimes, points are taken off due to unclear instructions or questions on the lab report and things unrelated to the actual chemistry\/math of the experiment. Additionally, instructions or lab reports included intentional mistakes in which students were penalized for. Secondly, you are expected to watch multiple long pre-recorded pre-lab videos before each lab date. These were often difficult to follow and disorganized. It wasn't clear what information was actually important and what was not important.",
                "I loved being able to work in the lab, but I didn't like how much of the class' grade was based on the lab reports. It was almost as if our actual performance in the lab mattered nothing.",
                "The strengths of this course were that it was great to be able to work in the lab in a live environment. The weaknesses of this course was that many times the work during the week was very heavy and had tight deadlines. As a result, I felt that sometimes I had to focus on working for a grade rather than taking the time to understand the material.",
                "This course was very good. The workload was very large, but it pays off",
                "The work load for chem lab is honestly higher than chem lecture and many of the various quizzes, especially the post-lab quizzes, did not seem necessary to me.",
                "I thought the 4 hour lecture was pointless because we saw the same thing in the pre-lecture videos. Its only purpose was to get the data.",
                "strengths: you do experiments (if you are in the in-person lab), get to be in the lab and wear a lab coat like a real scientist; you do learn how to write a lab report which is useful for any major and how to use Excel very well\r\nweaknesses: he level of engagement can be low if you are not particularly compelled by the experiments; there is a ton of work and the quizzes are super hard",
                "The strength of this course is that it was very beneficial to learn how conclusions can be made based on experiments. Another strength was that the videos provided clarity in how we were supposed to do the lab and aided in doing the lab reports. I think a weakness for this course was the due dates of the lab reports and quizzes. I think having the due dates overlap was definitely stressful.",
                "The course covers many different experiments and skills that are needed. The experiments were interesting and fun allowing for the time in the lab to be enjoyable. A weakness in the course was the testing system. I found it extremely difficult to complete the quizzes in the time frame since any calculation questions required complicated inputing into canvas that was very time consuming.",
                "The strengths of this course include the detailed explanations available to students about labs. A possible improvement for this course would be a lightened workload that takes less hours per week to complete.",
                "lab quizzes should allow more time and post lab quizzes shoudl be available for students to take right after their lab day if they want to take it. It doesn't;t make sense to make students wait a week and take the post lab quiz while also studying and preparing for the next lab.",
                "The post lab quizzes kind of became a challenge because they did not align with the chemistry 163 curriculum I had, and it was hard being expected to remember most of my high school AP chemistry knowledge.",
                "Can be tedious, especially on lab reports. A high level of precision is required which can feel annoying \/ antagonistic. Also would have been much nicer if the material actually followed what was taught in the 161 lecture course. I was marked down on several quizzes for not knowing basic chemistry material that was taught in subsequent weeks in the lecture course. Labs would also occur either several weeks before or after they were covered in the lecture, so I believe better synergy could be achieved with some simple swaps in the experiment order.",
                "Strengths: I loved being in the lab - there are many instruments, devices, and compounds that were fun to work with. Dr. G and my TA were also extremely kind and helpful - there was never a moment when anyone was left completely lost on what to do. Most people are finished with lab in around 2-3 hours.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The limitations of gen chem experiments. There are some exciting ones like titration, but otherwise most of them were pretty boring. Also, this is more of a warning than a weakness, but the lab reports can be graded extremely harshly by some TAs."

At all times I felt safe being in lab, was able to get help, and when the situation on campus worsened, we were given the option to move online which I felt was appropriate and implemented well. I did feel, however, that all of the videos before lab were unnecessary. The pre-lab lecture that walked through the experiment and concepts was very useful for understand the lab manual, but I felt that a lot of the videos of the experiment were just going through the manual in a slow manner that did not help me understand what I would be doing in the lab much better.",

                "The lectures could have been shortened--I found myself spending hours on end watching the lecture videos each week.",
                "I am glad we had the option to do an in-person lab, I don't think I would have understood what I was doing very well otherwise.",
                "The COVID response of this course was exceptional. Even with an in-person component, this course was safe and I never felt uncomfortable in any situation in the lab with regards to the pandemic. The online components when needed were easy to access and of good quality that facilitated online learning well. Overall if anything could be improved, I think it would be nice to have had the virtual lab sessions be more focused.",
                "Wearing masks during in-person lab and sanitizing the tables made me feel more comfortable taking a class in person.",
                "Virtual lab was great, and in-person lab was good because I got some human interaction. In-person lab was tough without lab partners, though.",
                "Virtual office hours with Dr. G were a great resource during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
                "I had in-person lab, and I think that the precautions geared towards learning during the pandemic were rather effective. There were much fewer people in the labs, masks were always required, and students stayed socially distanced from one another. Students also had the choice to take remote lab if they were not comfortable with in-person lab.",
                "I think all of the adjustments that we made for the pandemic were successful and necessary.",
                "The course immediately took preventative steps by offering remote lab options when cases were spiking on campus. We were also obligated to clean and sanitize our stations when we finished in person labs.",
                "The option to do virtual lab was successful and very well set-up. Although I started out doing in-person lab, I was grateful to have the option to do virtual lab when I did not feel comfortable or was unable to go to my in-person lab.",
                "This class worked well in lower capacity since it was smaller and we could have more individualized help",
                "I think we need to get rid of some pre-lab quizzes or post-lab quizzes - it is nice that one of the post labs can be dropped. However, I think we need more time for the quizzes, 20 minutes doesn't cut it.",
                "Less work. Having us take quizzes that involved calculations in a textbox is just not fair to students. Also, telling students to figure when their internet is best to take online quizzes is evil. How can having bad wifi be considered a \"learning experience.\"",
                "We were instructed to wear a protective face mask and gloves the entire time we were in the lab and were kept 6 feet apart. However there was shared equipment, which has the potential to spread the virus.",
                "The in person socially distanced lab succeeded, the virtual lab did not.",
                "Any class held over Zoom is extremely difficult to stay engaged in-- lab was one of the hardest. However, I think one of the key factors that forced me to stay engaged in this course was the prerecorded prelab and lab demos and the pre- and post-lab quizzes.",
                "The virtual lab was very difficult to accommodate because there is no interaction with the students. I do not know how to use any of the lab equipment or do any of the experiments myself, and I feel underprepared for future labs.",
                "Maybe more teaching of the materials that will be studied in the lab",
                "The in-person lab paired with the remote pre-lab work was a good combination. Daily virtual office hour availability was very helpful in understanding the material.",
                "Lab is obviously just one of the hardest classes to adjust to an online setting. I felt that for what it was, Professor G and TF Mathew did a good job, but lab may just be impossible to make into an online setting.",
                "Recording the lab and posting them in the media library like Professor G did for the prelab videos would save time and be helpful as I can pause and rewind. The live lectures werent engaging and I often struggled to pay attention.",
                "I thought the format of pre-lab videos was very helpful, but the live Zoom lab sessions were not as helpful. The format of giving us the data over Zoom was awkward, but given the situation, it worked. I still learned the concepts despite the situation.",
                "COVID-19 protocols required different PPE, and the implementation of these protocols was a success.\r\nAccess to instructors was severely reduced due to the pandemic and could be improved.",
                "The virtual lab when run by Dr. G was entertaining and engaging and I thought it was a good option when in-person lab felt unsafe.",
                "Recorded pre-lab content was really useful and worked really well, though I think that was part of the class even before COVID. The weeks when we had to do virtual labs, I thought that the lessons were really well-done and interesting despite not being able to get the usual hands on experience. Participating in lab while maintaining COVID precautions wasn't really ever a problem. I suppose office hours and ways to interact with Dr. G and the TAs weren't always super clear, but that wasn't a huge problem.",
                "I think the fact that the lab was provided in person for some students was amazing, in that it allowed for students to get hands on experience and get out of their dorms for once. However, I think that the TFs were slightly unavailable outside of the lab.",
                "Dr. G's videos were top notch. I utilized them often. I didn't gain as much from my actual lab session since I had already seen the videos and familiarized myself with the experiment and procedures.",
                "Little was done to promote student engagement. Videos of the labs posted to Canvas were helpful, but then during the lab day, the same exact thing happened. Having both felt unecessary. Also, having online quizes was frustrating as many of the times they required the input of math and equations that took a long time and required getting used to. This could be imporved by using a different program from Canvas for the input of such quizes.",
                "The instructor's pre-recorded videos completing the experiments and the pre-recorded pre-lab lectures definitely succeeded. They allowed for a depth of learning that I didn't think was possible in a virtual lab class. The live virtual labs on Zoom taught by the TF also succeeded and allowed for virtual engagement and plenty of room and time to participate and ask questions if necessary.",
                "Conducting in-person labs went much better than I expected. With social distancing, it was still very feasible to conduct our experiments comfortably and safely, which I really appreciated.",
                "I think that this course really succeeded through the online format. I was originally worried with the virtual lab format, but I think the TFs were very well trained for the remote lab version. The course was planned very clearly, and the deadlines and timings were clear. I did start the lab remotely in Asia, so the timezone was very difficult given that it meant I was taking the class past midnight.",
                "Being sent data and not having to deal with failed experiments was definitely nice, but watching the live zoom sessions was very boring. The TF tried his best to engage us, but there is little he can do when it is 3-4 hours and we cannot do anything but watch.",
                "I don't know how many people are in the lab during a normal year, but I loved that my lab group was relatively small. It allowed all of us to move around the lab efficiently and get plenty of one-on-one time with our TF if needed.",
                "Difficult to engage virtual students, not sure how it could be improved though...",
                "The four hour lab in addition to 1-2+ hours of video per week were stressful. Id appreciate either the lab or videos being cut down slightly, as well as not having the pre-lab, post-lab, and lab report due within the same 6 hour window.",
                "I think I had enough background knowledge from the videos to complete the lab, so I would consider the switch to a virtual platform in that sense a success.",
                "Dr. G and the coordinators of this class in amazing job and showing that we could be in-person. This is my only in-person class, and Im extremely grateful for the opportunity to step foot into the chemistry labs conduct experiments with my peers in a socially distance and safe environment. Through cleaning the desks before and after use, I always felt safe coming to lab!",
                "I think they succeeded in showing us what was expected of us during the each lab before each lab day. There could be improvement in making the material in the pre-lab videos more efficiently delivered as they took longer than necessary.",
                "Staying 6 feet apart in the lab wasn't always possible, but I think given the space, they did the best they could to adhere to health guidelines. There's also an option to take the virtual lab if you prefer.",
                "Succeeded: all, recorded lab and virtual lab",
                "I liked the option to have online lab, which I will be doing next semester.",
                "The way the quizzes and lab reports were graded by different TAs and sometimes even Dr. G, the lab instructor, gave the course a sense of inconsistency. I wish they had a clearer rubric, because some of the students' work was not graded all that fairly.",
                "Virtual lab was really not that useful. I 100% understand why it had to be done, but it really did not help with much. I am very grateful that we got as many weeks of in-person lab as we did. Additionally, the prelab and postlab quizzes had a time crunch on them because we had to type out math which is very unnatural, and often I had trouble with canvas.",
                "As this course was taught in person for the majority of the semester, I assume its practices were quite similar to those of normal years. Towards the end of the semester, however, the online lab days were adequate but less engaging than the in-person labs. However, this makes sense considering the nature of the course.",
                "The covid practices were adequate.",
                "The online sections were very helpful. It was nice watching the prelab videos each week to gain a better understanding of the experiment we would perform\/watch be performed.",
                "The recorded lectures worked fine, but the timeframe of the quizzes were not ideal. I understand the time limits (though some were quite difficult to finish) but the fact that you have to cram lectures and quizzes into a small timeframe before lab made it difficult.",
                "The post-labs that were added because of COVID did not help at all.",
                "The protocols in lab felt rather safe. I encountered no problems with contacting my TF or the professor with questions via email.",
                "I think that I definitely lost a lot of opportunities to get familiarity and practice with the lab equipment because my lab was virtual, but this seems to be kind of inevitable during a pandemic. I'm not really sure how this could be improved, it seems like it is just making the best of a bad situation.",
                "I think that the in-person lab sessions were a complete success. Everyone (that I know of) followed the rules and we were able to safely perform the experiments.",
                "The virtual lab was sometimes difficult to be engaged in since data was given to us so we didn't have to pay attention much. The online recorded lab lecture videos that we had to watch were super helpful for knowing what to do during the lab. I really appreciated those.",
                "When we switched to virtual lab with Dr. G, I think it would be more helpful to watch Dr. G actually perform the experiments (i.e. not have us watch the videos in advance, and rather just watch it over Zoom). I also think it would be helpful to post the data on the Canvas page after the Zoom meeting.",
                "Dr gs willingness to help",
                "Lab seemed safe during the pandemic (we all wore masks given to us as well as gloves)",
                "The organization of the class left much to be desired, and it was difficult to reach professors\/TAs. For example, there were several times when a mistake would be made by the professor on the lab report template that needed to be corrected by students. Rather than sending out an email, the professor would tell a couple of students, who would then have to spread the correction through word-of-mouth.",
                "recorded pre-lab videos were available to provide insight on the week's experiment; lab methods (online\/virtual) were pretty flexible",
                "Conducting a lab course remotely is difficult, but I appreciate the professor and TAs' efforts in making this course engaging and nevertheless valuable!",
                "This courses succeeded in its COVID-19 response.",
                "In person lab went very well. The virtual labs towards the end of the semester did not feel very informative, though, and did not make up for the experience that in person lab should have entailed.",
                "Everything went as well as possible",
                "Not having lab partners was not great in terms of both completing experiments in person and then working on lab reports and other assessments outside of class\r\nOnline Canvas quizzes (pre and post lab) with strict timers did not help to reinforce my understanding, I would have preferred another method but I don't have an idea for alternative",
                "During the mini outbreak on campus, it was helpful that the course switched from in person lab to virtual lab.",
                "The ability to have labs easily switch to the online format was very useful given the COVID pandemic.",
                "I liked the prelab recorded lectures and lab previews.",
                "I had in-person lab so I think this succeeded pretty well because I was able to do everything that you would do in a normal lab.",
                "The in person labs were amazing and made this my favorite class; when I had to go to on line labs, my participation dropped and it was hard to stay engaged for that long. I felt that when I did not personally do the experiment myself, I did not really understand the procedure\/what was going on",
                "I appreciated the professors offer to go virtual when cases started to rise. The course was still run smoothly despite short notice",
                "I think that being in person was very helpful and the one time I was on zoom, I was much less engaged. Maybe making the online segment more interactive could be helpful.",
                "There is no right way to go about virtual lab, and I think that the TFs and Dr. G approached this very well this semester. The only thing I would change is the quizzes. Typing up calculations was a continuous problem that my peers and I had throughout the semester. These issues could have been improved by 1) giving us more time for the quizzes or 2) changing the quiz format to a paper format. I hope that these suggestions will be considered so that other students will not have to experience similar issues in the future.",
                "It was successful because I felt safe in the lab setting and the protocol was good. It was enjoyable to be working with my hands and with other students in person.",
                "I did not enjoy the prelab lectures. There were too many of them on top of all the other work for the course.",
                "I think the virtual adaptation of the class was done very well.",
                "I admire that the class was able to be run in person, but I hope that the virtual sessions can be less lecture-based",
                "The quizzes online were good. I think that there needs to be a bit more engagement in the virtual lab because it can be quite boring and you don't learn much.",
                "Theres not much that could be added to the class",
                "I appreciated the virtual labs and how I was still able to learn even though we were not in person. I also like how I still felt safe due to the Covid precautions held in the lab.",
                "Its very unfair that we could not use computer\/internet problems as a valid excuse to make up quizzes on canvas during an ONLINE semester. There should be a policy for that in the future. \r\n\r\nI appreciate having the option to do in person vs online lab.",
                "The recorded lectures and demo videos from Dr. G were very helpful, and well made.  The practice of sending virtual students the lab data was also helpful, although it did remove some of the incentive to focus during class.",
                "less quizzes, more engaging learning materials",
                "I believe that all succeeded. The regulations put into place during in-person class made all students feel comfortable.",
                "Good practice on social distancing in the laboratory",
                "I thought it worked well.",
                "Online lecture before lab was very helpful because it streamlined the in-person lab process. We already knew what we should be doing and how to do it by The time the lab started.",
                "Allow me to be a few minutes late to lab, it is hard to walk up the the science hill!",
                "COVID-19 protocols were followed within the lab.",
                "In person lab was conducted great",
                "The in person, socially distanced labs succeeded. The virtual labs need to be improved so that students can potentially have more understanding of the intricacies of the lab rather than simply getting the results.",
                "Online lectures with lab demonstrations were given for 2 weeks when students could not attend lab in person due to a small outbreak of covid on campus; I thought this was a great idea because in-person students who were uncomfortable with attending class in person due to the outbreak could avoid the risk and not miss out on class instruction.",
                "I really liked the virtual labs because it gave us time to ask our TA questions.",
                "The virtual lab was successful; I was still able to learn despite never stepping foot in a lab.",
                "Being provided the option to go to lab virtually fit well during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
                "Lab sessions were a little boring because there is not much to do other than sit there and watch for a few hours straight. But I'm not sure how this can be improved given the circumstances.",
                "The social-distancing aspect of in-person lab did not detract from the quality of the lab. In fact, I found that performing the experiments individually was actually more helpful since we were able to obtain guaranteed hands-on experience with the various laboratory instruments. I do not feel that the pre and post-lab quizzes translated well to a virtual format. Due to the nature of the Canvas user interface, it felt more like a typing test rather than a chemistry quiz at various points. I believe this would be best countered by allowing students to write down their work and submit an uploaded external PDF of the quiz, although increasing the time limit of each quiz could also work. I also found the virtual lectures and pre-lab videos to be extremely helpful in understanding the purposes of the experiment, the chemical concepts behind each experiment, and the performance of the experimental procedures. I believe that the lectures and pre-lab videos would be a very useful resource for future CHEM134L students.",
                "The virtual labs I attended lacked virtual engagement and felt unnecessary seeing as the lab procedure is highly detailed and recorded in prelab lectures and lab report. In contrast, the in person labs highly benefitted from the recorded pre-lab lectures because there was greater knowledge of what the expectations for the lab were.",
                "I think the in-person segment was carried out very well with good precautions in place.",
                "Having quizzes and all assignments due the day of lab and not available for submission until the night prior was a big drawback",
                "As mentioned above, lab engagement could be improved considerably. Lab sessions generally consisted of 4-hour long Zoom sessions that ultimately proved incredibly fatiguing for my eyes. Although we were afforded breaks during the sessions, I still could have done with an alternativeor at least shortermode of engagement with the course. Overall, this lab was very difficult to adapt for a post-COVID-19 world.",
                "The course should be more accomodating to various time zones (ie the times in which quizzes on canvas can be taken should be open for longer periods of time in order to allow for students in various time zones to take it at appropriate times).",
                "I think having virtual lectures to prepare us before we actually came to the lab was good, so we weren't entering the experiment blindly.",
                "The wiping down process and all of the safety procedures such as changes masks and such",
                "The option for virtual-lab was helpful.",
                "I thought the length of the lecture was way too long and uninteresting.",
                "My section was remote through zoom and it went by pretty smoothly. It think that the TAs could be supplied with better cameras to ensure the quality of the images. Sometimes the image was a little blurry, because the camera couldn't zoom in properly. It wasn't very engaging when it was online. Maybe the students could be supplied with home kits to complete the lab.",
                "I think that having the pre-lab lecture and videos available online was a success. I also think that the virtual office hours were a success as well. One thing that could be improved was the engagement during online labs.",
                "The course worked well and was enjoyable despite being during the pandemic. The online lectures and demonstrations made it so that my time in the lab was safe and efficient. The lab itself was very safe, and I felt comfortable at all times.",
                "prerecorded lectures for lab prep was very helpful as was my TA Mathew Chow (he was the best!) who would do a short lecture\/experiment concepts overview at the beginning of our zoom lab.",
                "This was my only in person class, so I feel there is not much that can be improved in terms of COVID.",
                "Great.",
                "The prelab recordings were extremely helpful - I was often able to get through labs quickly because I knew what to do and what to expect in terms of results. I also heard horror stories about how lab notebooks used to be collected and graded harshly - for better or for worse, we didn't have to worry about that this year. In my opinion, not having to worry about recording everything in my notebook helped me focus taking note on the procedures and reactions involved in each experiment more effectively (it may have been chicken scratch too, but it was chicken scratch I could decipher!). We were also given lab report templates, which were helpful in building the foundation for what a report should look like.",
                "I though that the safety precautions taken to ensure everyone's safety during the in-person laboratory sessions were well suited to allow students to participate in lab while still maintaining their safety and that of the community."

                "Yes, especially if the student is pre-med or requires a lab class for their major.",
                "Would not recommend. One of the least-enjoyable classes I have taken at Yale so far. Level of engagement and interaction with the professor is very low - virtually none at all. Lab report writing instructions are not clear, but are graded extremely harshly by a different TA each time, which makes feedback very inconsistent and all the more confusing.",
                "Only take it if it is a requirement.",
                "I only took this course for premed requirements.  If a student wasn't premed, I wouldn't wish this on them.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. The laboratory skills taught in this class is something I highly value, and having the opportunity to see chemistry in action rather than through lecture really helped me better understand the material.",
                "If you want lab experience that will be very rigorous, this is a fine course to start with. You will need to learn how to operate in the lab, and this will teach you that. If you are intending to pursue any biology and chemistry studies, this course is also required and will certainly be helpful in future classes. But if you are just looking for an easy class to get some lab experience, this is not that course. This class is intense and time consuming, and while you will learn, the work load is more of that of a full credit course.",
                "Yes, but be warned that the work is a lot! It will probably be more than all of your other non-stem classes combined! You learn a lot and it can be fun, but make sure you don't fall behind or slack off.",
                "If only to fulfill a major requirement.  CHEM 134L was a largely unenjoyable class that imposed unnecessarily stringent grading rubrics, a mechanical emphasis on sig figs, and nothing else.  The chemistry concepts themselves are easy to grasp, but the volume of the work involved is entirely incommensurate to the 0.5 class credit you actually earn.",
                "Yes, I would. Because it actually taught me how to properly prepare a lab report which is a skill crucial to all STEM subjects at Yale.",
                "Yes, the lab experience is valuable if you're looking to do that in your future.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students. There were many times during the semester while overwhelmed with work that I didn't enjoy this course, but overall looking back I can see clear evidence of good learning. If you have a general interest in chemistry and want to try some lab work, this course is very attainable as far as the lab skills itself, and I never felt completely lost when doing experiments. As far as the notorious workload, it can definitely be grueling. Expect to write a lab report each week, and the two quizzes each week definitely add to the stress. However, if you work efficiently and give the course the time it needs, the lab reports get easier and the course becomes much more enjoyable. If you are just looking at this course for fun, I would weigh the 0.5 credits with the workload... its no secret that the 0.5 credit does not reflect the work, so make sure you're committed to the workload if you take this course. Overall I really enjoyed this course and gained many practical skills; if you put in the work I think its worth the time!",
                "I would recommend this course to pre-med students",
                "I would recommend this only to pre-med students who have to take it, or for students who truly enjoy lab work. The lab itself was enjoyable, it was just the harsh grading of the lab reports that put a real physical and mental strain on the class.",
                "Again, if you have to take it, you have to take it.",
                "If they want to learn chemistry and how to do lab reports, yes. It is a LOT of work, though, so just be ready for that. Dr. G is super helpful though and wants us to succeed.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course. You will learn the fundamentals of chemistry lab. The rigor will also prepare you for more complex STEM labs to come.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think the combination of Dr. G's lectures as well as in-person lectures with my TF was very effective. I think working with a TF is very helpful because the TF is also a student who has gone through or is currently going through similar experiences as me.",

                "Yes, it is a necessary prerequisite for a reason and the various experiments expose you to so many techniques in chemistry",
                "It's a pre-requisite class to most STEM majors so...",
                "If you are thinking of taking this course, you are probably pre-med and you have no alternative. If you have an alternative, then do it. This class is not worth the stress.",
                "No. Don't. Strongly reconsider being premed. This course should be 1 or even 2 credits with the amount of work I did.",
                "Yes. It provides some baseline chemistry applications that are probably necessary for any science future.",
                "Yes if you need it for your major, if not interested in chemistry, no.",
                "If you have to take this course for a requirement then there is really no other option. If you are taking this course just because then beware that it is a lot of work.",
                "I do not recommend this class to anyone because it was extremely stressful. If the course is in-person I believe it would've been better, but virtual is not ideal.",
                "Yes",
                "no, just no. Only if you have to. The professor is rude and unsympathetic.",
                "If your prospective major requires that you take this course, then yes, I would recommend it. Otherwise, the workload does not equate to a 0.5 credit course, and is not worth the stress unless you are invested in a Chemistry-related career.",
                "Unless you have to, I would not take this course. For a half-credit lab, the workload turns out to be as much if not more than other full-credit courses.",
                "I would recommend this course as it is a requirement but not to non stem majors who do not need to take the class.",
                "I would recommend this course only if a student is taking CHEM 161 and has to take a lab. It is helpful to understand the more theoretical concepts in general chemistry, but is a significant amount of work outside of lab for a 0.5 credit course.",
                "Yes, I thought this was a really nice introduction to lab work. Despite having no previous lab experience, Dr. G's approach to the class made the initial learning process and the entire semester really smooth. I thought that the experiments we did were interesting, my lab group and TA were great to work with, and the lab reports were a fun (but admittedly long) challenge. It's worth noting that because the lab deadlines fall on only one day during the week, it can be easy to push all of the work onto the day before lab, which is not the healthiest move but is still possible if it's planned out well. I suppose my point is that it would probably be smart to think about your work schedule to approach lab in the best way. It's also probably worth mentioning that Dr. G is firm about his expectations and provides a lengthy manual for how to approach various aspects of the class, but this doesn't mean that he's going to be ruthless or a unnecessarily rough instructor - he has his expectations and standards for the lab, and if you use common sense, follow them, and ask questions in you have them, he's great to learn from. Overall, I really enjoyed this lab and the work I did with Dr. G, my TA, and my peers.",
                "If you have to take this for pre-med requirements, then that's that. Otherwise, if you are taking it for FUN, do NOT. While it's doable, this course was EXTREMELY time consuming, and the grading system is awful. However, that's the life of a STEM student. Please do not give up because of this course, as I know a lot of students who are dropping STEM majors and pre-med solely because of how tough this course is. If you take full advantage of Dr. G's help, along with the help of your peers (probably the most important part), you should be able to squeak out an okay grade.",
                "I would not recommend this course virtually since you don't get the hands on experience. \r\nHowever, It's not a total bust if you must take it virtually. I feel like I could enter a lab today and still succeed merely by watching Dr. G's videos.",
                "Would only recommend this course as it prepares students for future labs and normally helps students refine thier lab techniques.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, because it was intellectually engaging. Although the workload was greater than the average Yale College course, it ends up being worth it in the end because of the depth of knowledge that I gained through what seems like a short ten weeks of lab. The assignment deadlines and instructions were always clear, and there were always resources to help you succeed in the class if you are struggling.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course because it was really engaging and although the workload was very high, there was a lot to learn and I think the skills we learned from this course are very applicable to future courses we take.",
                "I do think that the workload of the course is relatively large for that of a 0.5 credit course. However, if one truly is interested in chemistry lab techniques and would like to take the time to explore, then this definitely was a great course. The experiments performed throughout the semester were very engaging.",
                "Only if this is required for your major or for pre-med requirements.",
                "Unless necessary for your major or pre-med, I would not recommend this course. It is not the fun chemistry experiments you would do in high school. There is a lot of stress at every point in the class and you will likely be frustrated a lot. That being said, if you do have to take the course, try to take it in person if you can. Virtual lab is not fun at all.",
                "I wouldn't recommend it unless it is a requirement for your major. Take the freshman orgo if you can!",
                "Yes! It's a great intro to lab practices and doing lab work.",
                "If they needed to take a lab course, this would be required. Although tedious, Id say it was an overall positive\/neutral experience.",
                "Take it if you need it, but otherwise I would not take this class. I think there is a lot of work for this class and the lab reports are a lot and the quizzes as well. Even thought the time in the lab was fun and I enjoyed it, I would not have taken this again.",
                "Yes. Putting topics you learn about in chemistry class into action helps cement those concepts.",
                "I would recommend this course to know soon! However, I would win the student that this is a lot of work for 0.5 credits.",
                "I would recommend this course for someone who is pre-med or very interested in chemistry, but there was a lot of work for a course that is only 0.500 credits, so it is not worth the commitment unless the student is very interested in the material and lab setting.",
                "No. Unless this is required for your major, I wouldn't recommend this class. While the content isn't difficult, the workload is far greater than that of a 0.5 credit class, and it is very time-consuming. However, if it is required for your major, the actual content isn't too bad and you might even enjoy some labs!",
                "If it's a requirement.",
                "Yes, helpful instructors",
                "NO. If you have to take it (i.e. you're a chemistry major or pre-med) then just do it. But this is not a fun class whatsoever and I wouldn't recommend to anyone. The amount of work is frankly just too much for a half credit class.",
                "No.",
                "I honestly would recommend it because it helps with a lot of foundational science skills. BUT THINK OF THIS CLASS AS MORE THAN 0.5 OF A CREDIT. Even Dr. G at the end of the semester said that this class should be more than 0.5 of a credit. It is much more demanding than 0.5 would indicate (honestly more work than some of my other full 1 credit STEM classes).",
                "Yes because it allowed for hands on learning.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student planning on majoring in a STEM field, or planning to take other labs, as it provided a foundational experience in lab equipment and procedures and the proper way to write a formal lab report.",
                "Unless taking this course is required for major\/pre-med requirements, no. This course isnt necessarily difficult, its just pretty time consuming and I dont feel like I learned much from it. The course is more about how to write a lab report in strict regards to sig figs, the procedure, etc. than a chemistry understanding. Overall, I think there are much more fulfilling\/less time consuming courses.",
                "not unless you have to take it for requirement; performing the experiments were always challenging with fear of messing up and it was hard to get help on lab reports since office hours were during lab times. Grading was unfair since some TAs graded more strictly than others.",
                "I wouldn't recommend taking this course unless you're required to or you're a STEM major. It's a lot of work, grading is pretty harsh, and the class was not very enjoyable. Each week, there is at least an hour of pre-lab videos to watch, a four-hour lab slot, a pre-lab quiz, a post-lab quiz, and a lab report that always took me at least 4 hours to complete. If you don't have to take chem lab, then don't. Look for another course that will be more engaging, fun, and interesting.",
                "Only if you need it as a prereq.",
                "Yes, the lab is very interesting for chemistry students and I feel that I had a rewarding experience in the lab.",
                "If you can avoid this course, try to. It's not that bad if you have good time management skills and can somehow find the motivation to quadruple check every lab report for small errors that for some reason strongly hurt your grade, but otherwise the class is a pain and you don't learn much for the amount of effort you have to put in.",
                "Yes, you learn basic lab techniques that are important. Some of the work is tedious, but it is a good, basic course.",
                "No unless you can credit\/d\/fail it. It takes up a lot of time so if you're premed then you'll have to take it.",
                "Yes, I think that it is important to learn lab skills if you want to go into STEM. I took the class virtually, and I found that it was not as difficult as people often make it out to be.",
                "Yes, it's an essential class for any Yale chemist.",
                "Yes. This course is a lot of work, I will be honest. Some of the lab reports are extremely tedious and require a lot of time and effort and preparation for each lab is arduous. However, I learned a lot and it provides really great lab experience. I learned how to use a ton of equipment, carry out various procedures, and a lot of chemistry in general.",
                "Yes. This course is likely required anyway, and while high in workload, I really did walk away with a lot more knowledge than I came in with.",
                "Yes but be prepared to work!",
                "Yes but I would advise them to be very careful when completing the lab reports as it was very easy to lose points for very minuscule details.",
                "Not unless it was required. I feel like I learned more about the process of writing lab reports, but not much else. The workload of this course is not worth the 0.5 credits, unless its a major requirement.",
                "only if required",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, good introduction to laboratory methods and practices, and important foundations course for any of the chem\/bio majors.",
                "I would not, but given the nature of it as a pre-requisite, I would not discourage anyone from taking it either. In other words, I would simply caution students of the high workload and the even grading scale.",
                "Yes, especially when the pandemic is over, as the in person aspect was very well run.",
                "Yes! Great hands-on experience",
                "I would recommend this course for anyone who is interested in science because it helps a lot with understanding certain concepts in chemistry because you get hands on experience in these specific concepts.",
                "Yes I would, but only if it were in person.",
                "Only if you need it as a prerequisite for your major. Its not a bad course or anything but it is very time consuming and very similar to the lecture course",
                "I think this course is important for understanding fundamental skills in a chem lab, so I would definitely recommend it.",
                "Yes I would. CHEM 134L is tough, but it is a great way to not only hone in your chemistry understanding, but also your time management skills for your time at Yale. There is no doubt that this course is challenging, but the amount you learn about chemistry and how to adjust to college level courses is priceless.",
                "It was very fun and interactive.",
                "I would recommend this course if it is necessary for requirements. It was fun to work in the lab environment. However, for 0.5 credits it was a heavy workload.",
                "I would recommend this class to other students who are taking CHEM 161, but only if they would have in person lab. I don't think it's worth doing virtually. (although it's required for many students, so good luck with that).",
                "Not unless it is a pre-requisite for you",
                "Yes! It wasn't too much work and it was fun being able to learn chem lab techniques.",
                "Not online without multiple avenues for tutoring. Just like we have multiple office hours opportunities in lecture we should have the same in lab; multiple TAs with possible different perspectives and ways of explaining.",
                "Yes it is a great course to develop basic lab skills and strengthen chemistry understanding.",
                "If youre in gen chem, take the lab class! It enriches your understanding of many of the class topics",
                "Only if you have to take it.",
                "Yes! Not that difficult",
                "Not unless they were required to take it",
                "Only if they have to.",
                "Not unless required.  Perhaps it would have been better in person, but I don't know if I have ever felt more like I was working for the grading rubric.",
                "It depends. If you are interested in chemistry, I say go for it. But, if you are not, then this course may not be the best. It is a lot of work, but you do get a lot out of it. One of the weaknesses of the course was that there were many quizzes, and we do not have much time to do them which made the class really stressful.",
                "only if you have to take it for your requirements or major",
                "Yes, it is necessary to learn basic chemistry and lab skills to advance in any degree of science.",
                "Not unless they are a STEM major, since there seems to be a lot of work for a 0.5 credit course.",
                "If it is required then yes.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student, unless they absolutely need to take it. This was an extremely time-consuming course for only a half credit. It was really frustrating how the post lab and pre lab quizzes were only made available for a 23 hour window which forces you to do a lot of work in one night, rather than being able to spread out the work over the week.",
                "No unless you have to take it. Topics in lab do not align with chemistry course.",
                "It was a nice introduction to chemistry and Id recommend it as long as you dont slack off.",
                "Yes- but large workload",
                "Yes, knowing the concepts of chemistry and applying it in labs is helpful for those going into chemistry and other chemistry related fields.",
                "Only if you need it for your major or are pre-med; otherwise, the class is quite tedious and time-consuming, little guidance is given during experiments, and grading is quite harsh (you get tons of points off for small things like incorrect significant figures and incorrect formatting and can end up with a bad grade even if your knowledge of the concepts and calculations are all correct in the lab report.) Also if you are not taking this at the same time as the lecture course you really need to study the lab manual and pre-lab lectures to understand the calculations in the quizzes and the lab reports; otherwise you will be very confused about the calculations.",
                "I would recommend this course if a student wants to really dive deep into the applications of chemistry.",
                "If necessary for the major.",
                "Yes. This course provides a solid foundation for laboratory work.",
                "Other than this being a foundational course, Dr. G is a wonderful professor to be mentored by. Although he may be strict, his humor and willingness to help supersedes any challenges the coursework may pose.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who has not had any previous laboratory experience. I would also recommend this course to a student that would want to witness the experimental proof and data backing various chemical concepts, or a student that might want to tangibly visualize various chemical concepts learned in their corresponding chemistry lecture.",
                "The course is a lot of work so Id say if youre highly interested in general chemistry then yes otherwise, no.",
                "Yes overall it was a good course and I learned many new things that can be applied to working in a lab in general.",
                "As is often stated not unless you have to for your major or preprofessional path. It's far too much work for a half-credit course, and hardly enjoyable.",
                "I would not recommend this course at all to any student who wasn't required to take it as a prerequisite. Although the material itself isn't all that intellectually challenging, the grading is incredibly strict, while the conditions under which you are expected to complete everything aren't always reasonable. For instance, we often had 15-20 minutes to complete quizzes both before and after each lab, and sometimes this time proved insufficient to complete all of the questions, especially in an online, typed format. The course is, overall, more stressful than its really worth, and if a student can avoid taking it, I would recommend they do just that.",
                "not unless you need it for your major. The lab is very similar to that of experiments you would have done in AP chemistry.",
                "Yes. It was a hard course, but it is a common requirement and there are people willing to help if you need it.",
                "I would because it is very rewarding to accomplish assignments",
                "Only for students that have to take the class as a prerequisite.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it because it was helpful in growing a foundation and applying my knowledge of chemistry.",
                "I would recommended it to anyone taking an intro course in Chemistry and wanting to follow a STEM path. I think that it is important to be familiar with basic scientific tools and how to write about the findings of an experiment scientifically. However, the course was not interesting to me. It felt like a burden and it was a ton of work. I also did not enjoy the experiments. I took it as a requirement for my major. If the number of experiments is halved and if there aren't super difficult quizzes before and after each lab and if the labs were a bit more interesting (the observation of the result), maybe the course would be better. The teacher is super helpful and so are the TAs, but it was just a lot more work than expected for a 0.5 Credit class. I haven't stayed up for any of my other classes, but I stayed up till 4am to finish a lab report that I started 4 days before the deadline. Be prepared for a lot of work and loosing points for minor errors (however these errors are major in science). I would not take it again if I didn't have to.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's great for understanding the purpose of experiments and experimental validation of existing theories, hypotheses, or laws. In addition, it also teaches students how to create graphs that somewhat-accurately represent data to prove the work of other scientists. Experimental design was also indirectly taught in this course, which may be helpful for future labs as well.",
                "I would recommend this course. It covers the important skills and experiments that are needed in chemistry. The lab reports also challenge you to really think about the concepts and reactions that are occurring.",
                "Not unless they need this class for their major or other goals. For only half a credit, this class requires more hours of work per week than most full credit classes.",
                "This would be a good class for those who do not have experience working in a lab, because they are very clear in our instruction and you follow very direct procedures, which is great for people who do not have the skills or experience in lab yet.",
                "Its a requirement. If not, I wouldn't recommend. The course can be tedious and feel antagonistic, and is MUCH more work that 0.5 credits would imply. Doesn't really help you understand chemistry any better either. The labs are fun (if you get through the large amount of prep work required), though.",
                "Only take this course if you're premed or you need it for your major, especially if you care about your grades. It's difficult to get an A in this class."
