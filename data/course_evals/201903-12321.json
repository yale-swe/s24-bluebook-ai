    "I learned a lot of information as well as frameworks of analysis regarding gender and grassroots politics. My understanding of gender politics and the contestations made to them is richer.",
    "I really liked the fact that this course gave me the historical context for why things in this country are the way that they are today. It fills in a lot of blindspots that I had had -- I really learned a great deal.",
    "I learned a lot about twentieth century labor and women's movements, how thew two are interconnected, and how these movements and politics of the twentieth century continue to influence our political sphere to this day."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: choice of readings was a great balance between readability and intellectual challenge\/insight; Professor has a lot of insights and good questions for us to think through. Weaknesses: so much reading per class that it was impossible to feel like we actually worked through any of the big ideas as cohesively as we might have.",
    "Strengths: You learn a lot but it all feels pretty organic. You also get a LOT of feedback which is good because Professor Klein is constantly pushing you in the right direction. \r\nWeaknesses: There are a LOT of readings, it was my most heavy reading class and sometimes I just couldn't do them all which would make seminar discussion awkward because it's a very small class.",
    "I think the readings and movies were really good, but occasionally the discussions in class were not as fruitful as they could have been. Perhaps what could have helped was more discussion between students, rather than a seeming one-on-one discussion between students and the professor. Also, some of the readings had an overwhelming amount of reading."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Its important to understand how gender based organizing is nuanced and dynamic.",
    "Yes! I thought it was really interesting, and again, I learned a lot. I would, though, strongly encourage readings on transgender issues to be incorporated into the curriculum. Some of the readings may feel dated in their applicability. Professor Klein is really nice, impassioned, and doing a lot of great work in the subject! You will learn a LOT and in a really organic way."
