Professor Shore is brilliant. She is an engaging seminar leader. The readings are dense but rich and rewarding. The weekly conversations are poignant and relevant to modern day life. I could go on.",
                "I loved how Professor Shore guides the class. She is brilliant and I would prefer she speak for 70% of the class!",

                "Yes. Having the opportunity to be in a seminar with Professor Shore is incredible.",
                "Highly recommend! A fantastic introduction to phenomenology (very cool, coming from someone who almost exclusively studied ancient phil), interesting developments in political, philosophical, and religious contexts, and the course compares and contrasts thinkers of the era so well",
                "Yes. Wonderful course",
