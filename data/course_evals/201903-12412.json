   "comments": [
    "Language of venture capital was amazing here.",
    "I have never learned so much in a class, ever. I learned about dynamics of founding teams, the entire landscape of VC, and had the best professor ever.",
    "All soft skills related to VC!",
    "Fundamentals of venture capital, how VC's make decisions and evaluate companies, different areas of VC, financial terms.",
    "I learned a lot about venture capital as an industry and also looking at the nuts and bolts of it.",
    "I definitely would say I understand what Venture Capitalism is now. I've also gained a network related to VC including my classmates, professor, and the guest speakers brought in.",
    "Familiarity with the field of venture capital",
    "I learned everything technical and qualitative about the venture capital landscape, from a deep dive into term sheets and making a deal to what intangibles investors look for in entrepreneurs. I also learned a lot about current trends in VC and the startup landscape through a variety of class speakers that came in to share their insight. In office hour sessions with Professor Torres, I learned about potential career paths in VC and how to get a more comprehensive education on the industry.",
    "I learnt a lot about the various aspects of venture capital, ranging from how to evaluate a company to the various biases that exist in the field",
    "I learnt a lot more about the venture capital industry and the startup environment. I am now able to understand in more depth the structure of a venture capital firm as well as that of a startup and its fundraising process. I learnt what pitfalls founders face when founding startups and how this affects their VC fundraising. I have grasped the main concepts necessary to understanding how a VC firm works and would feel more comfortable and knowledgeable applying to internships or jobs in the VC industry. Finally, I further developed my knowledge of the startup and tech world and feel more at ease speaking about this topic.",
    "This class is a great introduction to the world of venture capital and will make you familiar with the terminology. You get the chance to conduct due diligence on a startup of your choice and use skills learned in the class to write an investment memo for them.",
    "I learnt a lot about what venture capital is and how investors work with entrepreneurs.",
    "Learned a ton about VC. Fantastic class!!",
    "This course gave me rare insight into the secretive industry of venture capital (VC). As a CS major, I appreciated learning about how startups raise VC funding and VCs' perspectives toward investing in startups. I also enjoyed hearing the views of my classmates, some of whom had already founded their own startups or interned at VC funds. Combined with Prof. Torres' and the many guest speakers' VC backgrounds, I now have a well-rounded view of the VC industry and feel that I have the tools to pursue a VC career in the long term.\r\n\r\nThis course is a general overview of the processes that go into VC decision-making. It does not teach technical financial skills like revenue modeling or IRR calculations.",
    "You learn how the VC industry works and the factors that create a strong investment."

   "comments": [
    "I think the strengths are easily guest speakers and their help for the course. I am extremely happy I was able to take this class. It could be improved with more outside class functions so we can network a little more!",
    "strengths: organization of the class, PROFESSOR, assignments are highly relevant to real-world, readings were AMAZING",
    "Amazing class, very well organized and amazing professor!",
    "Oh, so many wonderful things to say about this class! If I could point to a class at Yale that has transformed my worldview and really pushed me to take advantage of the Yale experience, this one is it. As someone from a non-financial background, I learned so much about how venture capital works and in general about the movement of the financial world. It encouraged me to pick up more financial terms, become more plugged into the entrepreneurial environment at Yale and beyond, and to interact with professionals in the field of VC that will serve as future resources. We learned a lot more than just venture capital processes in this class - we learned about how businesses function, philosophy around business success, how to evaluate companies, different types of investing, etc.\r\nI did every single reading for this class! They were palatable, although there were a lot of readings, but being in the course makes you want to read every word. I think the format of a round-table discussion is great; I like it when Prof. Torres lectures though also. The speakers that came into the class were funny and honest (albeit the first two, who were a little boring) about their profession. As a student, we don't get to interact with people who work in our desired fields too often, and this was a nice refresher!\r\nI wouldn't have minded more non-discussion post assignments. I liked writing the final paper and interviewing professionals, but more math and finance could have been nice!",
    "There were great guest speakers and the professor was prepared each class. The readings were also very great.",
    "The course is non-technical and meant to be so. I think it was a really great overview of the industry. Professor was def a plus.",
    "The strengths of this course were the engaging and insightful guest speakers that came in throughout. Professor Torres made sure to invite a group of diverse individuals who performed a variety of roles in the industry to come in and tell us their stories. In turn, their role often related to the topic of the week and we got to ask them questions relating to our weekly blog posts. Another strength was the readings that were spaced out nicely and curated to leave us with multiple perspectives on the current state of VC.",
    "Great class, maybe more into the numerics",
    "Strengths: no perquisites for the course, so students from all majors are encouraged to join; the application process for the course helped bring together a group of motivated students; guest lectures were very inspiring; excellent balance of professor presentation and student participation; peer-to-peer feedback encouraged; weekly blog posts really helpful to grasp the week's course material and read other people's responses before class; great that the professor forced us to reach out to professionals for our final paper as this helped us grow our network in the VC industry; excellent balance of article vs novel readings\r\n\r\nI can think of no weaknesses",
    "The class is great overall and Professor Torres is great.",
    "The guest speakers were definitely a strong highlight of the course. I also really enjoy the readings. I would hope to see more technical aspects of Venture Capital. Perhaps we can have a few problem sets or case studies.",
    "Was perfect. Wouldnt change anything.",
    "I don't see any weaknesses. Strengths include frequent guest speakers, great book selections, and good discussion leadership from the professor."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely. So good and on a topic that undergrads wouldn't really learn about.",
    "YES it is the best class i have and ever will take at Yale with the kindest, most passionate caring professor ever.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are looking to go into venture capital.",
    "Absolutely. See my previous response. Put a lot of time into your application because Professor Torres structures the class based on that and your LinkedIn bio. There's always a long waitlist for the class so don't defer it if you're lucky enough to get in. The application will help you decide if you're interested enough in the material to do the full class. Be prepared to write a 20 page paper at the end of the semester - I'm an engineering major so I haven't done this often, but I found the workload to be much higher than I expected when I finally got down to writing!",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. It is a little niche so make sure you are actually interested in the topic.",
    "Definitely. One of the few courses I have taken at Yale that is an amazing way to gain real world experience.",
    "Yes! Professor Torres is awesome and it's a res college seminar taught 3 years in a row for a reason. Every single of his guest speakers is very prominent and relevant.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to a studenti interested in technology, entrepreneurship, or investing. I would strongly recommend it to someone who has little to no knowledge of VC, as was my case, but wants to learn more about the field.",
    "yes! take it!",
    "Absolutely. This is the best course any student can take if they are interested in venture capital or entrepreneurship. This course is very helpful in narrowing down your career choices. It has inspired me to pursue venture capital as a career in the future.",
    "Yes definitely! If it is offered again next year, I highly recommend the class if you can get in! You'll become familiar with the terminology used by  VCs and get the chance to interact with venture capitalists in the field through guest lectures.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to other students who are interested in investment or entrepreneurship. I had no background coming into this class and now I feel comfortable talking about it.",
    "Absolutely. Every student interested in entrepreneurship or investing should take this course.",
    "Yes!\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in VC, entrepreneurship, or finance to any extent, you should try to get into this course. Yale has very few  if any  VC courses, so this course could easily be your only chance to take a VC course from a professional in the field like Prof. Jorge Torres. Prof. Torres has also just been appointed the new Dean of Pierson College (12\/5\/2019).\r\n\r\nProf. Torres himself is another major reason to take this course. It was evident to us students that Prof. Torres treated this course like his baby, devoting lots of time to making it the best it could be. He would regularly solicit our feedback and adjust the syllabus accordingly. The syllabus was the most beautiful syllabus I had ever seen. Its formatting was easy on the eyes. It covered the most important topics in VC, with excellent, seminal reading assignments, while spreading out the workload evenly and setting clear expectations for each class meeting. Each 1 hr 50 minute meeting went smoothly, progressing at just the right pace and using time effectively without any overruns. In general the course felt well organized.\r\n\r\nFor each of the last 6 or so class meetings, Prof. Torres brought in prominent VCs as guest speakers. Thanks to their talks, I formed a well-rounded view of the VC industry. I appreciate Prof. Torres's generosity in tapping into his relationships to help students.\r\n\r\nThis course jumpstarted my interest in VC. Prof. Torres was encouraging and volunteered to help me prepare for VC interviews. He has a caring and mentoring personality that any student would be lucky to get to know.\r\n\r\nFYI, this course was (and probably still is) highly selective. In fall 2019, according to Course Demand Stats (ivy.yale.edu\/course-stats), 45-50 students expressed interest in the course. After a preregistration application process involving a resume submission and essays, around 18-20 were selected, making this course's acceptance rate roughly 40%. Ultimately, the 18 enrolled students consisted of 8 seniors, 7 juniors, 3 sophomores, and zero first years.",
    "Yes, take the course if you are a founder or interested in VC. I think, however, the course particularly benefits founders."
