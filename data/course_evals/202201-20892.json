                "I gained knowledge of various analytical techniques to evaluate biological samples, including mass spectrometry, NMR, CD, SAXS, and ITC. I also practiced scientific writing and effective scientific communication in our culminating poster presentation.",
                "I learned about and had some hands on experience in some bioanalytical techniques like mass spec, STD NMR, DLS, ITC. Also learned about protein expression, purification, and about galectins.",
                "A large variety of analytical chemistry tools! The Professor and TA worked very hard to make sure that the experiments would run smoothly (they tested the protocols for us beforehand) and there was a lot of guidance for the first half of the semester working on techniques such as: protein purification, concentration measurements, mass spec, NMR, etc. Take a look at the course syllabus for more specifics about what is covered, but generally this class showed me a lot more tools than what I would have otherwise encountered in research."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course lie in the Professor, TA, and material. Professor Malaker is an engaging and knowledgable instructor who effectively explains the pedagogical goals of each exercise and how they will contribute to our overarching mission in the class (identifying and characterizing a protein). Because this was the first year of teaching the course, we worked on far too many instruments. It was hard to gain a deep understanding of the techniques necessary to conduct experiments on our own.",
                "I feel like this course has a lot of potential but was not executed that well (understandably, since it was the first iteration. for any future students reading this, it will probably be very different next time). The premise of having an unknown protein and going from protein expression, purification, to characterization is really interesting. Prof Malaker has a lot of expertise on mass spec, so that was probably my favorite part, and maybe in the future there can be more time devoted to that. \r\nHaving only two weeks at the end for the group project part did not seem to be enough to collect usable data. Also, there were far too many instruments that we learned about at a shallow level - it would have been much more effective to learn about just a few instruments but in depth. This also was difficult because Prof Malaker did not have too much expertise on most of the instruments we were trying to use, and we had to try to ask CBIC staff, so we felt really lost. CBIC staff didn't seem to have that much experience with proteins. Personally, I did not really enjoy the Zoom lectures on the different instrumentation techniques and I don't feel like I gained much from them. I think most of us did not enjoy the long lectures that Eric gave, since only some of what he said was actually relevant. Maybe this course would be better if it met twice a week 2-5pm, with a short lecture by Prof Malaker before each class? Overall, the course started out well but the end part was pretty stressful, and I don't think I learned as much as I had hoped.",
                "Strengths: The course is generally organized (some hiccups and delays in its first year being offered but that is to be expected and was dealt smoothly with grace). The teaching staff was extremely helpful, approachable, and ready to adapt. I think it really helps fill some gaps in the course offerings for the chemistry major, by giving us guidance and hands-on experience with many instruments. This could be helpful for someone already well-versed in research but wanting to see new cool techniques to apply to on-going projects, or for someone with little experience but wanting to get a taste of what different types of research can involve. Some of the strengths can also be its weaknesses, some students may feel that too little time was given to each technique. I personally felt that the independent project at the end gave some freedom to focus in on specific techniques though, and changes will probably be made to the syllabus for future semesters."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Lab classes at Yale often don't relate hands on work to a larger project, but this class did just that! The structure of the course made it like were part of a research team, collaborating and discussing to better approach scientific roadblocks.",
                "Yes, if the course changes substantially in the future.",
                "I think the course could be really meaningful for a student interested in seeing more analytical chemistry techniques, not even necessarily to apply to research. It is also a fantastic opportunity to work in smaller groups, take more leadership in your learning, and get to know some of the CIBC staff and faculty."
