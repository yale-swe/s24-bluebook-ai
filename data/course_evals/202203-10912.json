                "I will be honest and say that I don't feel I learned as much from this course as I thought I would going in, but this is mostly my own fault, as the course involves a large amount of independent learning. I did, however, learn some basic things about how software is designed in the real world, as well as some of the techniques used for doing it well. However, many of the things discussed in class seemed like things you would just pick up naturally from doing a software engineering internship somewhere. Of course, getting some exposure to important concepts, such as the MERN stack, testing frameworks, metrics for assessing the quality of code, the Agile paradigm, and so on could be useful to some. You do also get some hands-on experience from the project that you work on over the course of the semester. In my case, I learned a bit about React, Chrome extensions, and how to test JavaScript with Jest. So, I did learn a fair amount, but I don't necessarily feel much more prepared for a job as a software engineer than I did at the start of the semester."

                "Almost no one goes to class. If you've worked in industry, a lot of what we talked about in class is redundant. Wish the classes were more technical, focused on skill building rather than talking about software engineering high level, processes. Like what if we dove into stacks more? If the class was more like the skill sessions with the TAs I think more people would've gone.",
                "Very useful class for anyone wanting to go into industry. Generally low-stress. Awesome professor.\r\n\r\nLectures aren't directly related to what the class is about (the proejct), yet they're so well put together. A weakness of this class, then, is not incorporating in-class attendance / understanding of the material into the course's goals. Having a quiz or two might make the final project a little less stressful.",
                "More in-depth tutorials about various industry-standard frameworks",
                "Your enjoyment & experience with this course is HIGHLY dependent on the group members in your team. If your team members do not want to contribute it will make for a very poor experience. If you have a good team, then this will a really great experience - you get to work on a long term project and safely fail (or continue and launch a project!).\r\n\r\nI know Timos plans on restructuring the course, which I think will make it better. There needs to be more incentive for team members to contribute to the project, so people don't leech for the entire semester.",
                "The way the class was set up, it was very easy to not go to class and not get completely lost. I think if there was a bigger emphasis on attendance at the beginning, that was groups really understand the importance of learning the teamwork strategies. Also, if each team had to report when they meet to the professor, it would incentivize teams to actually meet more often.",
                "More guest lectures! Seun was amazing!",
                "Strengths: Exposes CS majors to essential software engineering concepts. Professor and TAs are very helpful, always willing to assist.\r\nWeaknesses: Focusing a little bit more on actual tools and frameworks that would be used for the projects would have helped a lot more. I think it would have also improved the engagement of the class.",
                "I think this course could benefit from more in class work. It would be cool to work with teammates in class while having the opportunity to check out what other teams are working on.",
                "I liked the assignments given to help encourage planning early on and the timeline for MVP and our final presentations, but I think experimenting with a flipped classroom format / using some class time for groups to meet and work on their projects would help with accountability issues within groups, and maybe also encourage more attendance during lecture.",
                "I think the idea behind the course is quite sound -- learn software engineering concepts in lecture, work on an actual piece of software in a team outside of lecture. However, these two parts of the course are pretty disjoint, as you don't see much of a practical reason to use many of the ideas from lecture beyond the notion that it's supposedly good practice to do so. Also, being in a team where everyone including yourself is inexperienced can be very difficult at times, and I didn't really feel that there was enough support built into the structure of the course to help with this. There were, of course, TAs, but they, obviously, lacked specific knowledge about your team's project, and so, in my experience, although they did try their best to help, the objective amount of help they were able to give was quite little (through no real fault of their own, of course).\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think the course could benefit from a redesign. Being able to choose your own project is a neat idea in theory, but I think I would have preferred it if we were given a set of possibilities to choose from, in which case the TAs and professor would have been able to provide more specific help for any problems you ran into. Additionally, the project could then be broken down into assignments, where you have to complete a particular component of the project by the assignment's due date. The entire team would then work on each component, allowing for everyone to gain more general experience, rather than specific experience with the role they had within the team. I also think it would be good for teams to be somewhat forced to abide by the software engineering best practices discussed in the course, as this kind of strikes me as the whole point of the course, and yet our team mostly just brute-forced our way through the project. There's not really a clear penalty for doing otherwise, so it's difficult to convince your team that it's worth trying pair programming or scrums, for example. \r\n\r\nThese are just my ideas and should all be taken with a grain of salt, as they reflect my own personal experience with the course, which will obviously not be the same for everyone."

Slight caveat:\r\nIf you're not excited about any of the project ideas or get the vibe you're in a group of slackers, don't take the class.\r\nIf you've got a good feeling about the project or have a few ppl in your group with whom you know you work well, definitely go for it. \r\nAt the end of the day, the class is a breezy elective and you get out what you put in. I learnt a whole lot that I know I'll inevitably use in industry.",

                "In the courses' current structure, I would only recommend taking the course if you take it with people that you know already, and know will contribute to the project. The course is too dependent on your teammates to risk getting an unhelpful team.",

                "If you have always wanted to work on a programming project but never had the chance to do so before, then this is the perfect class. You have full control over the idea you want to pursue and you get to work with other like-minded CS students.",
                "This is most importantly a group project class--the class is enjoyable if your group works well together and is on the same page about expectations / planning, but burdensome if your group does falls short on these criteria. I think the format of the class is cool and a good opportunity to complete a more complex project during the semester, but make sure to establish a high expectation for communication and have means of accountability in place within your group at the start of the semester.",
                "To be honest, no. I think the idea behind the class is good, but the execution is not. In its current state, I think the class is more stress and effort than it's really worth. Even though the workload of this course is technically fairly low, another important factor to consider when assessing workload is how it feels to do the work for the course. For me, the feeling was usually pretty miserable, as I had little idea what I was doing and ran into tons of minor issues that, while minor, still blocked all progress until I figured out the solution, either through trial and error, looking through StackOverflow, or a bit of both. As the deadline to have the project done by closed in, my stress levels became greatly heightened, as I still had no idea what I was doing but still needed to do my part for the team. \r\n\r\nIf you have some idea of what you're doing, the course might not be as stressful, but then it's also difficult to say whether you would really get anything out of it. My recommendation, if you're looking to gain software engineering experience, is to read a book (such as the textbook used for the course) to learn about the concepts, and then get an internship. I just don't think this course is particularly necessary for anyone to take."
