This class played a pivotal role in the development of my language skills, and gave me the opportunity to test and improve the language in all of its aspects, writing, reading, listening, speaking also through the many social events that the GMAN Department offers.",
                "Strong speaking and reading skills. I believe that my writing has improved drastically, and is one of the heaviest elements of the course. Writing has always been very difficult, and this course helped me push out of the comfort zone with it. I think speaking wouldn't have improved much if I hadn't gone to other German Department events, to which I strongly recommend going. Many students of German miss this wonderful aspect, and this makes the course very dull.",

            "comments": [
                "Strenght: short classes held daily, this is great to keep improving the language.\r\nImprovements: breadth of the program. I feel that there is no time to master all the contents, especially for grammar. I can remember half of the rules, and I still need to go back to the class contents to refresh them. I think it would be more beneficial to cover less topics more accurately.",
                "Strengths: The German exposure. I thoroughly enjoyed the class because we spoke and were spoken to in German. That was the best piece of our class, and I got to know my classmates on a higher level because of our small class size. \r\nWeaknesses: Not very well paced, but I enjoyed learning about many different aspects. I wish we learned more about other German-speaking countries and regions. Class could also be a tad smaller, maybe 8 people maximum?",
                "Strengths: A lot of emphasis on reading and writing -- with writing especially, I saw a lot of improvements. Small class discussions are also nice. Weaknesses: There's a LOT of work! I know it's a 1.5 credit class, but the amount of work is a lot and there's not a lot of flexibility in what you can do (except for the final project). It's a lot of teacher/assignment driven, which some people might like, for me, it felt, after a certain extent, like a chore -- and it became slightly less fun to do my own things and study in German.",
                "There are simply too many things to keep track of in this course. There were so many different kinds of assignments, most of which were completely disjointed from one another, that just keeping track of what needed to be done and where and by when felt like an entire course-worth of work on its own. Had assignments been consolidated into only a handful per week, I believe I would have been able to stay on top of things much easier, but with daily coursework layered on in-class weekly coursework layered on out-of-class weekly coursework layered on semester-long coursework, most of which had to be conducted on your timeline, so many things ended up falling through the cracks or piling up into an unmanageable mess of work that I could hardly manage getting through the semester.\r\nMost of the students in the class had tested into L3 and above, while a minority went through the L1-L2-L3 sequence. Those who had been taking German since L1 were severely disadvantaged in this course, as the previous courses did not adequately prepare them for the demands of L3, especially in a class with so many students who were actually more advanced than L3. \r\nThe best part of this course was by far the actual class period itself, where we often had interesting, engaging discussions about relevant topics. Sometimes I wish we spent more time in class working on grammatical things, but overall, the class period was one of the few things enjoyable about this class.",
                "strengths: Professor Hetjens is an excellent teacher and is very strong in facilitating conversation. Additionally the class is very engaging, sometimes to its detriment because it demanded a lot but I liked that I got to know my classmates very well.'\r\n\r\nweaknesses: inconsistent amount of work, but mostly heavy. NOT ENOUGH GRAMMAR PRACTICE!!!! A good class for practicing the German that you do know, but not for expanding it."

                "Yes. especially if interested in learning the language. However, the workload is disproportionate to the number of units (credits) carried by the course. I was happy to do that because regardless the workload it is ultimately beneficial to learning the language. However, we do not always have the time to do all the assignments because of many other classes.",
                "If you enjoy German, yes this is a great course. I love the German department, because they are small and have such fun activities!  Definitely will continue studying German, but if your heart isn't set on the language, and you're only there for the Language Requirement,  do reconsider. Or start to like German more.",
                "If you are super dedicated in learning German, do it! This class will teach you a lot of German, a lot of history/culture of the German region, and force you to do lots of listening and watching. But be prepared to spend a LOT of time!",
                "I would not. In its current iteration, it is simply too much work to be worth it, unless you REALLY need/want to learn German. Despite an otherwise light semester, I struggled to keep on top of the work for this class. It was by far the most time-intensive class I've ever taken; it was pretty much all I thought about this past semester. One weekend - the final weekend before the end of class - we had THREE separate projects to work on at the same time, including the final. The amount of work is simply unreasonable, especially when half of it does not benefit your language acquisition in any meaningful way. Had I known this class would be such a time sink, I most certainly would have chosen a different language. If you're choosing a language to take and you don't have an extremely high drive to learn German, my advice would be to take a different language.",
                "It was fun and certainly enjoyable, but I did not love the curriculum. You definitely need to have a solid understanding of vocabulary even for an L3 course. If you have solid experience with German you will like it, but there is a good amount of work."
