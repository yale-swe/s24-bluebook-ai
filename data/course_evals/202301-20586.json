                "This class's greatest strength is the intense scaffolding which the intermediate deadlines provide, ensuring that students are never overwhelmed by an avalance of work for which they were not prepared. The oppurtunity to come together for the sessions at the beginning and the end also allowed for a real feeling of cameraderie among all seniors in the department. However, the actual implementation of the course logistics was in many cases disastrous: key information was lost or communicated improperly; feedback was late, nonspecific, and ambiguous; and even basic mechanisms of finalizing graded work were often simply broken.",
                "Strengths - advisor was helpful\r\nWeaknesses - maybe more specifications would be helpful",
                "Strengths: Having deadlines along the way was really helpful for keeping me on track throughout the semester, so I didn't have to cram everything in at the end and had time to implement feedback. My instructor was very prompt in giving feedback and was very helpful with the literature review and the poster design. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None, I actually found this to be a pretty low-stress senior project as far as senior projects go.",
                "Feedback could be given in a more timely manner and in more depth, but I appreciated the enthusiasm the support provided by our advisors. Thank you!",
                "I think the course is an excellent capstone to the MB&B major. However, I had never written a review paper before so it was a struggle for me.",
                "Strengths-my advisor was knowledgeable in my topic of interest and was able to help me think through it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses-I know I was lucky, but several of my classmates did not have professors who knew much about their topic of interest. However, as successful scientists, I do not think it is actually that important for the advisor to know students topic of interest welljust need to know how to write a literature review!",
                "More active engagement throughout the semester- meetings with advisors needs to be structured and much more frequent.",
                "It's not a lot of work, which is certainly a plus but also leaves me wondering why the course even exists... I had very limited interactions with my faculty advisor for the course and it didn't feel like I was really learning much, nor did I get the sense that anyone cared about my finished product. The communication for the poster/flash talks at the end was also quite poor (I didn't know the size/style parameters until about a week before it was due, and they never actually conveyed what the poster was supposed to be about!).",
                "The course is very hands-off which could be either a strength or a weakness depending on the student.",
                "The strengths of the course were that you could choose any topic of interest. The weakness was that there was very little guidance throughout the semester on how to write an effective review paper. Additionally, there was very little feedback given on our drafts which made it difficult to know what we could do to improve.",

You have ample time (a whole semester) to do everything, and all the instructors seemed to be very kind, understanding, and willing to help in any way possible.",
