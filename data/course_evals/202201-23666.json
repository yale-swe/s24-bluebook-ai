Once I figured out how to study, this was alright, but I think it was hard at first.",
                "While writing and daily conversation among students and the teacher were integral to my growth. This helped to solidify the concepts I had been learning from the previous semester. I feel that I truly began to consider how to use German functionally and became much more comfortable with trying to express myself in German despite issues in my speech or failing to fully express myself. I thought the connect homework assignments were wholly and totally useless. These assignments regularly took over an hour each time, and were nothing more than busy work which felt tedious and busy. I failed to grasp most of the concepts these assignments taught.",
