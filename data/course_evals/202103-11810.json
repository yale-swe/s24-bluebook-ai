                "THIS COURSE WAS MY FAVORITE EVER AT YALE! My understanding of creative writing was improved 100x by taking this course. You truly learn all of the different aspects of craft. If you are looking to start creative writing or start taking classes on creative writing, START HERE. START WITH ADAM SEXTON! You get to read amazing books and stories and you gain so much insight into how to write well. With the final short story, you also workshop with your peers which sounds scary but in reality it is genuinely transformative. So I learned how to develop a story idea, write good dialogue, description, character development, and also how to revise! How to make things realistic. I learned that I love workshopping my pieces.",
                "In this course I developed a good understanding of the base elements of craft in fiction writing. It was also a fantastic introduction on how to contribute constructively in a fiction writing workshop.",
                "This course provided a helpful introduction to the building blocks of a successful story. Having finished the course, I find myself reading and watching TV/movies in a new wayI can now apply the concepts learned in class to articulate why a particular sentence or character makes me feel the way I do.",
                "I learned basic story structure, how to incorporate that knowledge into writing a story of my own, and how to critique other stories based on understanding the principles of storytelling.",
                "I learned about what makes a good storytechniques and insights that helped me with my own creative writing!",
                "I learned how to craft an essay and developed a particular toolset prepared by Professor Sexton and his analysis of successful stories.",
                "I definitely was able to put together a structure for constructing fiction, ranging from diction to the basic narrative structure."

            "comments": [
                "Professor Sexton is the strength. He's a great teacher and runs the class really well. I wish we spent longer studying the masters and less time peer editing, since I learned more from Beloved and Metamorphosis than I did from my classmates' writing. The writing process is well designed and provide ample time for feedback and revisions, both on short pieces, and on the final story. This is an excellent course and I highly recommend taking it.",
                "Strengths: small class size (everyone was so kind and dedicated to the course); PROFESSOR SEXTON is the best please take engl 404 with him you will not regret it; great feedback on every one of our weekly exercises and then a lot of feedback on the short story; lots of time for us to engage in the creative process; reflections and getting to talk about the things we read; the reading list is excellent, we read so many different authors; writing and rewriting and workshopping the short story was crucial to my experience in this class!\r\nWeaknesses: literally none except I wish I could take it for a whole year not just a semester :')",
                "The syllabus provides a very structured approach to fiction writing, which was helpful for me as CS major and novice writer. Although most people enter this class looking to improve their creative writing, I will caution that the majority of the course is spent discussing the readings on the syllabus. Obviously reading great writers like Updike, Baldwin, Hurston, Orange, Saunders, etc. hopefully translates into better writing, I found that I struggled to make the jump from reading to writing. By the time the short story assignment came around, I still didn't feel totally prepared to dive into the assignment because of the lack of writing assignments on the syllabus before then. Professor Sexton is also a strength. He is supportive and passionate about improving student work.",
                "Strengths:\r\n1. Front half of the class provides strong foundational teachings for the latter half; well-organized\r\n2. Instructor clearly passionate about all the students' work, knowledgeable\r\n3. Latter half of the course had well-structured workshop/critique sessions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. Could use less reading material in the front half of the class",
                "Strength: Professor Sexton is a very engaging teacher, and crafting a creative essay is always a delight.\r\nWeakness: The workload was overwhelming and took away from the quality of the class. For example, it was obvious that not everyone got to fully engage in peer-editing.",
                "Strengths: Definitely the workshops and Prof. Sexton's kind and focused feedback! Weaknesses: Not being able to engage with other writers in the classroom as much until the second half of the semester, a bit too much reading at times (the workload isn't the issue, but I just wish we did more writing at the beginning to balance out the reading)"

                "Yes absolutely. Professor Sexton is superb and the material is great. Just make sure you want to read and write.",
                "Yes, Professor Sexton is really great! It's also so cool to be able to read your classmates' work. Also, all the things we read in class are super interesting and not boring. Sometimes, there are tight deadlines for the reading but definitely doable.",
                "YES ONE MILLION TIMES YES. I had so much fun in this class and feel like I learned so much and now want to keep creative writing every semester! I know a lot of people want to take ENGL 404 with Michael Cunningham but I honestly think that Professor Sexton is better (shhh don't tell). This class was one of those classes that didn't feel like a real class, I went every week and always looked forward to it and had a ton of fun. If you're not willing to do the readings, you might not find the class as interesting, so just commit to it (it's not that much reading if you plan ahead!)!!!! Especially if you love writing but are scared to show your work or scared that you aren't any good or you've never written but want to, or you've been writing your whole life but haven't taken a class on it yet, please take this. Take the risk!!! It's amazing.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. It's a great intro course for people interested in pursuing writing seriously as well as those just looking to explore creative writing as a fun challenge. Professor Sexton is knowledgable and fantastic to work with and the classroom environment is productive and supportive.",
                "Yes! I ended up taking the course Cr/D. Although the course isn't too much work, the short story composes 75% of the grade across the first and final drafts. As a novice writer, I didn't want the pressure hanging over my head. In the end, I probably didn't need to Cr/D the course given my final grade, but it nonetheless allowed me to focus on finding pleasure in the exercise of reading and writing.",
                "I absolutely would! I've read lots of writing resources online, even went to a writing workshop summer program when I was in high school, but this class really helped me grasp the true fundamentals of an effective story.",
                "Yes! This is a great beginner fiction writing course. Most of the students were non-English majors, which contributed new and interesting perspectives. We read some eye-opening short stories in this class. It was also nice to spend a good chunk of the semester doing workshops. Everyone was always very encouraging and kind during the workshops.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would not recommend this course if you are not an outstanding reader AND care about your grades.",
                "I absolutely would! Such a nice introduction to writing fiction."
