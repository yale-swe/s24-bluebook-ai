                "It moved wayyyyyy too slowly. I was extremely bored in class, which resulted in me not paying attention, which then resulted in me feeling behind on the material.",
                "The course feels very rushed. In order to stay up to date and comfortable students need to dedicate a lot of time to individual learning. I consider this a weakness as not every student is fit for the \"flipped classroom\" style of teaching. I personally struggled to sit through video explanations. A completely new topic is introduced almost every class and you are simply expected to keep up. This problem is difficult to solve because there is a certain amount of material that needs to be fit into a course, but if it could be restructured somehow such that teachers were making clear the overarching reason for moving from topic to topic that would be helpful, as often one does not really understand why we are doing what we're doing or how what we are doing is relevant. Additionally I'd say a weakness is the abstractness of the concepts taught, it is difficult to see any utility to most of what is taught in class, so I wish the course would focus on adding real-life examples where the material is useful.",
                "strengths: very organized course format and information about exams, homework, concepts, etc was easily accessible\r\nweaknesses: information covered in class would sometimes repeat info covered in the prelecture videos which would feel like a waste of time, such as going over the derivation/reasoning behind theorems that we simply have to memorize for tests. to improve, do not repeat the less important concepts during lecture",
                "Strengths: solid teaching, clear concepts and good curriculum. weaknesses: lengths of the problem sets",
                "I liked the model of the class of having prerecorded lectures and then doing practice problems in class. However, I found that in class, we spent too much time reviewing what was taught in the videos, which made the class very redundant.",
                "Good class.",
                "The material moves very quickly, so it's hard to dedicate enough time for mastery of concepts. It was easy to be in touch with the instructor.",
                "The course's structure was first watching a recorded video and then going to class that taught the exact same thing as the video. This was repetitive and unnecessary, and made it so going to class was not needed.",
                "Content very hard, it would be helpful if there was a formula sheet.",
                "Strengths: Lots of peer tutor hours and available resources. A few psets could be submitted late which made homework much more manageable but some p-sets were much lengthier and time-consuming. Pre-lecture videos were very useful to introduce the content. Well-structured overall for the amount of content covered.\r\nWeaknesses: Wished that review sessions were recorded as I often had a conflicting schedule. Not allowed a note sheet like MATH115 which made exams very difficult because lots of theorems and formulas needed to be purely memorized. Coaching sessions were not super helpful, should provide answer keys to practice problems for most benefit."

It is extremely fast-paced and required a lot of self-study. The quality of the course is VERY dependent on your section instructor. Exams are difficult and cover a wide range of material that demand in depth understanding to apply topics in computational problems. It was beyond stressful!!! The grading of the class is somewhat flexible and adjusted to your best midterm/final scores but otherwise psets are still hard as well and involve mathematical aptitude that I lacked."
