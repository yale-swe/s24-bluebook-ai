                "I think the class was really strong, the professor was super engaging and really adorable. There's no participation credit, so a lot of students didn't speak during the whole semester. There's definitely room to participate, though, if you want to.",

                "Strengths: very entertaining and interesting syllabus and informative lectures",
                "While Professor Gonzalez is the courses' strength, it is erroneous to call this course a seminar. Little discussion is encouraged.",
                "I really liked the freedom of this course--the only official assignments were the three papers for which we could write about any work we wanted! It was nice to read the weekly stories and hear some great ideas from Professor Gonzlez-Prez (and classmates) during class. Some weeks when I was really busy, I wasn't able to read every story in-depth before class, but I always enjoyed the enthusiasm from Professor Gonzlez-Prez and felt motivated to catch up on the readings a bit after class. However, sometimes when I did get a bit behind and didn't quite follow everything in class, it might've been nice to have the slides available after class to jog my memory about some of the things we discussed in class. It could also be helpful to have a short summary slide available after class to capture the main ideas of the works we've discussed, especially for use when deciding what we want to write our papers about--sometimes I wasn't able to get all my notes/ideas down during class because I wanted to listen more attentively, so knowing that a short written summary would be available after class could be nice!"

                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in reading more Spanish literature! This genre is very interesting and I think anyone would be able to enjoy it. Professor Gonzalez is very kind and the course information is easy to digest.",
                "Definitely! Prof. Gonzalez-Perez is a wonderful professor and the subject of this class was so interesting. I didn't even really like science fiction before taking this class, now I love it.",
                "It's an easy Spanish class for those looking to fulfill their L5 requirement with a literature focus. Not particularly interesting for those with a strong Latin American literature background.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because Professor Gonzlez-Prez is very enthusiastic and welcoming, and we discussed some really interesting works of science fiction that I probably wouldn't have come across otherwise! For me personally, it was tough sometimes to keep up with all the readings during weeks with a lot of assignments in other classes; however, our discussions were pretty relaxed, so I usually felt that I could catch up after class if need be. I'm not a native speaker, so I sometimes didn't quite follow everything in class, but I liked that we could choose our own stories/ideas for the papers!"
