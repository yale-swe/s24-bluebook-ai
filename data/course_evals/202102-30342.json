                "Good overview of all the different topics in heat transfer, but could be helped with a little more depth in practical applications e.g. an assignment or class activity to design a fin or cooling system for a real application. Definitely helped me understand the principles behind thermal engineering design.",
                "Strengths: good balance of introduction to theory and working out of examples. The lessons prepare you very well for the homework and give you the knowledge you'll need to fully explore the textbook in your own time (it has useful stuff!). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: With Doc A, weaknesses are hard to come by. The distribution of work was a little wonky, but primarily because of the summer format. With the Tu/Th schedule, any homework due Th was crammed compared to the excess of time for Tu homework, so possibly releasing assignments a bit ahead of time so the Th HW could be worked on during the long weekend as well. The class flowed differently than the initial syllabus, but honestly this is a strength because Doc A recognized the needs of the class and adjusted pacing to work with us where appropriate. If the class weren't as small and communicative amongst each other and with the professor I can see where a lack of stricter organization could maybe cause issues - or just more emails than needed into Doc A's inbox.",
                "The course flowed in a logical order and built upon itself well. I have no critiques and don't have any suggested improvements.",
                "I really enjoyed how this class was taught. I really tried to think of ways to improve this class but couldnt think of any.",
                "Strengths: The concepts were made very clear and the applications felt relevant to potential careers in industry \r\nWeakness: The speed of the course (by nature of being a summer class) made some of the derivations unclear"

                "If you have the chance to take it with Doc A, definitely do so - you get as much out of it as you put in. If you want, it could be a very engaging class or just another one for your major.",
                "Yes! This class is like a refreshing breath of fresh air from Yale's decently theory-heavy curriculum. Almost every problem you work through models a real life design problem and it's easy to see how useful this knowledge will be post Yale. Careful about choice of professor, because having shopped heat transfer previously, this class can be run in greatly different ways which will affect the theoretical vs practical balance.",
                "This course was super interesting and is very applicable to the Mechanical Engineering degree and career. I recommend taking this course if you have any interest in HVAC as well.",
                "Absolutely, great professor and an interesting class.",
                "Yes. I feel like this is course is better than the alternative of taking it during the school year. It could be a little challenging with a 9-5 job (I definitely feel freer now that class is over)."
