   "comments": [
    "Learned a lot about linguistics, and my ability to think critically improved, as well as my reading skills, specifically technical reading like scientific papers",
    "I learned a lot about grammar, phonology, language acquisition, and research in linguistics.",
    "So much! This was my first linguistics class, so a lot of the linguistic theory was new to me. I would say about 2\/3rds of the class is introductory linguistics (morphology, phonetics-phonology, semantics, syntax) and then the last third of the course is reading studies that specifically relate to Language and Mind\/more about psychology.",
    "I learned the basics of linguistics (phon-phon, semantics, syntax, morphology) while also delving into conceptual system theory. Maria Pinango is a leading researcher in this field, and you learn a lot just from soaking it all in. You also learn about heritage speakers, sign language, and language acquisition and how that all plays into the mind \/ language.",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of linguistics, the structure of how we interpret language, and how it connects to our minds.",
    "I learned an enormous amount in this class. I learned aspects of linguistics like semantics, syntax, phonetics, etc., as well as different ways that linguists approach questions. Professor Pinango not only communicated a ton of linguistic knowledge, but also taught me new ways of asking questions, checking my assumptions, and learning in general.",
    "This is a hard question to answeras this course felt at once deeply theoretical and yet deeply relevant and appliedsuffice to say, I feel that I am taking away a lot! As my first linguistics course, it offered a crash-course into a number of different subfields and basic linguistic theory. But the course also provoked me to understand language as a system that exists in one's mind. (What does it mean to say that one is 'speaking English' ? Hehe.) From this perspective, it taught me a lot about 'language' as providing an abstract system of rules and components which a person develops to acquire a specific language. This has empowered me to better understand the difference between various languages, and within a language (dialects). This course taught me the skills to analyze the different aspects of the syntax, semantics, morphology, phonetics\/phonology present in a word or phrase. It has deepened my understanding of why sign language\/ASL is truly a first-rate human language, how \"heritage\" speakers develop their languages, and more broadly, how developing humans acquire language. I also appreciate that the course provoked us to view ourselves as researchers, and feel that it equipped us with a lot of tools to think about linguistics research.",
    "General understanding of how language is represented mentally",
    "I learned to conduct research inspired by and founded in previous data analysis while targeting a personalized question of study."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: learned a lot, engaging\r\nWeaknesses: kind of all over the place at times? not organized that well?",
    "The biggest weakness of this class is that homework assignments contained questions about material that we did NOT learn until the next day. We basically had to guess the answers, turn in the assignment, and THEN learn the information in class, which was not helpful. It would have been a little better if the assignments were not graded, but they were and they were a significant portion of the class grade. Additionally, the course was somewhat unstructured and the material was very dense. I feel like there was a lot of jargon that was used that made the material much more difficult to understand than it had to be. Some concepts remained unclear and the feedback on the exams and assignments was not helpful.",
    "Strengths: I really liked the organization of the class. All the readings, assignments, handouts, and lectures felt connected and relevant and topical. Although there are a lot of assignments, none of it is busy work and it's all helpful and even sometimes fun. I liked MMP's teaching style as well. She's very knowledgeable and cool, and she does her best to keep the lectures engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I will admit I zoned out to some of the lectures. Even though this is a small course (by the end of the semester there were 20 students I believe), this is still a lecture course, so if that's not for you, then that's not for you.",
    "This class is one of my favorite classes ever. Maria Pinango is a great lecturer, a great person, and will guide you through so much. There are no weaknesses, but do be prepared to work.",
    "Strengths - good overview of linguistics, professor is very caring - if you have a question she will always answer it and help you learn, keep you engaged\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - as a prospective cog sci major, I was hoping this course would focus more on language acquisition and processing than it did, but that might just be me. also, class discussion sometimes felt disorganized, it was hard to know what was important",
    "A huge strength is professor Pinango. Her excitement for the material and her passion for teaching really made this class shine. She provided appropriately difficult psets to increase our knowledge and understanding and worked hard to push students to engage and improve. Another strength that I greatly appreciated was Professor Pinango's willingness to take time to help the class fully understand a point that was initially unclear. However, sometimes I felt that we would dwell a long time on the conceptual questions while we might breeze through some of the more technical aspects. This has its pluses and minuses, but I would love to see a bit more explanation in the future on some of these things (e.g. more IPA practice, more aspectual practice\/ more grammatical category practice)",
    "Strengths: many. Professor Piango really knows her stuff and kept the course constantly engaging. Rather than a textbook, we learned from numerous readings and copious \"handouts\" that Prof. MMP compiled. Without her really saying it, we came to realize it that this course is a rare opportunity to learn linguistics from the \"cognitive\" perspective from someone that has been pioneering research for a while. This course manages to cover a \/lot\/ of different material, but it is, in general, very tightly-integrated in a way that really helped facilitate my understanding. For most of the semester, I found the course to be very well-organized. This said, about halfway through the semester or so, it felt that things became more disorganizedlecture in class diverged a bit from the readings and handouts, and the second midterm to me felt largely unrelated to the material we had been highlighting. (That really was a surprising midterm; for ~all of us, far as I could tell). All of this said, that too passed, and on the whole I feel that the course wove together a lot of cool material in a very tightly-integrated and engaging way.",
    "While the material is interesting and I learned so much, the course is disorganized, and we often don't receive clear enough guidelines for assignments. I feel that there was a lack of rigor\/precision in the way concepts were taught to us. We spent a lot of time learning features of linguistics such as syntax and lexico-conceptual structures without fully understanding why these topics are relevant to out mental representation of languagein other words, it felt more skewed towards language than towards mind, and the essential connection between the two is not made sufficiently clear to students. I would appreciate if there were more clearly organized lectures, perhaps with powerpoints rather than handouts. Reading out loud from a handout is not especially helpful for learning, and makes it hard to focus. I think that if the lectures and the order in which we learn content were more organized, student comprehension and engagement would go way up. Also, I think that section should be led by the TF, not the professor. Sometimes, TFs can have a better sense of what students are\/are not understanding from lectures."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it was good!",
    "I would recommend this course ONLY if you have a background in linguistics. The material is really hard to grasp unless you know all the technical terms",
    "Yes, I liked this course. I initially wanted to take it because I was hoping it'd give me some tips\/hacks for second language learning, but halfway through the semester, something changed. I became genuinely interested in linguistics just for the sake of linguistics and started to appreciate the field without any ulterior motives. I personally (re?)discovered a love for syntax. It awakened my elementary school grammar nerd, but like a more mature and less obnoxious version of the elementary school grammar nerd. One that isn't based on \"proper\" rules like \"no dangling modifiers\" (what does that even mean? does anyone care?), but just observes English based on how it's actually used\/spoken. I love this class because for the first time... English actually made sense to me. Sure, a lot of English is arbitrary and there's no reason English has to be the way it is, but English - all dialects of it - follows rules. If that doesn't make sense to you, take this class, and it will. I also appreciated how this class emphasized all dialects of English as equal and valid and followed the standard of how English is actually used, which made grammar just that much more fun.",
    "Yes yes yes yes yes yes",
    "If you want to learn about the basics of linguistics but with more of an application than a regular linguistics class, this is a good class. It didn't talk as much about acquisition or language learning as I hoped it would, but I gained a lot of interesting knowledge.",
    "YES! I had no intention of doing much linguistics at all, but Professor Pinango truly made me interested and excited to learn. I gained knowledge about a field I had previously no knowledge of, and that alone felt like an exciting thing. A phenomenal class to truly learn in and engage with.",
    "Yes! If you have any inkling of interest in linguistics, how it is that we're able to use language with each other, how language works in the mind, etc., then shop this course! The workload is manageablemaybe slightly heavier than average, but only because homeworks are consistent week-to-week, not because they're particularly impossible. Do keep in mind that there is both a final project and a final exam at the end.",
    "If you are willing to put work and intellectual energy into this class and are interested in language and\/or the mind, take it!"
