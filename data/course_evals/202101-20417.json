I used to see film as a very niche interest that certain people might have, maybe very privileged people, and this class made me realize it's a diverse tradition and a collection of methods of making things that a lot of people from all over the world are participating in. I'm excited to continue watching more non-western films in the future."

                "The writing assignments were incredibly hard, for someone who has no background in film. Felt like the writing support was lacking. Instruction on how to apply what we talked about in section and lecture to our papers was lacking and instruction on how to build a sound argument about a film was also not as great as I would have hoped. The course was very thematic, which was great, but as a student who took the class to branch out into film, I felt fed to the wolves in the writing assignments, and trying to apply the abstract themes to building a concrete argument was a veritable challenge.\r\n\r\nThe lectures were very clear, easy to follow, and very engaging. Prof Marta cares very much about the students and cares very much about the material.",
                "This course had some really great movie choices. I don't know if requiring the textbook was totally necessary. Some really interesting lectures and sections.",
                "The course was well laid out to provide an introduction to many different regions and types of cinema. My biggest issue was there didn't feel like there was an overarching sense to how the class was laid out--other then chronologically--but I am not sure if that is easy to fix.",
                "Great overview of world cinema and engagement with critical analysis techniques",
                "Professor Figlerowicz was incredibly good at explaining sophisticated and complicated ideas to students engaging with those concepts for the first time. She was also consistently and vocally mindful: of her own potential biases, of the extreme burnout some students were experiencing, and of the variety of interpretation that could work for a given text or film. The teaching team was always looking out for us, and the class discord was actually super good vibes -- a great way to assign low-stakes reading response assignments and talk 1-on-1 with students. The film selection for class was also such a blast! We would watch a film a week, which tended to be quite elusive and unique in its style, and then Prof Figlerowicz would give a fascinating lecture on the film's production history, context, and reception, which would often totally change my perspective on it. The work for this class was also chill while feeling genuinely useful and engaging. I also had a wonderful TA (Max Nelson) who helped to make this course a very special experience.",
                "Professor Figlerowicz is simply the best lecturer that I've had at Yale, hands down. Every lecture was engaging, and everything we learned was at once new and yet built on top of previous material. She's also incredibly understanding toward students--for example, the entire format of the final project was changed because of how hard things were with Covid, and the format of the first two papers were changed as well to better introduce non film majors to film analysis.",
                "NO WEAKNESSES. This is an AMAZING class! I wish we had had more time to talk about each film, but that's more of a logistical issue than anything else.",
                "Strengths: TA sessions were a great way to discuss films on a more intimate level than in lecture.\r\nLectures were engaging in the sense that we almost always watched clips from the movie we watched most recently and discussed interesting aspects of the scenes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did not get a good idea of how the different regions \/ time periods we focused on had impact on each other. We did often speak about how a few movies were influential in developing cinema around the world (such as the first movie we watched, by Dziga Vertov), but I often felt like the regions of focus were disconnected. I would've liked it if we spent a little more time talked about why various film industries developed and how film industries influenced each other in this process.",
                "The selection of films was really wonderful and I appreciated the attention to context in lectures.",
                "Good syllabus of movies but section could be quite dry.",
                "Strengths: Excellent film viewing list for the most part! Prof. Figlerowicz was awesome as well!\r\nWeaknesses: This class is open both to absolute beginners with no formal film analysis experience and to film majors\/people who have had a great deal of experience. This makes it feel super hard at times to compete (or, at the very least, keep up with) your peers contributions if you dont have much experience with film in an academic\/analytic setting. It also seemed that the TFs were not doing much in the way of considering each students personal history and experience with film when gradingI felt that I improved by MILES from my beginning in the class, but my grades never improved at all from assignment to assignment. I get the sense that this was because I was always being measured against my peers work, many of whom had already in a sense mastered the art of film writing. I suppose this is to be expected in any course open to all experience levelsjust something to keep in mind.",
                "Strengths: Film selection and lectures are great. Professor Figlerowicz is amazing, and the TAs are great as well. The material presented is great. Also, I really liked the contextualization of films within their histories.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "I really enjoyed the lecture, especially after Professor Figlerowicz adjusted half way through the semester to do an outline of the lecture at the beginning of each lecture. I wish the 2nd film had continued to be required because section participation definitely declined after that requirement was dropped.",
                "Strengths: lectures were really great and contextualized all the films really well. Definitely one of the more organized humanities classes I have taken at Yale. Felt compelled to take notes the whole time. I like the ways that 2 films were assigned per week, and the juxtapositions were usually really interesting. Also liked the way the assignments were designed, where the first one was a bit of a warmup, and the second one a longer comparative paper; there were a lot of opportunities for getting feedback and improving. The final project was really enjoyable and felt like a good exercise of all the skills we'd been learning in class."

                "Recorded lectures were both helpful and slightly hurtful at the same time. They were helpful in the sense that if I missed a lecture, I could always make it up and stay on pace with the class. However, with this class scheduled at 9:00am, and given the circumstances of virtual learning, it was almost too tempting to skip lecture in the morning and just watch the recording. This may have just been my fault for not staying diligent, but I ended up falling behind at certain points from missing too many lectures, and I really needed to devote excessive amounts of time to this course to stay on pace.\r\n\r\nI did feel like Professor Figlerowicz did a great job of accommodating students in a hectic year. The list of movies was narrowed down slightly, with some films being optional, which was very helpful. I also thought the restructuring of the final project made things a little bit easier in a very unusual, difficult year.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Figlerowicz as well as the Teaching Fellows were the most understanding people when it came to knowing that we were very stressed out and dealing with a lot of stuff due to everything being virtual and chaos going on in the world. In other classes that I had, there was minimal support given to the students such as 1-2 day extensions; however, this class really went above and beyond and gave extensions that were long enough to actually help us and Professor Figlerowicz as well as the Teaching Fellows decreased the amount of work while still giving us an appropriate workload which helped greatly for such a stressful time. They really were great about actually understanding what the students were going though and helping\/providing support. The class itself was very interesting, we explored many different cultures and genres, so if you weren't a fan of a certain style, you are not stuck with that style for the whole class and will most likely find films that you enjoy throughout the course. The final project was fun because you got to pick your own country and then select which films from that country you want to watch and write about , so that you actually find the topic of your final project interesting instead of just doing some final paper on something you don't care about.",

Film majors, this should be an absolute no-brainer as a requirement. Non-film majors, you will have a blast if you are even the slightest bit interested in movies and\/or global studies.",

                "YES. This is one of those Yale courses that will legitimately make you a better person. Dr. Figlerowicz is a fantastic professor who cares about her students and will take extra time to get to know them. The entire syllabus and course is designed very well. I would recommend this class to every student. Just be aware that the workload includes 3-4+ hours of watching foreign films every week. It's not as relaxing as you would expect, but very very rewarding.",
                "yes",
                "I would recommend taking another course in film first, something that teaches you a little more about how to analyze and write about a film. Not that this course doesn't help you develop that skill, but the real emphasis is on exploring world cinema and a lot of experimental styles and themes, which is much easier to grasp with a working knowledge of how to formally analyze a film. However, if you're really interested in cinema produced outside of the US \/ major Western film centers, this course is for you.",

                "Yes! World Cinema is a really good practice in art analysis and also placing yourself in another's perspective. I think many art, history, and humanities classes focus on Western perspectives that can certainly be lost. This definitely isn't the case in World Cinema, and I think you get a lot of practice in that sense.",
