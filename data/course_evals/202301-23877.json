                "I learned about modern political philosophy and the issues of our time.",
                "I learned how to write a much better H&P paper and Bromwich took the time to help me through this. What we learned from the books and seminars was very valuable",
                "Learned  how to play close attention to a writers language and style while being encouraged to hone in and declutter my own",
                "I developed a good understanding of European political theory from the enlightenment through the 20th century. Although many of these thinkers' important works can be (and frequently are) summarized in a few paragraphs, taking a deeper look at them through this course was rewarding and revealed surprising nuances. I didn't notice this at all until we got to Rousseau, and only completely understood it by the end of the course, once we'd read Arendt and DuBois, but I think the fundamental question that each of these works revolves around is 'What is freedom?'. I didn't find the books in DS HP particularly applicable to contemporary political science, and though they've obviously had an impact on history, charting the legacy of each text wasn't the focus of the course. The real value of sticking with DS and reading these books comes from comparing their authors' different answers to that big question. Being exposed to their varying conceptions of freedom surprised and challenged me and made me think more deeply about what a desirable political community might look like.",
                "Directed Studies at its heart is a trial by fire that reaches you how to read and write at a level that goes above that which is expected for most college first years. For those skills, I am glad I enrolled in the program. DRST 006 on particular is an interesting mesh of some practical and some hypothetical texts, which further refines these skills.",
                "I developed my knowledge of the relationship between history and political thought - how context influenced political thinkers, how one thinker influenced the next, how one was a reaction to the previous, etc. I also improved my essay writing skills.",
                "I gained a profound understanding of these prominent political thinkers and their works. I also learned a lot about writing these kinds of papers: how to construct an argument with coherence and precision.",
                "I learned how to compare different political thinkers and bettered my grammar."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the texts.\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of talk about texts in concert, where theorists agree and disagree.",
                "Strengths: Deep Understanding of Course Material\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes too deep and not enough coverage of the whole text",
                "Strengths: fantastic seminar discussionsBromwich is truly a world-class professor, insightful responses to questions and ideas posed in seminars, valuable recaps of the weekly lecture in seminar\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I felt as if the seminar atmosphere was not most conducive to free and open discussion (professor to student contribution ratio was about 2.5:1 when its usually more about 1.5:1 for most of my other seminars)",
                "Strengths: Asides from a few complaints, which I've explained below, I think the curriculum is very well designed. It's hard to think of a better way to learn about a book than reading it, discussing it in seminar, and hearing about it in lecture. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was really not enough of a focus on empire and colonization (and decolonization) for a course about European and American history and politics. Yes, we touched upon slavery and nationalism, but imperialism is distinct from both of those subjects and was so widespread and long-lasting that it merits special attention. Adding Bartolome de Las Casas to the syllabus would be great. He could replace the first day of Leviathan, which was mostly Hobbes's interesting but complex and somewhat peripheral metaphysics, or one day of Locke, or Douglass, since we read only a brief speech of his and not his autobiography. Or you could add writing by Fanon or Gandhi, who, despite living and working outside of the west, were educated in Europe and influenced by European history and thought. \r\n\r\nIn general, I think the HP track could be improved by providing more historical context to students. I know DS is supposed to be a great books program, but using secondary sources would be okay! What are the lectures, if not secondary sources? I think providing excerpts from a good textbook or documentary would make each reading much easier for everyone to understand, and discussion in seminar would benefit as a result.\r\n\r\nAlso, every student I've spoken with agrees that the quotes on this year's HP final were ridiculously obscure. I'm sure the test will be curved, but that didn't feel fair.",
                "Personally, I feel that DS H&P is one of the most interesting of the DS classes due to its synthesis of two different but complimentary subjects. However, I feel that there is not enough political theory in the first semester of DS H&P, and that there is not enough history in the second. I think a bit more variance would allow the two classes to feel more connected.",
                "More time devoted to the later authors we read such as Hannah Arendt\r\nMore discussion of history, not just as it relates to politics",
                "Strengths: Interesting selection of readings.\r\nWeaknesses: I really wish that the final exam would just have one essay, instead of two. The two essays are grueling and stressful in the three-hour period.",
                "Strengths: good material\r\nWeaknesses: too much material, need more context for each work"

                "Yes, this is a great course, the amount you learn not only through the books but through writing as well is worth it",
                "Take Bromwichs seminar if you want to learn from the best and are willing to take maybe a slight grade reduction (compared to other professors) to do so. As a result of his seminar, Ive gained an entirely new way of approaching political philosophy through the lens of the thinkers intentionality through style and have greatly improved my writing skills",
                "Yes. DS is great. It's tough, but I'd encourage anyone who's got the time to stick with it. You'll learn a lot, read good books, and make good friends. Professor Bromwich is a tougher grader than some of the other section leaders, but if you take his class you'll get a firsthand view of what someone who absolutely lives for these books and ideas is like. He may be intimidating at first, but if you work hard you'll end up having a lot of fun.",
                "I would, but know that Professor Bromwich is tough. That toughness is a side effect of one of the most brilliant professors at Yale; Professor Bromwich is precise and seasoned in everything from his ideas to his diction. But it also means that, of the H&P professors, he is one of the more difficult.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in the subject matter",
                "If you're in DS, you have to take H&P, so yes. Keep in mind that Spring H&P is very different from the fall. It is a different kind of thinking. There is no history, it is all political thought. That being said, I found it incredibly interesting.",
                "I would recommend that any freshman interested in a well-rounded view of the Humanities participate in the DS program. The program as a whole provides a space and a community for those to explore the works that are foundational to our society. The beauty of the course comes not at the beginning, but at the end, when students are able to look back from the vantage point of understanding and enlightenment they have received over the course of their two semesters of enrollment. Beyond the knowledge the course provides, it is a great way to make friends in your first year, a time when securing relationships is incredibly important. DS builds in relationships from Day one with its shared classes and lectures, both of which are taught by world-class professors with incredibly deep knowledge of their subjects. Taking DS was definitely the best academic decision I made my freshman year.",
                "Yes, if they are very passionate about historical and political thought. It will be a lot of work, but if they enjoy the reading, it will be worth it."
