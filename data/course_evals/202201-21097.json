The historical connections as the course went on, and objective reviews of the material were conducive to student lead discussions that stayed focused and really covered new material as well as bringing in topics from other weeks.",

Perhaps I would have appreciated being able to start on our final paper sooner, however, that is all I can think of and I'm sure no amount of time would ever feel like enough. The strengths of this course are the knowledge and passion Professor Kapustin has for the material, the material itself, and the intellect and open mindedness of my peers. I really enjoyed all aspects of this class!",
                "strengths: the quality and quantity of the material, the style of the class (mini-lecture, conversation), clear what most important points are",
                "I think another midterm assignment or reading response could encourage preparation earlier in the week for the weekly discussions, but overall a strength was certainly the teaching and structure.",
                "This course is very interesting and well taught. It can be difficult at times.",
                "There wasnt much discussion in the class. Most of the seminar was really a lecture. There was only two assignments which lent to a low amount of feedback and engagement. Didnt really walk out knowing anything new.",
                "Very effective seminar-style course. Kapustin has high expectations of everyone in terms of engaging with the material and generating original thoughts. I wish the course focused less on Hegel, but it's clear that Kapustin cares a great deal about him.",
                "It was a great course overall.\r\nStrengths:\r\nProfessor Kapustin is fantastic - very knowledgeable and passionate, a great teacher \r\nGood mix of seminar and lecture elements \r\nClose analysis of texts \r\nGood combination of ancient, early modern and modern political philosophy \r\nVery good questions from Professor Kapustin \r\n\r\nPerhaps adding some more left leaning thinkers would be a good idea",
                "Strengths: Professor Kapustin is a very captivating instructor. He also is incredibly knowledgable and helpful in explaining and making clear very incomprehensible political philosophy. His taking the time to go over specific meanings and intentions of authors was very helpful. \r\nWeaknesses: Texts are very Euro-centric, and there were no authors of color nor were there any female authors. This lack of representation can alienate women of color within the EP&E major and also fails to allow students a breadth of curriculum that may exist through reading more diverse perspectives. Also, for a seminar, the class could've been slowed to allow for more student discussion and debate.",
                "The course was extremely well organized. I thought that there was a good balance between student interpretations or responses to the text, and Prof Kapustin's own summary of the key ideas of the thinker. Prof Kapustin asks really sharp, directed questions that help you reach a clearer, more systematic understanding of the work you are reading. I was always impressed by the clarity and eloquence with which he not only spoke about the texts, but also responded to the students.",
                "heavy reading load is a strength. more accessibility to prof would be an improvement, but he's a busy guy."

I know it is very small and selective so I would not recommend it for fun as I am sure another student needs the spot, however, if you are lucky enough to need this course then I am really excited for you! The readings are interesting (although a bunch of old white men however, such is most philosophy at Yale), and Professor Kapustin really makes the course as wonderful as it is!",
                "absolutely",
                "Absolutely! It is a required course at Yale for EPE majors, but I think the kind of cross-cirricular thinking it encouraged is beneficial to students of many disciplines. Professor Kapustin encourages students to relate the abstract philosophical questions to other topics of interest and global questions in a way that I think was really different than other philosophy courses at Yale, and a very welcome change.",
                "Yes, if you are at all interested in political philosophy",
                "No. Its a required course for EPE. But outside of that, Id just take another course.",
                "It's required for EP&E, and I would say it can either make you love it or want to drop the major. The papers are very independently driven, and the lack of \"reading responses\" certainly helps with allowing each student to learn in their own style.",
                "Yes, definitely to anyone interested in political philosophy, political economy or intellectual history. You can learn a lot and it is also very enjoyable",
                "I would mainly recommend this course to EP&E students who have to take this class for the major. Otherwise, any students looking to read political philosophy for fun may enjoy another more-discussion based class more.",
                "I took this course because it was a requirement for the EP&E major. It is good for what it is: a survey of key works in the Western canon related to EP&E, with a particular focus on political economy (and some attention to ideas of virtue at the start of the class). The syllabus traces the foundational thinkers of market/capitalist economies, and some criticisms/observations about the crisis tendencies of capitalism. It would depend on whether this interests you.",
                "yes. aside from being required, a good survey of some classic works, if presented in a strange order."
