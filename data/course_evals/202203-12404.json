            "comments": [
                "This course has some very interesting experiments. However, I would not recommend this course in its current state to anyone unless they absolutely have to take it because there is an assumption (though not explicit) that lab participants are familiar with fairly advanced python coding. Additionally, there is no way that it is reasonable to have the lab reports (notebooks) due on the day of the lab especially considering there are other courses that students are taking.",
                "This course says it doesnt require previous knowledge of python, but some Prelab problems or lab analysis questions are difficult without already knowing python. Theres no python instruction in this class; you just copy and paste and mess with the code until it does what you want it to do.",
                "The strength of the course was the various physics experiments that we were able to complete. The coverage of experiments was quite good (starting from basic mechanics and ending with some E/M and optics) and my TF (Sierra) was very helpful. However, while some of the labs were well paced (and some being very easy to finish in time), other labs were ridiculously long, to the point where certain sections of the lab were taken off since no one was finishing in time. Also, even though the turning-in-on-the-same-day policy was supposed to remove stress from the student, it actually just made me panic more since I would much prefer to finalize my lab during the weekend since my day after lab was usually my more busy day. There were some labs where I was turning in my lab at 11:50 pm, and then I would have to start studying for a math midterm the next day.",
                "The workload of the course is certainly very high, at least initially, for the credits provided. The pre-labs also have limited guidance, which can lead to some confusion when approaching complex problems - however, the pre-labs do get easier as the course progresses, both in terms of workload and difficulty.",
                "Strengths: Python-based, manageable workload, great support from the professors and TF's.\r\nWeaknesses: Very fast-paced, a lot of experiments crammed in the 3-hour slot so it was difficult to finish the lab notebook in time (both it and our summary were expected to be submitted by the end of lab, but we were given a 'grace period' by the end of the day which ended up taking up my Friday nights more often than not. Would be better if we could work on it over the weekend.) The book was outdated and did not teach how to do error analysis in Python. Although we were expected to work in Python, there was not much incentive on teaching us how to do error analysis exactly, we were rather expected to figure it out on our own or in other cases we were given templates that had all the work done for us, which also made it feel like I wasn't learning how to deal with Python.",
                "Strengths: I think the workload was pretty reflective of a 0.5-credit course, and I did appreciate learning about Jupyter notebooks and error propagation. Those will definitely be useful.\r\nWeaknesses: there was simply very little direction, and I oftentimes felt like I didn't have enough information from the material available to us before class each week to complete some pre-lab activities or to write some measurement plans. Also, it was just really unpleasant and a slog every week to go through the pre-lab having had essentially no prior experience with many of the more advanced concepts or lab devices that were central to the pre-labs. I was taking PHYS 200 concurrently and took IB HL physics in high school, but still, a lot of what we had to know about to complete the pre-labs was new material that we were basically supposed to learn from like a 10-page writeup each week, which was a bit frustrating.\r\n\r\nLabs were consistently the most stressful 3 hours of every week. The only way I could get everything done on time was by going through the motions as quickly as possible without all the thoroughness and attention to detail that I would have liked to give each experiment, and even then I normally finished half an hour after class was supposed to end. There was never enough time to fully understand everything that was going on, at least for me. It's actually hard to overestimate how unpleasant it was to try to hustle through everything as speedily as possible, because the lab directions were sooo long and had sooo many things to do and I was always scared that I would accidentally miss one and get points taken off. Which happened quite often, even though I always tried to be as fastidious as possible about including everything that was required in each lab report. Also, there was very little room for creativity or exploration in the lab process, which is an absolutely central part of any actual science lab.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, I think I was one of the slowest people in the class, so most others probably didn't have as negative of an experience in the class as me, so maybe it'd be fine for you if you're thinking about taking this class.\r\n\r\nIn general, this felt like a flipped-classroom class, which is a format that I generally dislike but that I also feel is especially poorly suited to a lab class.\r\n\r\nSuggestions for improvement: during the first little bit of class when the TA talks, it would be great to not just talk about the instruments we'll be using that day and lab safety, but also go over some of the concepts that we \"learned\" about in the pre-lab, and to go over practically what we'll be doing that day, how we should best approach it, and tips for success in that day's lab. Because those things were not adequately covered in the write-ups that we were given ahead of class.",
                "This course has an unreasonable workload. Every lab felt like a 3.5 hour exam, where you began working the minute it started and couldn't risk putting your pencil down for a minute or else you could fall behind and not complete the lab procedure in time. The length of the labs should be reduced so our engagement with individual parts could increase; I often felt disengaged with the work I was doing or the concepts I was supposed to be learning because I was trying to rush through it.",
                "Strengths: 1. Compared to previous iterations, the workload this year was supposedly much lower, so it did actually feel like a half-credit. 2. The labs are trivial to do, and the homeworks are also easy if you've seen any Python before. Weaknesses: 1. Not sure if it's possible to make an introductory lab class in physics more interesting, but three hours in lab every week definitely felt a little dull - perhaps because a lot of the things we were measuring felt trivial. Guess one has to wait until 206 for the fun stuff.",
                "A lot of writing-class should have a writing credit.",
                "Good lab.",
                "The pre-lab did not consistently aid in preparing the student well for lab each week. Many pre-labs assumed a relatively high level of knowledge on many physical concepts, and the course overall assumed certain proficiencies (e.g. python coding) that not all students had, which made learning/understanding more burdensome for some. The labs themselves were mostly well designed and what the pre-labs lacked in provided the understanding, the labs made up for. Some more specific guidance on experiment design and more thorough review/explanation on the pre-labs would greatly benefit this lab course.",
                "There is not really a purpose behind the experiments and it seems to be a lot of busywork. I did not really feel like I was learning much, rather just trying to get my work done and get out of lab. 3 hours is too long in my opinion and the fact that the lab reports were due the same day as lab was very inconvenient as I often had other activities (exams, practices, clubs) on the same day that I had lab. Some of the experiments were quite cool though.",
                "Very organized format (prelabs and lab guides), most experiments led you through the thinking very logically. Lab reports had a bit of a learning curve at the beginning, some labs were tough to write about in the time constraints we had.",
                "One strength of this course is that it exposes students to a variety of tools that cover multiple physics disciplines. One challenge with this course is that there is a steep learning curve for students such as myself who never had any hands-on physics lab experience or any experience with Python, as a certain starting level of familiarity is assumed. Additionally, there were several errors/ambiguities in the prelab, many questions were vague or assumed too much background knowledge, and sometimes it was hard to connect information from the pre-lab to the work we did during the lab sessions.",
                "One improvement that might be helpful is to offer more support to students with the large amount of programming required in the first half of the class. Perhaps instructional resources and/or office hours.\r\n\r\nAlso, the midnight same-day as lab deadline for reports was extremely stressful. I would hope that this could be reconsidered.",
                "The course was high workload, although this was recognised in the first few weeks and reduced. However, it was very difficult to complete most labs in the 3 hours allocated.",
                "Final lab reports were due at midnight for a lab that ends at 4:30, making it difficult to finish in time if you do anything in the evenings. Lab reports are almost always too long to finish during class time, so if you have evening commitments, you will just have to consistently take a late penalty.",
                "Because you work on a different topic each week, and because your knowledge of that topic will probably emerge exclusively from reading the prelab document, you do not actually learn very much about anything. And certainly, what you do learn does not stick around, because each week is completely different from the next, so you have to reason to remember anything. Plus, the topics have nothing to do with concurrent classroom physics, so you don't get any 'deeper' understanding of the topic at hand -- just enough to scrape by in the lab writeup.",
                "Its way better than in previous years  the amount of work was much more proportional to the credits, and the more relaxed lab report rules let us have more fun in class getting a feel for the equipment."

                "This course was incredibly stressful even though I already had a background in python and a fairly strong understanding of physics concepts. The only way I would recommend this course is if it was listed as 1 credit. The workload would be reasonable if the lab notebooks were due in a few days of the lab and not the day of. Additionally, there needs to be more information about python because even though I am comfortable with the language, there are plenty of people in the class that had no previous experience, creating a huge barrier.",
                "Not unless required. Labs are too long, too confusing and incredibly stressful.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, as it teaches them important lab skills (and Python), along with strengthening their physics knowledge.  However, I would caution that the work/stress that comes with this class warrants more than 0.5 credits. Additionally, even though it isn't particularly hard to get an A in this course, the grading is sometimes quite arbitrary, so be prepared to get marked off on things that are seemingly trivial.",
                "Yes, as a required intro lab course - as a free selection, perhaps not.",
                "Only if you have to take it for your major or are interested in taking more advanced labs since this is a pre-requisite. And also if you are familiar with mechanics, electricity + magnetism, optics, etc. already since the pre-labs presuppose some knowledge on these topics, and you probably will struggle to do them and deal with the equations/activity problems if you haven't encountered these in calculus-based Physics courses before.",
                "Maybe only if you need to. It really is helpful for getting some more Python Jupyter notebook familiarity and learning about error propagation and maybe for reinforcing a few physics concepts, but I feel like there are probably better ways of gaining each of these skills than enrolling in this pretty unpleasant class.",
                "No. Don't take this course if you could take 165. My friend was a physics major in this class with me, and changed his major in order to drop this course while working on a prelab together. I would have done the same if I could. This course is pointless busy work that will teach you nothing about physics.",
                "If you're taking this, you probably are a physics major and therefore have to. If not, it's only a good idea if you've never done any experimental physics labs before, and you want to understand what that might be like.",
                "Yes - was fun.",
                "No, I recommend they take 165 instead as this class is stressful for no real reason. The fact that the lab reports were due the night of the lab was extremely inconvenient and increased the stress of this class.",
                "It is required for some majors, but you learn a good deal of experimental design and execution.",
                "In terms of hands-on exposure to physics concepts, I would recommend this course because many foundational ideas are contained in the prelab and it helps to actually use the tools necessary for physics experiments.",
                "I would because the labs are interesting and fun, and I feel that I learned much in this class. However, I would caution them about the pitfalls I have already mentioned above.",
                "Yes - of course it may be necessary to your major, but it was interesting.",
                "I would absolutely not recommend this to anyone! You don't gain any lasting knowledge from this class, the workload is higher than it should be at .5 credits, the prelabs are unpleasant and confusing, and the class seems to help you learn Jupyter but actually hardly does. If you're taking lab physics, take the easier lab physics class!",
                "For sure. You may have heard that it sucks, but it really doesnt anymore. The physics department listened to student complaints and improved. Probably the most effective Yales bureaucracy has ever been."
