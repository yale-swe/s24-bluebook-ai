I'm sure there are other strengths to the course but I feel like I didn't understand like 65% of the content so I couldn't really engage with the class.\r\nWeaknesses: I think there was too much background knowledge assumed. I got lost so often. Maybe that's just me being unprepared.",
                "The course is very heavily math based which is covered quickly in lecture which can be really stressful. However, this is balanced out by the really well structured homework assignments which show you where to focus your energies studying",
                "Both Professor Zucker and Luciano were the strengths of this course.",
                "The lectures are too confusing.\r\nThe homework assignments are interesting though.",
                "Strengths: The psets are very interesting and walk you through the implementation of concepts discussed during lecture (this greatly clarified some concepts that I did not immediately understand from lecture, such as eigenfaces or the difference between various edge detection algorithms). Professor Zucker is an engaging lecturer and passionate about the material. His slides were very detailed and made the mathematical operations or computer vision algorithms easier to follow, despite the virtual format of the class. Overall, I enjoyed the lectures and thought the material was interesting. Office hours with Luciano were incredibly helpful. Workload was manageable: 6 psets and a final project. There were no exams this year because of the virtual format, which was great. I think having a final project for a CS class is a much better option than a final exam.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Zucker's lecture notes are not very high quality. They're supposed to supplement the lectures, but some of the notes have sections missing or are very long and discuss topics that were not covered in class. I hope that he will edit them so that future students can use them as an additional resource, if they're confused about something from lecture. A lot of difficult math is introduced in this class, and there were some lectures where I felt very lost, so more lectures or office hours devoted to explaining those concepts would be helpful. Those concepts often were not covered by the psets, so I don't think I ever fully understood them. I would have liked more focus on neural networks, since we went over that section of the syllabus very quickly.",
                "I thought it was pretty good overall.",
                "Solid lecture (although somewhat boring). Incredibly slow grading (but very easy to do well).",
                "The strength of the course is the breadth of topics it covers. Topics range from pure biology, e.g., the anatomy of the visual cortex, to pure math, e.g., Fourier transforms, to pure computer science, e.g. the k-means algorithm and PCA, to everything in between, e.g., how biological perception of edges inspire edge detection algorithms. However, the tradeoff for such breadth is depth. Typically, we spend around one or two lectures covering each topic, which is certainly not enough to explore all the interesting concepts it offers.",
                "The material was very interesting and the professor was top notch. Assignments and support for the class was also pretty good. I wish, however, that the assignments and assessments were a little better connected to the material being taught in the lecture. It often felt like the assignments and the lecture were only tangentially related since the lectures were very theoretical, while the assignments were all practical applications without direct connections.",
                "Professor Zucker is extremely kind and you can tell he actually cares about his students. The psets also are super engaging and fun once you get over the hurdle of understanding how matlab and the corresponding python libraries work. At the same time, the psets were frustrating at times when they had errors and didn't work on my OS or had vague dependency problems that were not easily solved. This could be helped with more office hours and a clearer tutorial on how to actually use the matlab library. Another issue is how fast material was covered in lecture. We often skimmed through advanced math which on some level I understand but then at that point why even present the math and the proofs if we aren't even going to spend time understanding any of it. I wish the lecture notes were shorter and not 60 pages long otherwise I would read them but as it is now they are too long and it's difficult to find out what is important and what isn't.",

                "Course is useful in developing familiarity with concepts and practice in computational vision. However, the homework and the material covered in lecture can feel disjoint at times.",
                "The materials was very interesting, and professor Zucker was a great lecturer. He spent a lot of time on his presentation and it showed because even though the materials are challenging, the lectures are often easy to follow. The TA were also very quick to answer any email questions that I have.",

                "The notes on the material are thorough, the slides during live classes are truly a work of art, the problem sets are really fun to work on, the final project I worked on allowed me to be creative and apply key concepts of the course and the class is one of the most engaging ones I have taken at Yale thanks to Professor Zucker. However, the amount of material covered in the class is truly astronomical. It makes sense since without such a breadth of topics, I feel like I would leave this course with a more limited idea of computer vision, but the sheer pace and materials covered can be overwhelming at first.",
                "The labs were helpful in learning the material and seeing how it is used. Lectures felt extremely detailed, at times hard to understand, and for the most part only 10% of the lectures were necessary to understand the general idea and complete the labs. I enjoyed working on the final project as we got to choose which technique that we learned we get to play around with.",

                "The office hours hosted by the TAs were fantastic, and I appreciated that the lectures were recorded which was fantastic for comprehension as the lectures were dense so the ability to go back to places that were confusing was fantastic.",
                "Professor Zucker had intricate and well-organized slides that were very useful for the virtual lecture format. The slide decks were super long (maybe 60 slides per lecture). However, that's because some slides were about complex, mathematical algorithms\/operations, and each time Professor Zucker clicked, the next step of the process would appear on the slide. In other words, a sequence of slides within the 60 slides would look very similar because each one was an extension of the slide preceding it. This setup, showing the steps one by one, actually helped clarify the concepts being presented. It simulated the professor writing out the steps one by one on a blackboard, which slows down the lecture and allows the students to follow the professor's thinking process. I recommend other professors, if they're teaching math-heavy courses through virtual lectures, to also put a lot of effort into their slides and do something like what Professor Zucker did. When professors show all the steps at once on a single slide, it can be overwhelming, and it's harder for the students to follow the process. \r\n\r\nI plan to suggest this to all of my professors: professors should encourage a culture of cameras on. For this class, there were about 100 students, and almost everyone had their cameras on at the beginning of the semester. By the end of the semester, however, only about 20 people showed up to live lecture, and only a handful turned on their cameras. This made the class much less engaging because it felt as if Professor Zucker was just talking into a void. As a student, I know how desirable it is to turn off the camera during a Zoom call and just listen to others talk. However, I also know that when you do this, it is so easy to just zone out and maybe do other things on the computer or walk around the room. Im definitely a more active listener and participant when my camera is on. I know that professors cant force students to turn on their cameras, but maybe if professors ask students to do so at the beginning of every single lecture, more students will feel encouraged or compelled to do so. Maybe the constant reminder will make turning on cameras into a habit. As soon as one student turns off his\/her camera, everyone starts doing it, so my hope is that professors will find a way to stop this trend.",

                "Yes, especially if you're a CS major looking for a science credit (like myself), then this is a great choice! It's true that this is not a traditional computer vision class, and you wont be focusing on convolutional neural networks or machine learning. Youll learn about biological vision concepts, in addition to computer vision concepts\/applications. Nevertheless, I found most of the topics to be very interesting. It ends up being a mixture of CS, biology, and math, so I believe the class is accessible to those who are not CS majors as well. It will definitely help if you have some linear algebra knowledge. The math can get very complicated, although we were not tested on it this year. Professor Zucker is a really engaging and funny lecturer! Hes super passionate about the material, especially the biological perception topics that relate to his research. The assignments were manageable, well-designed, and interesting. They greatly clarified any concepts that I did not fully understand from lecture. I didnt keep track, but my guess is that each homework took me about 10-12 hours, and we were given 2 weeks to do each one. Office hours were super helpful. Make sure you go if you have any questions, especially if Luciano is still the TF. We had 6 homework assignments in total, and because of the pandemic, we had a final project instead of a midterm\/final. I saw that a lot of the negative reviews from past years were about the exams being really difficult. Therefore, my review might be biased since I didn't have to suffer from memorizing a bunch of random facts for the midterm\/final. The class isn't perfect--some of the math-heavy lectures were a bit random \/ difficult to follow, I'd like to learn about the more modern applications of computer vision--but I would still recommend since the workload is manageable for a CS elective and the material is interesting.",
                "Yes, but note that this is not a pure computational course. If you're taking this to learn about CNNs\/deep learning, this is not the right course, as they only come up much later. But if you're interested in human vision, then this course is really interesting and fun",

Also, if you don't care about learning and just want a science credit and could care less about understanding then take this class. I know people who stopped going to lecture a few weeks in and were able to do just as well as me who attended lectures. This course has a lot of potential to be interesting and fun except it tries to appeal to too many people and thereby waters down the material. We went over Fourier series so fast and the math behind it so that since I don't have the math background for it it just flew over my head. Either add some prerequisites or don't go over the math or at least give some more solid intuition for what I should take away and make that very clear. It was frustrating going to lecture and not understanding much and not having the ability to ask questions because I didn't know what to ask.",
                "yes, especially if u r a computational neuroscientist",
                "Yes. This is a great CS elective.",
                "If you are interested in computer vision, yes. But expect there to be a lot of linear algebra.",
                "Absolutely, if the material is of interest to the student. This course was eye-opening and I feel like taking more courses in computer vision in the future. I gained exposure to topics I would never have encountered otherwise, especially biology. It was truly a fun course and the final project gave me an opportunity to be fully creative, while applying my coding and research skills.",
                "If they are interested in computational vision and already have some background in it, yes. I took it for the SC credit as a CS major, so I felt like I only took away 10% of the things from the lecture as I wasn't really interested in the details that Professor Zucker gets into.",
                "The course is a great survey of the many different types of biological systems involved with vision and the different ways they can be modeled \/ investigated.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, the material is pretty interesting and the professor is very passionate.",
                "Yes! Such interesting material, not to much stress, and Zucker is amazing.",
                "Take this course!!! Awesome, well taught, accessible and exciting. Provides a high-level overview of a number of fields, married in a wonderfully interdisciplinary way that tackles profound questions about perception and consciousness. Loved it!"
