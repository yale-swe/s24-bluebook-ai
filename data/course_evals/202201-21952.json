Getting a good grade on these assignments was more about copying everything managers said during class rather than learning how to critique them. Overall not a very enjoyable course but has potential.",

It was also very clear how much thought the Investments Office puts into the course, as everything has a clear purpose. The only thing I think could be improved was just the communication at times, as there were a couple of times when a major assignment was given less than a week before it was due.",

I think it could also be interesting if the course was more connected with the investments office. I think that the presentations could have been announced with more warning.",
