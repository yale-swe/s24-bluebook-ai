Wonderful instructors, wonderful financial writing assignments (excellent critical thinking opportunities through the 4 writing assignments in particular) and an awesome TA, Joe Doran, as well. Thanks to Amy and Alex for everything.",

Getting a good grade on these assignments was more about copying everything managers said during class rather than learning how to critique them. Overall not a very enjoyable course but has potential.",
                "This is a very high-engagement course with fascinating speakers. All the students were very driven and curious about what exactly the endowment does. It was also very clear how much thought the Investments Office puts into the course, as everything has a clear purpose. The only thing I think could be improved was just the communication at times, as there were a couple of times when a major assignment was given less than a week before it was due.",
                "You need to be able to take good notes during the speaker presentations in order to do well because your grade is based primarily on essays from their presentations. I think this class really helps build that skill and the speakers are extremely engaging.",

                "Everything was great",
                "I loved the seminar setting with the speakers every other week. This course could be improved with more engagement from the professors, like using office hours. I think it could also be interesting if the course was more connected with the investments office. I think that the presentations could have been announced with more warning.",
                "The teaching staff and the guest speakers are truly enlightening in ways beyond description. The opportunity to have in-depth conversations with some of the most legendary investors is priceless. \r\nWeakness? I wish the class sessions could be longer!"
