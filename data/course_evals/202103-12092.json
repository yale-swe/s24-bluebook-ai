Weaknesses - use of software is not taught in detail and critiques take a lot of time. More tutorials or in-class workshops for using each program (and more features within each program) would be useful",

Occasionally we ran into issues such as sharing 3-D work and there was some down-time during class in terms of setting up devices. If those could be done more efficiently, either by giving students instructions to do them at home or having them set up ahead of time, there would be more class time for other projects potentially."
