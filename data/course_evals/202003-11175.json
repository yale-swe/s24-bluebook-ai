                "The only weakness of the course is being unclear on what characters students should learn. It is much too difficult to learn to draw and remember 5 new characters every day on top of the homework assigned. Learning to draw 2-3 characters a day is more realistic. \r\n\r\nThe class is super fun, the teachers are amazing, and the class is very fast paced. I loved it.",
                "It's mostly directed at accuracy with little or no focus on freer practice or personalization of some sort. I feel confident about the grammar and vocabulary that we learned, thanks to individual tutorials I can read very well, but there were very few opportunities to use the language out of drills and translation exercises. I loved essays in the first chapter tests, but after that quizzes and tests looked exactly like home assignments in the workbook. It implies our progress was evaluated within the ability to transform \/ translate correctly, while I wish there had been more opportunities to express myself and use a bit of creativity. \r\n\r\nI know the course is fast paced, and my instructor is absolutely great and doing his best in this pace, but I'm afraid when audio-lingualism and grammar translation method dominate classroom it doesn't lead to a more effective language acquisition.",
                "Strengths: Even via Zoom, this class was highly interactive. Daily homework wasn't overwhelming, and kept us all learning at the same pace. The instructors were amazing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we'd had to submit pictures of our character worksheets and get some sort of completion credit for them. As is, writing didn't count for our grade until the final exam, which lead a lot of students to either cheat on the final, or do pretty poorly. Given that it wasn't graded and there was so much other work going on in the class, few students kept learning how to write characters, given that it wasn't tested for the majority of the semester. This is specific to the online format, though, and this is really the only weakness I've got to point out. Overall, 11\/10 would recommend!",
                "Strengths: This course covers a lot of material very quickly.\r\nWeakness: It would have been helpful if the course goals and structure was more clearly outlined to the students earlier in the semester.",
                "The pace of this course was just right. Every day, I faced the challenge of learning new words and language structures. The lectures gave plenty of examples of how to use these new structures, and could be easily accessed online for future reference when preparing for exams. If I could make one change, I would probably include some more time for students to ask questions in lecture. Because the lecture is only 45 minutes, we often needed the full period to cover all the material listed on the lecture slides and little time was left over to ask clarifying questions. I would also appreciate more opportunities to hold Chinese conversations to achieve greater verbal fluency.",
                "The course is very hard by nature of the language but it makes up for it with amazing professors, tutoring sections, and daily quizzes to ensure we understand. It would help if at the end of the quizzes it asked what we were confused about for that section and the professor could spend time on that."

I also found the study guides that were posted before each exam quite helpful in guiding my studying. In spite of the virtual learning environment, the frequent usage of breakout rooms in class also helped to foster a greater sense of community than I felt in other virtual classes. The only minor issue we faced involved poor internet connections which made it harder to hear others' voices, but this was not a common problem.",

Although it is fast-paced, the course offers a very solid foundation in Chinese vocabulary and grammar. By the end of this course you'll be able to hold very basic conversations in Chinese. Most importantly, you'll be well prepared for future Chinese language study.",
                "I would recommend Chinese to another student. One reason is that it is a great language for those looking into economics and other industry based majors because China is a great part of those fields. But also it is very rewarding when learning it. There is a lot of work that needs to be put into it but when you do you feel great having worked to understand."
