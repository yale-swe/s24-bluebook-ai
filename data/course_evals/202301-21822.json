However, the course seminar was not constructive, and Professor Berger did not facilitate discussion but instead dominated it.",

I dont feel that I developed any new skills or insights in this course."

Clear and relevant discussion questions, time for each student to speak without interruption or soliloquy from the professor, and clear guidance from the professor when the conversation strays would make the course better. The course assessments were a strength, being flexible and instructive.",

                "This course really suffered from a lack of overarching direction. After taking this course, I couldnt see a central theme that connected all of the readings and discussions. I thought the work and readings we did before spring break clearly connected, but I wasnt sure how the readings during the last 1/3 of the semester connected to the earlier ones at all."

                "The course's value seems to depend on the group of students taking it, as well as how they interact with Professor Berger. I don't particularly recommend the course, since the amount I learned compared to the amount of time I felt annoyed by how little we were learning or discussing was not sufficient.",
                "Yes I would for people in the major. He can be a tough grader, but overall good course.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. The course was poorly organized, and especially during the second half of the semester it was unclear, even after a 2 hour discussion, how some of the readings connected to any of the others. This course was also hamstrung by the low enrollment this year: a 2 hour seminar with only 7 students is a stretch. I thought professor Berger did an outstanding job filling in the silences that arose, but the discussion was often strained and frequently centered on tangents to vaguely related topics and books we hadnt read for class."
