                "The guest speakers were a great way to break up the lectures and I enjoyed how you would do short lectures in the beginning of class then shift to seminar conversation.",
                "Great course! Grading is stressful, but overall great course",
                "Very well put together - the professor was very knowledgable and the material was very interesting. I am not into law or want to necessary be a lawyer but  I still really enjoyed the course. Plus it counts as an HU and a SO elective. The two guest lectures were also very valuable.",
                "This course was my favorite course ever taken at Yale. Professor Xie is amazing and I loved the variety of readings mixed with pop culture applications. My one suggestion is more feedback on the reading responses.",
                "Strengths are that its low courseload, weaknesses are disorganized",
                "The material was cool. The reading responses were pretty long and felt more like short essays. I think also the lectures could've been a bit more grounded in the readings.",
                "I wish we had more debates.",
                "I wish there was a way for us to consider the questions asked in class prior to class, like an overarching question.",
                "Strengths: really fascinating content - it is one of the few classes that I legitimately did all my readings for just cause they were so interesting, Cece also does a great job breaking down complex issues and demystifying intellectual property law; Weaknesses: final project felt like it needed more structure, I ended up doing a paper but would've preferred to do a project had I been given a rubric\/more detailed expectations in an outline; the reading responses were also a little much, and I would prefer weekly shorter responses rather than biweekly essay responses, especially since the response mostly just serves as an incentive to do the reading",
                "Strengths: material is very relevant to today, readings can be fun, prof is laidback and chill\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: discussions can be lacking"

                "Absolutely!! You have to take this course if you are interested in intellectual property law or law in general. It was amazing and made me so much more confident in reading court cases and analyzing them.",
                "Absolutely yes! Cece is amazing. This class is such a great look at the law and although IP law can seem boring on the surface level I found it fascinating and way more applicable than I thought it would be. A great pick for anyone interested in law, technology, or a combination of the two.",
                "Yes, as a fifth class!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in intellectual property. I'm not sure how satisfying it would be for someone who is mainly interested in the tech-side of the class, but it certainly gets there.",
                "Yes, Cece is a blessing.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Xie is brilliant and very kind.",
