                "I don't learn very well online so this course was not the best fit for me.",
                "I think the teaching fellows and the instructor are eager to answer questions in a multitude of ways which is really helpful. I think I ultimately did not engage with the course to the level that I needed to because of the asynchronous structure.",
                "Strengths - funny jokes and Prof. comes up with great mnemonics to help you remember class content; helpful office hours to review psets.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - a lot is covered... video lessons are very long; online flipped classroom format makes it very hard to stay engaged and take in content from videos",
                "This course is taught online through lectures uploaded to Canvas, which is great for taking your time and truly learning the material.",
                "I think the course would be improved if it weren't taught asynchronously. I didn't necessarily see the gain of a flipped classroom and felt I would've been more engaged with a standard in-person mandatory lecture.",
                "Going to in-person class was critical for me, so encouraging that more would be good!",
                "The strength was definitely its format. The flipped classroom model was very effective for my learning.",
                "A huge strength is the pre-recorded videos that you can completely rely on just those for the entire course.",
                "Flipped classroom was nice in some ways since you didn't have to go to lecture in person but it became very easy to fall behind in class.",
                "I think its great that the course is taught as a flipped classroom. It allows students to learn at their own pace.\r\nI think it could be improved by adding more office hours",
                "The material was very interesting and very applicable.",
                "I think the course material is good for an introductory course and I thought the content was relatively interesting. I did not really like the asynchronous setup. It made it hard to stay on top of the lectures and felt as if I could have learned everything taught in the class on youtube. I would have preferred an in-person class where it was easier to stay engaged with the material.",
                "I did not like the mainly online portion of this course. I believe it held me back from learning to my maximum potential. I cannot name any strengths",
                "The strengths of the course was that it gave me a very strong foundational knowledge of statistics and R coding. All of the flipped classroom lectures were easy to follow and the problem sets were very doable. The ULAs were extremely helpful during office hours when I had questions on the psets or course material. The one small weakness was that since I went to both the optional in-person classes and watched all of the flipped classroom videos, sometimes the in person section could feel slightly repetitive, but this was definitely not a large problem.",
                "This is basically a Coursera online course. All the materials are taught flipped classroom, with pre-recorded Covid-era videos posted on Canvas. I can't believe that the only times that I ever had to interact with the professor were to sit for the midterm and final exam. Prof held open question time during what would have been lecture time, but I never felt it was necessary or even worthwhile to go, and I think this is a poor excuse for teaching an actual class at Yale. I have taken so many intro level lectures, including many in STEM, and there was nothing distinguishing this course from a non-Yale stats class that I could have found online for free.",
                "The p-sets are manageable for the most part, and the flipped classroom allows for a lot of choice concerning engagement with the material and the time commitment week to week. However, it is very self-motivated and requires a lot of organization, which can be challenging if you fall behind.",
                "Strengths - Professor was clear and concise, exams were fair, project was interesting \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Async made it sometimes hard to be engaged",
                "Biggest weakness was it being fully online and the class time being at 9am. It should have a stronger in person component.",
                "I liked the flipped classroom method, which meant that we could go into more detail and ask questions about the material during the lectures.",
                "Strengths: this course is a great not-so-demanding math class. I took it because I was never a math student in highschool but wanted to try something new. It felt like an appropriate level of challenge without taking over my workload. \r\nWeaknesses: second semester, the videos became really hard to keep up with. They became very long and more confusing than in the first semester. The material was not clearly linked.",
                "The strengths were that it was fairly straightforward and the exams were fair. The weaknesses was that the learning style was a bit difficult and the grading was very specific and a bit harsh.",
                "strengths: videos available all times, office hours TFs were really helpful.\r\nweaknesses: videos available all times made engagement quite low",
                "Strengths: flipped format is amazing, allows you to go slower/faster, felt super comfortable with the coding portion as someone with very little coding background, amazing explanations, really fair PSETS, interesting, literally amazing\r\nWeaknesses: can't really think of any, could be a bit much at times but can always rewatch videos, etc",
                "It is well structured with the flipped classroom and the assignments are pretty straightforward. Reasonable expectations.\r\nI think because of the flipped classroom and somewhat ambiguous wording on PSETS, having more peer tutors and ULAs would be helpful",
                "The videos asynchronous were a bit tedious",
                "The homeworks were great; they helped me learn a lot and apply the concepts learned in class. I believe the exams need to be improved, however; there were questions about things not mentioned in class and we only got 1 practice exam; for comparison, all other STEM classes I've taken so far had at least 3 practice exams.",
                "The online class videos that were posted were very clear and helpful!",
                "A strength is the online resources available to use at your convenience. A weakness is the limited availability of office hours",
                "I learned a lot about statistical analysis and how to use statistics in the real world. I really appreciated how accessible and applicable the course material was.",
                "Strengths: videos are thorough and rewatchable at your own pace\r\nWeaknesses: Reverse classroom style is tedious and requires learning new material outside of class. Both the 9AM class as well as the reverse classroom style discourages attending in-person class.",
                "I did not like that the content was delivered electronically. It made me less engaged.",

                "strengths were the homework and the quizzes that accommodated the videos, but this class might work better solely in person.",
                "Great course, well structured.",
                "Strengths: Very well organized, lots of office hours offered, and I really enjoyed the flipped-classroom set-up Weaknesses: Lecture quizzes often felt tedious/a lot of questions felt unnecessary",
                "Strengths: flipped classroom\r\nWeakness: easy to fall behind",
                "I enjoyed the flipped classroom design as it let us work at our own pace. I think the lecture time though could have been used more productively than just recapping the videos and troubleshooting questions.",
                "loved that it was fully asynchronous and could do it on my own time",
                "I personally did not like the flipped classroom approach. While the lectures were provided as recordings, I felt that the in person class time was a bit unorganized. It often felt like repetition at the beginning of class and less time spend on practice problems.",
                "I wish that the in class times had been spent expanding on the lesson not repeating it",
                "The strengths were the recorded lectures. It could be improved if worked solutions to the quiz questions were provided in the videos, especially questions that dealt with R.",
                "One of the strengths of this class is that it is done via a flipped classroom. You can fit it better with scheduling conflicts because of this.",
                "Strengths: very clear lectures and straightforward assignments. I appreciated that everything felt very clear and easy to follow. The flipped classroom nature also allowed for a more flexible learning environment, which I appreciated \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: in-person classes would be more helpful with less review and more examples",
                "There were many resources for students",
                "lectures are really boring but it's a pretty straightforward course",
                "Topics were things I'm glad that I now know. The course was overall not very challenging, and I felt like the content was repetitive.",
                "The strengths of this course is that everyone can go at their own pace when learning the content, since everything is taught in videos. Then, if you need extra help, you have the option to go to the live class. In the live class, we did a lot of practice problems which was very helpful for learning the concepts.",
                "Strength: ability to take class on canvas. in person office hours\r\n\r\nweakness: multiple choice on exams felt too hard",
                "topics are gone over sooooo quickly and it is hard to catch up when you fall behind. also definitely not a solo course--- you'll NEED a friend or buddy to get through it even though it's asynchronous. \r\nstrength is that it is asynchronous so it is flexible with your schedule",
                "Strengths: asynchronous format, clear and concise videos, accessible and kind TAs\r\nWeaknesses: 9am lectures made it less likely for me to attend the optional sessions",
                "I had a lot of trouble with the fact that this class was a flipped model and think that I would've learned better if it had been fully in person.",
                "I really enjoyed the flipped teaching style and abundance of office hours available.",
                "This was an overall wonderful introduction to statistics. For students who have never taken statistics or had a high school introduction, this was easy to get into.",
                "I found the lecture videos so long and getting into the weeds a bit which made me feel very lost",
                "Having videos be available for those who need to re watch lectures like myself is a strength. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "The flipped classroom format of this class allowed me to learn at my own pace and return to videos on any concepts I felt confused about. The videos were sometimes dry, and it was hard to stay motivated to keep up with all of the lessons. The lessons were sometimes too long. Ed Discussions was a super helpful resource, and I always had all of my questions answered very quickly. The TAs were always really helpful in office hours. I did not like the final project, and I don't think it was a helpful way to assess our understanding of the class material given the difficulty of finding a data set appropriate for the kinds of statistical analyses we had learned to run. Beyond that, it just felt like a repetition of the kind of work we did on PSETs. I wish the project had a slightly more specific assignment that asked us to extend our knowledge more. I also think the pacing got a lot quicker in the second half of semester, and it was hard to keep up with the more challenging material.",
                "Weakness is that the professor was inaccessible outside of class hours. He held office hours right after class which was unhelpful when my schedule didn't match up. (our class ended at 10:15am, and most people have 10:30am classes, so office hours at this time is suboptimal). It is completely understandable that he cannot schedule a time that works for everyone. The issue though is that if we couldn't attend office hours with him, he was difficult to reach outside of class to schedule a time. He pretty much just said to ask the undergraduate TAs for help. \r\n\r\nSo I felt like I was at a state school with very little air time with the actual professor and pretty much only getting help from a junior or senior who might have taken his class before. Not a fan. \r\n\r\nA major strength of the course is the format. He makes class attendance optional and provides lectures all online. which means there are SO many ways to be engaged in the course. It was not a gut though. Quite difficult actually, but I really appreciated having the option to look at the videos and go to the undergraduate TA when attending a 9am class was not feasible. I went to class 88% of the time and it really helped my learning, because that is how I learn best.",
                "I think a greater emphasis on in person class might be good.",
                "I really liked the Ed Discussion board, as it allowed me to seek immediate feedback from the professor, staff, and other students. It was an incredibly valuable resource. The class' asynchronous design allowed me to digest the content whenever most convenient, but I ultimately prefer a typical classroom set up.",
                "Strengths: great job at reviewing previous material in class  before staring new concept",
                "The course provides students with multiple \"formats\" of learning (i.e. online lectures, in-person classes, office hours, P-sets), which allowed us to acquire the knowledge in the way which was best fit to our studying habits. Overall, I enjoyed the course and no significant weaknesses about its format come to mind.",
                "Strengths: built-in review of learned topics, clarity of instruction\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: monotony, professor's failure to make class engaging, flipped classroom model"

                "I think I would recommend it to another student but would tell them that it's really important to stay on top of the lectures and that if you're not someone who can do that then I would not recommend it.",
                "No, I would not. It was hard to adapt to the learning environment, as well as the workload and time commitment.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I had never taken a statistics class before this or learned any coding, but I was able to understand all of the course material and become comfortable using R. All of the skills I learned in this class are very applicable even though I do not plan to major in S&DS or get a S&DS certificate.",

                "If they want a basic understanding of statistics, yes.",
                "Yes. If you need a stats background, this is a great place to start.",
                "Yes because it was a fun and fairly accessible way to learn the basics of statistics which is a useful life skill.",
                "I would! If you are hesitant about taking a math class at Yale but still want to/ want something useful I would recommend it. I think I got a lot out of it without it being overbearing.",
                "I mostly would, but I honestly may recommend a different into to stats class for a bit of a lesser workload. It was overall taught pretty clearly though and I feel I definitely walked away with more knowledge.",
                "not really .\r\n- you learn the similar concepts as you would do in 240 for a example but with more exams and therefore more exam stress.\r\n- learning style of online was really convenient when wanting to review but also made student engagement pretty low...",
                "Absolutely. Came into this as someone knowing nothing about statistics, took it as a pre-med req, loved it, may take more stats courses in the future, interesting without having a super heavy workload or requiring prereqs/previous knowledge which is rare at Yale.",
                "Yes, it's a good introduction to statistics for those without any background knowledge in stats or coding. If you have any experience, it might be a bit elementary",
                "Yes, for a QR credit",
                "Yes, with caveats; if you are a more stem-inclined person, I would recommend taking the intensive introductory statistics instead.",
                "Yes because the content of the course is stimulating and the professor is good at teaching the material",
                "Yes definetly. It teaches you applicable and marketable statistics skills + coding in R. It is very useful irregardless of whatever you hope to pursue in the future.",

                "Yes I enjoyed it.",
                "yes! great intro stats course if you just need the requirement",
                "Yes. I would recommend this course because I developed skills in coding as well as statistics. Additionally, the class is flipped, so attending lecture in person is not required.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It was a comprehensive overview of statistics that touched on all the major aspects within the field while.",

You gain an intuition of how to look at any set of data like a data scientist, and you begin to understand the power of statistics; it is very easy to stretch the truth with statistics and accidentally include biases. This course helps students learn to avoid biases.",

                "Yes, not too hard of a class and the content is useful to know as general knowledge.",
                "I would if they were interesting in learning R and had never coded before.",
                "Yes; I think this was a great course that allowed students to learn some practical knowledge about a very important subject in a way that did not overwhelm an unsuspecting humanities student.",
                "Yes; learning a coding language was interesting and exciting as well as basic statistics which I know will appear to be useful later in my life",
                "I would recommend this class, because I believe it is an excellent introduction to the most important statistical tools that show themselves to be useful in multiple contexts - from data analysis, to scientific research and identifying trends in a source of information. I was happy to gain abilities in programming in R as well, which I believe is useful to students pursuing very diverse majors at Yale.",
                "Not really. It works in a pinch for a QR credit, but I was bored most of the time and just hurried through the work."
