   "comments": [
    "I learned to deal with children better and learned about various aspects of early childhood education.",
    "I learned about child development and designing a curriculum for young children, but best of all I learned how to care for young children by understanding their mindset. I really believe this course will actually make me a better parent and family member in the future.",
    "i learned about child development, curriculum, theory, etc. beyond that, i learned from observing children firsthand. on my first day in the classroom, i was uncomfortable, unsure of what to do. i've learned so much more about the children since that first day, i've learned about my own biases, and how valuable early childhood education is. and that it's up to us to bring it to the public's attention",
    "I learned the importance of the school environment to foster the growth of a child's development in a number of ways, namely physical growth, social\/emotional development, critical thinking, and other cognitive abilities.",
    "I learned a lot about early childhood education, how to evaluate students and schools, and about current issues in child education.",
    "I learned about early childhood development theory in class and applied my discussions and readings to the daycare environment through weekly observations. The opportunity to observe at Calvin Hill Daycare is truly unique and hard to come by, and it was so interesting to apply what I had learned to the preschool class and ask the teachers questions.",
    "Better observation skills, understanding of behavior and social-emotional competence in early childhood, the progression of development between threes and five year olds",
    "I learned a lot about Child Development and how the confluence of the roles of parent, student, and teacher.",
    "I learned both the pedagogy and practice of early childhood education. I learned about the development of children, the appropriate materials for an early childhood education classroom, the role of the teachers, and much more. I learned how to connect pedagogy to what I was observing in the classroom."

   "comments": [
    "Really awesome course! THE realest course I have taken at Yale. I loved the observations at Calvin Hill, although it was a big time commitment and could be easier if every other week or for only an hour a week.",
    "The material is a bit too intuitive sometimes, but it is very useful if you're interested in children (having or working with) and always good to have confirmation of your intuition and talk about interesting topics. Classes are fun and it's not a lot of work. The children are sooooo cute and it's so much fun to do the observations.",
    "The observations are a massive strength: they're the perfect time to get a glimpse of real life outside Yale and give back to the children you meet.",
    "observation was the most valuable part of this course--it's so special to have the trust to interact with kids firsthand and watch them grow so much just over the course of a semester. class at calvin hill was a bit of a trek, but it was valuable to have conversations with the teachers at the school. each of them is an encyclopedia of information in their own right. being able to have online copies of sample observations and final papers would have aided (even though we read one in class, i'm just more visual than that) in my writing. i loved working with blocks and would have loved more hands-on activities like that. readings were really interesting, especially the books, but a lot of the articles at times got redundant and i felt could have been cut. nonetheless, they were all really engaging, they just had a lot of the same arguments.",
    "The weekly observations, in my opinion, were the best parts of the course. I really enjoyed being involved in the children's learning, even if only for two hours a week. I also really enjoyed getting hands-on experience with the learning material, such as block building. The only weakness was not being able to discuss our child assessments with the teachers. It would have been really great to do so.",
    "The content of this course is phenomenal. The topics covered are extremely diverse, so various interests are covered. Moreover, the topics are discovered in various ways which increases the impact of the content. \r\n\r\nThe practicum (observation) is extremely rewarding, especially when what is observed is connected to what is learned in class. \r\n\r\nThe discussion-centric nature of the class is also really great. \r\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems is the location of the course. It would be much more convenient if it were taught at a closer location.",
    "This course is extremely interactive!  I love how the observations were structured and that the professor gave us many chances to participate in class.\r\n\r\nI do wish more time was given for the assessment of the books we brought in and for the time to experiment with the art materials to be included.",
    "The journals are a great way to keep track of our observations and how they connect with the material we are studying, and Professor Horwitz gives extremely detailed feedback which helps us improve over the course of the class.",
    "Some strengths are that it's a very unique classroom experience to have both seminar and weekly observation requirements in a preschool or kindergarten classroom. A weakness is that this not really a class about early childhood education, but rather a class about the Calvin Hill Daycare Center where you do your weekly observations. Also, the syllabus needs to be updated!",
    "The syllabus should be updated, both to include fewer readings and to have more recent readings. It would be nice to have more discussion-based classes as well. Otherwise, great! I loved this class.",
    "The weekly observation, the essays, and the ability to talk to professionals in the field made this class come alive in ways that most classes at Yale do not. The only weakness is that Calvin Hill is not realistically walkable, so you have to be committed to the shuttle\/to the time it takes to get there."

   "comments": [
    "ABSOLUTELY!!!",
    "Yes, super fun and educational! Such a positive environment and you learn a lot!",
    "Yes!!! Great course if you like children or are interested in education. When I was deciding whether I would take the course I was scared by the amount of readings, but it's really not a lot of work so don't worry about it.",
    "Yeah, it was an interesting class, definitely really different from anything else I've done.  It can be kind of tough to fit in your schedule, but the obeservation sections are a really hands on way to get a different perspective from most of the classes at Yale.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course, especially if you're a stem major, as it's a wonderful break from psets and helps you build better relationships with classmates, teachers and children, as well as making you reflect on your own experiences in childhood.",
    "if you can get in, take this course. the most valuable part is undoubtedly the ability to observe children and see them grow so much over the course of a single semester. each week, i felt i could also monitor my own growth--now i feel so in-touch with my biases going into the course. i feel like this course has made me realize how interesting children are and will make me a more-informed parent and educator one day. the writing in this class is not based on structural nuances, but content, so it's not like other writing courses where you have to deliberate for hours about the correct phrase. carla is really just there to facilitate your learning. this course singlehandedly makes me want to pursue education as a career path. there's so much left to learn.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you like children. I came in with a slight interest in children, but this course has truly made me appreciate the complexities and intricacies that underlie childhood education and development.",
    "This class is extremely important for anyone who wants to work with kids in the future. And if you are interested in education policy, child development, math, science, this is also the class for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students as I think that it teaches a lot of material that is relevant to all students' lives, even if they aren't planning to be teachers.  I would however, warn other students that this course is a significant time commitment, between the trip up science hill and the weekly observations.  But it's definitely worth it!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student; Professor Horwitz is so knowledgeable and the discussions are always engaging and intellectually stimulating.",
    "Yes. It was certainly not the most work-heavy class, but you do get a  lot out of it in the end.",
    "Yes! Very interesting and engaging.",
    "Absolutely! The observation and exposure to experts in the field make this class both fascinating, practical, and unique."
