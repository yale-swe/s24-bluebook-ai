                "I gained a large amount of insights, skills, and knowledge by taking this course! Going into the course, I had a very one-sided view of the Indian Ocean, but Dr. Yahaya's choice of readings and meaningful discussions has truly changed the way I look at the Indian Ocean and has inspired me to definitely take more history courses at Yale. The material challenged my viewpoints and allowed me to look at history from various perspectives. It taught me to embrace the complexity of our past, and to stray away from looking at an event from a single perspective. I truly appreciate the insight this course has brought me, and it is all due to Dr. Yahaya's passion for teaching.",
                "I learnt how to detect and prove the existence of historical trends from a ground-level perspective. Also learnt a plethora of analytical skills built from analyzing historical evidence.",
                "I learned how to analyze primary texts and think about history through a critical lense.",
                "I gained deep insights into Indian Ocean world, culture, and economy. I learned collaborative discussion, listening to my peers in the course, learning through them, and loving the community of my peers. I learned how to write a true historical essay, as well as get through historical readings quickly with efficient analysis to extract claims.",
                "We learned a lot about the Indian Ocean starting in the pre modern era going into the colonial era. Some of the skills we developed included conducting research as well as writing response papers and essays.",
                "I knew nothing about the indian ocean before this class but now I feel like I have a good baseline of understanding from the medieval to modern period. Dr. Yahaya teaches history from economic, anthropological, environmental, and archaeological perspectives. The class brings such a multifaceted understanding of history!"

            "comments": [
                "I think this course had a lot of strengths. The course reading was very diverse and spanned over 900 years of history. Additionally, the subjects of those readings would vary and covered class, gender, race, economics, environmental science, and many more fields. Additionally, the response paper assignments were a great way to reflect on the week's readings and make sure we are actively gaining insight in the class. Another strength of this class is its gateway to exploring other history classes at Yale. Even though the class is about a specific region, one of the key themes of the course is that the Indian Ocean transcends man-made boundaries and instead we should try to follow the movement of people. This allows us to focus on a variety of topics which can be applied to other history classes at Yale. Additionally, the class served as an introduction to historical thinking and analysis, and Dr. Yahaya would hold extremely helpful office hours and meetings to help us gain those skills and provide feedback. This would aid us in our future history classes at Yale. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't say there are weaknesses of this course! While the readings may be a bit long, they are very useful and it provides us more material to discuss.",
                "This course benefited strongly from the depth of Professor Yahaya's experience as well as the very interactive classroom environment. I do not know how it could be improved other than by a class field trip to the Indian Ocean.",
                "There were only strengths. The course did a great job at covering a wide range of topics in a very thorough way.",
                "Honestly no weaknesses, aside from the readings being overwhelming at times. I adored the class, adored my fellow classmates, and the professor was incredibly knowledgeable on the subject and a master at facilitating our discussions. The readings stayed well-picked and topical, I only wish we had more time to cover the material, on account of every member's strong interest in the course.",
                "Doctor Yahaya cultivated very engaging discussions and the material was very interesting. She also spent a lot of time with her students, talking with us outside of class and taking us out to dinner and going for lunches after class.",
                "Strengths\r\n- as a first year seminar, there weren't many students in the class, so every discussion was super engaging\r\n- the texts were incredibly varied, such as diares, the analysis of a reconstructed sewn-plank ship, and fiction written from the time's perspectivemuch more than reading of your typical jstor history article"
