    "I learned a comprehensive overview of the European Union, its faults and virtues, its crises and successes. We discussed numerous topics of current relevance to the EU, including the migrant crisis, Eu expansion, and Eurozone economic crisis.",
    "-A lot about the EU and political systems in Europe \r\n-Each week is a different topic across a strange of interesting subjects. Very varied.",
    "Intriguing discussion on the EU from the policy, social, and economic point of views. Very interesting.",
    "Through this course I developed a stronger understanding of the institutions, politics, and policy-making processes of the European Union. This allowed me to closely examine the various crises affecting the EU and to critically consider the role that the EU plays in its member states.",
    "I learned about the formation, mechanisms, and crises of the European Union."

   "comments": [
    "Great Discussions, lot of reading, response papers are a good check",
    "Strengths: Professor Cameron is kind and extremely knowledgeable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class can go by slowly at times, as Prof. Cameron does choose to pick the same few kids every class for their opinion.",
    "Strengths:\r\n-Interesting and varied content \r\n-great readings\r\n-I appreciated the additional content that was discussed that wasn't always on the syllabus. for example, Brexit updates and the situation in the UK.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-a lot of reading sometimes \r\n-would have liked a little more discussion or maybe students presented on the reading\/gave a summary each week",
    "It really relies on students' preparation prior to class and it can be hard to jump in to the discussion sometimes.",
    "I feel that the readings were a bit long and did not allow for great depth. Otherwise the course was good."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, enjoyable discussions and Professor Cameron does a good job leading them, but only if willing to do EU reading",
    "No. Despite the professor being knowledgeable and passionate about his work he loved to hear himself talk and the seminar was not a discussion. Aside from him talking he let grad students dominate the conversation. Really tiring class to be in especially because he almost always went over and the class was 2 hours long.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the European Union or Europe in general, Professor Cameron is very knowledgeable about the subject.",
    "Yes, if you are genuinely interested in the EU and current issues in the EU. Very interesting and David Cameron is an expert.",
    "Yes if you are interested in EU politics but the course often stay within the EU borderland and not often drawing connections to other polity.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is essential for thinking critically about the challenges facing the EU and the ways that it can move forward. The class environment was extremely conducive to debate and discussion about the decisions that the EU must make moving forward.",
    "Yes, it is a good survey of the European Union."
