Currently, I think students are under the impression that our PIs are the only ones who are reading our theses, so what's the point? Also, I think it would be cool to have a place where everyone could upload their theses for people to read. Maybe this could be an across-Yale thing.",

Perhaps providing some guidelines at the beginning of the semester, and more importantly at the beginning of the fall semester, on expectations and what this project should look like would be helpful. It was also immensely helpful in my case to work with a single person in the lab consistently."
