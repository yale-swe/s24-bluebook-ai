                "This course is too big to be a seminar but too small to be a lecture. We sit around a seminar table and listen to the professor ramble to us for an hour and 15 minutes twice a week. There were almost no assignments that took forever to be graded and were graded inconsistently with little to no (legible) feedback to improve off of. We had a full list of readings we were gonna get to in the course but in total I think only read two of them and when the professor did talk about them in class it was convoluted and the students did not add anything to the discussion.",
                "There is an alarmingly low level of organization in this course. There needs to be a well-defined schedule for readings and topics. For example, avoid talking about a single paper for months, leaving no time for anything else.",
                "This class had some interesting topics, however it felt a little more Philosophy heavy rather than Computer Science heavy. The topics were a little hard to understand and follow.",
                "I think that Professor Gelernter doesn't do a great job facilitating discussion. Whenever a student disagrees with him, he shuts them down and presents his ideas as the only correct ones. Disagreement is integral to engaging discussion, so you can't just dismiss it. He also doesn't really ask open ended questions or forces students to discuss with each other in smaller groups. I think if he had more exercises prepared for the class it would be more dynamic and engaging.",
                "just a terrible course. wrote less than 1000 words and read maybe 20 pages and got a writing credit. tried to engage with the professor inside and outside of class and was just dismissed or ghosted. absolute joke. the one strength i would say is that for the two \"micropapers\" we did get graded, his feedback on concise writing style was actually helpful."

                "No, stay away - run fast and far. Gelernter is a mess. Every paper you submit expect it to be missing, and as a result you might just get a 0 on said assignment. Very awkward and weird class, with demanding structures to paper. Arbitrary grades, so either get an A or get an F.",
                "Yes; everyone should be subject to this pain as a rite of passage.",
                "No. While it is extremely low on workload as advertised, it also doesn't teach anything and the grading is frustrating. I am fine with mediocre grades if I can understand why I am getting them and how to improve. Our midterm quiz was handed back with illegible feedback so bad I wish I cold upload a photo to this form. Honestly an unacceptable quality of class to be offered at Yale.",
                "no",
                "No, because of the disorganization of the course and lack of resources to improve one's learning. Even though the course materials were partly interesting, there are no office hours hold, lectures were really unorganized and confusing, and the pace of the course was very slow. At the end of the course, we ended up covering only half the material in the syllabus.",
                "If you want a class with 0 work and 0 transparency from the professor regarding grades\/any kind of feedback, then yes",
                "if you want a free writing credit at the expense of a coinflip grade, yes. but just know you will gain nothing from this course other than the ability to write concise sentences. i'm filling this evaluation on the evening of jan 8 - grades were due like a week ago and still half the courses assignments, including the final paper have not been graded. i have absolutely no clue what grade i will be receiving in the class. \r\n\r\nin all honesty, the course's planned content is intriguing. but the professor just rambles for 75 minutes, never stopping for questions. he will often forget what he discussed in the previous seminar and end up repeating lectures 3 or 4 times. we ended up covering 2 short readings over the course of the entire semester. i tried on multiple occasions to interact with the professor via emails or talking after class and was either dismissed or ghosted every time. the books he's written are genuinely good reads, but taking this class will prove no merit."
