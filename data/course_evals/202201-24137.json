                "Strengths: Definitely varies with the instructor. If the instructor gives material to practice and explains things well, then this is a very fun class. The videos before class help and practising Ximera on a regular basis is also helpful. \r\nWeaknesses: Lack of a cheat sheet in exams. Makes absolutely no sense that 115 students get cheat sheets but 120 students don't even though we're dealing with significantly harder topics and taught at a quicker pace.",
                "Tip: watch all the pre-lecture videos every time, including all of the optional ones. You will be tested on all of the content. In class, we do not cover all the content. You can basically teach yourself this entire class from the videos alone and never go to class, and although I did continue to go to class, it felt a bit like a waste of time.",
                "Overall, I felt that this course was rather poorly organized. The pre-lecture videos and what we actually covered in lecture were frequently disconnected which made for a disorienting experience. Additionally, I think the problem sets should be worth far more. Currently, they are only 10% of our grade but make up the vast majority of the work in the class. They should be worth at least 20% and probably more. All other STEM classes I have taken at Yale have a problem set percentage between 20% and 40%.",
                "The course is heavily self taught and therefore relies on the student spending a lot of time out of class/office hours/peer tutors finding a way to teach themselves the material. One result is that there is no unity as some students use a textbook and others use various online resources, which makes going to peers for help or collaboration on psets difficult as everyone understands the content differently. The course is also heavily biased towards formula memorization rather than conceptual understanding, as students who demonstrated understanding on homework and in the classroom failed to pass (or do well on) the exams for lack of a formula sheet and the bias of the exams towards memorization. Allowing students to make a cheat sheet for each exam would greatly improve scores as well as reduce student stress.",
                "Having 2 PSETs due the week before exams was a bit stressful and could be changed. Also, PSET solutions should be posted",
                "Maybe we could add back the extended versions of Green's Theorem and Stokes' Theorem? The strengths are that the course is very organized, with transparency about content and grading.",
                "This course is not very well designed. The lectures and homework are not lined up, and essentially cause students to either decide to be lost at lecture, or not go to lecture and put more responsibility/pressure on themselves to learn independently."
