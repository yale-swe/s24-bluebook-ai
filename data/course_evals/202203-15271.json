The professor stressed the importance of doing philosophy and not just talking about philosophy, and I feel like he succeeded in creating an environment where this was actually practiced. weaknesses: I think because there weren't any required readings my engagement with the class was very once-a-week, and because we spent a lot of time in class where he would lecture to us about the material (again, because there were no required readings), I feel like we missed out a lot of potentially really exciting discussion.",
                "I like the format of the writing assignments that places more emphasis on doing philosophy as opposed to learning about how some other philosophers have done philosophy. I do think the course can be improved if the optional readings could be posted before each class so the students can know something about the content for each class if they feel so inclined.",
                "Strengths: Small size of the class made it really engaging, and Michael is a fabulous professor. The grading on the assignments was generous, and I also felt like the assignments were valuable in helping me learn in that they force you to think critically about your own stance on various philosophies. No weaknesses."

Point of note: I would probably think twice about taking it if you are into \"useful\" philosophy, or if everything you learn needs to \"matter\" for the \"real world\". If that's what you want, you're looking in the wrong place.",
