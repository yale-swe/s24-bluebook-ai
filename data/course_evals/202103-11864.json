I learned how to apply these principles to many different systems, such as a classical gasses, magnets, radiation, and quantum gasses.",

Started with the basic postulates of thermo, heat engines, heat capacity, differential forms and partial derivative relations, ideal gasses, thermodynamic potentials, Maxwell relations, phase transitions. Statistical Mechanics, ensembles, relationship to information entropy, thermodynamics from statistical mechanics, stat mech of radiation/phonons, spins, quantum systems. Lots of content treated very well in a coherent framework!",

                "Thermodynamics is a bit of a black box. At least to me, it is not exactly clear everything that happens; it feels a lot more like chemistry or biology in that one needs to know a lot of equations and when it is appropriate to use them. Where the equations come from and what they mean are a bit of a mystery, except phase transitions which are pretty neat. Near midterm, it seems that all all is lost, that one is destined to be swallowed whole by a miasma of Maxwell Relations and wackadoo derivatives. Then, in the distance, there's a light on. Hope! A cape-wearing hero on brilliant steed has come to rescue you. And its name? Statistical Mechanics! What is this mysterious entropy that you have been working with all semester? Why do the relations work as they do, and where do they all come from? All answered by this shining light. As you approach the middle of the semester and it seems that all hope is lost, despair not, for you will be saved. (Jokes aside, SM is very difficult, but it is a beautiful and powerful theory that has solid central objects that do not \"squirm\" the way that those in thermo do. I do not know what exactly I learned in thermodynamics, but I can tell you exactly what we did in SM: microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical ensembles with fundamental bridges and Fermi surfaces.)",

            "comments": [
                "The two-part structure of the course is helpful for compartmentalizing the material. The problem sets were always reasonable and interesting. The course notes were well-organized which made reviewing material for the final easier. My one suggestion is that my understanding of the material would be improved by doing more worked examples in the lecture.",
                "Honestly the structure was great! Lots was covered but in a consistent and well-motivated framework, making a variety of topics in physics seem approachable. It felt like we were doing \"real\" physics, with famous phenomena like blackbody radiation and the Chandrasekhar limit. The Psets did a great job affirming and complementing what was happening in class without being an unreasonable amount of work. One suggestion I have is to be a little more clear/add more examples where the thermodynamic potentials apply to chemical reactions (e.g. a chemical battery). This would be very cool to see, but I think our treatment was a bit too brief. The grading was timely and the instructor (Prof. Cheng) was a great teacher!",
                "High level, thought provoking homework (though often tedious calculations!).  I appreciated the axiomatic approach to thermodynamics, since I hadn't seen that approach before. \r\nThe first half of the course (thermodynamics) followed a textbook very closely.  It would be helpful if the second half more closely followed one or two particular references.",
                "Professor Cheng did a fantastic job of making the subject relevant through choosing examples with interesting real-world/physical applications. I felt that the psets really were designed to reinforce our in-class learning and deepen our understanding of the subject and how to actually solve stat mech/thermo problems, more so than in any other class Ive taken in the department. The only weakness in my mind was that sometimes in lecture I lost sight of why we were exploring certain concepts, or why we were following them in the order presented - it seemed slightly unclear as to how something new was related to the topic immediately preceding it. However, Professor Cheng was an excellent lecturer and his lectures were very easy to follow.",
                "It could probably cover 20% more ground. Knowing this is the first and last time a lot of us will see this material in our physics careers, I think it would've been interesting to spend a couple lectures introducing (even conceptually) what solving non-separable problems in stat mech can look like. I really liked the day we spent on the vdW equation in the thermo part of the class, so this could be analogous to that day. Interacting systems with phase transitions, cluster expansions/perturbation theory, the idea of Monte Carlo methods for more complicated systems...\r\n\r\nIt was otherwise a great experience and I think it was a great course combining what at many schools are two separate courses.",
                "Strengths: The problem sets were illuminating and very clear. I enjoyed the instruction for SM, and I found Professor Cheng to be kind and agreeable in general. Weaknesses: This is just inherent in thermodynamics, but the first half of the course was very messy. Again, because thermodynamics is decentralized, there is not much that the professor can do; with what he had, he did very well. There is also so much material in this class that I feel that it would have allowed more absorption of the material if the class were two semesters, and statistical mechanics is so important it deserves a whole semester.",
                "It was amazing! I would have appreciated some more high level summaries throughout the semester, instead of just at the end",
                "The problem sets are well structured to explore concepts discussed in lecture and expand on them. The length also seems to be just right; thorough but not painstakingly long and horrible. The lectures and corresponding notes were also immensely useful.",
                "I think the layout of the course is really well done. If anything could be changed, I think a little less time on thermodynamics in the beginning to allow for more room for stat mech and quantum stat mech at the end would be nice.",
                "The course was taught well, and the problems on the psets were helpful learning tools. The problem sets were also manageable with the rest of my courseload. Professor Cheng made himself available for questions and was very helpful in that regard. A weakness was the time slot of the class. It was at 2:30, by which time lunch has begun to make many students drowsy. It is nothing against the professor, but we were definitely sleepy in many of these class periods. Also, regular office hours from the TA would be good in future semesters."

                "This class was interesting in that the physics major generally consists of re-learning the same topics over and over, but with new formalism, etc. This class, on the other hand, was a breath of fresh air in that regard. Usually this section is unremarkable, consisting of replies like \"yes, required for the major\" but I might recommend this course to people who aren't even primarily in the physics major. It did a very good job illustrating how the basic laws of systems give rise to macroscopic behavior.",
                "Yes.  It's a fascinating subject that gets to the fundamentals of how we probe the physical world in actual macroscopic systems.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn about thermo and stat mech and have a lot of time to dedicate to it. This is one of the hardest courses in the major for a reason, but if you put aside time to engage with it you should do fine. Professor Cheng is really, really good and cares a lot about student learning.",
                "Yes, if a student is interested in physics. This course is essential for most areas of physics, especially statistical mechanics, and is very interesting.",
                "Overall, yes. If you can take it with Professor Cheng, do because with Navon it is so much worse. I hated thermodynamics and loved SM. Both are very difficult; SM is a bit more so, but it is so much more enjoyable. Also, do not fear this course. Yes, it is very difficult - probably the most difficult undergrad physics course that I have taken. Yes it has a high workload; I gave it a 5 in this review. However, this class has achieved a somewhat legendary status among undergraduates and consequently I came to fear it as some monolithic beast impossible to overcome. But you will make it through. It is hard but possible; it is within the same level as the courses you have taken to this point. It is just another hard class. I am not smart, and I made it through this course. If you despair in the middle of the semester, come back to this review and read these words. You can do it. You will do it. Ask for help. Work with your friends. They can benefit from working with you, too. Survive until SM and you will be fine. Breathe. You've got this.",
                "Yes! So much physics came together and I loved learning a new framework to analyze systems",
                "Absolutely. Of the Physics intensive major core lecture classes, it is undoubtedly my favorite. The material is challenging but truly fascinating, and Prof. Cheng is a wonderful professor.",
                "If you're interested in the course, I would recommend it. Even if you're not a physics major it is a cool class and interesting material.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if Professor Cheng is teaching it. Professor Cheng is very friendly and good at explaining topics. He is also thorough, and if he can't answer a question in class, he comes back and answers it in a written document. This is a difficult topic, but it is really cool and rewarding. A lot of this theory was made up by Yale's own J. W. Gibbs, and it is awesome to get to know the theory that was developed at our university."
