                "This class is well-structured in terms of testing student understanding of material; problem sets are pretty solid, and I appreciated the conversational way we were tested at midterm and final periods. That being said, the lectures are not engaging. This is a seminar-sized class being taught in a lecture format, and it is very difficult to stay focused. Some lectures are presented in slide format, but others are just guided notes being projected onto the wall. The notes on their own are pretty good, but as a presentation, it's hard to follow because there's just so much text being presented at once.",

                "Strengths: Clearly organized, final paper was very fun and interesting to write\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were not very engaging, and although I thought that the second half of the course would be more discussion-based seminar style, it was just more lectures.",
                "Overall, I thought the course was well-structured, and well-scaffolded. There were some instances where we were exposed to material that was quite challenging for a person without a linguistics backround that wasn't really reflected in the homework or the supplementary material, like sentence trees, but that material was overall well-explained, even if it was a little out of nowhere."

                "I would not recommend. It's a relatively easy class, but that being said, you need to go to lectures in order to earn a participation grade and understand what's going on. The lectures are not engaging, and I usually walked away feeling like I'd gained very little.",
                "YES! If you want to learn what linguistics is but dont know where to start, this is a great course. The classroom environment and prof will not stress you out.",
                "If you're looking for an easy A and interesting course content, take this! It only had a few assignments and a well-structured final paper with checkpoints, and the professor was very kind. It was interesting to study introductory linguistics.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class! Not only did I learn more about the specifics of phonetics and morphology, but I loved being able to also cover thematic concepts of how language more broadly functions in society and communities. I thought the class was extremely engaging and the final project was rewarding.",
                "Yes, it is a great introductory course. You learn a lot of relevant elements of linguistics. It also is a great launching pad into future linguistic classes.",
                "This is a great intro linguistics course, and it makes really clear the connections between the theory and praxis, which I found quite valuable."
