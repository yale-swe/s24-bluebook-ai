    "Aesthetic and technical skills in digital photography.",
    "This class teaches the fundamentals of making digital photographs, looking to historical and artistic examples to ground discussion of composition and form. You will learn how to use aperture, shutter speed, and ISO in order to manipulate the exposure such that you can control the 'look' of your photo. You will also learn to use the elements of Photoshop that are useful to edits of your digital photography.",
    "Technical Skills of Photography, which I now feel I have a better grasp of.  Much much more than that, this course was essentially an Art course--by which I mean more time and more energy was dedicated to the questions, what is art? What makes art good? How do we improve? In the long run this other focus is much more important.",
    "This is my first introductory photography class I have ever taken. I learned not only how to make good pictures by learning the basic functions of my camera, but I also became an artist who strives to interpret art and appreciate art. Besides that, I also got familiarized with photoshop and Lightroom, which is a skill that I was eager to learn in class."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: course material and individual feedback\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Access to the computer lab outside of class time could have been useful.",
    "The professor was amazing and created a really nice learning environment. Despite the short length of the summer session class, we learned a ton. I especially appreciated that our learning was grounded in looking at the work of artists past and present.",
    "I would have liked the course to have gone on longer.",
    "The strength of the course is definitely the content of the class. I really like professor Donaldson's way of teaching the necessary skills by classifying the slideshows into different categories on canvas so that the students can have access to the content online."

   "comments": [
    "This is a wonderful class if you have interest in learning to take digital photographs. It will force you to think about what you see around you and how you can translate that into interesting images.",
    "Yes. Good luck getting into the class, I imagine it has a really backed-up waitlist.",
    "I definitely recommend other students to take this class if they are interested in photography. Since the students will complete the course with a final project, the course itself will not only teach the students the technical function of the camera, but also the theories behind art making."
