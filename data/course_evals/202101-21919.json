                "One strength of this course is that the material is presented with the mathematical background at the beginning, so everyone is on the same page in terms of understanding the mathematics of quantum mechanics. The course is also the first part in a two-course sequence, so the material doesn't feel too rushed. I honestly cannot think of any weaknesses of this course.",
                "The material of the course is interesting, and the parts of the course which actually emphasized new theory (i.e. the lecture on symmetries and conservation laws) could be emphasized and expanded.\r\n\r\nThe course spends an inordinate amount of time on review of basic mathematics, beginning without even an assumption of vector algebra. Moreover, it spends additional time reviewing the definition of the classical Lagrangian and Hamiltonian, material covered in the listed prerequisite course. In short, the course needs to be much faster. A greater emphasis on the theoretical aspects of the concepts at play, rather than simple equation-solving, would also be greatly appreciated.",
                "Not very engaging, too many psets, psets too long. Lots of non-trivial mathematical details glossed over but we were expected to just know.? Example recent on my mind is derivatives of operators wrt scalars/vectors/operators, which came up a lot but were not addressed \r\n\r\nOnly got like 3/13 psets grades back by end of semester",
                "Strengths- TAs, course notes, and the textbook\r\nWeaknesses- Lectures and recorded lectures were a waste of time, but the course notes were very informative.",
                "Prof. Shankar's recorded lectures were near incomprehensible; very little structure, difficult to follow, and left me with little more than vague intuitions. His live Zoom lectures were far better, since he would share notes on the screen that we could follow as he was talking. That said, most of my learning in this course came from struggling with the material on my own. Pset problems could sometimes be tricky, and not directly follow from what we had learned in class, but the TA was very helpful and Prof. Shankar was always available for emailed questions. Tests were easier than psets for the most part, though it's strange that they aren't open book, or that we weren't at least allowed to bring our own formula sheet. In general, this course could really benefit from more structure.",
                "Perhaps live portion could be more different than pre recorded lectures.",
                "Strengths: professor was very available to answer questions, the format this year basically had us hearing everything twice which helped solidify it\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very slow grading, it would have been really helpful to have had clear and consistent feedback. Only like 2/13 psets were graded before the final",
                "We only got grades for 3 problem sets before the end of the year so more feedback would have been nice. Shankar is a good professor and does care about our learning but every once in a while assumes some odd prior knowledge.",
                "Strength: the lecture learning goals sheets were useful for solving problems and studying for exams. Strength: having practice questions during the live portion of the class was helpful in evaluating my understanding.",
                "Having multiple sources from which to learn was good (recorded and live lectures and posted learning goals). The class topics were covered rigorously. The live lectures, however, were hard to follow often especially since there wasn't much drawing or writing to go along with reading the learning goals.",
                "Most of class was just reading through a posted notes PDF, so that wasnt that engaging. Also very little is explained thoroughly and the textbook doesnt help much either, and then the homework is ridiculously hard and usually makes you feel like youve learned nothing. The tests are reasonable, though, and the professor made class feel pretty relaxed.",
                "strengths: the course is well organized, and the instructor is very knowledgeable about the subject. The typed learning goals for each lecture is a brilliant idea. I benefited a lot from them.\r\nweakness: the hw and exam grading is slow. I hope I can get feedback sooner.",

I wouldn't recommend this course as a math elective. (There was obviously little in the way of derivations or proofs, but the ideas we learned didn't even seem to logically progress from each other, and a lot of it became memorization. Maybe this is just the nature of QM, but I'd like to imagine that there would be a more formal way to teach some of this subject. From what I've heard, the grad QM class seems to be a bit more along these lines.) I think that it was much better for physics majors, though.",
