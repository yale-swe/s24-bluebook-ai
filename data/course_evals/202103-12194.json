                "The course is a good introduction to paleoecology for anyone with a paleontology\/geology or ecology\/evolution background. The current topics part of the class was the most interesting because we got to discuss recent papers, but the lecture part and the coding part were also useful. The course is a little disorganized because so much information is covered in it, but because it covers so many different segments, the class schedule is very flexible.",
                "I liked the breakdown of the class into three sections. The science paper review and comment part felt very crammed having to read and write about new topics every week. I think if the lecture or R code section of the course was shortened by a week or two and the paper reviews were more spread out it would have been better.",
                "Generally, I think the course was poorly designed. It was split into thirds: lecture, seminar, and PBDB workshop. The lecture really didn't cover anything more in depth than Celli's lecture in History of Life, which was definitely disappointing, and the textbook was probably the worst I've ever read. Just a jumbled mess of extremely rudimentary information. \r\n\r\nI think a semester-long seminar coupled with a semester-long project using the PBDB or other paleoecological databases is the way to improve this course.",
                "I liked the different components of the course because the variety helped keep me engaged throughout the semester and taught me different skills.",
                "The first part of the course (the lecture) was really good: Celli's lecturing style is great, and it was cool to include relevant fossils. I think this part could have gone a bit more in-depth (a lot it was review from History of Life, which is a prereq), and I thought it didn't need to follow the textbook (which was kind of terrible) so closely. Also, it would have been nice to have a few homework assignments that required synthesis of the material, like the exam questions did, to practice for the exam and to have a more consistent workload between the three parts of the class. The exam at the end of this section was fair (and interesting!). \r\n\r\nThe second part of the course (the seminar) was my favorite, and I wish it had been longer. The papers were well-chosen and I definitely learned the most during this section. I wish there had been *just* a little more structure in the discussions and for the write-ups, given that this is an undergrad class and (at least for me) the first time doing a grad-style seminar. I think an intro to each paper by Celli and then a free discussion might have worked better than having students take turns leading discussion, since we often did not have enough background knowledge and had to turn to Celli anyway! \r\n\r\nThe third part of the course (the intro to R \"lab\") didn't really work. It was not organized well enough to be effective and didn't have realistic, concrete goals. I think a better alternative would have been a cumulative final project requiring synthesis of the earlier parts of the class, maybe involving some basic R. If I had been invested in a question based on earlier parts of the class, I think it would have been easier to learn a little R to help answer it, rather than the other way around. It would have been nice to work toward a final goal throughout the semester, and this would also have helped the workload be more even between parts of the class. \r\n\r\nOverall, this was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale, with a fantastic professor and really interesting content."

                "Yes if you are interested in the topics at all then definitely take the class as the workload was relatively similar to other classes and learning R code with no pressure to do problem sets with it made it a lot more enjoyable to learn.",
                "As it is currently structured, I would not recommend to students that have taken multiple paleo\/sed. geo. classes. I just don't think you'd learn anything new in the lectures. The best part of this course was being able to ask Celli to explain particular processes or methods that would have been otherwise glossed over.",
                "Yes! The three part class structure: lecture, then discussion, then coding instruction and project, was unique to my time at Yale. The initial lecture segment was very interesting and useful for getting on the same level as the grad students, or at least trying to even the playing field. The discussions were engaging, albeit sometimes intimidating, and the freedom to pick our own write-up topics meant that I was often writing more than was required (an impressive feat for a stem major). The coding section moved fast but generated results, although without some background in R it would have been too fast for me. However, this isn't the class to take if this is your first venture into EPS - if I wasn't majoring in a similar field\/hadn't taken EPS classes before, the whole discussion portion would have gone over my head (and some still did, but that was to be expected).",
