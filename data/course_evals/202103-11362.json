                "Learned a lot about several important medical anthropology theories and how they have collectively shaped the field. Also learned how to perform academic book reviews and read large amounts of text in a week.",
                "Applications of anthropological theory and terms, key works in the field of medical anthropology, how to write book reviews!",
                "This course drastically improved my ability to do close readings of the selected books and identify key themes, methods, and main ideas. Particularly, the final paper required a deep comparative analysis of two books and this type of analysis is one that I had not felt comfortable doing. However, given the incredible feedback from Marcia, I felt prepared and well-equipped to handle both the final and the writing assignments in the course.",
                "I developed great academic book review writing skills! The readings were a wide and diverse range of seminal medical anthropological works.",
                "We read many classics in medical anthropology and gained a better appreciation for beautiful, functional, discriminatory and/or threatened cultures across the world. In particular, through powerful in-depth work of ethnography, we came to understand the benefits and faults of various global and local philosophical/political/moral patterns. And we gained a better appreciation of the lives of humans that live in different conditions around us. \r\n\r\nWe also practiced technical skills of speaking and delineating arguments in seminar. Academic book reviews were also an excellent way to improve social science/humanity writing, I really enjoyed them.",
                "I learned to read long ethnographies quickly, my anthro. writing improved greatly, and I participated in class a lot more throughout the semester as a result of the book club style of this class.",
                "We read the canon of medical anthropology (many well-written and gripping ethnographies!), led our own seminar discussions (with excellent guidance from Marcia), and wrote academic book reviews.",
                "I learned how to critically read ethnographies and interact texts of medical anthropology. Also, how to converse in a seminar and write book reviews."

                "I loved the format of this class! You read a book a week and your assignments/discussion are just centered around that book. It really encourages you to actually read the book and get the most you can out of itfor me, it was a really nice way to make myself read and also explore really interesting and powerful concepts in medical anthropology. I like that the class is fairly smallit makes discussion easierand I also liked how students are expected to lead one discussion section!",
                "No weaknesses! I think the workload was fair but be prepared to do a lot of reading (its a 200-300 pg book a week)",
                "The greatest strength of this course is that conversations and insights are student-led, which means that the class is always, if not most of the time, deeply invested in the readings. As a result, class discussions are always invigorating. One weakness is that sometimes it is difficult to get the discussion going and I think that creating a pre-discussion where students discuss one or two things they found interesting to ease the class into the question sets would be helpful. However, this class was often pressed for time, so that suggestion might not be too feasible.",
                "Everything about this class is so engaging! I especially loved how we all received the opportunity to lead a seminar. My only weakness would be the timing of the class. 7 pm on Mondays is a difficult time to have seminar.",
                "this class is exceptional! take it, take it, take it!",
                "This class felt like a book club about incredible books, topical issues, and unanswerable, compassionate questions. Marcia struck a great balance between letting students guide conversations and intervening to steer us in a productive direction, and the syllabus was incredible.",
                "The strengths of the course is that we read a full ethnography a week. It is a lot of work but it is pays off a lot so much and provides a rich understanding of the text. The set-up of the class where someone leads seminar and we all discuss their questions provides great structure to the course as well and Marcia is always ready to come in with feedback or additions to the conversation."

Particularly if you're interested in medical anthropology, issues of health equity, if you're going into public policy, or if you're interested in medicineit's incredible important to understand the structural and social barriers that people around the world face to healthcare. I really loved this class and I think I really walked away being much more aware of what kinds of issues people around the world (and the U.S.) face!",

Marcia's classes are vital for those who want to work on critical thinking and analysis in their writing and discussions. I also think that her selected readings are incredible because they provide concrete details and experiences that illustrate what medical anthropology and its adjacent theories are.",
                "This was a fantastic course. Marcia is a wonderful discussion facilitator and every class we discuss important topics in medical anthropology. I would wholeheartedly recommend taking this class.",
                "Yes! Absolutely!",
                "yes, absolutely. take it. Marcia is probably the best professor I've had at yale, and the class is eye-opening and very insightful.",
                "Yes, but only if you're prepared to carefully read a full book every week. I enjoyed doing the readings and found the books interesting and a good break from other schoolwork, but it was definitely time-consuming.",
                "I highly recommend this course if you are interested in medical anthropology. The books we read were all very interesting and thought-provoking. Marcia was wonderful at leading the discussions and chiming in whenever the discussion was stuck or off track. She is a wonderful professor and she is very passionate and knowledgeable about the topics she teaches. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
