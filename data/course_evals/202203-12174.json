                "So much! While this was my lowest-workload class this semester, it felt like I learned more from it than any of my other classes. We learned about phonetics (how humans make the vast array of sounds and signs from the world's many languages), syntax and semantics (how languages construct sentences from words and how different sentences are related to each other through their truth conditions), morphology (how meaningful chunks of words are combined to make full words), ambiguity that is built into even grammatical sentences, how learning language is very different than learning any other skill like piano or math, some of the traits that vary across languages and what is universal in all languages, a bit of how language is processed in the brain, and more!",
                "I received a broad introduction to the study of language. Each week was based around a different field of linguistics (i.e. semantics, phonetics, phonology, etc.), and information was even applicable to\/useful in many of my other classes.",
                "This course was a broad survey on Linguistics, which taught us cross-language analysis and invited us to think deeper about the social implications of language and any prejudices that may arise from that.",
                "We learned a good deal about most major areas of linguistics, especially phonetics and phonology, morphology, and syntax. Among the most valuable skills we learned was understanding the International Phonetic Alphabet (a VERY useful skill, especially if you're learning a new language), and understanding what makes a particular construction ungrammatical in a dialect, and how it might be grammatical in another dialectin other words, how grammars may differ across dialects, as well as across languages. We learned to analyze the structure of sentences and words and sounds in any language, and to describe the grammars of different languages as they actually occur out in the world (rather than as someone believes they *should* occur).",
                "I gained a systematic understanding about what linguists study. Previously, my conception of linguistics was limited to phonetics, syntax, morphology, etc.; but now, I found that psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, etc. are part of linguistics as well.",
                "I learned a lot about how language works and the wide variety of languages that exist.",
                "I gained an overview of some of the basic fields of linguistics (morphology, syntax, semantics, phonetics, phonology, psycholinguistics, and historical linguistics).",
                "I learned how to dissect a word, view sentences from a scientific perspective, and understand why we speak the way we do. Memorizing the IPA was kind of painful but it definitely gave me a different perspective on learning a new language.",
                "I learned to take better notes in an unfamiliar subject and how to tackle material that is very different from what I usually study.",
                "Morphology, phonology, syntax, differences in language production and why these differences arise, and the relationship between language and the mind.",
                "Knowledge of morphology, syntax, semantics, phonetics, phonology, neurolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and historical linguistics.",

It also just sort of tunes you into thinking like a linguist; you get to start really exploring the concept of language and see some of the debates in how language should exist and be studied.  Not only is it fascinating, but you get to think about language in a whole new light.  I definitely think its a great basis for exploring specific fields of linguistics more in-depth."

                "I liked this class. It was interesting and the workload was not too bad. The weekly psets were a good balance for helping me learn the material and discussion was a good chance to practice what we were learning, too.",
                "This course was flawless. Possibly the best-designed course at Yale.",
                "strengths: well-organized, had a good question-asking culture, lecturing was clear, teacher was good at teaching.\r\nweaknesses: can't think of any",
                "Strengths: very organized, relatively consistent\/predictable workload (and little-no busy work), engaging\/interactive lectures that were generally easy to follow, extra materials always provided for students interested in a particular subject area, etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none in particular!",
                "The main strength of the course is how cumulative it is, and how everything builds up on itself. Concepts learned in the first week of class continue to be relevant throughout, and they are expanded upon in context. At times, the work we were doing as introductory students seemed a bit much, especially with the Midterm Project, but ultimately, I think it helped us understand much better what linguistics is and it was an excellent review for the midterm.",
                "The lectures were fascinating and engaging, and the problem sets were not too difficult or long, and were helpful to understand the material and apply what we learned. It may be a little hard to take copious notes in class, as the pace is somewhat quick, but all the slides were available on Canvas, along with many other helpful resources, and the lectures were recorded.",
                "This course is very well-structured and comprehensive: the procession from writing systems to morphology, syntax, phonetics, phonology, psycholinguistic, et al. felt so natural that I really feel like I'm studying \"linguistics\" as a whole rather than random parts of it. (Which was my impression in CPSC 201).\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of resources to look at for education: textbooks, extra reading materials, even researches occasionally, that puts the subject into real world contexts.\r\n\r\nHowever, there aren't many resources for the sake of exams: before the final exam, I was a bit lost about where to look for review materials. Psets, textbooks, and section materials were pretty much everything. No practice questions; no study guides; the review session was only 1 hour (one section's time) and only covered a few key points. I wished I could get more help with exam prep.",
                "The course gives a really broad overview of language, which was a really nice introduction to linguistics. Professor Shaw is also a great lecturer, and classes were always really engaging.",
                "Strength: covers a lot and the midterm project was very engaging\r\nWeakness: because we cover a lot, sometimes the course moves a little too fast",
                "This course is great.",
                "Strengths: Jason is a great lecturer and his office hours are helpful; the psets and exams align perfectly with the content covered in lecture and readings. Weaknesses: none really! Studying for the final was rough because there's so much content to go over, but most of it is straightforward.",
                "Weaknesses: readings and lectures are basically the same\r\nStrengths: lectures were very engaging",
                "The class is very organized. However, there were lots of jargon introduced that doesnt have too much importance for someone who doesnt intend to major in linguistics, i.e. those terms dont facilitate knowledge communication itself. If the class could focus more on application of linguistics (potentially how it is relevant to daily life), it would be a better experience for those who are just interested",
                "Course was extremely well organized. Both the recorded lecture and PowerPoint slides were made available, allowing students to focus on lecture in class vs. copying down notes. Dr. Shaw and TAs welcomed inquiry, were responsive, and made themselves available.",
                "This class has a lot of things going for it.  The topics covered are very interesting, and the variety of stuff covered means that, even if a specific field of linguistics is not your thing, there is always another field coming within a week or two.  The problem sets are always manageable and never feel like they stretch the material too much.  The only subject that I felt felt a bit overwhelming was the IPA, since its just sort of a difficult thing to teach and some of the latter units rely on a mostly complete understanding of it.  There were plenty of resources to consult for it; its just a difficult thing to get in a week. I loved the course overall and think it was a very engaging intro course."

                "Absolutely!!! It is so eye-opening! Everyone talks all the time, but no one things about how there's soooo much complex stuff that goes into such a seemingly simple, everyday process (speaking\/signing). Also the phonetics unit is SUPER helpful for thinking about pronunciation in any foreign languages you're learning, and more broadly than just phonetics\/pronunciation, I think the class in general is useful to improve your learning process of foreign languages.",

                "This is an essential course. Even if you're already familiar with some linguistics concepts, this course might completely change your mindset about the human faculty of language, as it did mine. It dispels a multitude of myths about language, and it gets you to approach languages and dialects the same way you might approach cultures in anthropologywith a view to describing rather than evaluating them, and to understanding their structure, origins, and sources of change and diversity. This course opens your mind to the hidden complexity of language, and it gives you the vocabulary and background knowledge you need to talk about it.",
                "Yes, but with caveats. This course is especially suited for students with no prior linguistics knowledge but is interested in learning how language works. I was already confident with syntax, morphology, etc., so I occasionally find the material too easy. On the other hand, those without _any_ exposure to basic language concepts (e.g. adjectives, clauses, vowels) may find the content a bit hard to internalize. But overall, this is an exceptionally well-organized intro classnot demanding, but packed with new discoveries every class. Professor Shaw is also amazing at explaining conceptsif you see LING 110 taught by Jason, and you need an easy but rewarding So credit, take it!",
                "Yes! LING 110 provided a really great overview of linguistics, and I feel like I know a lot more about the languages that exist in the world and how language works. It is also a not-too-hard social science credit if you are looking for that.",
                "If you are already interested in linguistics, I would absolutely recommend this course! I personally loved it it's fun, well-organized, and low workload. However, if you aren't genuinely interested in the course material then I think many of the units may not be that enjoyable.",
                "Yes, especially people who are interested in linguists. The course is very introductory and covers a lot.",
                "Yes, I thought the professor was great, lectures were interesting, and the workload was not bad at all.",
                "Only if youre interested in the subject or want to major in linguistics. Its a typical intro class, so if youre not very interested the class will feel like a chore and youll feel like youre not getting much out of it.",

                "Absolutely!",
