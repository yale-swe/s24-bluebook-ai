                "I learned a lot about clinical psychology research in this course. I also learned a lot about the state of research for psychology and Native Americans. I gained the ability to synthesize many different psych articles\/studies and to understand how different cultural and social aspects of a person's life could impact their mental health and health in general. The intersection of health\/mental health and Native American life is CRUCIAL and I am so happy that there is a course on it at Yale. There should be more courses like this! I also learned how to write a psych research paper. I learned about historical trauma, rates of different illnesses, and what research has been done on treatment and prevention. I also learned a lot about culturally-adapted interventions and the ways in which psychology can hold harmful assumptions about Native people.",
                "Great course for introduction to Native health disparities and the Indian health Service!",

                "The professors are so enthusiastic about teaching this course and bringing existing knowledge around Native American mental health to undergrads. I learned a lot about how my existing knowledge around general psychology is applied in practice to Native populations in the United States, so some content can feel like a review if you're a psychology major. They are also very enthusiastic about mentoring students who are interested in graduate school, so I gained a lot of insight of what preparing for grad school might look like after graduating from Yale.",

I wish the class had delved deeper into an ER&M perspective on Native American health, with more consideration for historical factors that have given rise to health inequities. I also wish that the class had gone further beyond discussion of health disparities to address more possible solutions, including the strengths of Native communities and community-based interventions.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: LOVED how Dr. Cutter and Dr. Beitel worked together to teach this class!! This is heavy material, and having the two of them made this classroom more of a community. Since we learned from both of them, we got even more information and perspective than we otherwise would have. It was also wonderful when the professors shared their personal experiences as clinical psychologists with us. That info from people who do this as a living actually inspired me to want to switch from a pre-law-esque path to psychology. They also impressed upon us how important it is for more psychology research to look at Native Americans because of all sorts of disparities and the lack of current research on Native populations. The assignments were also very well designed to engage us and the weekly journaling, media analysis paper, and final research paper assignments all served different but important roles in getting us to really learn new things and be excited about what we were learning. \r\nWeaknesses: honestly I don't think there are any weaknesses of the course. I do wish we'd had even more time to discuss things as a class. Dr. Cutter and Dr. Beitel really worked to create a space where we all had to share things in class and felt comfortable doing so (so that's another strength lol). Maybe asking even more discussion-based questions could help facilitate that, but overall I really do not think there are any weaknesses of the course and I seriously hope that this course is taught again and again and again!!!! it's so important",
                "It is amazing to have an opportunity to take a course cross-listed in psych and ER&M. The professors care so much about this class and student's ability to succeed and engage. I wish the course were taught more as a seminar and less a \"leminar\" such that people had time to discuss and think together about the themes of the class. I also was frustrated by the lack of focus on historical contexts of contemporary health experiences. I would hope that this is more emphasized in the future as it plays such an important part in bridging the concentrations of the two cross-listed departments and in illuminating the underlying issues of health disparities in the U.S.",
                "Profs were kind and lectures were interesting, wish there was more unprompted discussion",
                "strengths: the guest speakers were very interesting! should bring in more guest speakers\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the class was a 2hour long lecture with very few opportunities for genuine and engaging discussion. the professors need to work on integrating the readings into class in a way that goes beyond summarization, and focuses on real-life examples\/implications",
                "This is an incredibly important course and I feel so fortunate to have had the opportunity to take it. Dr. Beitel and Dr. Cutter are truly experts in their field and it shows. I enjoyed the final paper opportunity in particular.\r\n\r\nI don't think this course, however, should be cross-listed as ER&M as it is currently taught. For example, there are little to no readings that have critical theory and we read almost entirely psychology journal articles. For example, I felt frustrated at time throughout the course that we read papers about studies revealing health conditions in Native American communities, without reading papers about -why- those health conditions are so prevalent in communities.\r\n\r\nThis is also almost entirely a lecture class. There is little to no facilitated class discussion. When questions are asked, they are most often posed after presenting some informational slides and asking \"does anybody have thoughts on that?\" rather than meaningfully constructed class discussion. I would have really enjoyed having the opportunity to learn from my peers and be in conversation with them. I also think that the way questions were asked was not particularly inclusive and felt only answerable by people who had been engaged with the material in their outside-of-class research\/thesis work, etc.",
                "strengths: really strong readings that supported in class learning, accessible even with no background in Native American history\r\nweaknesses: the course could have benefited from more facilitation of discussion (such as more questions or even just going around and reflecting on something we learned from the reading)",
                "I loved the more graduate level structure of this course. It was a great environment to have discussions, engage with the course material in a more thoughtful way, and learn a lot about a critical subject that isn't available in any other class.",
                "The course is also structured like a graduate course, where there's not many assignments throughout the semester but one long final paper that the professors encourage students to think about early on. There's a lot of trust between the students and professors in that way, and I really appreciate that and personally feel that it fits my learning style more. This might not be something all students prefer, however, so it's something to consider. \r\n\r\nI also wish that the classes were more discussion-based than lecture-based sometimes, but given that not all students in the class come from a psychology background, I see how this is an important part of setting the discussion. Coming from a humanities background, this class wasn't the typical discussion-heavy seminar I expected, but I don't necessarily see this as a weakness.",
                "the course was described as a seminar, but was really more of a lecture. this should be explained before students sign up so that we can see what we are signing up for - I wish we could have had more student discussion about the readings.\r\n\r\nthe content was so well organized and put together. we learned about many perspectives relating to Native health. the guest speakers were amazing! and the freedom to write a final paper on a topic of our choice was very engaging. the profs were always there to offer help and guidance on the big undertaking of a final paper.",
                "Really liked having two instructors. I also liked the guest speakers and think it would be great if there were even more!",
                "For me, the highlight of the class was the guest speakers (real-world stakeholders and mental health practitioners), and I would recommend that this be integrated further into future iterations of the course. This class fills a critical need, in that it is important for Yale's courses to address Native American mental health and health inequities. However, the execution of the class was unfortunately not ideal, and discussions were not very engaging. The professors shared a very clinical perspective on Native American health (with an emphasis on statistics, psych textbook material, health trends), whereas many students were interested in getting more of a social\/historical perspective. For this reason, some students were uncertain about how to contribute during seminars, and the discussions took on a mostly lecture-style format. There was also not much feedback provided on assignments.",
                "This class is very informative, and very comprehensive of many different issues of mental health. It is a very psychology-focused class, I am an ERM major and this is not formatted like any class I've taken before, it is very focused on psychology, psychological research, and potential psychology-related fields. If that is your interest, the professors are very experienced, but in terms of only learning about the topics in depth, it wasn't the primary focus of the class."

                "YES! This is such an important topic, but there are so few courses that address Native American issues at Yale, and none that look at mental health like this course. I think that this course is not only important for psych majors and ER&M majors, but also for political science, history, global affairs, sociology, anthro, humanities, ANY PREMED, and literally anyone at Yale to take. It's a fair bit of work, but the assignments are engaging. Honestly, though, only take it if you are willing to engage with the material and really think deeply about all of this stuff. I wish there were more classes like this one, so please please please take it if you get the chance! The professors are so wonderful and kind and funny and want you to do well, too!!!",

                "It depends- the content can be very heavy and very triggering, as it covers a lot of issues related to mental disorders, addiction, and physical health problems, but it is definitely an eye-opening class and can help broaden your perspective",
                "I think this course is a must take for psychology students. I learned so much about the issues of Native American representation in psychology research and Im now so much more conscious of the importance of inclusive research.",
                "Yes absolutely. The overlap between PSYC and ER&M is really important but there are hardly any classes for it. Incredible professors who really care about your independent interests and help guide your research so you get what you want out of the class.",
                "Yes! Dr Beitel and Dr Cutter are very busy people, but they make the time to get to know and support their students. They're not paid to teach this course, they genuinely just want to teach and this is something you feel every week.",
                "Yes! The content is SO important and SO underrepresented. If you are thinking of pursuing a field in History, Indigenous Studies, medicine, or psychology or even education, this class is extremely important.",
                "Yes. A great course!",
                "It is critical for Yale to offer classes in the area of Native American mental health, and for students in Psychology to confront the predominantly white perspective that is often presented in their other classes. However, I would not recommend the class in its current form. While Professor Beitel and Professor Cutter care deeply about the well-being of their students, they seemed to have their plates full with research, and unfortunately were not in a position to provide detailed feedback or to invest deeply in leading the course. More than anything, this speaks to broader issues of insufficient resourcing of Native American studies and research at Yale, which led the professors to perhaps take on more responsibility than was manageable. The class felt a bit dry and clinical, and discussions were not as interactive or lively as I had hoped. While I admire their determination to teach this class despite their heavy research load and lack of institutional support, I hope that Professor Beitel and Professor Cutter will have the opportunity to focus more on their important research efforts in the future, and for another (perhaps new) faculty member to take on the responsibility of leading this class. I also hope that more of this material will be incorporated into mainstream PSYC classes.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone interested in going into a health field, particularly relating to mental health, because it's important to have cultural consciousness, and the professors are experienced in the field. It is interesting for Indigenous studies, but not the most in-depth course I've taken in the field, because of the focus on psychology."
