I also learned a lot about the role and evolution of misogyny in stifling (and inspiring) female expression throughout history, from Christine de Pizan to Annie Ernaux. Class discussions were always very enriching and stimulating.",
                "I learned close reading of a translated text, how to listen in discussions, and research of authors.",
                "I discovered a newfound love for writing through this class. Probably because the readings were so interesting. I also practiced discussing books a lot during class so I think I got better at articulating my analysis of texts.",
                "I learnt how to read womens writings in French literature from the troubadours in the Middle Ages to contemporary authors. A lot of our discussions looked into the psychology of the characters in the works we were reading and made for, in Prof. Blochs words, some wonderful sentimental education.",
                "I learned a lot about French literature, but honestly far more about what it means to love. If you pay attention in this course you will get a lot out of it. By far one of my favorites that Ive taken at Yale."

                "Strengths: Professors encouraged discussion, great use of the board, the books were interesting - great selection of books\r\nWeakness: One or two of the texts were very hard to understand, discussion helped a bit but it was still confusing. Otherwise, the different texts were great",
                "Strengths: The works read and secondary resources consulted were all incredibly interesting and enlightening. Class discussions were always very enriching. Weaknesses: N/A",
                "strengths: a lot of support for students if they're not connecting to the text, great selection of readings\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the professors could provide more context for the texts we're reading, there was only one class assignment past the midterm/final papers and I would've liked more information regarding what was expected of us",
                "Strengths: professors, content, student interest. Weaknesses: this course really doesnt have any weaknesses, but maybe it could be improved by having more focused discussions during class.",
                "It was quite pleasant to go to seminar every week and I dont think there were any weaknesses! Both professors are exceedingly knowledgeable, funny, and friendly, and I enjoyed most of the readings very much.",
                "Strengths: great use of blackboard. The professors were funny and great at facilitating discussion and had a nice dynamic when co-leading. The syllabus was well thought-out and the books you get to read are incredible. \r\nWeaknesses: Papers are very free-form so you have to ask the right questions in office hours to end up on the right path."

                "Absolutely. This was my favorite course I took this semester. The professors were engaging and had a wonderful rapport. I loved coming to class simply for our great discussions, not just about learning about our readings. This is a great class if you're looking for interesting readings and lively discussion.",
                "Yes!!! Id recommend this course to anyone who is interested in discussing historical feminist literature. We read books that ranged from 1155 to modern day so it was really cool to see the development of French feminine voices over time. Even if you dont really think you have much of an interest in France, thats not a huge part of the class so its totally still interesting.",
                "Yes, it was enjoyable and the two writing assignments were not very stressful either. One doesnt usually get to read many women in these European literature classes which is why I took it and I was really glad I did!",
                "Take this course!!! As with any course you get out what you put in but the books were really engaging and made it easy to stay excited about class. The books we read were fantastic and Professors Bloch & Saint-Amand led the class in such a great way. More than anything I feel like I walked away with a greater understanding of love and relationships that I will carry with me into my own life. So cool to take a class which felt so thoughtful and applicable."
