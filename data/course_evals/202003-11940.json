            "comments": [
                "It will take a drastic restructuring to make introductory lab classes into a useful experience, rather than something people only ever do to complete a requirement and forget about. I think all of the skills we learned could have just as well been learned within a week of working in an actual lab, and it felt pointless to do activities like mixing to solids together and spending a couple hours separating  them again. It would be much more engaging if the lab could be designed around an actual project, to make it clearer how the lab techniques would actually be applied in a setting other than a basic and unhelpful STEM requirement.",
                "The lectures were engaging but the TAs had way to must free reign on how to grade, there should be an established rubric that is also shared with the students so they know how to properly write lab reports and what is expected from them. The final exam carried too much weight in the overall score.",
                "The strengths are that the lab is really fun, and always relevant to the material you're learning in o-chem. The weaknesses are the sheer amount of busy work assigned and the emphasis on graded assignments that do not accurately assess a student's competence in a chemistry lab. Every week, you'll spend 4-7 hours outside of lab completing assignments that are (a) just busy work mostly (b) harshly graded and (c) decide your grade. You are sure to be depressed at some point during the week thinking about this lab and the vast amount of graded assignments that are mostly useless. The class would be far better organized if an exam at the end wasn't a quarter of your grade, if students were provided the hazards of materials and the procedure of the lab rather than having to write it themselves, and if the TAs did not grade so arbitrarily and harshly.",
                "strengths: honestly enjoyed the course, prelab video demonstrations were very helpful\r\nweaknesses: none that come to mind",
                "Strengths: DiMeglio is amazing and very clear, translated pretty well online (I felt like I was still learning even though I never got to actually go into the lab)\r\nWeaknesses: how dependent your grades are on your TA -- I had a super tough and picky grader, so I had to spend way longer than many of my peers in other sections just to get the same (or even worse) grades. It is curved by TA at the end, but it was quite stressful\/time consuming",
                "Labs online are really tough. This is not the ideal format for a lab at all, but with the circumstances, it was a fine experience.",
                "This course is very strong in actual lab technique and understanding of what is in front of me. The assessments also extrapolate to different reactions, compounds, etc. that are similar, but perhaps the instruction part of the course could focus a little more on this point (for example, lab notes could contain a full mechanism for a similar reaction to the one studied in a given week). The assignments for each week were definitely helpful, but it would also improve learning (and lab notes) if the experimental plans were due early enough (perhaps a few days before the lab) that the Teaching Fellow could have time to grade them beforehand in case the student was understanding the experiment incorrectly.",
                "The course TAs grade really unequally across different sections. My section might have an 8.5\/10 average for an assignment, but others might have a 7\/10. Super hard to know how you are doing in the course as well. Especially in the virtual setting, it felt like points were being removed for arbitrary reasons.",
                "Strengths: comprehensive education in lab safety procedures\/etiquette, well designed & set up experimental procedures, excellent support & guidance\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Work discrepancy between online and in-person students, length of pre-lab and post-lab assignments, harsh grading for minute errors in formatting\/description",
                "Strengths: The labs are quite engaging and fun. I was lucky enough to be able to take this class in person, and really enjoyed the experiments we ran and felt as though I learned\/improved quite a bit. Dr. DiMeglio is amazing, and my TA was very helpful.",
                "Overall, the course was well organized. However, I would have liked it if the TAs had been more clear with what was expected from us on each assignment.",
                "very organized and assignments were laid out for students which helped to keep trach of the course and when assignments were due",
                "The professor provided a lot of resources and reference material. These were extremely helpful at explaining the labs and also in completing the assignments. I wish the professor would have hosted at least one live session with students who were remote. \r\n\r\nThe workload of this course is not accurately reflected by the amount of credits it is worth. Receiving 0.5 credits for a class that gave me much more work than other seminars I've taken in the past (even some DS classes) is crazy. I don't know if the instructors can change anything about this, but this is a serious problem with all chemistry labs at Yale (I've have the same experience with all other chemistry labs). \r\n\r\nThere also needs to be more transparency and consistency in TA grading . Although the professor would post rubrics with clear outlines\/expectations, there were times that I would be penalized for including\/excluding something that was explicitly mentioned in the rubrics. Later, when I would bring it up with the TA, they would say that the professor \"changed the requirements.\" During no time were these changes ever announced by the professor or teaching staff--I would just be penalized. This happened to me on several assignments.",
                "strengths: helpful TAs, clear lab videos; weaknesses: lots of assignments to keep track of",
                "I think this course did a good job presenting the material and showing me what to do. I think the quizzes were stressful because of how limited our time was, but I guess quizzing is an unfortunate necessity.",
                "I don't think my TA in particular did a good job of going over the details of each lab before the section. I had a really hard time on the final because we never talked about some of the stuff we needed to know for it. I think the in-person lab was really helpful for the hands-on learning experience though.",
                "I felt that one weakness was the ambiguity in grading in that I often wasn't sure what exactly I needed to do to avoid losing points on assignments.",
                "Strength: the videos were really detailed.\r\nWeakness: because it was online, i think the skills I learned would not be up to par immediately if I tried them in an actual lab",
                "Strengths: Dr. diMeglio is super nice and helpful in lab, and often goes around checking to make sure everything is going alright in our experiments and making us feel welcome. The videos she filmed of doing the experiments in lab were also very helpful for letting us see what we should and should not be doing while performing the experiment. These videos also gave us a visual of how to properly handle the equipment.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the workload for this class is very heavy. There are extremely specific guidelines for pre-lab assignments (which are called experimental plans in this course), post-lab assignments (which are called lab notes), and lab reports (which are called post-lab assignments). There are often a lot of things that need to be included in these assignments, some of which seem like busy work (ex: searching up the specific density and molecular mass for every reagent, even when these numerical values aren't employed in lab or in other parts of the assignment for most reagents). This leads to lengthy assignments that take up quite a bit of time, and the grading is very loose, meaning that the TAs have freedom to deduct points for whatever they deem as unprofessional (so if you get a TA that grades harshly, you often find yourself nitpicking over tiny details in your lab assignments to avoid getting points off, contributing to the high workload of this class). I think the teaching is fine and the labs themselves are not especially demanding, but the workload for this class does not feel like a 0.5 credit.",
                "This course was excellently adapted for online lectures. You could really tell that a lot of thought and effort went into setting up the lab to create a meaningful experience.",
                "It teaches content well, however, it can be a bit of a time commitment which is to be expected of this kind of course.",
                "Strengths: excellent teaching from the TA, well organized Canvas site, opportunities to practice skills without fear of penalties for messing up; Weaknesses: N\/A",
                "There was a good variety of experiments and I felt like I learned several fundamental laboratory techniques that will be useful in future research endeavors. I felt that the pre-lab assignments took up a lot of time given that this is only a 0.5 credit class.",
                "I thought the course was well organized",
                "The coursework for this lab was much more than a 0.5 credit course. I found myself spending countless hours on lab reports and other assignments. However, those assignments did prepare me well for the lab environment and allowed for in-depth learning of the material, so there is a trade-off.",
                "I felt like we were very supported as students. Between the TAs involvement during lab, pre-lab readings and videos, and post-lab assignments, I think that our growth and learning in Lab was very thorough. I enjoyed being able to know exactly what I am doing before entering the lab, as it helped me prepare myself for sometimes an overwhelming lab experiment. This class ends up being a fairly large workload for a 0.5 credit, but the work definitely aids in the lab process. Pre-lab and post-lab assignments were graded fairly stringently, but it helped me adjust quickly to the scientific writing model\/style.",
                "Even though we couldn't be in the lab, I still learned a great deal about each lab technique and lab safety and felt as though I didn't actually miss out on the experience. While the quizzes were open-note, there wasn't much time and I wish there were more questions pertaining to specifics about each week's experiment.",
                "One big strength of this course is that there is a lecture before beginning to do the lab, and there are people who are ready to support you when you need new materials or do not know how to do something. Learning how to become a better scientific writer and use proper formatting was also another big strength. One weakness of this course was that sometimes the expectations for EP's and PL's were not really stated as well in the beginning and there was not a specific rubric tied to each so it was hard to understand how exactly to write them in the beginning.",
                "explained purpose and theory of techniques well, but could be much clearer about grading guidelines and offer more time on quizzes.",
                "A strength is definitely that your class size is quite small, so you can get help immediately. The pre-lab readings were supposed to have all the information required for that weeks lab but they rarely did.",
                "Overall they did a great job with structuring the class. The videos made by Dr. Dimeglio were so well done and very interesting to watch each week. TAs were very helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses are the quizzes. They had such a short time limit so it was hard to even think of the right answer even if we knew it.",
                "An immediate strength that comes to mind is the high level of organization and comprehensiveness within the course; course materials on Canvasincluding assignments, reading assignments, lab videos, quizzes, and other fileswere largely consistent, readily available, and navigable. However, there were some discrepancies in chemical compound names and lab procedures between some weeks' reading assignments and lab videos, and the small differences led to confusion and the need for clarification throughout the semester. Ensuring that the information presented in the reading assignments and videos is identical will aid in making the course more user-friendly, especially in a virtual format. \r\n\r\nI also find thatwhile the exams and quizzes accurately apply concepts discussed in sections and reading assignmentsstudents were not allotted enough time for assessments, especially the final exam. Providing only 60 seconds (quizzes) or 96 seconds (exam) per question creates a significant time deficit, which induces high levels of stress that can cloud rational thinking. Even as a student who read thoroughly and studied consistently to ensure full comprehension of the course material, I found the quizzes and exam to be rushed, and I do not feel that testing conditions allow for an accurate reflection of student comprehension and effort across the semester. Given these timing issues, I found the weighting of the final exam to be particularly severe; missing a single question on the exam equates to getting a 0\/10 on an experimental plan or lab notes assignment. Given that these assignments often take several hours to complete (in contrast with the 96 seconds per exam question), I found the 10-point penalty for missing an exam question to be disproportionately high. A student with exceptional performance throughout the semester and mediocre performance on the exam due to timing issues could watch his or her grade turn from an A to a B+ or B within minutes. I find this alarming.\r\n\r\nI am sure that I am not alone in my concerns, and I urge the course coordinators and\/or instructors to reconsider the merits of allowing students more time to formulate their answers on quizzes and exams. If this leads to retroactive adjustments for students enrolled in the course in the most recent semester, those changes would be equally welcomed and appreciated.",
                "Strengths: Well-organized, definitely took students' wellbeing into consideration, still comprehensive despite remote environment (although I'd likely retake this in-person at a local college if I absolutely needed these specific laboratory skills later on) \r\nWeaknesses: I think having the slides from the TA lecture would've helped with studying because I'm not a quick note taker and often have to go back multiple times to fully understand what's happening",
                "The class was set up extremely well for the virtual setting and truly allowed students to thrive. The professors and TAs were all extremely understanding and adapted to the changes and unexpected challenges well. The main weakness of this course was the format of the quizzes and final. They were all multiple choice and did not correlate to the main types of questions for the ideas we focused on in our TA sections and labs.",
                "Strengths: It was awesome to be able to have in-person lab and actually be able to engage hands-on with the experiments.\r\nWeaknesses: The lab textbook was near useless and grading was very inconsistent and unfair, especially between remote and in-person students.",
                "The EPs and LNs take a lot of time, and this course should be considered a full-credit course. The meeting time for each week (3 hours) is more than the 2.5 hours per week for any other course, and the homework with EPs, LNs, and PLs take hours every time.",
                "Strengths- I would say that this course was really well organized, especially during the pandemic. The deadlines were always consistent, and I always knew what was expected of me during a given week. The content was also well organized so that each lab built upon the previous week. In person labs were engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Even though I only attended one virtual session, it was definitely a bit harder to be engaged (through no fault of the instructor, Zoom is just a difficult platform for a lab). I also wish there were more larger post-lab assignments so that they were each worth a little bit less (it seemed like they had a disproportionate impact on our grades compared to weekly experimental plans and lab notes).",
                "Strengths- videos\r\nWeakness- section varied greatly by TA, I think it would be helpful for there to be a constant curriculum for all the TAs",
                "The amount of work put into experimental plans and post labs was a little disproportionate to the work done in the lab. Many hours were spent for a small percentage of the final grade.",
                "I loved being able to go to lab in person this year. i thought it was essential for this type of class to be experienced first hand, to actually perform the experiments myself and try to diagnose any sources of error. Being able to discuss the chemistry and the procedures with my TA in person was so educational, and the act of conversing about the topics made a huge difference. There was also a sense of independence and responsibility instilled in each lab student, which I enjoyed. I think I acquired a lot of practical knowledge, and of a wide breadth, all while being very intrigued and engaged in the lab. The only weakness I could point out is the occasional subjectivity of grading; sometimes points would be taken off for the smallest things, often issues that were not previously discussed or in the rubric.",
                "The strengths are the helpful information provided for the lab every week and the TAs and lab people available to ask for help. The weaknesses are the unclear expectations in terms of the quiz and exam content and how the experimental lab, lab notes, and post lab assignments are graded. These can be improved by specifying exceptions to the normal experimental lab and lab notes template and clearly explaining which exam study questions are styled like the exam questions and are more likely to be tested.",
                "Strengths: Professor DiMeglio is great; she's always walking around asking us if we need any help or have any questions. The labs are engaging and relevant. None of the content is overwhelmingly difficult. The virtual option in case you couldn't make it to lab for some reason was a great safety cushion. TFs were very helpful. Practice questions and pre-lab readings were very useful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lab days were always very hectic since we had to turn in our lab notes that same day but professor DiMeglio gave us until 8 PM which made it significantly better.",
                "The experiments themselves were fun and informative. However, especially with EPs and lab notes, the grading scheme was stressful and incomprehensible. All assignments were worth 10 points despite taking at least a page, if not 2 or 3, and therefore, when minor mistakes were made (which occurred frequently) and entire point was taken off each time, such that an flawed table that was one section out of 7 could cause a loss of 3 points (30%), or something as small as an incorrectly formatted title would result in a 10% deduction.",
                "More explanation into the large point assignments (Post Labs) may be helpful as they are graded slightly harshly.",
                "I think that this course is taught very well by engaging students before lab with experimental procedures and after lab with the lab notes. I thought that I was able to understand what was being taught well.",
                "Strengths: The labs were never too long or convoluted and the pre-class assignments were relatively sufficient to prepare us for lab day. The labs are also quite forgiving, and if you don't meet a certain percent yield or recovery you don't have to restart the lab over or get docked points.\r\nWeaknesses: There are no rubrics or explicit guidelines for the EPs, LNs or PLs so you just learn how you should write them through trial and error (meaning you get docked points and then figure out what you should change next time). This was a bit frustrating in the beginning, but for the most part you learn by the end of the course how to get the points.  I think if they gave us a little more guidance in the first few lab days how to structure them it would make the course a little less stressful in the beginning.",
                "weaknesses: at times the gradings were inconsistent  for the ep & LN",
                "This class, I think, is very good at teaching what it intends to teach. However, the grading system of the class is extremely flawed, and they take off points for the smallest things, which is extremely annoying; they could be much clearer on what we should and shouldn't do. Also, the TA's seem to be less friendly and more strict than other classes.",
                "Strengths- Dr. DiMeglio was excellent and Aaron Clark was also superb. Grading in the class was super fair. There was a lot of work for a 0.5 credit class, but it did not feel unnecessary in any way. \r\n\r\nWeakness- Having to watch an hour long video every week and take extensive notes on said video was extremely annoying and tedious. However, I understand the difficulty of teaching a lab online, so I cannot really complain. That is the best that it can be.",
                "Weaknesses: The Post Lab assignment grading was sometimes hard to gauge exactly what the TAs were looking for. Strengths: Dr. D is a very friendly lab professor and the TAs are helpful during lab as well. You get clarification on exactly how the lab will work beforehand, so it was pretty low-stress during actual lab.",
                "A strength is that materials were uploaded on time and the instructors meant well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- In person and virtual lab students are taught and evaluated side-by-side \r\n- Very hard to learn lab techniques from videos, though I appreciate the effort that went into creating them\r\n- Excessive expectations of students during a pandemic (Ex. on syllabus, no extensions granted or possible even for illness)\r\n- Not very accommodating or thoughtful towards student needs and evidence of learning\r\n- Overly formal assignments, hard to find clear expectations for all required work",
                "This course was structured well for student learning. The combination of textbook reading and lecture by TAs with post lab assignments helped facilitate my learning.",
                "I enjoyed the online format of the recorded lectures. Although the EP's and Lab Notes were incredibly tedious, the work was manageable. I did not like how we were given no time for the quizzes to prevent cheating online (6 minutes for 5 questions), but it wasn't the worst. The main negative was that I didn't find the live lecture with a teaching fellow useful at all and was kind of just a waste of time. Also, the grading of EP's and Lab Notes seemed very arbitrary at times and points would be taken off for unimportant and unquantifiable things such as phrases not being short enough or procedures not being paraphrased enough (though for some really inconsistent cases the inconsistencies could be pointed out and the points would be given back).",
                "As a remote student, watching lab videos and writing lab notes and pre-labs was a little frustrating, since I was doing a lot of work to just watch a video instead of being in the lab (more a weakness about this year's situation). I would have love to have learned about real-world applications of the techniques we were learning. It is a lot of work for 0.5 credits, but it is quite manageable.",
                "The course was paced very well as it allowed us to become familiar with the assignments and procedure before actually conducting the lab. It also hit upon the concepts we discussed in lecture at about the same time which was certainly helpful.",
                "Strengths: I think experiments are set up well and you will learn quite a lot about synthesizing products, extracting them, and evaluating their purity. The engagement (at least for my TA. It varies though as I have heard otherwise from my friends) was pretty high for my section and you do have fun doing all the experiments. Weakness: The grading is very up in the air and you really have no idea what you scored until after the final (which is a huge huge portion of your final grade). The experimental plans and lab notes due before and after each lab section respectively were also very tedious and sometimes seemed unnecessary. The TAs were very picky and ambigious about what they took points off.",
                "The course was very organized and the labs were clear and engaging. There are not many weaknesses, but the course is a lot of work for 0.5 credits.",
                "A glaring weakness in the class is the grading scheme, rather than being based on your knowledge of the chemistry behind each lab, most of the points you lose will be due to minor mistakes (missing citation, not using the correct terminology, not restating the question in your answer, and at one point even beginning a sentence with a number) that add up to non-zero portions of your grade. Because of this scheme, this course actually presents a surprising amount of workload that comes from double and triple checking work for any errors that could enough up as docked points.",
                "Strengths: The in-person laboratory time was always fun, engaging, well-organized and well-paced and very conducive to learning. I feel like I grew a lot in confidence with regards to preparing solutions, doing the basic different types of experimental setups, and collecting and analyzing data. Weaknesses: A lot of busywork outside of class involving a long pre-laboratory reading assignment, writing up an experimental plan, watching a video of the experiment, preparing for the lab notes, and preparing for the post-lab quiz. A lot of it felt very redundant and did not add much to my learning or lab experience. The assignments were also graded quite unfairly as they didn't give us a rubric to follow exactly, and points were taken off for things like font, format, or color, which was really frustrating. There were also so many exam questions to prepare for for the quizzes, and the quizzes themselves were so short that every question had a lot of weight, which made it extremely discouraging to receive 3\/5 or 60% on a \"short quiz\" that took 2 hours to prepare for. It did NOT feel like a half-credit class and probably had the most workload among all the classes I took this semester.",
                "The strength was the actual content, as the labs were well-organized and interesting. But the overall evaluation system was very frustrating, grading small formatting mistakes as if they demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of the material. The expectations were sometimes unclear, and 1\/3 of the grade was determined by a 15-question multiple-choice exam, which is frankly ridiculous.",
                "I felt that week-to-week I was only getting worse at the assignments instead of better. It was difficult to know what the class was looking for and taking it online was not a great experience.",
                "Strengths: this class fosters a supportive environment that encourages intellectual curiosity and the development of instrumental experience in the lab. It accompanies the lecture course very effectively, and the course provides a variety of different techniques and reactions that are essential to the foundations of organic chemistry. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the grading of this class seems ultra-specific to the TA, and while they do curve assignments according to TA, I find that the grading system seemed quite random at times -- some weeks you would lose points for not including something, and then the next, when you do include, you would lose points for \"unnecessary information\"; I would have liked to seen a more clearly structured grading system. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I am not sure how this can be changed, but the number of students who collaborate illegally on EPs and LNs is quite disheartening -- those who worked ethically (including myself) were often hurt in the grading system (losing points in formatting and occasionally content) because we did not break the rules by allowing people to review our work for general formatting errors and content\/word errors before submitting.",
                "I thought the course was really well-organized! I knew exactly what I had to do each week. I thought the workload was intense and asked a lot out of students taking the virtual option, and that grading was tough and at times inconsistent which was discouraging given the hours and effort placed into completing the assignments.",
                "Strengths: very well organized, consistent workflow each week, fun labs, professor and TFs were phenomenal!\r\nWeaknesses: expectations for post-labs and experimental plans\/lab notes were sometimes unclear; lots of variation in grading by TFs (but thats mostly corrected by standardization of grades and the final)",
                "There were a lot of points of confusion where the course packet \/ instructions would say one thing and then we would write our lab reports that way and get marked off because another course document said something different. We also didn't have a chance to interact with Professor DiMeglio through office hours or any sort of in-person interaction but she was willing to meet with students if you set up a separate time. We also didn't get our lab reports back until weeks after we submitted them so it would have been nice to receive that feedback sooner.",
                "Overall, I thought that this course was well transitioned into an online format. I appreciated how short the live virtual session usually was as well as the videos. It was nice to be able to see and understand the material in a concise timeline.",
                "Strengths - good survey of various organic chemistry lab techniques\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes grading was absurdly strict",
                "The course is very well organized, and the experiments were generally fun and interesting. The grading on written assignments seemed too focused on particular formatting details, although grades are standardized across sections.",
                "Strengths: well organized, high standards in terms of student work\r\nWeakness: requires a lot of work for individual assigments",
                "Strengths: kind professors and teaching fellows, plenty of resources to help complete assignments, lab videos were amazing!\r\nWeaknesses: doing the assignments for this class often reminds me of banging my head into a concrete wall. The experimental plans and the lab notes are each worth ten points, but those points aren't given for what you did right, they are taken away for your small mistakes, often formatting-related. Sometimes I wonder if it would be possible to receive negative points on one of these assignments. Three small mistakes and you have a C on the assignment. This was my average. Four small mistakes and you are down to a D. While the post-lab and the final are worth much more, completing these ten point assignments is demoralizing as you put an incredible amount of work into learning the material for consistently mediocre grades that don't reflect what you know.",
                "I liked the structure of the class with the prelab readings, EPs, and post labs. I thought each covered an important step. I also liked how each lab built on the last one and in the last couple we could see all we had learned with labs that used all the techniques we'd covered over the term. A weakness is that the course load felt like more than for a half credit class. I do understand that it's hard to cut anything though, since every aspect of the class seems important.",
                "Strengths: Prof. DiMeglio! She is a great professor, energetic and I always enjoyed interacting with her and watching her videos.\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly I don't really think I got a lot out of watching the videos. I learned about different techniques but I think the point of a lab course is to be able to do those techniques and I think if you put me in a lab right now and asked me to perform a recrystallization, I don't know if I'd be able to do it correctly. I don't think this is the fault of the teaching team or anything,  it's just an unfortunate consequence of virtual lab. I think labs are just one of those classes that lose a lot by being virtual.",
                "Strengths: I learned a great deal about lab techniques, and I felt this course was a very good introduction to the organic chem lab. Dr. DiMeglio and my TA were both very helpful. Weaknesses: Grading was very inconsistent among the TAs, and oftentimes points would be taken off for very insignificant details.",
                "The class was very well organized",
                "I think the material for the course was intensive enough for me to learn a lot. \r\nHowever, I think the final exam should not have been worth so much, as that negated much of the effort for the entire course.",
                "This course adapted to facilitate a wonderful environment for students",
                "Strengths; really cemented knowledge of skills and applications",
                "-my TA was very approachable and knowledgeable",
                "It was difficult to keep up with so many small assignments, but the professors did a good job of adapting the lab to a virtual format.",
                "Though it was not possible to truly replicate an in person lab, the teaching team did a good job of helping remote students gain some lab skills like report writing and proper lab note taking along with virtual lab simulations.",
                "The class was very well organized and the progression of work was very clear.",
                "I wish feedback was a little more thorough for the largest assignments in the course. Support in physical labs was great.",
                "The content of the course is useful. The grading was difficult to follow and seemed dependent on your TA.",
                "I really liked how this course was more hands off compared to gen chem. Instead of a step-by-step instruction manual, it gave you a general overview. This forced you to really understand what you were doing and why. I liked how the synthesis labs required us to recall skills we had previously learned to really solidify them.",
                "The strength of this course was the teaching team. Even through virtual labs, they continually worked to ensure we understood the material. The weakness of this course was the final exam. Because it was such a large portion of the grade, it would have been nice to have a written component or more questions rather than rushing through multiple choice questions. It could also be improved by having each TA standardize what they were looking for in each EP or LN. Many comments were made several weeks through the course on assignments that we were not aware of\/were nuances of the specific TA.",
                "Strengths: very well organized and logical buildup to each skill. Lots of practice with scientific writing and clear feedback. No weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: I thought everything was really coordinated. I though the assignments were short but full of information. It is not as much work as general chemistry but the concepts were a little harder especially if you had no ergo background. I liked that the recorded labs were clear and short. I also liked how our first attempts at the assignments did not count towards are grades and were there instead to give us feedback on what to do for the next assignments that did count.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Grading. This is more hearsay than by own personal experience. But there is a lack of consistency in grading. And although we are graded within our section and not across the entire class, I would like more consistency. There is nothing wrong about \"hard\" grading and I welcome it but it comes down to what is being graded. It makes no sense that one group gets feedback on presentation + chem while others don't. The grading of content should be the same. That means other students have to prepare more and look out for pieces of info to include that others would not have to worry about.",
                "Large variety by teaching fellow so grading felt unfair at times",
                "Very well-organized, very demanding course",
                "I wish there was more consistency in terms of grading among the TAs.",
                "A strength of the course was the caring nature of the professor and TAs. They were very understanding of the circumstances and seemed to genuinely care for their students. Some weaknesses of the course were the uneven grading scale between TAs and the sometimes unclear feedback on how to improve on assignments.",
                "The concepts were very important and interesting, but the feedback was often unclear, making it difficult to receive full marks on the weekly assignments, even toward the end of the semester.",
                "I believe that there is too much of an emphasis on small grammatical errors when grading labs rather than the content. However, the grading and feedback was always very in depth.",
                "Strengths: The retention of information was very high because the amount of times you had to write out procedures, use them, discuss them, etc really helped ingrain them into my mind. \r\nWeaknesses: They weren't always clear with what information they wanted exactly so there was always a feeling of panicking over whether we had done assignments correctly. Assignments also took extremely long and I personally think there probably could have been a more efficient way of doing things, even if it was having better communication so students wouldn't spend so long agonizing over details that didn't matter.",
                "A strength of the course was our TA -- Jaehoo was great and always willing to answer questions. The lab environment, maybe due to it being so small because of COVID restrictions, meant that instructors were always walking around willing to help and explain WHY things were happening and why processes were being done the way they were. However, a weakness was that a lot of the class seemed like busy work and just unnecessarily time consuming. This class was super stressful for no reason. Then, on top of that the grading was super harsh, literally taking things off for formatting.",
                "The class was very well organized using an online format, and the material for each week was given well in advance and there was plenty of time to complete all of the assignments. The weakness of the course was the grading policy, as the TAs were entirely responsible for grading our assignments, where the grading policies\/expectations were not always known beforehand. For example, policies regarding grading for references and technical terminology changed without prior notice, as they would be accepted on one assignment but not on the following without warning of this policy change.",
                "This class is hard to translate effectively into an online format, making it hard to learn sometimes. I know what procedures should be carried out to achieve some goal in the chemistry lab, but would not know how to actually do it in person.",
                "Strengths: the teaching team was very understanding and explained concepts clearly.",
                "I think this was a very well structured course. Unfortunately, we only did a couple of reactions at the end of the semester and since I am remote next semester, I will not be able to continue within the lab.",
                "Being remote, not being able to do any labs in person is a great loss of experience but unfortunately there is not much to be done about that.",
                "This course can be quite challenging, especially the written components. The lab TAs held student lab report submissions to fairly high standards.",
                "strengths - the in person labs were so much fun and the instructional videos + guides we received beforehand were helpful for conceptual understanding",
                "Strengths: Dr. DiMeglio and my TA were always really helpful and understanding when mistakes were made in lab. They also did a good job of connecting the chemical concepts to what we were doing in lab.\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "The strength is the pre-loaded content which is accessible early-on and neatly organized into week folders. \r\nWeakness is the occasionally inconsistent grading format. Following the directions too literally can lose you points. But the instructors were fair and upfront 99.9% of the time. \r\nThe final exam format unfortunately was geared towards concepts emphasized in lecture rather than specific lab experiments. Compared to the practice exam, the actual lab final had less questions pertaining solely to lab.",
                "The strength is that the labs were recorded so they could be rewinded, but this was also its weakness as a recorded lab is not the same experience as an in person one",
                "The strengths were having very helpful TA's, small lab size with social distancing, very good preparation (with pre-lab readings and lab videos), as well as clear feedback.",
                "Strength - amazing professor, pretty clear explanations. Has compassion, loved taking her course, such a fair course. \r\nImprovement - a little more support with feedback. Making it clear about having some type of office hours to help with assignments and get feedback before due.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is its organization. In addition to recorded lab videos, there were also often additional documents outlining what needed to be completed in each assignment (e.g. a guide on scientific formatting in lab reports). All documents were easily categorized by week, which made Canvas very accessible. Within the lab videos themselves, DiMeglio did an excellent job at carefully articulating each step that was being taken, and she remained engaging. The subsequent live discussion sections enabled students to actively discuss the lab protocol and ask questions. I have no critiques for this course.",
                "The in-person component was definitely a highlight. This was my only in-person class, and I was grateful for the experience! It never felt like hours in a lab; I was always fully immersed in the experiment. I also appreciated the clear course organization and expectations\/deadlines. One drawback, however, was the workload. Even though it was only worth half a credit, I spent the most amount of time preparing for this class.",
                "I really enjoyed the lab course and learning how to perform various techniques. I liked how there was an EP before every lab, which ensured we knew what we were working on during the lab, and then the mini lab reports at the end of each lab.",
                "The assignments in the class were very thorough, forcing us to understand completely what the lab is about. The grading in the class could be very harsh.",
                "Strengths - it was a very well-structured course with top-quality teaching\r\nWeaknesses - the grading was erratic and varied far too much among TAs. So many points were taken off for small rubric infringements that a well-written lab report with a few errors would score as poorly as a poorly written lab report. Hours were spent trying to perfect the EPs and LNs, but points were taken off wantonly, and they did not really affect the grade at all",
                "The course corresponded well with the regular organic chemistry lecture and concepts were well-explained. However, more direction could have been given during the first few sessions."

                "The videos, which were primarily for the use of the remote students, were a good supplement to the written lab notes and I always felt more confident in lab after watching the video.",
                "The course adapted as best it could virtually, which I am really appreciative of. Christine put in a lot of effort to record the videos to her best ability and it provided us with a more interactive experience.",
                "Succeeded: maintaining a relatively normal in-person environment within the lab by implementing social distancing and other procedures\r\n\r\nCould be improved: work discrepancy between online and in person students",
                "I was in-person, so I can't really comment too much on this. I felt very safe in lab.",
                "Adapted well. In-person lab was arguably even better because of the lower student to TA ratio.",
                "I don't think I would have enjoyed this class as much if I had to take it through the virtual format. Otherwise, no real complaints about the online format for all the assignments.",
                "lab videos were provided which helped for visual learners",
                "The discussion sections were very helpful in terms of summarizing content. I also really appreciated how all the discussion sections were posted online--super helpful.\r\n\r\nThe professor provided a lot of resources and reference material. These were extremely helpful at explaining the labs and also in completing the assignments. I wish the professor would have hosted at least one live session with students who were remote. Unless you went to their OH, there was no opportunity to engage with the professor--my TA was practically my professor (no disrespect to the TAs but if I were paying full tuition only to get taught by a 1st year graduate student... I would be very mad).",
                "I think there is no great way to do labs remotely, but the recorded experiments were well done. It was helpful that Professor DiMeglio explained everything she was doing, and what would happen if she messed up anything during the experiment. It was thorough and made me feel like I wasn't missing out on the experiential learning I would've gotten.",
                "I think the laboratory was a very safe environment.",
                "I thought the recorded virtual lab videos were helpful, especially if I needed to go back and review a procedure. The weekly quizzes at the beginning were, for a lack of a better word, annoying.",
                "The lectures were set up in an amazing and convinient way. Everything was set up in canvas under modules so that each student knew what was assigned for the week and that the dealines were the same for every week. It was very well structured and very efficient.",

                "The pre-recorded lectures allowed students to feel immersed in the material, but I do feel like the LN assignments where we basically re-wrote the procedure of the lecture videos were unnecessary.",
                "I think having the videos and the course materials online ahead of time was very helpful, especially given that collaboration within the lab was limited due to social distancing. That being said, I'm very glad that the lab was open and had the necessary precautions to have an in-person component, as it was super rewarding.",

                "The one-hour meetings and pre-recorded lab videos were incredibly helpful and worked well together to facilitate student learning and engagement.",
                "I think that lessening the amount of students in the lab and having them be one hood apart from one another was definitely a success, but sometimes, social distancing guidelines were not enforced as well, because there were some places like the balance station where people may have been closer together.",
                "Sometimes important pieces of information were left out of the lab video for the week, so it made it harder to write the lab notes.",
                "I heard that in a normal year students did not have to do lab notes. The students who went to in person lab would have to spend 4 hours in lab then do lab notes the same day in the span of 3 hours after lab. It makes no sense to me to have to spend 7 hours in one day on a class. The lab notes seem like they were a way to make sure the virtual students actually engaged with the material. However, a one hour zoom call is much less time intensive.",
                "Mostly all a success! Virtual lab went a lot better than expected, still engaging and interesting to learn and watch about how organic chemistry lab is conducted",
                "The combination of pre-recorded lab videos followed by the live TA session was a great combination and the timing of everything went very smoothly.",
                "The workload could be more balanced for people taking it in-person rather than remote. I felt like it was unfair to give so much work to one half of the class and so little to the other half. I also feel that grading was very inconsistent among TAs, so if this could be standardized in some way that would be great.",
                "In person lab was social distanced, but still allowed for learning and collaboration with other students or instructors. Virtual lab was a bit less interesting, although the instructors did their best to ask questions and keep everyone engaged.",

                "I felt very safe in the lab, being distanced from the other students and having clear, standard protocols. I appreciated being given new masks at each lab. The pre-recorded experiment videos were also helpful, but it seemed like the in-person students almost did twice the work of the virtual students because we both watched the video and performed it ourselves. Nonetheless, I can imagine the virtual students were able to learn a lot from these videos, and Dr. DiMeglio did a wonderful job of trying to share the in-person experience.",
                "The in-person lab succeeded for me. The lab videos also really helped me a lot in terms of learning the lab procedure beforehand and visualizing the instructions given.",
                "In-person lab was great. It felt very safe and allowed students to experience at least some level of normalcy in the midst such an odd semester. The option to do either virtual or in-person was also great.",
                "This lab was in-person, and the mask-wearing and sanitizing precautions were manageable but safe. Since it was in-person, I don't think this lab was much different than normal years otherwise.",
                "The pre-recorded lectures helped.",
                "I think that given the pandemic and restrictions, this course was taught very well and prioritized the students' safety during lab.",
                "Succeeded: Accessibility of the TAs via email and the submission format for the assignments. Videos of Dr. Dimeglio also helped with filling out the EPs and LNs.\r\nWhat could be improved: The deadlines for the quizzes should be at the end of the day instead of at other times like they were in the beginning of the course.",
                "too much work considering we are in a middle of a pandemic. possibly having more weeks that had less eps or lns like the IR worksheet week & etc.",
                "Lab just isn't the same if it isn't done by the student",
                "Due to COVID-19, I was only able to participate virtually in the lab, which I think severely inhibited my level of engagement in the course. Because I wasn't able to perform any of the techniques in person, I don't know if I fully understood what I was supposed to do. That being said, I understand that not everyone can participate in-person in the lab.",
                "During actual in-person lab, all the precautions taken and format of the lab worked pretty well. I never felt unsafe. I would say the weeks we had zoom tended to be much less engaging, but that is to be expected.",
                "Lab videos were pretty well made and appreciated, though I don't think learning lab skills in organic chemistry online is very successful overall.\r\n\r\nCould be Improved:\r\n- In person and virtual lab students are taught and evaluated side-by-side \r\n- Very hard to learn lab techniques from videos, though I appreciate the effort that went into creating them\r\n- Excessive expectations of students during a pandemic (Ex. on syllabus, no extensions granted or possible even for illness)\r\n- Not very accommodating or thoughtful towards student needs and evidence of learning\r\n- Overly formal assignments, hard to find clear expectations for all required work",
                "I thought Orgo Lab did a great job of transitioning towards online learning. I feel that I would have learned the similar skills were we in person.",
                "Again, I was not a fan of the strategy of giving us no time to do online quizzes to prevent cheating. I felt that the questions didn't even do a good job of gauging actual understanding of the lab. I wished we had more time and don't really see a reason why open-note quizzes weren't considered. The live lectures didn't add anything to the lab experience and I don't see why they were necessary in the slightest. By that point, all of the work should've been done and the lab video would have already been thoroughly studied to finish the work, and so the lectures were often repetitive. For example, every week we for some reason discussed walking up the stairs to Sterling lab and putting on gloves.",
                "Being a remote student was not too bad, as I was able to do my work with other remote students, but I would have loved to be in the lab. The virtual recordings and modules were structured very well and were extremely organized, which I liked -- it made it a lot easier.",
                "Although I felt that I missed out on valuable lab experience by watching the experiments being performed I don't see how there is any way around this format. The system in which we had a live session with our TAs was quite helpful as it ensured that we were all up to speed on the fundamentals of each experiment.",
                "The lab videos were very clear and well made; they conveyed a lot of technical and practical knowledge. It would have been nice if pictures of the product were included with the videos to help with visual analysis.",
                "The videos of the experiments were really helpful for familiarizing with the technique before coming into the lab. I think taking into account the lab video, the pre-lab reading could be shortened\/condensed so that there would be less redundancy with the video.",
                "The videos of the labs being performed were helpful towards understanding complex procedures beforehand. Other than that, the extra safety measures worked well and didn't interfere with the lab.",
                "the 5 minute quizzes were unnecessarily stressful and difficult to complete given the online format.",
                "This course is effective -- the in-person laboratory students were able to complete the labs per usual, with a few extra steps for COVID-related safety precautions. The TAs were very good at helping us develop laboratory techniques. \r\n\r\nI would maybe recommend making the TAs return work in the same time-frame. Some TA's got the EP's back in-time for LN submission, which ultimately allowed for higher grades because the same mistakes would not be made on the LNs; perhaps having EP grades be released all at the same time -- potentially later in the week -- would solve this issue.",
                "I thought the course adapted really well to offering a virtual lab option! I appreciated Dr. DiMeglio's time and efforts to recording the lab videos and consistently reminding us of what we do each week.",
                "The recorded lab videos were fantastic; I watched those after reading the pre-lab documents before I went to lab in-person, and I found them incredibly helpful. I also appreciated that the quizzes and final were open-note.",
                "I liked the recorded lab demonstrations that were done by Professor DiMeglio because it kind of felt like I was in the lab and was much preferred to some animated simulation.",
                "This course really used the online format effectively and efficiently.",
                "The virtual lab setting actually worked pretty nicely! Not much improvement can be made I don't think, they did the best they could given the circumstances. there was a live TA session every week that also allowed for virtual engagement - but I thought these were quite unnecessary as information would often just be repeated from our readings.",
                "Professor DiMeglio's pre-recorded videos where she did the experiment and talked through the process for each lab were very helpful for both virtual and in-person lab students. The in-person lab proceeded smoothly, with masks required and social distancing achieved by having every other lab bench be occupied.",
                "The course did well to accommodate needs during the online semester, mostly by offering the lab virtually",
                "I think that there was some difficulty for remote students given that they could not participate physically in lab, but I think the recorded labs were sufficient to familiarize remote learners with the concepts.",
                "The videos were amazing! I really appreciated all of the virtual resources available to us.",
                "I thought the recorded labs worked surprisingly well. I know we still missed out on a lot of the experience of actually being in the lab, but everything we did have worked  in terms of watching the recordings and writing detailed post labs. I also thought the discussion sections were much more engaging than the discussions we might have had in person like in gen chem lab.",
                "succeeded: course structure was great, I liked that I had the freedom to watch the videos and do the LN whenever I wanted. I loved my discussion section too (shoutout Juan).\r\nimproved: I don't know-- I think this course's weaknesses are just due to it being online.",
                "This course was very well facilitated for online learning and it was very easy to follow",
                "I was really happy to have to opportunity to engage in an in-person lab and from my perspective it all went really well.",
                "handled beautifully",
                "I enjoyed the combination of in person lab and virtual labs, especially after challenging in person lab weeks.",
                "In-person adaptation was successful",
                "-The professor did an excellent job recording the weekly seesions",
                "They video tutorials were really great but they could have used better image quality, specifically in the physical analysis steps of experiments.",
                "I think the videos are a great substitution for in0person labs when necessary.",
                "I thought the most effective practice was the hour discussion each week along with the videos posted of the lab. It would have been helpful to have smaller discussion groups or groups where we could more easily ask questions, but due to all the remote challenges, I don't think anything could have been improved.",
                "This was the only class I could take in-person this semester, which was a very welcome change from the lineup of virtual classes. Social distancing measures were very well thought-out and I felt comfortable to be taking the class in person.",
                "I thought the recorded lectures were good. Having discussion time with our TAs was really helpful since it would encompass a variety of things. I dont know if the live classes have that, but if they don't, they should.",
                "Great resources for the pandemic. My TA was always available for questions.",
                "I really appreciated that in-person labs were offered. I would not have learned as much from an online format.",
                "The online format was coordinated well, but the lack of clear feedback with some assignments could be improved.",
                "It was very good that the course allowed for in person lab while still maintaining safe distances for all students. The virtual component was very small.",
                "Being able to watch the lab video prepared by Dr. DiMeglio beforehand really helped prepare for lab day and overall, the course went pretty smoothly despite COVID. Labs had less people and people were spaced out by alternating the use of vent hoods\/stations. Overall, COVID didn't have much of an impact on lab and the extra videos posted on canvas were definitely helpful.",
                "The pre-recorded videos were extremely useful to be able to understand the lab techniques even without being able to complete the labs in person",
                "The discussion section should have helped better understand the content, but it seemed that each discussion section varied in what types of activities were done to help solidify understanding. Watching the virtual lab was at times hard to engage in, but there was really no other option in this case.",
                "The professor was accommodating about quiz times and assignment deadlines. Accommodations were also made for weeks when students were traveling.",
                "I was very glad to be able to have this class in-person. The procedures in place were comforting and I never felt unsafe in the lab.",
                "The lab videos recorded were easy to follow along with",
                "The in-person lab was a success. Having a hand-on experience was essential for this course.",
                "Individual hoods and social distancing was done very well. I never felt unsafe in lab. I think there could've been some sort of ice-breaker could've still been done because while safe, it felt very disconnected and cold.",
                "There was harmony in switching between in-person and online labs which I did not find in many other classes despite the much greater demand of switching venues for Chem.  The format and timelines were very well prepared to account for fluctuations and unpredictable circumstances.",
                "The recorded lectures were nice, but could be a bit higher quality",
                "All the practices with COVID-19 succeeded. This class managed limitations fantastic and allowed for a robust experience while keeping students safe. If you are sick or might feel so, TA's are incredibly accommodating and allow for virtual labs one week and continuation or a complete transfer at any point in the semester.",
                "Virtual Lecture - success. \r\nImprovement - More study questions that could help prepare for PL-B's better.",
                "The practices geared toward learning during the pandemic all succeeded. The clearly defined procedures and protocols of lab safety allowed for students to stay safe while completing experiments. Also, the 6ft distances and spacing between lab stations were set up perfectly to ensure safety for everyone. The lab stations and tables were safe while still allowing for collaboration when needed. Overall, the practices were effective and allowed for the in-person lab to be safe.",
                "All lab sessions (which were mostly performed by Dr. DiMeglio) were recorded. Overall, I felt that Dr. DiMeglio did an excellent job at verbally explaining each step that she was taking in the lab, including when setting up and cleaning up lab equipment. There were a few instances in which the virtual circumstances limited ones analysis (for example, if the instructor accidentally misspoke while explaining a step, or if the fine details of the product were impossible to detect over the camera). However, DiMeglio occasionally tried to bridge this gap by offering lab photos in addition to the recordings. \r\n\r\nThis course also involved live discussion sections with teaching fellows for remote students. I personally thought that this was very helpful, as it gave students an additional chance to review the lab procedure and ask questions (given that watching a lab video online will never be as engaging as doing the lab in person).",
                "I think the in-person component was successful, and I hope that this is continued for the next part of the sequence.",
                "Since I took the course in-person, it was pretty similar to a normal semester.",
                "The format of the class worked for me. I am glad there is an in-person option for students on campus.",
                "My engagement was not hindered due to this course being in-person, and health and safety precautions were followed well."

                "I recommend it if you need the lab credit.",
                "Yeah. You probably have to take it for pre med, but it's definitely better than gen chem lab in my experience, and overall I still enjoyed it",
                "just a pre-med requirement",
                "Take it if you have to or if you like orgo.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student taking the lecture in organic chemistry as a welcome supplement that not only teaches lab technique but sometimes gives a better, simpler explanation of concepts that are also covered in lecture.",
                "Absolutely--it's quite a bit of work for a 0.5 credit class, but it serves as a great introduction to lab etiquette and safety culture, along with several basic procedures",
                "Yes! If you're taking this class it's probably because you have to, but I felt that I learned a lot and enjoyed the experiments. Opt for in-person if your circumstances allow -- its more challenging, but much more rewarding.",
                "This is a great course. Don't worry if you are a first year without any prior lab experience; the professor and TA are very supportive and are great people in general.",
                "Yes. For many students, this is a requirement anyway. It's a solid course, and that lab experience that you get is definitely important to have.",
                "yes",
                "yes if they want to learn organic chemistry lab techniques",
                "Yes, it was very low stress for a lab and I still felt like I learned a lot. It is necessary for pre-med, but was enjoyable.",
                "Yes. Doctor D is great at making everyone feel welcome and the in-person lab was a great experience.",
                "No, unless you have to take the class for your major or are looking to do research in an organic chemistry lab. The course does teach you the necessary experimental techniques for doing organic chemistry reactions in a real lab, but the workload for this class seems unreasonable. I would not take it for fun.",
                "Yes if they are taking Organic Chem.",
                "Yes, it is a great introduction to the organic chemistry laboratory environment and techniques.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is taking the organic chemistry lecture. This course was great for practicing laboratory skills.",
                "This course is very interesting and helped me grow as a scientist and student. However, the 4 hour lab days plus pre\/post lab assignments that often took 3-6 hours made this a very rigorous course. The work was generally enjoyable but it is much more than you would expect from a 0.5 credit course.",

                "Yes, take lab while taking the organic lecture! It's a more hands-on experience that helps clarify some of the more abstract topics in lecture.",
                "Absolutely, this class made orgo that much more bearable because you felt like you were actually understanding the material and how it actually applies in the laboratory setting. Definitely take this with orgo since it helps with conceptualization.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it provided me with invaluable skills that I will be able to use later on in my career. It also was very nice to see how this lab course and the orgo lecture course were in conversation with one another especially when learning about SN1\/SN2 reactions. Being able to actually do those reactions was a great learning experience.",
                "Definitely take a chem lab. It is good to learn how to safely use materials and equipment in a class setting.",

                "I would recommend this course to students who are genuinely interested in understanding the chemistry behind different lab techniques and methods. The workload of this course is weighty, but it is necessary for one's learning and understanding. Students who take this course should have the intention of putting forward their best effort; this is not an easy course, but it is a worthwhile investment.",
                "Yes, most people who take it take it as a requirement anyway and this is a refreshing change from Gen Chem lab",
                "For a lab course, this is a good one. The set up during the pandemic is extremely beneficial to students and is a manageable workload.",
                "This is a very work-heavy course and should be worth much more than 0.5 credits. I'd only recommend it if you're willing to put in the grunt work of studying, preparing lab reports\/plans, and working hard in the actual lab.",
                "Just like with organic chemistry the class, I would have a really hard time thinking of a reason you would want to take organic chemistry lab for a reason other than requirements for a major or pre-med. It's not terrible, but it's just one of those classes that is way too much work for a topic that really isn't that interesting to be a class I'd recommend as a \"fun class.\" As long as you don't leave your PLs to the last minute and you adjust quickly to the grading guidelines of your TA, you should be alright in this lab.",
                "I would recommend this course if you need it for your major or if you're interested in improving your lab skills and technique. If you aren't interested in the material, it would definitely be more challenging, but the instructors and course organization are great!",
                "Only if they have to take it",
                "I really enjoyed this course. I honestly could say I had fun in lab, even with the restrictions and protocols. My TA was so helpful, and constantly pushed us to think critically about what was actually happening in our experiments. I felt very safe and supported, and was not afraid to make mistakes. The EPs were tedious but prepared us well for the experiments, so that we could be independent and confident during lab. At the same time, I got to know my fellow lab students a bit, and everyone was very friendly and collaborative. I liked this class because it felt practical, and it was exciting to see reactions occur, even if they were \"right\" or \"wrong\". Dr. D and all the lab staff were so caring and helpful, too! It was tough at times, and the labs\/write-ups could be long, but in the end I'm glad I took it.",
                "Yes I would recommend. I felt like the techniques and information were nicely taught.",

                "Most students who take orgo lab due so because they are required to. If you want experience working in a chemical lab, I would recommend asking for a spot at an actual Yale lab, where you can learn all the skills you need to succeed without the resentment towards writing reports coming from the need to nitpick every word to avoid a complete destruction of GPA.",
                "If this person wants to learn the basics for organic chemistry lab and techniques used, this is the class for them.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who needs to fulfill a lab for organic chemistry. The course is taught very clearly and the work is very manageable and clear.",
                "If you are required to do this for your major or pre-med, definitely do it since it is probably better than taking gen chem lab. If you choose to do this, remember to allocate your time wisely for the Post lab assignments, collaborate with fellow peers and keep an open line of communication with your TA.",

                "Yes, this lab course was pretty straightforward and a good deviance to the rest of my schedule",
                "No. Not very accommodating or thoughtful towards student needs and evidence of learning and overall just really hard to take online. Can't say anything for in person though, I imagine it would be a totally different experience.",
                "Yes. This course was a good introduction to Orgo Lab.",
                "Yes, this lab class was really great in covering a lot of useful organic lab procedures and the concepts were presented in an understandable manner. This class is also obviously a prerequisite for other more advanced science courses.",
                "Yes. It is a good lab course that would be even better in person. It is structured well and is quite organized, follows the material in lecture, and is not extremely complicated.",
                "Only if you get a reasonable TA. This will make or break your experience. I had peers who took this course and had a very decent experience but some who would always end up beyond frustrated on their lab days.",
                "It will probably be required for most people but yes I would definitely recommend taking this lab if you are taking orgo lecture (though it doesn't really need to be taken together but some topics overlap and are helpful in understanding a few topics). I personally thought that I learned much more and got more out of class than the actual orgo course. You will learn quite a lot and getting in hand experience in a lab is really helpful in the future for premeds and STEM majors. This lab is rather hands-off (which personally I liked but I had prior lab experience) and if you go into class without being prepared, you will 100% be lost as the only things you go over before you start the experiments are the chemical concepts and safety concerns. There are also two flaws in the class that I found. FIrst is the grading system which varies a lot between TAs (I had a B+ based on the assignments\/quizzes alone but was curved to an A since my TA was a harsh grader) and you don't know how you're doing until after the final. Second is the assignments that need to be done outside of class. The experimental plans and lab notes seem tedious at times and usually you spent 2-3 hours before lab for each EP and another 2-3 hours after for the LN (though this might be on the higher end since my TA was very picky). Also the lab reports (there are two) took a decent bulk of time and you often get points taken off for reasons that you don't really know. However, overall, the lab I found to be a pretty great course. Just be wary going in that you might get a lot more work depending on your TA (not more assignments just how much time you spend), you won't really know how well you are doing throughout the semester, and your final grade rests heavily on the final and two lab reports.",
                "Yes, it is a nice accompaniment to the lecture course.",
                "If you're considering this class, you likely need it for your major or premed anyways, so yes I'd recommend taking this class because you kinda half to.",
                "Yes, if it's a major prerequisite or requirement. Just be prepared to put in a lot of time for it, which can be frustrating and tedious.",
                "I would if you're interested in doing lab work in the future, because you do learn important procedures. That being said, the grading of assignments was often unclear and frustrating, and the 15-question multiple-choice final exam was pretty ridiculous. So I'd say only take it if you're genuinely interested in the content.",
                "no unless its a req",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in developing laboratory technique proficiency and for those who want their lecture experience to be accompanied by a laboratory course. While the grading system can be a little confusing at times, I thoroughly enjoyed this course and would recommend it for anyone in the STEM sciences.",
                "Only if it's required for them to take it",
                "The labs were pretty cool and help you learn organic chemistry, so yes, I would recommend this course in-person.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone whos taking organic chemistry at the same time. Learning the lab techniques enhanced my learning in the classroom, especially later in the semester when we were working on synthesis with SN2\/SN1\/E2\/E1 reactions.",
                "I doubt anyone takes this as an elective so if you have to take it for your major, it's not terrible and I imagine it would be more fun in person if you could do the lab yourself.",
                "I would because I really enjoyed watching the experiments online throughout the semester and felt like I really had the time to understand the material in this format.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they needed it for a pre-req. This is because I feel like there are much better, more enriching classes to take than an introductory organic chemistry lab at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone taking organic chemistry. The lab complements the lecture well, and is a great introduction to laboratory techniques.",
                "it's a prereq",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but I would warn them that while it is a 0.5 credit, if it is your first lab class, it feels like a lot more than that. This class has a high workload.",
                "Yes, it's cool to see material you learn in lecture actually be used.",
                "If they need it for a major or a lab requirement, which is probably why most people take this class, then sure. I don't know if this is a lab course anyone would fall in love with, but it's definitely better than gen chem lab, for example.  I do think it's fair to say that the workload of this lab isn't as breezy as I feel like people make it out to be. You do have to put in a fair amount of time each week, and there are occasionally longer assignments on top of that.",
                "Yes. Prof. DiMeglio is caring and understanding and wants to see her students succeed. This course is amazing especially compared to OChem lecture.",
                "Yes",
                "This is a challenging course but very helpful when it comes to actually seeing the applications of what we are taught in organic chemistry",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as I did learn a lot from it.",
                "Yes! Great lab.",
                "Yes, great foundation",
                "-if you must take it",
                "Yes, if needed as a pre-med student or they truly like organic chemistry",
                "Yes, Dr. DiMeglio makes the class super enjoyable for anyone interested in Organic Chemistry.",
                "I would recommend this course. I feel much more comfortable in a lab setting and I feel familiar with many common procedures.",
                "This is a much better lab than gen chem. You really learn how to be a chemist and develop skills in experimentation. Only downside is it is only a half credit but feels like a full credit of work. Weekly experimental plans, lab notes, and quizzes.",
                "I would recommend this course, especially because it is taught in a very organized way.",
                "For sure! You learn the necessary laboratory techniques to build a foundation for more advanced lab work and it feels amazing to be able to put two and two together in terms of the science and theory, and then make the magic happen with your own hands. A great class!!",
                "Yes. Some people are required to take for chem or premed but regardless of that, it is a good class to take alongside orgs 1 where you see how some of the concepts we learn are applied.",
                "Yes! It's a very well-organized lab course with incredibly knowledgeable instructors. The info is all there if you know where to look.",
                "For all of you who just suffered through gen chem, don't sweat this course. It's sooooo much better than gen chem. It's actually a really fun course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as it is helpful in applying organic chemistry skills.",
                "I believe that this course is fundamental in developing a variety of techniques that are an absolute necessity within the chemistry laboratory, so yes.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course if someone is looking to go into research or something related to lab science.",
                "I would really only take this class if you had to. The actual lab component was fine and not too bad and even fun at times, but the extra paperwork before and after lab (especially the post labs) were just super time consuming, not engaging or conducive to learning at all, and regardless of how hard you worked, you were bound to have stupid points taken off anyways.",
                "I would recommend this class to students interested in pre-med, organic chemistry, and\/or research, as it teaches the fundamental techniques necessary for basic chemistry and basic science research",
                "Take this class if it is required by your major.",
                "Yes, if you need it!",
                "Yes, it was beneficial to have an actual lab component to organic chemistry and understand the conditions under which reactions we talk about in class take place.",
                "The course has a lot of busy work but it is cool to see how one's first lab notes\/ep compares to their last ones.",
                "Yes! It helped me better understand the subjects learned in orgo.",
                "Yes, the labs are very engaging and you learn a lot.",
                "Yes!! It helps to better grasp some concepts from orgo lecture, and is useful to see the real-life application. Dr. DiMeglio is amazing and so kind.",
                "I would not take this course unless needed for the major. Whatever enjoyable moments we had were overshadowed by constant stress of format, many hours in lab, and the time needed for internalizing the material.",
                "I would recommend if this lab is required, otherwise, no.",
                "I would. Christine makes the class enjoyable, she is more than fair and I enjoyed learning from her. We need more teachers like her. Reach out with any concerns, she is actually there to help you learn. It was refreshing to have that type of energy.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The hands-on experience from the lab is extremely helpful in understanding reactions and allows you to put your knowledge from orgo lectures into action. This course is different from just sitting in a classroom or listening to lectures while taking notes. Overall, this lab is great!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. DiMeglio does an excellent job at teaching basic lab procedures that are fundamental to organic chemistry, and these labs help add value to the concepts discussed in organic chemistry lecture.",
                "Yes, I definitely recommend this course! I love the professor and the concepts that we learn during lab!",
                "I believe I would recommend the in-person course. Students need hands-on experience to get the most out of a lab course.",
                "Yes, especially if you enjoy organic chemistry and want to understand some of its real world applications. Be prepared for a lot of work",
                "Yes, this course ties in well to the regular organic chemistry course."
