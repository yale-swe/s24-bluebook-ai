                "This course moves at a really fast pace, and it can seem especially daunting to a first-year. At the same time, course material was organized in a way that was easy to understand and follow.",
                "I thought the course was set up well. I appreciated the structure as it was the same every unit and we knew what to expect. Although it was intense, I appreciated learning Russian print, cursive, and how to type, all at the same time. I appreciated working with partners and mixing up partners every now and then. I think it's great that we have a professor and a TF who both have office hours when we need help. This is not a weakness, but I think it would have been helpful to me to have more interactive elements to the class. I love that we are put on the spot and have to translate and conjugate Russian in class, that is really helpful. I think mixing it up sometimes and drawing on the board, or playing more interactive games would be fun. I know we did these a couple of times. I liked when we practiced our handwriting on the chalk boards, that was helpful. It could be helpful too (although maybe time consuming) to do more of the textbook activities on the chalk boards. I think doing a game like Kahoot, or telephone, would be fun. Kahoot could be used for vocab, and telephone could be used to help with pronunciation, memorization, and handwriting. Overall I thought the class was great and conducive to learning.",

Despite being one of the hardest classes taken in my academic career, the opportunity to learn with like-minded individuals has made this course one of my favorites. Russian is a fascinating and hugely relevant language, and the opportunity to take it at Yale is amazing. A prospective student should definitely asses the challenges of this course before pursuing it, though.",
                "Of course! This class, and I am sure other languages are really challenging, but also rewarding. It was a lot of work but I enjoyed it. I think the professor and TF's did a great job teaching and guiding us through this challenging course. I think the structure is intense but is set up well to learn the language. I would definitely recommend this class to others.",
