                "Strengths: Professor Titus and the Teaching Fellow, Fiona, were extremely patient and engaging instructors. They always did a thorough job of explaining/introducing new concepts. Since the class size is pretty small, it allowed them to correct individual mistakes during read-aloud practice. Generally speaking, the way Yale language courses are structured (especially beginner courses) ensure that students are being frequently exposed to the language. This is definitely a \"you get what you put into it\" course. This was my first time learning a language (besides the one I grew up speaking with my family), and I feel like this course was definitely rewarding in teaching foundational Russian. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  I felt that some of the daily homework exercises from the workbook were often tedious and unrelated to what we had studied in class. On some days, the homework took me 30 minutes, but on other days, I would spend nearly 2 hours. Also, since all of the homework is completed by hand in cursive, I wished that the exams/quizzes were also done by hand, instead of on Canvas. We rarely practice typing in Russian, so I felt that I could have completed exams faster if I was hand-writing my answers, which I practice every day via the homework.",
                "I think we should spend more time on pronunciation; that way, we can feel more in tune with the culture and the Russian people. (My pronunciation is something I still work on, even with prior familial experience in Russian language)."

            "comments": [
                "Highly recommend. Russian is not necessarily difficult, but it's definitely a lot of work to learn, especially you have to study the Cyrillic alphabet. There are a lot of cases and nuances to be memorized in both grammar and phonetics, so you definitely have to be prepared to invest time into the course if you want to succeed. For me, this meant listening to Russian podcasts/TV or re-writing case charts in my free time. The grading is pretty fair and relaxed; however, I recommend really investing into the homework since they're graded for accuracy and count for a sizable chunk of the final grade. Also, Fiona and Professor Titus provide valuable feedback on the homework, which usually comes in handy for the quizzes and tests.",
                "Absolutely (assuming they are up to the challenge, of course). Learning Russian, or any other language of the caliber, requires a willingness to be humbled and an openness to failure at times. But Russian language and culture is beautiful, and everyone (in my opinion) should have at least some engagement with it in their lifetime."
