The final project and presentation were an amazing opportunity for us to research about the aspect of combinatorics that we are interested in and learn from others students' interests as well.",

Some math professors use the online format to cram as much information as possible into lecture, but Professor Kenyon did a great job presenting the material at a pace that everyone could understand. When I signed up for the course, I thought it would be more about graph theory than it ended up being.",
                "I think it would have been much more helpful if we had a teaching assistant offering more drop-in office hours. Sometimes the homework would get difficult, but there would be no one to go to for help. However, Professor Kenyon's weekly office hours were very helpful, even though I wish it could have been offered more frequently instead of just the same time slot every week. I also think the problem sets could have been graded more promptly so we can receive feedback sooner than late.",
