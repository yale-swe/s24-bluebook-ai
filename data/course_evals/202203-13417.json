We discussed how different kinds of development both affected the landscape and human components of the country, and the modern implications.",

                "Strengths: The readings were so good. Like I kid you not they went crazy week after week. The discussion was very good and helped bring out key parts of the readings. No the readings were so good. Also thematically the course was constructed clearly to incorporate the politics of infrastructure, like Indigenous displacement and anti-Black structural racism, which are central. This courses asks you to think critically about infrastructure, who makes it, why it's made, and how that affects people.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't like 19th century rail stuff and those histories are always really technical so that week was kinda eh, although it's important to be able to read those so it was fine. The person who wanted to colonize Greenland in the course should've been approached with more...criticism... specifically because it was just such in opposition to the course themes!! There is a substantial focus on writing itself, which should have made the course a Writing Credit, but it wasn't. Tragic. \r\n\r\nThis isn't a \"weakness\" per say but I wish there was like another version of the course that touched on many of the infrastructures we didn't talk about (just simply because of time limits), and even Prof Rose acknowledged this as well. Things like public murals/art, oil platforms, natural gas lines, the nuclear family, boats, planes, airports, marinas, schools, broadband/cable networks, sewage/plumbing + water towers; food, food deserts, and grocery stores; schools; hospitals and healthcare, satellites, and so much more would be awesome too.",
                "The readings were very interesting, and definitely the heart of the course. There were a lot of readings at first so it was hard to spend enough time on them to fully digest them, but lessening them at the mid semester mark helped solve that problem. The discussions were also always lively and interesting.  Feedback on my writing from Professor Rose was also one of the best parts of the class, and will help me in my coming semesters.",
                "Strengths: read a wide array of texts and plenty of room for discussion, appreciated the inclusion of Indigenous perspectives and other marginalized voices when they could be found\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: reading load was initially extremely high (but reduced by the professor mid-semester after feedback), as with most US history/history courses the syllabus included a lot of white men, and certainly could be improved by including more diverse voices or revisionist histories, professor accommodated some student comments that several students found over the line re. colonialism, lots of writing for not being a writing credit",
                "Strength: Taylor is awesome and can lead a discussion like very few other professors I've had. The readings were all super interesting and offered nuanced takes on multiple subjects. Taylor also gives great, specific, essay feedback. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The readings were often a bit too long, but interesting nonetheless."
