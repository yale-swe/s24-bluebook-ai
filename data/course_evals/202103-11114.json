                "The knowledge taught in the course is great and really interesting. The organization and administrative aspects of the class were pretty disorganized and in some cases unnecessary in my opinion, including the online quizzes and certain aspects of the homeworks.",
                "The little modules were good but the lectures overall seem like a waste of time.",
                "Strengths - super interesting material, you honestly won't forget it. The material is applicable to pretty much every field, and if you follow this class, you'll understand what's going on behind the scenes with some pretty powerful tools. Weaknesses - it's just so poorly disorganized. Just so bad. The problem sets and quizzes were beyond vague.",
                "Strengths: lecture material \r\nWeaknesses: feedback on PSETS",
                "Strengths: lecture slides and pre-recorded lectures helped with understanding, learned a ton about unsupervised learning and dataset analysis which is very useful for research and/or other classes, Weaknesses: psets were very long and hard to understand so a lot of completing them was trying to figure out what was being asked and what formulas to use, also quizzes/assessments made major leaps which make sense to a more advanced student, but was confusing to those new to the topics",
                "I had a hard time keeping up at some points in the neural network module. It seemed it was assumed we had some background on neural networks already, and a good number of students certainly did, but also keep in mind this is a course with a broad audience that may not always have that background (eg genetics).",
                "Strengths: Instructor is incredibly bright and talented. They know a lot about this field, and it shows when you ask them a question.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Instructor spends way too much time bragging about their research. Sometimes they put down random formulas on the board and fail to explain them unless asked directly. Also the questions on the problem sets are incredibly confusing and vague.",
                "N/A, auditing the course",
                "This is by far the worst class I have taken at Yale. Smita is rude, arrogant, and horrendous at teaching. When asked questions or approached by students, she gives off a terribly confrontational attitude and her answers are unhelpful and unclear. Often she repeats the question back to you in a condescending and belittling way, which completely destroys the confidence of students and removes their motivation to learn. She is dreadful at teaching and cannot explain any concept with any clarity at all. Her slides just contain pictures from journals and she explains them in such a complicated and high-level manner that only someone with 20 years of experience in the field can understand. It would serve her well to understand that her students are seeing the material for the first time, and have not had experience with it. I have never felt so lost and confused in a class, and many students feel the same way because nobody pays attention in class. Everyone is on other websites and half the class doesn't show up because her teaching is so terrifying and horrible. Assignments are needlessly long and tedious, and minimal help and guidance are given. Assignments are graded extremely slow and tardily, with only one grade back by the time I'm writing this after the semester has ended. The grading is messy, opaque and confusing - we were promised 5 quizzes but given 2, and the percentage for the quiz suddenly changed from 15% to 2%, with the \"remaining 7% allocated to the project\". First, 15-2=13, not 7, so is the13% allocated all to the project? Second, the project is already 30%, and allocating 43% to a project that is shorter than the assignments and has minimal guidance does not make sense at all. Students are left confused about grading and their standing throughout the class. The class is truly the most poorly organized and poorly taught class I have ever came across in my entire education history. I highly recommend that you avoid Smita's classes at all costs.",
                "I think that the final project and exam were too close to each other - they could be spread out",
                "The strength of the course is also its main weakness: it covers A LOT of topics. This allows students to see a lot of different things, but they are all treated too superficially. Another issue with the course is that the assignments are too long and repetitive, and due to their length they take a lot of time to be graded so students do not receive timely feedback.",
                "The course covers a range of topics in unsupervised learning including dimensionality reduction, clustering, community detection and various neural networks, so it is very helpful and rewarding for someone who has little background in machine learning. It emphasizes both implementation of the algorithms as well as the theoretical aspect and interpretation, which lay a good foundation for application of unsupervised learning methods in various fields and topics relevant to the students' backgrounds.\r\nHowever, the course does not clearly delineate its learning objectives. The content for a given module can go from very basic to fairly advanced, and it is not usually clear which part of the content is fundamental or essential to know. For a student who has little background in machine learning and computer science, it is easy to get lost in the class discussion, get distracted by more advanced topics and end up not grasping the basics. Therefore, the course can be substantially improved if every class and every module can be better structured into basic/essential content and more advanced content, with clear learning objectives defined for each module.\r\nMoreover, the problem sets can be slightly trimmed so that 1. students receive more timely feedback through out the semester and 2. they have more time for the final project.",
                "The course's HW assignments are extremely long and the final one expected a lot of prior technical knowledge with PyTorch-- something that we very briefly reviewed. Also, the average grades for the quizzes on Canvas were about 20/40 and were often poorly worded and confusing."

A good point of entry to unsupervised learning as the course exposes students to various methods and topics, covering both the mathematic and theoretical as well as the practical/implementation aspect of them.
