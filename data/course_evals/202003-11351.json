                "Super practical course relative to other econ classes at Yale. If you're considering being a trader after college you should definitely take this. Sometimes tangents in lectures make it a little hard to pay attention, and first few midterms can be tricky, but overall a good course. There are definitely a lot of midterms (4 + a final), so it can feel like you're taking exams a lot. The readings every week weren't super helpful because they were so long and technical and we were never really expected to know them so there wasn't much motivation to do them.",
                "Pascutti is a little disorganized but not so much so in this course compared to his corp. finance course. If you took corporate with him, this will be on the easier side for you since some of the same topics are covered.",
                "Pascutti is super entertaining and open to student feedback.",
                "Strength -- learned a lot and Professor Pascutti is a great lecturer. He is clear and always has great stories to tell. He does a great mix of lecturing, telling stories, and engaging students in examples.\r\n\r\nWeakness -- Professor Pascutti is a genius and so has high expectations. The 4 quizzes took a lot of studying.",
                "Strengths: really interesting material, great instructor, frequent and fair assessments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lecture notes were often all over the place. needed to watch the lecture recordings to understand them. Prof Pascutti says that he normally doesn't make powerpoints so that might be the explanation.",
                "The pandemic hurt this course because Prof. Pascutti is a great in-person lecturer. He still did a very good job over Zoom, but it is inevitably more difficult to be engaging over a computer, which is one of his greatest strengths as a teacher.",
                "Tests were a bit tricky, but fair! Just wish we had more practice problems\/more complex problem set questions to get the hang of concepts before they were tested on exams.",
                "The class was very enjoyable to attend as the professor always brings great stories and commentary on the well-customized material. It also was very effective in getting across the points about market anomalies and how to exploit them (or why it is often difficult to exploit them safely or at all.)\r\n\r\nThere felt like there were a few too many quizzes\/midterms (a total of 4, plus the final exam) so we were always on our toes for another assessment. This could also be seen as a positive, however, so not a huge critique.",
                "Incredible, enthusiastic professor. The material was engaging and was constantly updated based on current market trends and events.",
                "Topics could have been better organized. Also powerpoints and writing things on the board could be helpful. Also the policy of handing in things late and getting your grade lowered Stinks because my computer is super slow.",

                "There was a lot of reading that was repetitive and not addressed in the week following. Professor seemed disorganized. For example, we had a midterm on a Monday and then we went over the material on the test for the first time that Wednesday. The grade distribution of that test was huge because of  the pre existing varying levels of experience in the course material. Some students had worked two internships in what we talked about; others had little to no experience. This is the nature of how things go, but the wide range of test scores (lowest being a 10%, highest being a 100%, median was around 50%) was an indicator of the lack of relevant material being taught for this particular midterm.",
                "I liked that the problem sets were Pass\/Fail. However, they were not always a good preparation for the tests, and we had a lot of tests. There were 4 quizzes, and I only could finish one of them in time! The Final Exam took the whole 3 hours! The readings had little relation to the class and almost no relation to the tests. I still read them, of course, as they did describe important pieces of research in the space. Overall, it was this over-testing that was the only weakness. You can mitigate that hassle with a CR\/D and still learn a lot, or if you have taken a class with the prof. before, you can probably know what to expect and do quite well.",
                "Very interesting material taught by Prof. Pascutti who has extensive experience in the field. Interesting to get his thoughts and views on certain phenomena. He also tailors the course to cover current events (ie SPACs in Fall 2020).  Downside of this is that about midway through the term the structure of the course (which had been very well defined in the beginning) began to fall apart which made understanding exactly what was important\/going on challenging at times."
