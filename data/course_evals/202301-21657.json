Group projects will test your faith in the goodness of others. I learned that several \"engineering majors\" at Yale are in reality pretty incompetent and will freeload off your work. I develop a key insight which was: doing more than the bare minimum will always backfire on you.",

                "Mechanical design in a team environment, in partnership with an actual company. This is a continuation of the 487, so it naturally follows the work done in that course; moving from prototyping to finalizing your project\/product, and wrapping up production and manufacture to present your year long work.",

Senior design is definitely a lot of work, but it's a great way to gauge whether working in the industry is your thing. You get the chance to undertake an entire engineering project--you learn how to develop a problem statement, how to budget, how to manage and stay up to date with a 9-month schedule, how to prototype and iterate. Depending on your project, you might also gain more machining and assembly experience. You're also forced to think of ways to properly test and analyze a system, decide what parameters are most important, etc. There are also so many people--Dr. Booth, TFs, Pete, Kevin, Nick--that are always there to help, you just need to learn to ask for help anytime you're stuck or else you will fall behind."

I guess this is technically a strength because it teaches you that people in the real world are usually useless and annoying to work with. Also a lot of the advice given tended to be unfeasible or would require a LOT of effort to actually implement.",
                "The second semester was better than the first because we were allowed to focus entirely on our project instead of having to complete random assignments that added no value to our project and simply wasted our time (like building a mock chicken coop). However, there were still a couple of lectures which again were irrelevant as they did not communicate useful engineering concepts. We also had to complete irrelevant assignments every two weeks or so which had no relation to our project and simply wasted our time.\r\n\r\nOur primary advisor did not get any input with regard to our grades, and in the first semester of this course, our grades were determined based on 'Peer Evaluations\", \"Instructor Judgement\" and 10 minute meetings with TAs rather than by the quality of our work. The TAs and instructor felt they knew exactly who was doing what without ever once seeing us work as a team together. The end result was that for MENG 487 (fall 2022) we all received different grades and the grades were in no way correlated to our performance or the quality of our work. To say I am dissatisfied with the way MENG 487\/8 was run would be a gross understatement!",
                "Strengths: it's a great, hands-off approach to allow the students to work with a company and their peers to produce and present a year-long mechanical design project. For much of the semester, the only required meeting times are for the presentations and the biweekly 10-20 minute meetings with the instructors to check in with your project. You as a team must decide by yourselves when to meet, what to do, and who does what. When you do need help, there is ample support to give you a nudge in the right direction. \r\nWeaknesses: your project, teammates, company, and advisors honestly do really affect your experience in this course, it's very very important to have great teammates, great communication, and a project you at the very least are somewhat interested in. The grading is also kind of vague and a bit subjective as well.",
                "This course is really what you make of it. If you have a project you like and somewhat responsible group members you will have a great time and you won't need to overwork yourself. However, we waste way too much time on busy work (both for this class and in the fall semester) which would be better spent actually working on these projects.",
                "I think this could be improved by shuffling some of the 487 lectures into the spring and hosting more industry\/academia people in the fall for talks about their path. I feel like I dont get enough experience meeting people and discovering different paths, and I feel like this is the class to do that.",
                "Needs to be 1 credit for each semester.",
                "The strengths of this course lie in the independence and trust you are given to learn by doing. Dr. Booth is a huge proponent of just getting your hands dirty as early as possible and that leads you to run into problems often. Learning to solve those problems in a supportive environment is what helps you grow and I feel that's what I got in the teaching team.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of this course is the variability of your project depending on the corporate client you get paired with. My client did not come up with a good project for us and was not incredibly supportive. That dragged down the entire semester and year and I would have appreciated the class a lot more if I had a better project."

                "a word of advice: do NOT let your senior year become about this course. If you let it ruin your life, it will. No amount of tiredness, sleeplessness, exhaustion, etc is worth it. This course will test you, not because the engineering is hard, but because group projects are the worst possible form of education. Your teammates will likely be stupid, lazy, incompetent, or all of the above. Putting in anything more than the bare minimum amount of effort will only teach your useless teammates how to freeload. You will receive limited feedback from your client because they are actual adults who have actual projects that actually matter unlike this one. The teaching staff will be helpful but the expectations of workload they have is at times so astronomically high that you feel like they forget you have a life outside this class. Toward the end of each semester, you will notice the workload for this class skyrocket and you will struggle to keep up. When this happens, just remember that these are the consequences of your actions. This is a CHOICE that YOU made. \r\n\r\nThis is your last year at Yale. Enjoy it. Don't let this class be the thing you remember about your time at this university. Meet your friends, go out, take walks in the sunshine, sip hot chocolate in the snow, enjoy the beauty of the world that exists above the dingy dark tunnels connecting Becton and Mason. Your life can and will be so much more fun if you care less about this class.",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if they were to be guaranteed 1) a real senior design project that one could be proud of (not building a box) and 2) grades would be measured fairly and not according to 10 minute meetings held with TAs who had nothing to do with our projects\r\n\r\nI would have been extremely disappointed with my senior project if I had worked with any of the companies besides the one I did. The quality of senior design projects was extremely poor and I am shocked that this year's round of projects were \"the best yet so far\". I feel sorry for those who have graduated before us!",
                "Yes, I learned a lot about working for a client and about working with a team. The projects were all extremely interesting and I enjoyed doing mine, but keep in mind that it is a time consuming class.",
                "If you're ABET, you have to. Otherwise, if you would like a hands-off approach to mechanical design in a collaborative environment, this course isn't bad. The workload is pretty high but the overall experience is really shaped by your project, your teammates, the company you work with, and your advisors.",
                "Don't take it unless you have to (and all ABET MechE majors do). Even though he is a talented mechanical engineer, Joran is not a well-organized or particularly thoughtful instructor. Most of the projects offered do not seem particularly engaging and some of the presentations at the end of the year were quite frankly embarrassing in how simple they were, considering teams of 3-4 spent the better part of a year working on them. I am not sure whether this is due to Joran's love of assigning pointless work to students when they could be instead spending time on their capstone projects, or due to him and the rest of the teaching team not pushing other students to work harder, or because some of my peers this year simply don't have a lot of drive to make progress. Realistically, it's probably a combination of all three. From what I've heard, this course is much better than it was in previous years, but I wish there was a better instructor for it that could better define expectations for year-long projects and not force people to waste their time. I would also like to add that it is ridiculous that so much of your grade in this course is left up to \"instructor judgement.\"",
                "I would since you have to take it as a MENG ABET engineer.",
                "Only if you need it for the capstone. Useful, but not worth the time commitment.",
                "I always think this question is hilarious because you don't take this course if you're not an ABET MechE and if you're an ABET MechE, you have no choice. So yes, I recommend this course to those of you who have to take it."
