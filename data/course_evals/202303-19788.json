Exams were very poorly written, and hardly related to anything in the psets. Moment functions constituted a large part of the final, and was extremely poorly taught..",
                "Reading off the slides was not a very engaging format of lecturing. I wouldve preferred something closer to a math class, where key concepts are derived on the board. I learned most of the concepts through the textbook",
                "I think an increased amount of practice questions with each lecture could be helpful, sometimes I find its hard to know where our gaps in understanding lie.",

                "The course notes were really clear and very helpful for the exams. There was also a component of computer programming, which I found to be very helpful.",
                "Very low workload. Not very intrinsically interesting content, but that's just par for the course. Exams were fine--I would suggest getting quick at using control-F on the textbook pdf. The course didn't really hold me accountable for internalizing any of the material since the textbook problems (assigned once every two weeks) were kind of plug-and-chug, and the content itself just isn't that conceptually demanding. Prof. Narita was chill and knowledgeable.",

I took the GLBL 121\/122 sequence and that class left out lots of important concepts that you actually need to know in order to have a good grasp of statistics. I would recommend this class over that, but maybe not over S&DS 241\/242. Lectures werent very useful and you learn most of the content on your own from the textbook.",
