This is not supposed to be a difficult course.\r\n\r\nIf that's not indicative of how poorly this course was taught, I don't know what is. Professor Glenn is not great at teaching this subject, and Office Hours and general feedback was severely lacking. I felt like I had to self-learn the majority of the content. I went to Office Hours multiple times to get feedback on my midterm exam and understand why I got certain questions wrong, but there were simply too many people who needed to get walked through the homework assignment. The main thing I got out of this course was the pressure to self-learn a lot of the content. I wish I had taken MATH 244 instead.",

I understand this is fundamentally a theory class, but having the class tied to more real-world applications rather than \"the number of perogies\" would have been nicer. Besides, why the hell did we spend so much time learning about the mcnugget problem (with perogies instead of mcnuggets)?",

But I'll  list some off the top of my head: predicate logic, the idea of proofs(there were times during this course i wished they never existed, but it's  really all about the proofs), to be patient and persistent- each weeks pset was a struggle, cldnt  get thru all of it without OH's.",

Students mainly took Glenn's lecture notes and tried to take that format for writing their proofs. I wish the proofs were a little more formal. Also, the topics of this class were everywhere. It was a whole new completely different topic per week that we did not go into much depth in the class so we were required to do it on our own for the problem sets. I guess the point of the class was an overview to all of these topics but I wish some of the topics were more in-depth so I could have learned them better vs. an overall sampling of all these math concepts. This is a class I think almost would be taught better over two semesters. Prof Glenn mentioned often concepts we learned is so we see it for the first time to be prepared for higher mathematical computing classes, but I think that those concepts should be solely reserved for our classes to make CPSC 202 more focused.",

                "Prof. Glenn is a good lecturer, and the course has engaging material that is presented well. Psets are mostly manageable but help you learn the material. The biggest weakness is the grade distribution, if you care about that . Prof. Glenn was not willing to curve or adjust cutoffs even though the median on the midterm was a 77.",
                "A strength of this course was that many useful topics were covered.",
                "Strengths: concepts learned are useful in computer science.  Weaknesses: very boring.  Midterm was unreasonably harsh.",
                "Strengths: The course was very organized, lots of office hours to get help, PSETs were reasonable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were quite boring. I stopped going to them pretty early on in the semester and just watched the recording in 2x speed.",
                "A strength of this class was the number of topics covered. It was interesting to learn about each and strive to fully understand them. I think a weakness would be the lack of opportunities to practice what was learned in class (as most practice on one's own was on the graded homework). Instead of lectures consisting just of watching the professor complete problems, I think opportunities during class where students could complete problems first and then have the instructor go over them would be more beneficial.",
                "Pset grading is BAD.  Also need the ability to drop one pset at minimum.  Lectures are pretty boring, but follow the psets really well which is a great quality of this course.",
                "Interesting mathematical concepts that are foundational to computer science. However, there were many weaknesses. The lectures were very dense and hard to follow for students without a background in discrete math. Many of my friends struggled and withdrew from the class. There is usually only 1 ULA during office hours rushing to help 10 students. The psets are not always adjacent and usually a lot more difficult than the lecture examples, so many times we had to learn from websites or youtube to complete the psets.",
                "This course was horrible. It had only weakness. Quite literally no strengths. The problem sets were too long and difficult to be due every week. None get dropped and you can only submit late 3 times, but then if you do submit late on a pset you're behind on the next one. The midterm was horrendous, and Glenn told us he made it impossible on purpose. The office hours were unhelpful and there are basically no resources to help with any psets. The textbook explains things horribly and isn't even exactly what our class is.",
                "The strength was that the material was well presented with examples that elucidated it well, but the weakness is that it was very boring and repetitive. The majority of the material was material that I had already learned in high school math classes, which meant that it was not necessary to go to the lectures.",
                "Weaknesses  the office hours only had one TA and 15+ students who needed help. The TA would only answer one student's question at a time and independently which made it difficult to receive proper help. Like most Yale classes  lecture was one thing and psets a whole different thing (in terms or rigor not content).",
                "Strengths: very well organized and always stayed on track. engagement was pretty good and the quality of instruction was high. weaknesses: the homework assignments were very difficult for what they are, and are difficult to finish with a high grade without the assistance of office hours.",
                "Strengths: a combination of unlimited-attempt Canvas quizzes and written portions for the problem sets was very fair. Course moved at a manageable pace. It is a good way to cover a wide range of mathematical topics relevant to CS majors rather succinctly.\r\nWeaknesses: office hours were very helpful but not timed very well to problem set deadlines (part of this problem is course enrollment dictating the number of ULAs, so not a total fault). Problem set grading was very slow (4 weeks behind at times, even after the midterm was graded).",
                "Notes were pretty poor, and lecturing was pretty bad",
                "The topics in the course are quite interesting and I can definitely see the applications of certain topics to computer science, but they can sometimes be unintuitive or difficult to grasp. The course topics sometimes did not seem to be related to one another, which made it harder to learn within the structure of the class.",
                "Strength is that the class itself gets you to think differently about math and the previous knowledge you know about math. Weakness is that it feels like there isn't enough practice/problems to understand the material sometimes.",
                "I believe there could have been more direction in the lectures as to how to approach some of the problem set questions. I also wish there was more clarity on what could be tested. However, the class did do a good job at covering all the content and making office hours regularly available.",
                "This course's main strength was its professor. I think the course material is interesting on its own, but Dr. Glenn really brought it to another level. The lectures were actually fun to attend because he is very communicative with those who attend. The grading scheme of the course also allowed you to really learn how to write proofs without being penalized for not being great at it early on. The exams were very fair, and the workload is never overly burdensome. I believe this course was at its best possible form.",
                "I think this course does a quite good job introducing students to topics in linear algebra, combinatorics, discrete math, cryptography etc",
                "Strengths: breadth of topics, late day policy\r\nWeaknesses: the grading was unnecessarily harsh compared to other CS courses I've taken here, the instructor was good but not great (and definitely not kind) and the depth of topics made it so I don't feel that I fully understood the topics at all. PSETs were also graded badly (we didn't have 3 PSETs graded at all near the final) and ULAs would say something was correct that would then be graded as incorrect during grading.",
                "Professor Glenn's teaching was not very good. His preferred teaching style is to use Microsoft OneNote to do \"live math\" and then post that as class notes. This is often very hard to follow from a purely visual point view, as the notes are usually extremely cluttered. The psets often felt a level or two too removed from the class content, and the notation that was used in class and in the Psets was often inconsistent. I found myself going on the answer explanations for psets and not understanding them because of different notation. The psets would usually take weeks to be graded so there was no way to know how well you were doing in the class or what content you needed to brush up on.",
                "The varying levels of difficulty from pset to pset was something... Sometimes, Glenn just puts all of his effort (on psets and tests) into writing the most conceptually difficult or convoluted questions ever, you spend more time figuring out what is going on rather than practicing the material itself. However, dealing with the logic itself is actually a little fun. Go to office hours if you are struggling, the ULAs are very helpful.",
                "Strengths were that it was well resourced and the TAs were very helpful. Weaknesses were that grading was vague, there were only 2 exams that made up half the grade with little guidance on how to prepare for them. Glenn wasn't as helpful of a professor with lessons thst seemed very general without going into the larger principles that explained certain topics. I found myself learning more from TAs and on my own.",
                "Weaknesses: teaching style. The instruction was unclear, everything was handwritten and disorganized, and honestly so so boring. Even after the final exam I am still unclear what I was supposed to learn from lecture, and the homework and exams were much harder than what he covered in class.",
                "I felt like the course was unstructured. I felt so confused about how concepts related to each other from one class to the next. The assignments we were given were harder than what we learned in class, which was really discouraging as you'd have to spend more time learning during office hours than I should",
                "Strengths: Focuses more on CS rather than pure discrete math topics.\r\nWeaknesses: This course is a lot more difficult (especially considering the problem sets, exams, lack of notes on exams) when it is taught by Glenn. It is also not super organized, but I think this is common for all instructors. I think this course should be labeled discrete math for computer science rather than mathematical topics as the current name is too ambiguous.",
                "Glenns lectures were entertaining but not really a good use of your time because he spent too much time on simple concepts, providing involved examples to illustrate them, and not enough time on more difficult concepts. Psets were interesting but quite difficult, and it took forever to get feedback on them. Grading was also extremely subjective. TAs were helpful, and the course was well-structured as far as material and posted notes. Connections to CS were actually emphasized, which was nice.",
                "Strengths: detailed notes and helpful problem sets and TAs/professor were very helpful\r\nWeakness: needed more explanation and practice on the lectures in the latter half (specifically on functions, cardinality, and counting)",
                "Very clearly organized course. Materials easily accessible, plenty of office hours.",
                "I enjoyed the psets and content for the first 2/3s of the course, but had difficulty with the last 1/3 of the course (notes were not as helpful as they were before, psets were difficult to understand, lecture content wasn't as helpful to solve the psets).",
                "I feel that maybe the teaching could have been taught in a way that isn't too confusing for new comers to discreet math .",
                "Strengths: broad depth of material covered \r\nWeakness : too fast paced",
                "One of the biggest improvements made to this class was the increase in homework as a proportion of the final grade. With Glenn, it was 50%. Glenn writes very hard psets - ones that I often spent far too long on - but having the two exams only determine 50% of my grade (rather than 70%) was very welcome. Onto the psets, I often felt like they were too difficult, but they were generally lined up with the content we were learning in class. If it wasn't clear when initially attempting, it was very much clear when finished. I think some of the psets could be made easier, as it felt like a few of the psets had the entire class stuck in office hours. Glenn, also, writes bad notes. They're difficult to follow without having to rewatch the lecture. Though the class explicitly references multiple resources (namely Aspnes' notes and a Discrete Math book), they didn't line up fully and so having concise, clear notes dedicated to the current iteration of 202 being taught would be a welcome addition. Also, there should be more linear algebra. Simply learning basic multiplication in one class is not enough for the real world.",
                "The first review was the night before the exam. This made things difficult, glad that was adjusted for the 2nd, but having  a review session a week before or something is even better to help students gain focus on what they need to study before the exam. The 1st midterm practice wasn't representative of tge material on the midterm. There was a lot of content -too much in fact covered after the first half of the course, and the notes became less clear when reviewing  them in comparison to the first half. I liked the handwritten notes tho for the most part. Maybe that was a way of making students come to lecture, but even after i came to lecture, i would have to rewatch the class videos nevertheless.I suggest doing preclass videos like the Math Department, optional, but helpful as students co,e into lecture knowing whats up. A strength was that the professor brought creativity  into each pset and lecture, like the CHOMP game pset on probability(made it somwhat tougher to understand  the principles being taught through the pset like stars and bars, but it also made it fun when u finally got it), the postage stamp pset(induction), the pierogi lectures, the fun predicate logic examples etc. I was kinda sad about the grading  situation towards the end, unfortunately, the grading wasnt  finished in timefor psets, so psets were rough graded. Overall, this was the 2nd hardest class of my life after SDS238. There were some really tough psets, might be 5 questions, but the amount of time each one took spoke volumes. It was made fun and interesting by the professor, but it's a tough class(a lot of new content), so beware.",
                "Glenn is too harsh of a prof, and the exams were much harder than the PSETs or practice problems.",
                "Strength: ULA/TF office hours help\r\n\r\nWeakness: how engaging the lectures were",
                "Strengths- I thought the course was challenging and thought very valuable skills like knowing how to prove something \r\nWeakness- I thought the course was taught poorly. The lectures by the professor were kinda hard to follow and jumped all over the place, the problem sets were very frequently a lot harder than what was taught in class. Overall I had a hard time understanding some of the topics cause they weren't explained very well.",
                "No clarity about grading, course material is interesting",
                "Not enough TAs in office hours, not enough office hours, grades on psets returned late and with minimal feedback, notes provided are hard to follow and often lacking",
                "I thought the course was really poor at managing expectations. Material taught in class was easier than the problem sets. Problem sets were easier than the exams. I was really confident about the class until time came for the exam. I felt relatively cheated about the material that was tested. This is the first class I have felt that way out of the 8 courses I have taken so far. I also had no idea how I was performing on the psets prior to the exam. They were not graded before the first midterm. Psets were only partially graded before the final.",
                "It is extremely unacceptable that our problem set grades for the midterm and our final were mostly incomplete before the tests. Unlike other classes, there are multiple ways to do a proof, and multiple forms of understanding the question. This class above all others needs to have timely feedback for this reason. Though there were answer keys online, I do believe feedback on our own work and how to do better would have helped me more before my exams. \r\n\r\nProfessor Glenn is extremely passionate when he teaches so much so he has a hard time sticking to one topic and wanders off when he speaks. I also wish he would post non-marked up versions of his notes because his annotations were kinda everywhere after lecture. \r\n\r\nI also wish for the midterm a more comprehensive review would have been given, we kinda just had to figure out what was on that midterm which is hard for students new to the major and Yale in general, which this class is targeted towards. This was improved for the final but I wish it was the case here as well.",
                "Lectures were solid (and also available online), office hours hosted by ULAs were very helpful, psets were sometimes quite confusing but overall were manageable. It would have been helpful to receive grades and feedback more quickly on the psets, which would have improved studying experience and performance on midterms and finals."

                "Yes. Its required for the CS major, but its a fun class even for non majors like me. It contains a good introduction to proofs. I dont recommend if you care about grades..",
                "Yes, it is useful to understand discrete math.",
                "I believe it is a useful course if you want to take more CS courses in the future, although you should probably not take it with Glenn.",
                "Yes, I felt like this was a good introduction to proof-based math.",
                "Yes. I think it was a really interesting but challenging course to take.",
                "Not really. It needs to be a bit easier, Glenn is not an easy professor. If we are putting in this much work you should just take Math 240.",
                "No, at least not with Prof Glenn. Although I enjoyed learning discrete math and Glenn is great at cracking jokes in class, the second half of the semester was extremely more difficult, lectures did not thoroughly explain concepts that were included on psets, and there was a lack of support for students. Many of my peers withdrew from this class. Discrete math is an incredibly interesting topic, but I would recommend taking it with a different professor.",
                "I absolutely would not. Take this course with anyone but James Glenn and maybe it will be okay.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student due to its boring and repetitive nature. I do not agree that it should be a requirement for the CS BS/BA degree because it forces students to take a repetitive class that covers material they already know.",
                "No. It might be better to take the Discrete Math for Math majors course instead.",
                "Yes, especially if they want to get a solid introduction to discrete math and proofs.",
                "I would recommend this course to any CPSC majors looking to fulfill the discrete mathematics requirement for the CPSC major. While challenging, this course is both more relevant to CS and more manageable than MATH 244, the only other option. I would not necessarily recommend this course to those interested in the CPSC certificate, as this course is not directly required for the certificate (only as a prerequisite for some certificate electives). It is not a course that you want to take on a whim, and is only really relevant to those studying CPSC at the major (or possibly certificate) level.",
                "I would only recommend this course to a student who was extremely interested in learning more about discrete math from a computer science angle. The class was quite difficult at times and it doesn't feel like there is enough support. Certain concepts did not \"click\" for me; especially when writing proofs, certain steps were simply not intuitive.",
                "Yes. It is a great class if you want to learn more about discrete math.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I think this course was an outstanding introduction to proof writing, and it was very much manageable. I think the course is definitely more fun with Dr. Glenn teaching as the lectures were very engaging. The course material itself is actually pretty interesting. There are great resources to get help when you do not know what is going on with the course material. I learned a lot, and the grading was fair. This was an outstanding course.",
                "i would",
                "If you're a CS major, you just have to take it, so it's not really about recommending. Just don't take it with Glenn.",
                "It depends on who's teaching it. This semester, 25% of the class scored a D- or worse in the final exam. 50% scored a C- or worse. And at least ~15 of the points in the final were simple Yes/No questions. This is not supposed to be a difficult course; it's meant to be the easier counterpart to MATH 244. Yet, I wish I had taken MATH 244.",
                "I would recommend if it is a prerequisite for another class you're interested in or if you're pursuing CS.",
                "Only if you need it for your major. If you're looking for a discrete math class, I think just taking discrete math is a better bet.",
                "Not really, but no one is taking this if they don't have to. I would maybe recommend with a different professor though.",
                "not unless it is required by your major. try to take it with a professor other than glenn.",
                "Later psets in particular were quite difficult, but at least psets constituted 50% of the grade. Material was interesting, although we spent a significant portion of the first half of the course on logic, and I would probably recommend this over discrete math (244) if you are a CS major and want to see the applicability of course topics to CS.",
                "Absolutely. Obviously it's necessary for the CS major, but it's interesting and Prof. Glenn explains mathematical concepts in a way that makes them feel intuitive.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to others in the CS major that need to meet the discrete math requirement.",
                "If you are a CS major, then yes",
                "This was the first time Prof Glenn taught this course, and as his notorious reputation goes, it was much harder than the previous years. The psets took longer to solve and the exams were much tougher than expected. What was worst, though, was the fact that most psets were not corrected before the midterm and final exams leaving us in the dark to our mistakes and the ways to prove the questions. However, besides the poor organization, the course definitely teaches you how to write mathematical proofs. Do not take it with Prof Glenn unless you have to, which I dont think should ever happen.",
                "It is essential if you want to be a computer science major, but overall good if you just want to develop basic understanding of the logic of computer science and structures behind that",
                "Look, it's a core requirement for the CS major, so \"recommend\" is a useless question. Instead, 'll answer the question \"would I recommend it over 244\", without having taken 244. I think the class offers a good enough introduction to most of the math you'll need, but to be honest, I can see why you might want to take 244. The class does lack *some* of the rigour needed in high-level classes, and misses some of the linear algebra needed in high level classes (though that would be covered in 225, not 244). But, for most students, the rigour is simply not needed - unless you plan on going to grad school, I don't think taking 244 is necessary. Also, if you like math, 244 might be a better fit for you.",
                "Absolutely not with this professor",
                "Yup, because u have to take if if you are a CS major, and the content ftom the class helped me start thinking more like a CS major!",
                "No, only take it if you need to, or just don't take it with Glenn. It should've been a straight forward class, but Glenn made exams much to difficult, and included material and proof strategies in the psets that were never discussed in class.",
                "Yes. It is helpful, especially for understanding things like runtime and counting.",
                "I wouldn't really recommend this course unless you have an interest or need it for a major. The class isn't very interesting and doesn't really provide anything unless it has something to do with your major like CS or Math.",
                "If its required for their major",
                "No, but it's a requirement of the CS major. Each topic just feels very insular",
                "I would recommend taking this course under the professor that taught it previously. According to the students that had taken it a semester prior, the class was much more organized and expectations were managed well.",
                "No, not really. It was not a fun course, not sure how useful it was. It's a crash course on functions, proofs, statistics, and linear algebra that I didn't learn well. I almost want the CS department just to mandate us to take a stat or lin algebra course(s) instead as it would be more specialized in the math department with more tutoring resources and concepts taught more in-depth. I know I could have taken Math 244 but their syllabus is also similar in the ways many forms of discrete math are taught, in my understanding.",
