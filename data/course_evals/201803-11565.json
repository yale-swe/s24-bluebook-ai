    "I learned how to think and write in a philosophical way. I also learned philosophy is not for me.",
    "critical thinking\r\nfollowing spoken arguments\r\nphilosophical writing\r\ndebating philosophical points",
    "This class was exceptional. After a bad experience with Philosophy in DS I was ready to throw in the towel, but on the strength of this course alone, I have come to love metaethics and the field of philosophy itself. Prof. Kagan gave an astonishing lecture every class that I strived not to miss, and I was genuinely excited about coming to class where my thoughts about the plausibility of an objective morality were tested and changed.",
    "Familiarity with common skeptical arguments and meta-ethical positions, improved comfort with philosophical writing and argumentation",
    "I learned about meta-ethics, first of all, and how to write a truly clear, concise paper. This course does what it aims to do very well. You learn all about what metaethical ideas are out there, and what philosophers think about what morality \"is.\" It's not necessarily information you use on the street, but it's very interesting and makes you think a lot. I think the biggest strength of this class is it really makes you consider arguments and logic and figure out what ideas can make sense. It really is valuable in that sense.",
    "Learned a great deal about a number of different second-order ethical positions and claims.",
    "philsophical argument\/organization of papers and verbal arguments",
    "Learn how to write philosophy papers and how to think about metaethics.",
    "I learned about the complex arguments for and against the existence of morality and regarding what features morality would need to have for it to be plausible.",
    "I learned about the main theories for and against moral realism.",
    "Metaethical analysis skills, philosophy writing skills.",
    "Knowledge: Problems in metaethics, including epistemic ones like whether evolutionary psychology undermines the reliability of our moral intuitions; metaphysical ones like whether categorical reasons or morals are in some sense \"spooky\"; other problems like whether motivation troubles truth-aptness of moral opinions. Other stances such as nihilism and non-cognitivism.\r\nSkills: Moral and philosophical reasoning; writing clear papers; representing and responding to opposing arguments; discussing philosophy in section; philosophical reflection \/ research.\r\nInsights: Morals are not metaphysically spookier than other things we believe; God is not a panacea for metaethical concerns (why do we care what God tells us to do? Is it true because God said it, or did He say it because it was true? Would that be mind-independent or necessary?); That people disagree about morals is a. not obvious, b. not a serious problem for moral realism.",

    "This course was instrumental in developing my clarity of writing. I am extremely happy I took this course because the improvement in my writing is monumental.",

    "I learned how to write a paper in philosophy centered around my own ideas and arguments. I also learned how the field of philosophy operates, and perhaps the most interesting of all, I learned enough about ethics to come to my own conclusion about the existence\/nonexistence of morality.",
    "It's a course about second-order ethics - basically, whether moral questions can be answered, what kind of moral questions are valid, and, most of all, loads of different general objections to different moral models.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought section was very intense since it was graded harshly which made it less enjoyable. I thought the lectures themselves were fascinating.",
    "Strong overview of different positions on morality, but could be more critical of different positions\r\nGrading and feedback differs between TAs, which makes writing papers more difficult",
    "This course was extremely strong, in terms of content I have no suggestions. From everyone who I have talked to who did the reading, the reading was really high quality. Unfortunately, there was no incentive to do the reading in terms of the course (the lectures didn't respond to it, and it was seldom brought up in section) so with a busy course load, I didn't ultimately do the reading. I would love to see the readings more emphasized in section so that there is an incentive to do them.",
    "The main strength of the course is that Kagan really knows his field and give a stimulating lecture. His manner is extremely natural and conversational, yet he always knows exactly what he wants to say and can defend his points. And the material is interesting, especially when you think about it more. My section was interesting and genuinely fun too.\r\n\r\nMain problem of the course was that it was hard to follow the broader arc or outline. The assignment for the final essay listed a dozen questions we had supposedly discussed -- I couldn't remember anything we said about most of them. Readings were left almost completely unused (even though they were interesting and could have added a lot!) \r\n\r\nI also wished I had a better idea at the outset what we would be discussing. I thought we would discuss the question \"why be moral\" -- but actually, the class was about considering (and usually rejecting) as series of specific skeptical attacks trying to prove that objective morality can't exist. Even rejecting all of these attacks, I was still left without any positive reason to \"be moral\".\r\n\r\nFinally, I'd like to take this opportunity to continue what I'm sure is a decades-long tradition of complaining about Prof. Kagan's grading scheme. As is well known, Kagan grades on a completely different scale from the rest of Yale college (median on the first essay was a C+). This has the predictable effect that a majority (or at least a very large plurality) of students either drop the class or take it credit\/D, as I did. The fact that I knew I wouldn't get a grade inevitably sapped my motivation  especially on the essays (I could have met with my TA to discuss and improve them rather than writing them the night before, but I had to prioritize other work). The ironic part is that I would have been willing to work hard and risk a mediocre grade if the curve were merely very difficult, as opposed to unreasonable. The end result is that the students learn less. The only good motivation I can think of for grading this way is to identify the small minority of students who are truly gifted and committed to philosophy and separate them from those who are merely smart, or have a passing interest. This is a worthwhile goal, but not in a 100 level course. I hope you don't dismiss me as a bitter or grade-grubbing as I said, I came into this simply because I liked the material and knowing ahead of time that I would credit\/d anyway-- I'm only saying I would have gotten more out of the class had I seen taking it for a grade as a realistic option.",
    "A major weakness of the course is its absurd grading scale, which serves a demoralizing purpose more than any other.",
    "Prof. Kagan's lectures are always engaging, clear, and given with enthusiasm. He actively encourages students to voice questions and doubts during lecture, which I found incredibly beneficial. Sections are engaging, and having a good TA reduced the initial anxiety I felt about the strict grading system for section participation.",
    "I think it could be better organized to begin with basics of epistomology and metaphysics as a background and that the reading list could include some more important, pivotal works of philsophy",
    "This has the potential of being a strong class. It is different from a typical philosophy class at Yale because of its second-order nature. I do not think that the course was not designed with growth in mind, regardless of whether it is considered in the calculation of final grades. I appreciate the enthusiasm Shelly has and the knowledge he has, but I believe that there was a serious disconnect between him and the TFs when it comes to the structure of the course and what students should be getting out of it. My section was dominated by students who consistently provided hot-takes (sorry for the colloquialism) about the broader themes without displaying any serious engagement with the true material whatsoever. What is disheartening is that they were rewarded for this mode of behavior due to a lack of intervention from my TF. In order for philosophical discussions to be productive, open, and understanding, everyone should have the opportunity to engage with the material, not something that another student has simply pulled out of thin-air without seriously considering. I believe that the fact that many take this course Credit\/D creates this unfortunate consequence as they simply try to get their participation grade without considering how such laziness affects others.",
    "Good lectures, interesting topic for the class.\r\n\r\nSection could have been a bit more organized and readings seemed incidental\/were barely brought up in lecture\/section.",
    "I appreciate the honesty of the grading, but I think that if there were more assignments throughout the semester that I would have seen more development in the skills that the course focuses on.",
    "It's professor and materials were great. The engagement of students during lecture was also good.  Given the tough grading, I think a clearer outline of the expectations would've been benificial.",
    "I gained a basic foundation of the strengths and weaknesses of moral realism and skepticism. The largest weakness was that we never actually made any headway into the content. Because there was so much to learn we were only able to scratch the surface. Moreover, we never actually figured out if moral skepticism was or was not a valid point. In other words, we learned individual theories but not how they overlapped and which position (overall) was stronger.",
    "The subject matter is interesting, the lectures are engaging. However, I feel like the way we cover material is sometimes superficial, or sacrifices breadth over depth to an excessive degree. We tend to go over broad controversies in many of the areas we are discussing, and when we start analyzing arguments, we usually reach a point of \"eh, this looks very complicated, so we will not go into it any longer, but here's a brief outline of what some people think\". This class is great at showing how to get to those complicated points in metaethics. It is lacking in its ability to show how so solve those complications.",
    "Strengths: Clear, interesting lectures from Kagan; good TA'ing. Course is mainly episodic but there are themes and ways of thinking that permeate the course and tie it together nicely.\r\nWeaknesses: Slow grading.",
    "The strength is the discussion section. Thats where you really get the opportunity to explore these ideas yourself. The weakness is that its not really organised in terms of learning.",
    "The material is interesting although it gets a bit predictable. The greatest strength of the course are Shelly Kagans engaging lectures and his high standards for writing. It is only because has high expectations that I was forced to try and meet them. In his class the grade you receive on a paper actually holds meaning and is not inflated and the feedback on the papers is invaluable. Also meeting with the TAs is extremely helpful.",
    "The lectures are interesting, but for people who have never had any exposure to ethics\/philosophy, the class is by no means an intro class. I had to seek a ton of outside help on my own and the TAs were hard to reach\/inaccessible, and also just very busy. Philosophy writing is VERY different and the class is graded EXTREMELY harshly, so without a proper foundation and a lot of outside help, the class is very difficult, even if you put a tremendous amount of work in.",
    "The course is very well designed, and leaves a lot of room for growth and improvement.",
    "well-organised materials and intense discussion\/interaction between prof. kagan and his students not only in lectures but also after class",
    "Strengths: the class covers a lot of material so it feels like you get a survey of the important arguments about morality and it encourages people to come to their own conclusions. Also, if Shelly Kagan is teaching, the lectures are incredibly animated. Additionally, the papers in the class provide great feedback on how to write philosophy well.\r\nWeaknesses: some of the reading is not entirely helpful and the structure\/order of the lectures can be confusing.",
    "Strengths: Clear lectures, and very good introduction to metaethics. Forces you to think and write in a very detailed manner.  Weaknesses: Very very strict grading.",
    "It's a good introductory class for philosophy, especially if you're a STEM major like me who thought it was all bunk anyway and wanted to know what the big deal was. Professor Kagan is an engaging if exaggerated professor, and the course content doesn't presuppose any knowledge of philosophical literature, which is rare among Yale courses. (I'm not sure it would even help much.) \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the workload of the course consists entirely of three papers, and the grading and feedback is so awfully slow that you're pretty much on your own for every paper, despite Professor Kagan's emphasis on improvement over time.",
    "Strength: great TAs. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses, barely pertinent readings, unstructured and unengaging lectures."

   "comments": [
    "If the student is willing to get C's and take the class credit D they should go for it. Shelly is incredible and funny and brilliant. They should also note that it is a very \"meta\" class meaning you're not really talking about moral concepts themselves you are thinking about how we think about morals. The classes get a little repetitive towards the end.",
    "This is a good introduction to philosophical writing and an interesting subject, but could be more rigorous",
    "Enthusiastically. This was a great intro philosophy class and for all of the hype that Prof. Kagan gets about being a harsh grader, the flip side of that is that he (and his TFs) are exquisitely detailed people in terms of feedback. The material was good, the lecturer couldn't be beat.",
    "Only take this if you're genuinely interested in the minutiae of this philosophical subfield as (1) the material is pretty technical and (2) you will likely wind up taking it credit \/ d. Kagan's a good lecturer but often comes unmoored from discussing the \"big picture\", and by the end of the class I had forgotten a lot of what we supposedly covered.\r\nHaving said that, if you are willing to spend a credit\/d it's a very reasonable work load (three 5-page essays) and you'll learn something interesting. I'm also copying my answer from above since I don't think you can see that one on CourseTable:\r\n\r\nThe main strength of the course is that Kagan really knows his field and give a stimulating lecture. His manner is extremely natural and conversational, yet he always knows exactly what he wants to say and can defend his points.

Even rejecting all of these attacks, I was still left without any positive reason to \"be moral\".",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is truly invested in philosophy and thinking about tough, philosophical ideas (in a rewarding way!). I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone who just wants to take a \"Shelly Kagan class\" because the ideas are not as mind-blowing as they are philosophically engaging.",
    "Not unless you are willing to Credit\/D\/Fail it.",
    "Yes, especially for anyone who has ever had genuine doubts about morality or how something like it could exist. Shelly's grading certainly is stricter than most, both with papers and participation, but if that is what's holding you back, you do have the option of taking it Credit\/D. I personally didn't, and I'll find out whether that was the smartest decision, but no matter what I would recommend this course.",
    "depends on if you care more about grading or not\r\nreally dependent on which TA you get how enjoyable the course is",
    "No, you should probably take a different Kagan class unless you have strong interests in metaethical theory. It really isn't as interesting as it seems.",
    "Yes. Kagan is a great lecturer and the course makes you think about morality\/challenges to morality in interesting ways. Take Cr\/d though.",
    "I'd definitely recommend the course if for no other reason than because it was interesting. Definitely changed the way I think about the world which is all I look for in a class. Taking it credit-d was a good idea.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they are SUPER INTERESTED IN MORALITY. I feel like I didn't learn anything that was super concrete or that stuck particularly hard.",
    "If this student is keenly interested in the subject area, then yes, but taking it out of general interest, e.g., because the \"class sounds cool\" might lead to disappointment with the level of depth in the class.",
    "Absolutely, take. I was skeptical coming into this class, but personally I came out very much a realist. I really enjoyed the problems that came up in class. I've also taken Intro Ethics, which dovetails with this.",
    "I would recommend it if you dont want to read the great philosophers that you have probably heard of but want to reason through philosophical arguments from scratch. I highly highly recommend taking it Credit\/D.",
    "Yes for improvement with structured writing.",
    "No, especially if you dont have a strong philosophy background. The class is graded harshly, you dont get a lot of support and instruction regarding writing unless you work very hard to seek it out, and while the lectures are interesting, there are other intro ethics courses out there that you would get a lot more out of.",
    "I'd recommend this course if a) you are really into debates about morality, and b) you want to be graded honestly for once. You talk about the same, narrowish topic for the entire semester. For that reason, if you aren't psyched about morality, I'd imagine this class would be pretty boring for you.",
    "I would, if the student is interested in the material at hand and motivated to reach real, grounded metaethical arguments.",
    "Yes, morality is so important a part of humanity (esp. in this era when AI is said to be taking place of humans) that everyone should take a moment to think critically about it",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are curious about morality or want to challenge their views about it. Shelly Kagan gets the reputation as a tough grader, but many students take it credit\/D and the experience of having such a passionate lecturer is really great.",
    "Yes but you would definitely have to bear in mind that what everyone else said about grading is true. Apart from that, the class is super interesting and engaging. You would definitely learn a lot from Professor Kagan.",
    "It's not a bad choice, though it depends on what you want out of it. I think you'd be best suited for this course if you're a STEM student with strong writing and some patience. If you just need the distributional credit, this probably isn't the class for you.\r\n\r\nSecondary advice: If you're worried about workload, have a look at the course schedule beforehand. By far the toughest parts are the weeks a paper is due; the rest isn't bad at all (the readings don't help much).",
    "No. The harsh grading is real."
