For that reason, I especially appreciated Brett's clarity in lectures and picture-perfect black-board drawings that aided in my understanding of every topic. I now feel much more confident in Calc II topics.",

                "strengths - lots of partner work which was helpful (especially when I was lost). really liked how we talked about the big ideas and what questions we would be answering today, as that kept everything in perspective\r\n\r\nweaknesses - class could move incredibly fast and leave students with little time to take notes and actually engage in the material. I had already learned some of the material in high school, and some of the explanations in this class left me confused (would've had a hard time if it weren't for my previous knowledge).",
                "Strengths: good amount of content, pacing \r\nWeaknesses: classes and professors teach a lot of the theory, but provide very little instruction in how to actually solve problems like students are then assigned",
                "I really liked the \"explorations\" that we had to do for homework. They were an effective way to introduce us to/get us thinking about the concepts we were going to discuss in class the next day and very time efficient. I also like that my teacher held his office hours on Monday-Wednesday, front-loading the week since the problem sets were due on Wednesday. I really liked that we had a chance to do some practice problems (or even just \"polls\") in class before having to do the problems on our own.",
                "I loved the Maths Stories.",
                "I enjoyed the way of teaching. (Every new topic came with an exploration of the new idea before it was explained in class). I would have enjoyed some more guidance on practicing outside of the weekly problem sets.",
                "I thought the course material was very well organized. It was always evident to me what we were learning about and how it tied into a previous piece of material. A huge strength of this course is that practice exams and exam review sessions are offered. If you're a student reading this take advantage of those! One weakness I found was that some ULA's were not as willing to help during office hours. One ULA in particular would work on their own homework while they're supposed to be helping other students and I found that frustrating.",
                "Brett is a great instructor and he made classes very engaging.",
                "I liked how consistent the problem sets were in their difficulty and length, and how approachable Brett was with any questions we had, especially during his many office hours. However, I have heard that Brett is by far the best professor for MATH115 and don't know how much my experience would have been affected by having a different professor, so I wish there was more consistency in the teaching.",
                "A strength is the way that the assignments are set up. Before each class, there are brief homework assignments that introduce students to the material that will be presented the next day. The midterms were also well spaced. One weakness of the course is that the problem sets were due Wednesday night, when we would cover the material needed to complete problems Wednesday morning in class. This meant that it was challenging to get ahead on the psets, as I didnt yet understand the material.",
                "This course moved at a good pace  but the weakness was that the PSETs were way more difficult than the material learned in class. Sometimes, the notes were not help enough, which would force to learn the material through other resources.",
                "Strength: I was able to learn WHY the concepts worked as they did. We learned the background of these complex topics. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish we did more examples in class together.",
                "There was a lot of variance in what the different sections' teachers taught, especially in the convergence tests unit.",
                "Strengths: the Professor is probably one of the most gifted teachers Ive ever seen, and my high school teachers were good teachers.",
                "Strength: there is so much help available whether by peer tutoring or office hours. \r\nWeakness: the lecture style was not as structured as it could have been. Much of my notes were useless when it came to figuring out how to do the homework. Id recommend guided notes/examples that explicitly show how a problem should be done to completion.",
                "The strengths of the course are the array of resources available to students seeking extra support (there are many hours of peer tutoring and office hours available). The weaknesses of the course are that I believe it requires a significant amount of background knowledge of Calculus 2 in order to keep up with the pace of the work.",
                "The course structure was really good. Builds nicely from integration to series then into applications which was good.",
                "It's math, if you don't like math, don't take it. If you do like math, it's pretty fun. Esp if you have Brett.",
                "Strengths: There were a lot of resources provided in this class, including a great network of peer tutors and extended office hours. There is also a lot of review sessions provided before exams that were extremely helpful. \r\nWeaknesses: a lot of the material was difficult and extensive: need to be prepared for extensive work on problem sets and review of class material.",
                "Print out the notes ahead of time for Brett's section.",
                "The strengths is that the course offers aid to the students with many peer tutoring hours but the weakness is that it is very fast paced so it can be easy to become very lost in the class."

Most people aren't out here talking calc just for the heck of it, if you need to take 115 and are dreading it, I recommend trying for Brett's section, as it'll probably make your life a whole lot easier",

The material around series was very difficult for me to grasp but I really enjoyed the first third and the last third of the course. I found the material substantially more difficult than Calculus I so be prepared to work hard if you enroll.",
