    "This course has a lot of individual attention from the professor, which aids learning. Direct feedback in class is very helpful. Sarab is extremely receptive to student questions, and she is patient when explaining topics. The weakness of the course is that you are required to complete daily homework assignments, but you receive no feedback on them."
