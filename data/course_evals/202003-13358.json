Our research took us into democracies, dictatorships, classification systems, electoral\/party systems, and game theory as applied to political science.

                "Strengths: great lectures, highly interesting readings, and awesome sections. Weaknesses: readings could be a bit more challenging and I wish sections got at deeper questions, although this was mostly a byproduct of the philosophy of sections in classes in general, which is to review material",
                "Strengths: Section was really vibrant (shoutout to my TA, Chris) and felt like a seminar environment. The class was very well organized with lots of structure, transparency, and no surprises.",
                "Strengths: I learned a lot. I wish I had taken this course earlier before taking more advanced political science seminars, because it really provided me with a lot of foundational knowledge about many political science concepts. I was able to constantly apply and connect things I learned in this class with my other political science classes. \r\n\r\nWeakness: like any other introductory course, we cover a lot of material, so we don't go into depth into any one specific thing... but I still found it important to learn this breadth of material so worth it I think. Also, grading can be tougher than in other introductory courses in my experience. The readings can be A LOT some weeks.",

                "Strengths: Good balance of papers and readings!\r\nWeaknesses: Synchronous lectures preferred over asynchronous lectures",
                "This course is a great introduction to political science, in my opinion, more so than a solely U.S.-based one. It taught us about political institutions and theories from around the world and different time periods and it taught us how to apply these theories to real-world elections and other events. I think the course could be improved by posting all of the assignment instructions toward the start of the semester so we students have a better understanding of each week's workload.",
                "Strengths: A well-done, well-run introductory political science course. The professor and TFs worked to get students to interact with the material, and I personally found the readings informative and engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures could feel like mere recaps of the readings; at the same time, I understand the most people were not necessarily reading all the readings.",

Dr. Khan also did a great job of allowing for students to participate even in the large live lectures.",
                "Strengths: professor and tfs are amazing, the lectures and course was clearly organized for understanding\r\nWeaknesses: the final was exhausting and brutal as it was writing 12 pages over 4 different topics in 24 hours which required citing and making arguments, the short paper assignments should be taken into consideration in terms of word count\/elements it was difficult to fit everything into the word count",
                "Strengths: organisation, lecture format\r\nWeakness: very (and in my opinion unnecessarily) harsh on the word count.",
                "The content in this course touches upon many key principles that give students a well-formed understanding of comparative politics. Our discussion sections were extremely helpful in translating readings into critical and active thought.",
                "Strengths: the professor and TFs seemed genuinely very interested in hearing feedback for the course and were willing to make changes based on the feedback received. The weekly topics covered felt very interrelated and build on each other well. Weaknesses: there is a lot of dense and dry textbook reading sometimes involving economic or game theory models, and the expectations and grading for papers are not well explained. Feedback on papers was also very limited. Also, some of the writing prompts were a bit difficult to answer because they implicitly required students to have a strong understanding of American politics and trends (3-4 of the assignments required students to reflect on the topic we learned about for the week and apply it to American politics).",
                "the take-home final was arduous. essentially involved writing several essays, which took pretty much all day. In the middle of finals period who has time to devote a whole day to one test.",
                "The strengths are the teachers, the weaknesses are the overwhelming quantity of information and the variety of sources, which sometimes - but not too often - did not allow for enough exploration.",
                "This class is a great survey of the field. I wish we could have spent more time on each aspect of the field, though I realize that's what later courses are for.",
                "I think the course was very good in engaging current events.",
                "I enjoyed the content of the course but I wish we had gone deeper into the topics and learned about more case studies.",
                "This course went incredibly far in depth. At the end of every week, I had an incredible amount of knowledge on every aspect of whatever we learned that week. Each week would consist of work that taught the topic, only to be accompanied by additional resources that explain a real application of the topic. An area of improvement could be more transparency on, specifically, the reflection papers. I think I didn't quite understand what was required from them, and I thought I did, but towards the end of the semester I had a conversation with my TA about it and everything became really clear after that. This obviously isn't too big of a complaint - if anything, it's complimenting the transparency of the TAs - but it would've just been helpful if instructions on the reflection papers were clearer.",
                "Professor Khan is excellent but the class structure made engagement difficult in these trying times.",
                "This course was interesting, engaging, and approachable  and Professor Khan was great  but it could have benefited from fewer readings. At times, I felt as though we lacked sufficient time to explore each topic.",
                "Strengths: great weekly lectures\r\nWeaknesses: final was way too incredibly long, dense info",
                "I think the responsiveness and ample feedback of Professor Khan and the TFs was definitely a strong suit. As the course progressed, Professor Khan adjusted the material load and readings as necessary, added in things where she saw fit and cut down where there was too much to handle. Also, the diversity of the material was great. The weekly materials were not restricted solely to the textbook or academic journals, but branched into opinion articles, documentaries, Youtube videos, and NPR podcasts, which made it very enjoyable. The prerecorded lectures were also very helpful in breaking down the textbook material, and the discussion section was a nice forum to discuss and ask questions in a smaller group setting. Overall, I think this class was very well structured and made the best of the situation, all while finding a nice balance of challenging and manageable.",
                "Sections were interesting and fun. \r\n\r\nThe lectures just repeated what was in the readings for the most part.",
                "The course did an excellent job at presenting a wide range of topics. I think it suffered a bit from its breadth, though. There was not much discussion of case studies, and instead we focused on specific aspects or standards of government. Although the independent papers compensated for this to a certain extent by encouraging students to conduct their own research, some form of class discussion of specific case studies would have been very beneficial.",
                "The reading material was often dense and not always the easiest to follow. I found it a bit difficult to relate material to certain countries we were discussing without a full overview of that country first. In other words, this course assumes a lot of knowledge of political history in other countries. it's not necessarily necessary to know information about other countries, but the course was a bit bland when I could not follow our discussions because I did not know the history of a country that we were discussing.",
                "The professor was always prepared and chose amazing readings. The TF's were also amazing and facilitated great discussions. However, sometimes the discussions were circular (everyone agreed with everyone) and did not seem immediately helpful to uncovering different perspectives, however the course overall had incredible information",
                "Strengths: the lectures were very informative and the TF\/Professor Khan was always helpful and clear. They adapted the course as the semester went on based on student needs, while still maintaining a clear structure and rubric. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there was a lot to cover so we couldn't review it all in section. The final exam was very lengthy. Readings could be a little long and numerical without any of the stats\/numbers explained.",
                "I wish it had gone a little more in depth about specific countries to exemplify some of the concepts. At the same time I like that we covered a lot of topics and briefed many countries.",
                "Strengths: solid professor and TFs, very interesting content, very fair grading\r\nWeaknesses: can take a bit for assignments to get graded (not a ridiculously long time tho), and the class wasn't super interactive beyond the discussion sections (Zoom university made that difficult of course)",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Wide range of topics covered with more than sufficient detail without being overwhelming\r\n- Assignments (discussion questions, reflection pieces, essays) very useful in synthesizing and applying information\r\n- Enjoyable and highly informative reading material makes this an excellent introductory course \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Essay feedback not very detailed\r\n- Recorded lectures sometimes repetitive (often they summarize the reading -- though, that makes them good review, so this is just a minor weakness).",
                "Strengths: good theoretical base \r\nWeaknesses: too many assignments",
                "The course was well organised. The lectures were interesting and the right length, and there was ample time to discuss and engage with the topic.",
                "I thought the asynchronous lectures split up into two per week was a great way to adapt to the pandemic. I also had a great TA, Chris Chambers, who was super helpful.",
                "Strengths: The professor and TFs were all very knowledgable, helpful, and kind. The course covered a broad range of topics but connected them to one another really well and always gave concrete examples\/case studies. The variety of source types and assignments also kept the class interesting. Weakness: The discussion sections filled up very quickly which made it difficult to find one at a reasonable time."

                "The teaching team's flexibility and understanding of student circumstances was extremely helpful. This was one of the few classes that actually made realistic\/compassionated accommodations for students taking classes at home. I would have appreciated more live virtual lectures from the professor, but this is only a minor thing. At first, the discussion sections didn't use power points, which was confusing at times. I appreciated it when we started using power points in the discussion sections. It would also be helpful if these power points were posted online or shared to the people who went to the section.",
                "Synchronous lectures were not as engaging as they could've been since the professor explicitly told us not to turn cameras on, which I think was a mistake and made it harder for me to focus.",
                "The asynchronous recorded lectures were great. \r\n\r\nI wish we had used the hands-up feature in section instead of calling on the next speaker. I thought it was a much easier function, and had made my other classes feel more organized, and more encouraging to participate.",
                "Liked having both recorded lectures and live lectures. Would have preferred more consistency in the structure of live lectures.",
                "The recorded lectures were helpful so we could always refer back to those and watch them again even if we did not watch them before class.

                "The use of both synchronous and asynchronous lecture styles created a great balance. The final exam format was pretty reasonable and the time window was accommodating. One thing that could be improved was the microphone device that was used to record Professor Khan's lectures. The quality was not great and sometimes the audio was really uncomfortable to listen to because the mic would pick up on sharp sounds as she spoke.",
                "The asynchronous lectures worked really well. Professor Khan is very good about presenting information in an organized cohesive way, and the lectures helped me make sense of the more complicated readings.",
                "Both the recorded and live lectures were engaging and well-paced. The discussion section was difficult over Zoom, though I don't think anything would change that.",
                "I enjoyed the pre recorded lectures because they were clear and concise. The live lectures were also good.",
                "This course was the most accomodating in terms of the pandemic. A majority of the content was recorded, so wifi issues didn't hinder my ability to participate in the course. The recorded lectures and heavy reading were incredibly helpful, allowing me to juggle the spontaneity of my personal life and also learn the material of the course. I genuinely can't imagine any way Professor Khan's practices could have been improved.",
                "The combination of recorded and live lectures simulated a classroom environment well while providing much needed flexibility. I really enjoyed how Professor Khan used our asynchronous sessions to introduce new topics and then invited us to discuss them together during synchronous sessions.",
                "Wish there was more discussion to make this more engaging of a course",
                "The discussion sections were great, allowing for that more personal connection with classmates and creating a smaller group setting to further process and question the week's material.

                "Absolutely! It is a great introduction to comparative politics, and truly gives you a broad overview of the different sub-categories in the field.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes! I learned so much and the professor and teaching fellows were very considerate given the circumstances of the world at the moment. Material was even more interesting given it was an election year and we were in the middle of a global pandemic.",
                "Yes, but be aware of the workload.",
                "Yes, a solid intro\/foundation for poli sci majors.",
                "Yes, it was very interesting and well-organized to facilitate learning; however, the high workload would easily dissuade some students.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in political science and hasn't taken any other courses in the discipline. A very good survey course that provides opportunities for students to research topics that interest them (big plus!).",
                "Absolutely. Khan is a great professor who cares a lot about her students and puts a lot of time into putting together lectures, syllabi, and discussion sections. This showed in just how interesting the readings were and how clear the lectures flowed. It never once felt like class was unstructured or disorganized. Also, learning about comparative politics was extremely interesting, granted this was my first exposure ever to the domain and to non-domestic politics at all. Honestly every Yale student should take this class. Just a really excellent survey course, and Khan sets the standard for running such a class.",
                "Yes! Well organized and interesting introductory course for political science\/global affairs or anything politics related without too much work.",
                "I would recommend only to political science majors. If you are a political science major, you probably should take this class to gain insight into a lot of the basic concepts you need to understand before taking higher level courses. I am a political science major and I am glad I took it; I came out with a solid grasp on politics and have a general, but complex understanding of many concepts. \r\n\r\nIf you are not a political science major, then I would suggest just take a higher level seminar that might be more interesting and focused on a specific topic you might want to learn about.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Really valuable introduction to the way politics operate around the world.",
                "Yes, this course is a useful introductory course for those who are interested in Political Science or related fields. It was a universal course that could be taken by first-years or older students all the same.",
                "I would recommend this course! I think it's a really helpful way of looking at the world, and interpreting how we feel about foreign affairs and foreign institutions as Americans.",
                "I would, regardless of their field of study, if they're interested in politics. It's less about debating ideologies and more so studying government institutions, though, so they should keep that in mind.",
                "Depending on their major and background, maybe. It was very theoretical and I would have preferred less social justice topics being infused into the course.",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in learning about political science from a more objectively scientific perspective.",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely. I enjoyed this course tremendously, and found Dr. Khan to be an excellent and engaging professor. I would highly recommend this course.",
                "yes! just take into account the assignments",
                "Yes, I would if you are interested in different electoral and party systems, regime types and the actual differences between political institutions around the world and whether or not these differences lead to better\/worse outcomes",
                "No",
                "I would recommend it if you want to understand how different regimes emerge and function across the world. This course provides a strong foundation for people who want to learn and gain perspectives on how different governments work.",
                "Maybe. If someone has a vested interest in learning about government organization and the relationships between citizens and government structures, then yes. 3-4 of the writing assignments required students to apply the topics we learned during a particular week to a trend or event in American current events, so they required students to be pretty familiar with American politics\/government. Some of the papers may feel more difficult and less accessible to students without a strong base of knowledge to draw upon and make connections to. Also, some of the ideas presented in this class felt very generalized and broad, which was a bit frustrating. However, the class does a very good job forming connections and building on material covered in past weeks, and there were a number of really cool readings. I feel like I walked away from the class with a much stronger understanding of government and power in a way that feels relevant to the present day.",
                "sure, it's a solid course. if youve taken comparative in high school you won't find anything too groundbreaking, but it's a good course with some interesting readings and discussions.",
                "Yes. This is a great intro and very well done.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to study comparative politics in the future. Even for students not into social science, this course connects poli sci to the real world exceptionally well.",
                "Yes, absolutely! It's a wonderful introduction to the field of comparative politics, and will allow you to gain a more profound perspective of the world around you.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. Professor Khan is great about explaining things clearly and concisely.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It was engaging and in-depth, forcing me to learn about a variety of new concepts and apply them to current events and current practices.",

                "Yes",
                "Unless you have an interest in comparative politics, I would say no. The readings are extremely dry, the textbook is difficult to navigate, and the lectures that Professor Khan created were basically copied and pasted from the textbook, meaning they weren't much help either. So unless you find a way to interact with the material more in-depth, take another comp gov course.",
                "Yes, I think this was a good introduction course. The material can be challenging at times, but there are plenty of resources and people available to aid you in understanding.",
                "Yes, it was very interesting to me.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course. I found the material extremely interesting, even when lectures were not the best. If you are interested in politics or political science, this is a great introduction course. I also had a great TF who gave valuable feedback and was very knowledgeable on the subject material.",
                "Honestly, I would recommend that other students take more specific classes in the political science department. Although I was very interested in certain topics, we never really explored them in depth because there were just too many topics to discuss. This is natural for an intro class, but seemed tedious, especially when other political science classes provide basic grounding of concepts.",
                "If you need it for a requirement, then yes. It is also great as a foundational political science course. But you have to be interested in the topic for the course to be engaging. Otherwise it is easy to fall behind and it'd be a waste of time.",
                "Yes, it was a good intro course for political science.",
                "YES!! Take this class! The professor is amazing and the readings give you an incredibly expansive global perspective that is truly fascinating",
                "Yes, it's a good intro course and helps you understand if you want to be a political scientist.",
                "Yes. Great for political science majors especially. Covers a lot of topics that are integral to development and running of a country politically.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! The content I learned was fascinating, it was a solid introduction to writing college-level polisci essays (and to reading academic texts), the workload was not overwhelming, and the grading was VERY fair (the average grades for essays seemed to be around a high B+ or low A-, and that's not even factoring in the participation grade). If you're looking for a great intro-level polisci course, take this one!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Even for those not planning on doing anything related to politics, understanding how the state works, unlearning some common assumptions re: democracies and dictatorships, and learning about electoral systems will be immensely useful for anyone living under a government. I think it's important, especially for people living in democracies (and thus have the power and I would argue duty to shape the government), to know how power flows through and between political institutions because they affect us all.",
                "Yes if they want a broad introduction to theoretical foundation",
                "Yes, this is a brilliant course. It covers a good range of topics and looks at a diverse range of real life examples that compliment the theory.",
                "yes",
                "Yes! This is the best introductory political science class I have taken at Yale. Professor Khan is a great professor and incorporated a wide range of perspectives and sources into the course, which was refreshing and interesting. The workload is significant enough that you have to stay engaged but it's still manageable."
