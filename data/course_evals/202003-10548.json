Additionally, I was able to learn more about other Latin American cultures and their traditions through in-class assignments and through the students in the course.",
                "I developed a better grasp of both reading and writing the Spanish language.",

I also had a lot of opportunity to connect with my heritage as a Spanish-language speaker who feels somewhat disconnected from being Latino. I did a final project for this course on Celia Cruz and the information I gained allowed me to connect with my father over salsa music and our common identity. That is something quite precious. This course is about discovering oneself through the language.",

                "Strengths: Good feedback, friendly atmosphere, amazing professor, good pace\r\nWeaknesses: Class goes over a lot and could benefit from being longer",
                "The strengths were that there was a variety of assignments. There were assignments more research-based while some others were more creative writing. Each quiz also focused on a different skill which was very helpful. The format of the lessons was very helpful as well. The grade distribution was fair. Weaknesses probably include not enough time on some assignments.",
                "Strengths: the professor was very helpful and willing to go over lessons again in order to ensure that students understand the material. Additionally, the professor provided plenty of detailed feedback on essays and other assignments to ensure that students are able to learn from past mistakes on assignments and improve the next time. Weaknesses: due to the transition to online learning, some online components of the class did not always work. or maybe were not as successful as they could have been.",
                "The course is very strong in striking a great balance of whole class lecture and small group discussion\/activities. I always felt that I was able to both learn in class and put to practice what was being taught to us.",
                "Strengths: Sybil Alexandrov. She is a darling. Incredibly sweet, very kind, and very understanding. Knows how to give students enough distance to learn how to function in the language. I felt she always believed in me, even when I doubted myself (that is, constantly).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course does not presuppose a lot of knowledge of the language, but the lack of structure (because everyone comes from different places) means one has to be hands-on in speaking practice, learning vocabulary, etc. I found that incredibly difficult. Also, doing this over Zoom did not help in terms of fatigue. The course is also heavy on small assignments, which is overwhelming if you are taking a very heavy courseload (I took six courses this semester). I wish there was a lot more guidance about vocabulary and speaking practice, because I found the lack of it really, really upsetting at times. That said, the course is great, but if you need a lot of help in Spanish, it may be a bit of a mismatch.",
                "Strengths- \r\n~homework blended really well with lectures and elements from the class\r\n~Professor was incredibly kind and very responsive to emails \r\n~assignements did not take much time \r\n\r\nWeaknesses-\r\n~quizzes would take longer than the time allotted to do them\r\n~sometimes there would have to be a lot of outside studying, but that seems standard for language classes"

Additionally, in-class presentations on Google Drive were also very helpful, especially if instructor feedback was provided before the class. The practices that could be improved on were Perusall, as students often would highlight the same passages and questions sometimes became repetitive, and weekly vocabulary assignments, since after a week or two, students had to rely on finding words that maybe weren't going to be used in their everyday conversations in Spanish.",
                "The virtual activities through use of google slides was very effective, as well as the interactive components such as hyperlinks to other sites and documents. I also loved the breakout room usage through zoom.",
                "The breakout rooms were an excellent choice and allowed students to speak the language. More aggressive monitoring would be better, though. I had peers who would sometimes speak English and this was often distracting, especially for someone who does not use Spanish very much and wanted to practice. Online assessments were good, but I generally found them more puzzling than anything. It was hard to see the point of the tests, and I didn't take them all that seriously because they weren't presented as such."

Additionally, the class also provides a strong sense of community among Spanish-speakers from various Latin American communities, which also makes for a more enjoyable learning environment.",
                "This course was absolutely amazing. Professor Alexandrov has created a robust curriculum that allows for frequent learning and practice. This course is best suited for heritage speakers wishing to refine their Spanish speaking and writing ability. As a native Spanish speaker, I certainly enhanced my Spanish language ability.",
                "I definitely would. Sybil Alexandrov is a fantastic professor, one of the best language instructors I have had at Yale. She is amazing to work with, but the class can be more structured in terms of vocabulary acquisition and speaking practice. This is not the best fit if you need a lot of the former. It was certainly doable for me, but it required more attention\/self-direction than I was able to give it\/realized, since I had never taken a language class that demands such self-direction before. Sybil Alexandrov gives so many resources, but you have to use them.",
                "Yes! The class created a great space for heritage speakers to learn whilst also using our previous knowledge in Spanish."
