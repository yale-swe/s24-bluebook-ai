I also learned how to identify fossils and, through the final project, how to plan and carry out my own experiment over the course of several months.",
                "I learned all about various taphonomic, biostratinomic, and diagenetic processes and how they affect the overall fossilization of organisms. I gained some experience in paleontology research.",

                "The class was great, but I would have liked the opportunity to get more feedback throughout the course. Working on my own project was a great opportunity, but I sometimes felt that it came at the expense of reviewing other concepts from class.",
                "I thought the class was well organized and enjoyed the format of lectures + project. The lack of sit-down midterm/final exams took a lot of pressure off of understanding every little detail of some complicated topics and allowed us to focus more on the semester-long project. The only downside to the midterm paper + final project format is that you don't get much feedback on your work throughout the semester unless you ask for it.",
                "This was a very informative course.  I would simply hope that in the future there was more constructive feedback before going into a final grade.",
                "Professor Briggs is incredible! He is extraordinarily knowledgeable and is a great teacher and mentor. He is patient and non-condescending, and clearly wants us all to learn and enjoy the material. A major strength was the semester-long project where we got to apply material from the class to a particular specimen or research question, which was invaluable for really understanding the course. I can't really think of any particular weaknesses, except that the lectures could be long sometimes, but even that was well broken up with discussion.",
                "This is an amazing course. The two major components of this class are both extremely strong: two content-packed, well-organized lectures a week from Derek Briggs, the world-class expert in exceptional preservation, and a semester-long project in which every student produces original research. These projects are conceived, designed, and executed by the students, with the help of very supportive mentors (Professor Briggs, graduate students, post-docs) so that everyone is personally invested in producing science they are proud of. Professor Briggs's lecture style encourages students to think and to participate by identifying fossils and proposing potential solutions to scientific problems in the literature.",
                "The primary weakness I saw was that students often had a hard time engaging in class when Professor Briggs would ask a question. I think it was a rather intellectually intimidating environment, which stopped many people from contributing the thoughts they had. I think the course would be much more exciting if there was more student discussion and problem-solving, as this was, in my opinion, the highlight of the lecture class when it happened. The questions Briggs would ask and the answers he was expecting were difficult, even if straightforward, as they always required some synthesis of information. It was immensely satisfying to consider the evidence before me and correctly conclude what was going on. I think this engagement is really important for students to learn how to look at the material like a proper paleontologist would.",
                "I cannot think of any weaknesses for the course!",
                "Excellent course. Professor Briggs is a great lecturer, all slides and lessons were carefully put together with lots of specimens pulled from Peabody for us to examine. Material covered is extensive but youre not expected to absorb absolutely everything. The final project is the highlight of the class and Briggs gives plenty of advising."

                "I would recommend this class to those who need a greater look into evolution of life.",
                "Absolutely!!! It wouldn't be very interesting to someone who's not an EPS major/paleo track/interested in the finer details of paleontology (most of the class was majoring in either paleo or geology). For someone who is interested, I can't recommend it enough. Professor Briggs is absolutely incredible, and the material is so interesting and will help you really understand preservation processes.",
                "Absolutely-- do not miss the chance to take it if you can.",
                "Absolutely, but only if you are interested in how fossilization occurs rather than what biological information we find in the fossil record. While we did cover many fascinating ancient organisms, their biology and interactions with their environment were never the focus of the material, so a student expecting otherwise would probably be disappointed with this course. Also, I think it's important for any student taking this class to be sure they want to commit to a semester-long research project. It is a lot of work and if you are not invested in it, you will be bored and probably consider it a waste of time. For anyone who is interested in taphonomy and wants to do research in paleontology, this is an incredible course to take - Professor Briggs has been at the forefront of taphonomy research for decades, and I really can't imagine a better opportunity to learn this material.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
                "Absolutely, both if you have a paleontology interest or if youre in the major/an adjacent major and want to explore paleontology."
