                "I have taken French every day for the past 7 years, and my language skills have never grown as much as they have in this course. The rapid timeline set forth, and the effort students must give, creates an environment of accelerated learning. My oral fluency has grown quite a bit, as has my aural comprehension-- something I had always struggled with. The course also goes in depth on grammar and idiomatique grammar, which also helps to create fluency.",
                "French reading comprehension and new grammatical concepts, as well as extension of concepts and grammatical structures that I had studied in previous semesters of French. There were lots of opportunities for speaking, writing, and reading practice.",

                "My French improved greatly thanks to this course. Having class for two hours every day, not to mention the daily reading and grammar assignments, means that you're pretty much as close to immersion in the language as you could be without actually going to a Francophone country. My speaking and listening skills probably improved the most, but my understanding of more nuanced points of grammar and idiomatic expressions increased too, as did my skill at reading and writing French.",
                "I practiced my reading, writing, and listening skills by taking the course. This course also helped me improve my French speaking by encouraging me to formulate more complicated arguments in French.",
                "Improved my french grammar, speaking, listening and writing. I also learned some useful expressions and phrases in french.",
                "Using french grammar in literary context, more than just memorizing conjugations, reading and discussing french books and stories, vocabulary. Focus on stories not just from France but across the Francophone world."

            "comments": [
                "I felt that the class time itself focused too greatly on the stories we read, and the grammar was secondary. I felt that this could have been better balanced, as the tests/quizzes were all focused on the grammar, which we would spend minimal class time on. We often had to learn the grammar ourselves at night, and wait two days before it would be covered in class, which could be a little confusing. However, as a student, I enjoyed the class discussions on the stories and felt it was a good change from 120 and 130. Also, Prof. Ngame is an excellent teacher and such a nice guy. You could tell he is actually excited to teach students French. I wish our grades had been posted at any time during the course though -- there were frequently missing grades, and we could not see our actual percentage grade at all, so if you wanted to drop the class or get a real assessment on how you were doing, it was nearly impossible.",
                "I would've preferred spending less time on \"La Symphonie Pastorale\" and more time on \"Un Sac de Billes\" given how much longer the second book was. That said, I appreciated the variety of readings and the clear connection between that week's reading and the associated grammar. No matter what, I see how challenging it is to fit a full semester into 5 weeks, so anyone going into this class should be aware that you will be constantly learning new material without a ton of time to solidify it. That timeline isn't necessarily a strength or a weakness, but something to be very clear about when setting your expectations for a summer class.",
                "A lot of focus on grammar work, which was VERY helpful!",
                "meets everyday for 2 hours so goes quickly - sometimes feels like youre playing catch up constantly. hard to avoid because its only 5 weeks but be prepared to handle the pace",
                "I love the wide range of texts from a number of different french-speaking  countries.  If I had feedback, I think it was sometimes a little difficult to find answer keys on the website, which I find particularly important because without them I have no idea if I'm just reinforcing bad habits, but that would be my only critique.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is in its consistent workload: the daily work succeeded in facilitating learning and a more nuanced understanding of the language. On top of that, the workload and material was genuinely interesting: FR140 draws material from a broader range of the Francophone world, which is to say, a lot of the readings are not simply written by white French men but rather authors, male and not, from across the French diaspora, from countries such as Vietnam, Senegal, Morocco, etc, and these readings don't simply check a proverbial \"diversity box\" but are really interesting and say a lot about French history, modern French identity, and issues like race and colonialism on the whole. Finally, one last strength of this course was in its teaching: Professor Ngame is a kind, dedicated, and skilled teacher.\r\nThe one weakness that really struck me in this course was the last unit, wherein students are expected to read ~80 pages of \"Un Sac de Billes\" per night, on top of studying for the final exam. Granted, there's less grammar work in this week, but the amount of reading was still somewhat ridiculous; we barely covered the material in class, and I would guess that not many students, myself included, did all or even, say, half of the reading.",
                "The course offered opportunities for us to engage in both small and large group discussions. There was also plenty of time for us to pose questions about the course content, which I really appreciated.",
                "The course material was interesting. The books and movies were varied and so there was a wide range of topics. I did realise that a lot of the material centred around identity and family.",
                "Strengths - consistent coursework that builds all the skills we were evaluated on, pretty clear sense of how you were doing because of the constant quizzes and tests. Professor Ngame is very engaging and understanding of the students, made the 2 hours go by quickly.\r\nWeaknesses - large coursework, some days would be many hours, some days less, hard to keep up with if you were taking other classes or had a job over the summer. Similar to other French courses in this way. Sometimes it was confusing to know what homework was for what day as the canvas page assignments didn't match exactly the syllabus."

                "I absolutely would. My French grew a lot in this course, and I enjoyed taking it in the summer, because I could put all my energy and brain stamina into the course. Taking French every day during the semester can be such a drag, so being able to solely focus on the course this summer was great.",
                "If you are looking for an intense French experience for 5 weeks of your summer, I would definitely recommend this course. It is a shockingly efficient way to cover a semester's worth of French material and stay fresh over the summer before continuing in the French department (or getting through your language requirement, as it seemed like many people in the class were doing as well). Time will tell how well I actually learned and internalized the material; I definitely spent the whole 5 weeks feeling like I was in cramming mode because of how quickly summer courses move. If you're looking for a strong and unhurried foundation for future French studies, I might not recommend this course.",
                "Yes, Monsieur Ngame is a very good professor.",
                "yes, if youd like to move through the language sequence quickly. if youre working an intense summer job, maybe not.",
                "Yes -- it is an excellent way to further knowledge and proficiency in French, and I think the diverse range of texts used is particularly important to be exposed to.",
                "I would! While I did it, probably like most other students, to complete my language requirement, I also genuinely enjoyed the material and feel like I learned a lot. The workload can be daunting, sure, but I think that it's doable and certainly worth it for the amount that your French will improve, should you put in the time.",
                "I would definitely recommend, because it is a good opportunity to not only study French but also gain insights into French culture. The class is also overall very supportive and boost my motivation to learn.",
                "I would! It's a great way to learn, practice and improve all facets of your french.",
                "I would recommend the summer course version of this class, Professor Ngame is a great teacher to have, and the class is fairly immersive. However it is a large time commitment, mainly because the class has been shortened to 5 weeks, so I would be wary if you're doing a lot at the same time."
