                "Greatly increased my abilities in understanding and participating in conversational spanish, reading and writing in spanish, and learning about certain cultural elements",
                "To be honest I do not feel that I gained very much from this course compared to Spanish 130. Many of the readings and movies we watched were very interesting, but I think having more of a conversation-based class would improve Spanish speaking skills more.",
                "In this class, I was able to refine my writing, speaking, and reading skills in Spanish. We did this through class discussions where we analyzed Spanish literature, movies, and art.",
                "I learned so much Spanish from this course--I learned how to read, write, speak, and listen in Spanish. Most importantly, I think this course did an amazing job at making us comfortable holding conversations spontaneously in Spanish, and Professor Sanchez Walker was a very enthusiastic and kind professor."

                "Strengths - encourages participation, feels very comfortable in class\r\nWeaknesses - some homework assignments felt tedious and unproductive",
                "The use of computers for so much of the class was detrimental. Everyone was distracted and I saw many students use ChatGPT to answer questions in class. I think the class should be restructured away from Jamboard and toward a fully discussion-based class.",
                "Strengths: The environment feels very open and inviting to speak with my classmates in Spanish. The number one priority, especially from my teacher Noelia, was that we as students improved our Spanish by speaking with each other. This put less pressure on doing something a certain way and genuinely just focusing on improving my Spanish. Weakness: The class could be organized a little differently. It feels very repetitive having a new Jamboard each day to lead our discussions.",
                "I loved how Professor Sanchez Walker approached each project and assignment as a learning experience, as well as how patient she was with our speaking. She always made us feel comfortable and welcome, which is always needed in a language class where speaking is the first priority. She also went over all the content with us and always made sure we understood what we were doing, and there was always time for questions. I honestly cannot think of any weaknesses at the moment."

                "I would with my professor. She was great at facilitating conversation, encouraging participation, and creating a comfortable and non-intimidating environment",
                "Honestly no unless you need to take it for L5. I think Spanish skills would be more improved by immersive discussion with other learners.",
                "Yes! I think this class is great to take to improve your Spanish speaking, writing, and reading skills. I would especially recommend taking the class with Noelia because the environment in her classroom is very open and inviting for students to learn through making mistakes.",
                "Yes (especially with Professor Sanchez Walker)! It is a very fun and welcoming environment to develop your Spanish skills in, and I personally know that I improved in my Spanish so much over the course of the semester."
