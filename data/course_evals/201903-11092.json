   "comments": [
    "I gained quite novel knowledge about the history of science and religion and their relationship, discovering that most of what I had learned in school and through popular media about this topic is myth.",
    "We learned about the relationship between science and religion from the middle ages up into the modern era, with each week honing in on a different religious tradition or group. The course is my mind equal parts history and philosophy: our class discussions talked both about the historical contexts for these relationships as well as our own opinions in the 21st century looking back on these relationships. The final paper was extremely open-ended, allowing students to write about science and religion from whatever perspective they desired. Students could write about a topic that wasn't discussed yet in class or elaborate further with their own opinion on subjects we discussed.",
    "I gained knowledge of historical eras and subjects I had not studied previously.",
    "I learned an in-depth overview of the intertwining of science and religion throughout history, and among different cultures. I truly appreciated how the syllabus veered away from the Western."

   "comments": [
    "The class discussions are always very interesting and engaging, as well as intellectually challenging. \r\nMost of the readings were super interesting, but a few felt dense and unnecessary.",
    "Strengths: interesting topics, great job not focusing too heavily on any specific religion or tradition, great historical knowledge, very knowledgable and friendly professor, good feedback on writing, open-ended final paper.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes it was difficult to know what the professor wanted for a specific topic. For instance, it was often hard to know for the presentation what elements of the readings were most important to discuss \/ what Professor Dal Prete wanted to focus more on. That said, he let us discuss certain elements we found interesting in greater depth.",
    "This course was organized by topic, all of which were different and interesting in their own way. The class periods themselves were left largely unstructured, depending on whether a student was leading the class that day. The professor always had myriad knowledge to share on whatever discussions came up.",
    "I'd love to see even more non-Western subjects within this course, because I found those the most enlightening."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are interested in the topic it is fascinating and intellectually stimulating! The reading load is quite heavy (100-130 pages per week), but most of it is quite engaging material! The workload in general is very manageable - 4 submissions of 600 words throughout the semester on class dates of your choice, 1 class presentation, and one final paper (10-15 pp).",
    "Absolutely! If you're interested in learning more about why science and religion aren't necessarily always opposing forces, this is 100% the course for you. Also a great choice if you just want to have some great discussions.",
    "I definitely would! I learned an entirely new perspective on science and religion, something I'll carry throughout my life."
