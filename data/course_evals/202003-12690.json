We did spend a short period of time covering Puerto Rican histories as well as Central American histories. The class sadly makes no mention at all of South American histories.",

Also, this was the first time that I've designed a (hypothetical) museum exhibit, which was cool!",

                "I learned about the history of Latinx peoples in the U.S. from 1848 to present-day around the southwest, the northeast, and Puerto Rico. By reading really informative and well-crafted books on different topics\/time periods\/populations every week, I learned about history as a discipline and its methodologies and limitations. I also learned so much about different tensions and issues about a history that I did not know about at all. Prof. Pitti really helped contextualize the books we read by inviting the books' authors to our Zoom class, showing related videos and materials, and helping us navigate databases to find more information on that week's topic.",

Not a textbook course; rather, you learn selected histories (e.g. Puerto Ricans and state violence, or indigenous labor organizing in the US South) that give specific and broader insights into the history of Latinx people in the US (and other LA nations) from 1840-ish to present. How to analyze history from the grassroots, rather than top-down.",

We also learned about immigrant communities from Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Cuba. Additionally, the assignments stressed historical methodology and primary source analysis, which was especially insightful for history majors, though likely useful for all students. I also enjoyed the readings' focus on oral histories and the uncovering of often erased\/ ignored histories more broadly.",

                "The traditional essay assignments offered in this course were different than the standard paper because the rubrics called for more description and flexibility with prose. In other words, the instructors allowed students to play with their writing voice in a way that worked with academic writing while encouraging deep and complex research topics. An example of this is the final Museum Exhibit project, which was a research assignment but the focus of this paper was to (re)imagine the presentation of history through a museum exhibit. Thus, research and creative writing merged in this unique assignment.",
                "This class provides the opportunity to gain more skills in the deep analysis of literature and the exploration of past events\/history that still impact us to this day. The weekly readings forced me to learn how to read large pieces of texts in a short amount of time, while still understanding what the author is trying to show us. The weekly discussion posts, while sometimes frustrating (to come up with something to write), were encouraging for active participation in each week's book and in sections.",

            "comments": [
                "Weakness: Book per week; I had to rush some readings, so I feel guilty. A lot of Mexican-focused content.\r\nStrengths: TA's, content, Professor Pitti",
                "The course itself was very interesting and covered a variety of subjects, ranging from the history of Spanish in the United States to Puerto Rican student protests. The readings we completed tended to be interesting and generated fruitful discussion in class. I appreciated having Professor Pitti invite the authors of several books we read to class. The final project, which consisted of creating an exhibit proposal, was also one of the highlights of the class. While the assignments themselves were not too burdensome, the reading is this class was excessive. Having students read a 200-300 page book a week, while it allowed us to delve into the topics covered, was quite unreasonable, particularly in the middle of a pandemic. Shortening the readings, or at least suggesting that students focus on a particular section, would have led to more cohesive and productive discussions overall. The structure of the class was also a bit confusing and at times frustrating. This class is NOT a seminar. It is very much a small lecture, the only difference being that sections were built into class time. I found myself having very limited interactions with students outside of my section and Professor Pitti. While TAs for this class were absolutely wonderful, it was also a bit weird to see one group have Professor Pitti as their section leader. Clearer guidance would have also been helpful when completing the course assignments, particularly our primary source analysis.",
                "ALOT of reading, it's a little unrealistic to expect 300+ pages of reading a week when students are taking several other courses",
                "A strength of this course is that we are split into discussion sections, giving us the opportunity to be more engaged with the topics being discussed, contribute to discussion more frequently, and have a tighter-knit learning community. A weakness of this course is that the number of pages assigned for reading each week (mostly entire books) is not necessarily feasible and it makes discussions less specific due to the fact that in an attempt to cover everything we read, we talk about the books more broadly. It would be more beneficial to read specific chapters from the books.",
                "Strengths: Prof Pitti and the TAs were amazing. They were really understanding during the election and any other hard things going on. They truly care about the students. The discussions and books were also overall very rewarding and insightful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the lectures were a bit too long as well as the readings. I thought when we were given specific chapters to focus on, they felt more manageable.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Pitti and the TAs were all great, kind, understanding of the difficulties of this semester, and super excited about making sure we got a lot out of the class. The readings were fascinating and the final project of putting together a museum exhibit was a lot of fun. Weaknesses: quite a bit of reading but towards the end we were told to focus on certain chapters which was really nice.",
                "This course was thorough, thoughtfully designed, and fun. \r\nWhile I appreciate the idea of focusing on a book each week, it felt a little unreasonable (and unrealistic) for a lecture course, during COVID especially. Giving more focused readings, or at least highlighting areas of important within assigned books, would likely have fostered more engaging conversations in section, because students would be more likely to all be on the same page.",
                "Strengths: Many of the readings we did for this course were engaging and informative. Prof Pitti organized the class well and did his best to accommodate everyone despite being on Zoom. Section TAs were all very committed and well-liked as well. I learned a lot about Latinx history in a variety of areas. Discussions and lectures were often very interesting and thought-provoking, and I thought that it was a great idea to do sections during class time rather than at an additional time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think it might have been better to have more variety in the readings offered in the course. We read a book every week, but it might have been better to assign chapters from books along with other articles to give more perspectives and knowledge. I also wish this class did not focus so much on Mexican experiences. Although those experiences are important, I was really hoping to learn more about Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Central American experiences--which were each given about 1 week each.",
                "I really loved the readings for the course, most were very interesting; section discussions were also enjoyable and intellectually stimulating. Since the class is emphasized as a \"Latinx History\" course, I think the course would benefit from more emphasis on the role of non-mexican hispanic groups in history (the class often felt like a Mexican history course).",
                "The biggest strength of this class was its focus on telling history as multiple histories. I think that this helped me see myself in the course material and understand how different moments\/places in history interlock. This course could potentially be improved by the referring to some of the feedback students gave in the last class about what books we liked the best, but I think that Professor Pitti's intentionality really came through in the syllabus, which was well designed.",
                "This class was a joy. The books are all excellent, and we were lucky enough to be able to \"meet\" many of their authors, which added so much to the discussions. The final project was one of my favorite assignments I've ever done at Yale, because it is incredibly open-ended in terms of content, yet forces you to do the nitty-gritty work of a historian. As someone who is Latinx myself, all the time I spent in this class felt so important and I think I grew not only as a student but as a person.",
                "Addressed too much Mexican-American history; no engage with South America at all (and during a semester when great revolutionary change was being led by Bolivians. Chileans, and Peruvians).",
                "The sheer amount of reading made this course difficult for me, but I also think I've learned more in this course than any other single course.",
                "The strengths of this course lie in the instructor (Prof. Pitti), its structure, and the skill-building assignments. Prof. Pitti is an extremely knowledgeable and empathetic listener and mentor; he always makes himself available to clarify course content, respond to your weekly reading response, and provide guidance for any of the assignments. The class has an easy structure to follow -- you read that week's book or chapters, write a response, and come to class ready to discuss it. There are overall three main assignments that build on each other -- the first teaches you how to search for primary sources in a database, the second teaches you how to analyze several sources on a topic, and the third asks you to build a museum exhibit using many primary sources. It could be improved with better timing of the assignments, in my opinion. The museum exhibit project felt rushed toward the end of the semester, even with the prospectus several weeks prior to the final project's deadline. It'd be great to have more guidance as far as when we should have our primary sources picked out, when to meet with a librarian, when to have a draft done; unfortunately, since this project was our final, many of us procrastinated to the point of doing all of these steps in the last week of classes. It would have been so much more enjoyable to have started finding sources earlier on in the semester should we have been more proactive; while taking this initiative was definitely our responsibility as students, it would have been great to structure the earlier assignments around the exhibit project, perhaps, or to provide \"guidance\" deadlines to keep us on track throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: the books chosen for reading, the learning format of the course (small lectures with seminar discussions), professor Pitti, the TFs\r\nWeaknesses: no major weaknesses; maybe more student-to-student conversation and dialogue with the discussion posts",
                "The professor and TFs are fantastic and the content is really relevant and new to most.",
                "The strength of this course came from Professor Pitti. He was extremely engaging, spent weeks organizing for our class and it was very obvious.",
                "Strengths: I thought that the lecture-seminar hybrid was really effective, and the TFs were great. \r\nWeaknesses: This is not so much a weakness as it probably is a limitation of the scope of the class, but the works we read do tend to be skewed toward the US Southwest and Mexican-Americans; however, this is not Professor Pitti's fault and is perhaps more due to historical and demographic reasons of Latinx populations within the US.",
                "I really liked the learning environment of the class, Professor Pitti and the TA's did a great job creating a comfortable and engaging classroom dynamic, even over zoom. I also really enjoyed the books we read, that were for the most part, extremely interesting. However, after reading a long academic book every week, I experienced a lot of burnout and often was unable to complete all the assigned reading. I would have appreciated some different kinds of readings that weren't only relatively-dense academic non-fiction, perhaps some fiction, poetry, music, essays, films, etc, that would offer another way to consider Latinx history. Furthermore, I would have appreciated more readings specifically about Indigeneity and Blackness within and in relation to Latinidad, especially by Afro-Latinx or Indigenous-identifying authors. I did really appreciate the focus on queerness and gender in migration.",
                "Professor Pitti and the TFs were a major strength; they were all very kind and accommodating.  The assignments were all doable yet also felt meaningful, and the final project (a museum exhibit proposal) allowed for more creativity than usual term paper assignments. I also really appreciated the opportunity to interact with the authors of the books we read.  \r\n\r\nMy only criticism is that the class straddled an odd structure at times-- somewhere between a seminar and a lecture. I think the large class sessions might have been more effective if Professor Pitti had lectured a bit more, and then we left the discussion for our smaller sections instead of having a 60 person discussion. I really enjoyed the days, usually on Tuesdays, when Professor Pitto would ground our readings for the week with some videos, images, extra content, etc. I would have liked more of this content within the main group meetings. \r\n\r\nI would also recommend highlighting certain chapters to focus on for each week's book (some of the 300-page books were a bit much to knock out in a week).",
                "I really enjoyed this course. Professor Pitti is great and his TFs are just as good. I enjoyed the readings and discussion sections. While all the readings were interesting, I felt that the weekly discussion posts were sometimes more tedious than fun--maybe cutting down on how many discussion posts are required would help. I also felt that the greater focus of this course was on Mexican history only rather than Latinx history, which is encompassing of many other peoples and countries.",
                "This course would be improved if there was a greater focus on Latinx communities with heritage from South America. There was not a single reading about a country in South America, which was a bit disappointing as a majority of the readings throughout the semester focused on Mexican, Mexican-American histories. Another improvement would be having a lecture from the professor about the context of each week's book. A strength of this course was having the books' authors give a guest appearance in our virtual classes.",
                "Strengths: Structure, Speakers, Most of the Readings\r\nWeaknesses: More engagement with Central American and Caribbean narratives as well as queerness",
                "I appreciated the array of texts throughout the semester, but I often found it difficult to manage reading essentially a whole book per week. I think making the readings shorter or less frequent could have helped me digest the content better. Furthermore, I wish the class had included more Central American and Afro-Latinx voices in the readings. Finally, the grading rubrics were a bit vague, so I was not sure how my presentation\/projects were evaluated. Overall, I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot from it.",
                "The mix of lecture and discussion within the actual class time was a great way to learn about the books we read from Professor Pitti, and also get the opportunity to discuss them ourselves. The very varied assignments also made the class a really enjoyable experience in that sense. However, I'd say that a weakness of the class was the sheer amount of reading asked of us. A book a week is a lot, and it was definitely an opportunity to practice \"skimming\" which at times was frustrating as the books were so engaging at times.  Furthermore, while I understand the desire to follow a somewhat chronological history, by focusing so heavily on Mexican American histories in the South west in the first month or so, I felt that the scope of the class was naturally limited. The books in my opinion should be more mixed and give voice to different histories more equally.",
                "Strengths: the course covers a wide array of subjects. When Stephen lectures, its nicely structured and engaging. Weaknesses: the reading load and class structure. Every week, we were required to a read an entire book - not short 100-200 pages ones, but 300+ dense books. We were given no direction as to what we should focus our attention toward. Since each book was extremely comprehensive and chronicled a profusion of historical events, discussion section was aimless, and it felt like students were battling to discuss the parts of the books they had read. Perhaps, if clearer guidelines and expectations were given, then discussions could have flowed better - but this depended  on the teaching assistant students were assigned. And it seemed like the professor was still trying to figure out syllabus given this was the pilot semester. The class met twice a week, and class would open with stephen giving a lecture. Midway, wed break into our assigned sections for discussions. As the semester progressed, less and less time was devoted to lecture. Instead, we engaged more with our section and teaching assistants. It would have been nice to have more exposure to other classmates and teaching assistants - or even to have been in Stephens section since many students signed up for this class expecting more instruction from him.",
                "First, the fact that the instructor planned and taught this course during the pandemic is already an incredible strength; COVID-19 tested the limits of virtual instruction, and the ability for this course to remain organized is a testament to this strength. Also, I think varying the forms of instruction between lecture and seminar was insightful because it provided a change in pace every so often. However, while these varying forms of instruction were beneficial, it was difficult to enjoy this format at times because of time scarcity. Lectures would go into seminar times, which would truncate discussion time and make it difficult for peers to bounce ideas off on another and get to know each other. Being mindful and\/or shortening the length of lectures could be a solution but would be detrimental to instruction. Perhaps creating a section for this class and dividing lectures and discussions into separate time blocks could be a better alternative if possible. Another weakness is the class readings, of which half center a specific Latine population and the other half only have 1-2 books discussing other populations. Of this problematic half of six books, there are repetitions in themes and histories that other books within that group of six already discuss and it would be more beneficial to switch out some of those books for others that address Latinidad in places like South America, which was discussed rarely, if at all, or in Black and Indigenous populations\/nations\/communities.",
                "Strengths-\r\n- the books we read\r\n- the concepts we learned\r\n- the professor's involvement \r\n- the videos and interactive aspects of the course \r\n- the final was extremely creative and honestly my favorite final out of any other courses I've taken\r\n\r\nWeaknesses-\r\n- I wished there was more on Central America!!",
                "This course was exceptional, though it could be improved with a lighter weekly reading load, which students often struggled to keep up with and condense a whole book's worth of information per week, especially given the online format of the course which already serves as a deterrence to engagement."

                "I liked combination of lectures and small seminars, but small seminars were definitely better.",
                "The discussion section portion within the course time succeeded! It's always helpful to students to reduce the amount of time they need to spend on zoom. Having discussions during normal class time was a strength of the course. The lecture portion could be improved in my opinion. There were a few lectures throughout the course, but not every Tuesday was a lecture from Professor Pitti. We often had guest lecturers which I believe is a strength of a course because it's always important and special to hear from the authors of the books we are reading themselves.",
                "Having the smaller sections was a brilliant idea. Also, all the books being available as PDF forms was very convenient.",
                "Prof. Pitti did a great job of making the lecture sections more interactive by inviting us to participate, using poll functions, etc. It was also nice to have both larger lecture-style discussions as well as breaking off into our smaller groups led by TAs.",
                "the instructor adapted very well to the online format, such that I have no criticisms. I think the course's in-class section was very effective, and worked better than a separate section would have.",
                "The mixed format of this class made learning as good as it could have been over Zoom, I think! The lectures were always engaging and not too long, and I really enjoyed my breakout room and TF.",
                "The fact that all of the books were provided on Canvas was incredibly helpful.",

                "Professor Pitti did everything perfectly.",
                "Remaining engaged with the material is so difficult over a virtual format for any class; however, the weekly reading responses helped ensure that students were remaining on track with their reading progress and aid as additional support for students who may not have understood that week's reading. In order to improve, I think the instructors should look into VoiceThreads which is a platform in which students can leave written, audio, and video responses which I think can add a more immersive and intimate experience not made available through written reading responses.",
                "The lecture-seminar hybrid teaching model was really effective! Maybe having more opportunities to interact with others from different sections would have been nice, but overall I felt like this model worked incredibly well. Further, Professor Pitti and the TFs were super accommodating and understanding, which created such a safe and comfortable learning environment.  The amount of reading some weeks did feel a bit excessive, but it was never too bad.",
                "Generally, Professor Pitti and the ETAs did a great job adapting the class to the online format. I thought the polling was very engaging, and I liked how section was integrated into the regular class time, it was nice to go right from lectures to a small group discussion. I also really appreciated the speaker events with the guest authors - these were some of my favorite classes. One element of the online format of the class that I think could be improved would be when the professor would attempt to have discussions in the main zoom room with all 60+ students. Often the same few people would participate, not leaving much room for those who may have been less comfortable talking in front of strangers in a virtual environment. While I appreciated hearing from people outside of my section, I was always a bit on edge during these large whole-class discussions.",
                "This course was well prepared for remote learning. We only had 2 class periods and tuesdays were more lecture, while thursdays were spent more in our individual sections with our TAs. This was a good balance between lecturing and seminar.",
                "I think Professor Pitti and the TFs transitioned this course online very smoothly.",
                "This course took advantage of the virtual format to invite authors to share with us about their work which was incredible. It also incorporated lots of multimedia elements.",
                "I appreciated the flexibility with the assignments during the week of the election as November was a hectic month in our country due to the pandemic and tensions across communities.",
                "The discussion section format was definitely well suited to virtual learning. I also really appreciated the opportunity to conduct primary research in a virtual setting.",
                "One of the practices, which was implemented near the end of the course, was assigning selected chapters of books rather than the books entirely. This class out of all my others had the largest reading load despite the discussions of these readings being limited because of time constraints. In a way, this frustrated me because it felt as if I was not receiving the intellectual stimulation from and for all the reading I did. Realistically, selected readings in this manner helped manage and structure the class overall because even the seminars became more active since students were not overwhelmed with high volumes of reading and synthesis.",
                "The separation of the class into smaller breakout sections once a week, I found to be, was the most engaging part of the course in facilitating learning and engagement in a smaller setting. It allowed for more conversation amongst ourselves in contrast to the larger group setting, as well as far more interaction with the professor, which is already something that is far more limited in a virtual setting."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student who is looking to learn about Latinx history within the United States. I would recommend this course to people who are unfamiliar with Latinx histories and are looking to study them within a history discipline and framework. I would recommend this course to another student who loves to read and learns well by reading and then discussing in class as well as by writing short reflections on the readings. If this learning style works for you and you enjoy the history discipline, then take this course!",

                "Great class! Prof Pitti and the TAs really made this an amazing place to think about latinidad and Latinx radicalism",
                "YES! A lot of fascinating topics that are not taught in other history courses. Prof. Pitti is amazing and so are all the TAs he chose to help teach this class.",

                "I already have and will continue to do so. I would especially recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about Latinx peoples in the U.S., labor, racial inequality, transnational movements, or state-sanctioned violence.",
                "Absolutely. Even if you're not majoring in anything history, humanities, or social science related, you will gain a lot from taking this course. The history of Latinx people in the US is a long and rich history, and this course helps challenge pre-existing assumptions, knowledge, and conceptions of an incredibly diverse group of people with roots dating back over 150 years. The course is also incredibly valuable for understanding how dominant historical narratives get made and become contested, and how history of Latinx peoples in the US intersects with those of African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and others. The readings are incredibly interesting, and will likely give your mind very important threads of curiosity to pursue both within and outside of Latinx history for further learning\/investigation.",

                "Definitely, especially to Latinx students who may not have had the opportunity to learn about their heritage before! The course covered a broad array of countries and communities, yet the material was still nuanced and organized in a way that built on certain themes.",
                "Yes! Professor Pitti is amazing and the readings are very interesting.",
                "I would only recommend this class to another student who is willing to learn more about Mexican and Mexican American history, than a broader Latinx history. I would recommend looking over the syllabus to see if topics, regions, or countries you're interested in will be included throughout the semester.",
                "Yes, this is a great ER&M course, especially if you are new to the department and the only course at Yale (that I know of) with a mission of exploring such a broad range of Latinx experiences and histories.",
                "Yes but be prepared to read a lot.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in filling the gaps in their history education of the United States. Although the course requires a heavy reading load, the material presented provides in-depth perspectives of the untold histories of Latinos and Latinas across the country.",
                "I would recommend this course as a means to explore a topic that you really don't get the opportunity to elsewhere. Before this class, I had read maybe one or two works by Latinx authors, and only a few pieces regarding Latinx communities. I appreciated this focus. However, be ready to read a lot and come prepared to sections to discuss the works, which can become a big ask in the middle of the semester.",
                "No. Its too dependent on your ta, grading is arbitrary, and the class is scattered in terms of subject matter. Its need a more concise focus, and the class size makes it impossible to have genuine, intelligent discussion.",
                "If you are a student with little to no knowledge of Latinx history and migration, this course is an incredible source to immerse yourself in the field of Latinx studies. However, if you are a student with a strong background in Latinx studies, I would suggest another course, maybe even with a location focus or specialization. This course was a good experience but because of my disagreements with the class readings and who is and is not represented, I think that students with a deeper background in Latinx history might be disappointed with the content of this class. That being said, if class readings change, if the topics were more polemical, especially towards the idea of Latinidad in and out of the United States, I would change my recommendation to a strong encouragement of this class.",
                "Absolutely, professor Pitti is among the most well versed in his field of study and is both patient and compassionate in his teachings. The course itself is designed in such a way so as to make disparate histories cohesive, interconnected, and comprehensible, which enables further avenues into theorizing and examining our present."
