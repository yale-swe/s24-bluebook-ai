There were major similarities and differences, and I believe that our analysis of carceral punishment is richer for it. Particularly, I had never studied Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union before, and I suddenly learned a whole lot. Our papers also allowed us to take deep dives into particularly parts of the carceral system which added to my knowledge."

                "Strengths: very interesting syllabus and guest speakers, and Prof Stanley and Prof Snyder are very smart and have a lot of interesting things to say.\r\nWeaknesses: the class is very disorganized (due dates are not set at the beginning of the semester, but rather as we go along, and Prof Snyder and Stanley are constantly emailing us to shift things around/assign new readings/tell us last-minute about guest speakers; the assignments are very long and vague and you get very little feedback on your writing; participation is worth 40% of the grade yet there is very little time to participate in class as we have guest speakers and Prof Stanley and Prof Snyder spend most of the time talking themselves. There is also a very strong ideological line that feels like it must be towed - students don't feel comfortable disagreeing with one another or the professors.",
                "Couldve been more clarity on assignments and wouldve loved if the professors made themselves more available outside of class, also couldve had a slightly less overloaded syllabus but amazing readings and amazing class discussions",
                "The material of this course was really interesting but I think structurally it could have been set up a bit better. It didnt feel like that much of a seminar (a lot of lecturing) which I didnt mind because we had good guest speakers, etc. but I think there could have been a better balance potentially.",
                "This class is incredible!!!!!!!!!!! The only weakness is that sometimes the philosophy points seemed a bit challenging to relate to certain elements of the readings but thats such a small critique because overall the class was incredible and I was always so satisfied leaving every single class.",
                "The course explores a fascinating intersection of American studies, Eastern European studies, and prison studies. It provides a lot of interesting avenues for students to contribute their own opinions and insights to the class. However, the scope of the class could be narrowed and made a bit more specific, as the wide range of materials and subjects covered sometimes seems scattered and fails to cohere.",
                "strengths: absolutely incredible readings, engaging discussions",
                "Great discussions but sometimes the discussion got away from the profs and we often ran out of time to discuss all readings",
                "Strengths: Really interesting readings, guest speakers and class discussions. It was also great listening to the two profs discuss and debate the material for each week. One of the most intellectually stimulating classes I've taken at Yale.\r\nWeaknesses: There was a lot of reading for each week, and between the two professors, students and guest speakers there was often not enough time to for everyone to get their chance to speak in class or to cover everything we read. Having said though, I didn't really mind because just listening to class discussion was great anyway.",
                "Strengths: comparative analysis, reading, engagement with texts, and speakers\r\n\r\nweaknesses: structure of class could be more streamlined, esp when speakers are also present",
                "I found that the course had excellent content and provided a comprehensive overview of mass incarceration in the Soviet Union and the United States. I really, really loved the fact that guest speakers were brought in and I learned so much from them, and I found this intellectual exchange to be fantastic, especially when my classmates asked super thoughtful questions. I also really respected the contributions and perspectives that Shawn and Clyde brought to the class.\r\n\r\nHowever, I felt that I really struggled to stay engaged and enjoy the content because the reading load and workload was simply too high. It also felt like even if Id done all the reading, the work wasnt going anywhere because I wasnt sure what the instructors were looking out for in class discussions or assignments, and sometimes class discussions felt a little unstructured. That was demoralising at times. It could also feel like everyone was stressed to say something because of how high the grade weightage was, but the discussion could sometimes be dominated by professors. They also often tended to favour more philosophical/theoretical discussions, which are frankly super hard to keep up with if one isnt exposed to the discipline prior. I felt like if the reading load was reduced, and perhaps if more guiding questions were given prior to the lesson, we would have been able to read the text knowing what to look out for and discussions would have been more inclusive/productive. In terms of assignments, it was often very difficult to secure office hours (which I completely understand), but the lack of guidance on assignments and unclear expectations, plus the fact that all three assignments were initially effectively final papers, also meant that I wasnt often sure where I was headed with them. I felt like there might have been differential standards between two professors coming from two different disciplines. Overall, I felt like I wouldve significantly enjoyed this class more if the workload was adjusted and expectations were communicated."

                "best course I have ever taken at Yale. flawless combination of material across time and disciplines",
                "Probably not, though it depends. The material is fascinating and Prof Snyder and Stanley have a lot of interesting things to say, but there is a lot of reading and the assignments are very long and very vague. It is exciting to have so much flexibility with what you write, but it is also hard to write long papers on very complex material with no clear outline of what to. Prof Stanley and Snyder are very helpful in office hours but impossible to reach by email. The biggest issue with this course is that participation is worth 40% of your grade, but there is very little time to talk in class, especially because guest speakers frequently come during class time. Prof Stanley and Snyder also spend a LOT of time just discussing the differences between philosophy and history, which is interesting but ultimately not so relevant to our class material. Because Prof Stanley is a philosopher and Prof Snyder is a historian, it often feels like one is playing baseball and the other basketball - they are simply operating within different frameworks and consequently have different expectations for the students. While the interdisciplinary nature of the class was also a strength in terms of expanding our thinking (and it was fun to watch them debate), it often felt like we were caught between two very different games (hence the baseball and basketball example) and were unsure what to do as a result. This made writing the papers especially difficult. There is also a strong ideological line to be towed in the class - it didn't feel like students felt comfortable disagreeing with one another or the professors.",
                "Tentatively yes  it is a lot of work and I had never taken a co-taught seminar before which was sort of new / I thought Professor Stanley and Snyder could have coordinated a little better maybe.",
                "YES YES YES!! especially if you are a history major and are interested in mass incarceration and/or Russian history. Please take this course!!",
                "If they are highly interested in prison systems or Soviet history, I would recommend this course; it is quite easy to shape the assignments according to your particular interest. However, they will be doing many readings on both these subjects, so I would make sure they're actually passionate about it.",
                "yes- incredible comparative study of incarceration, enlightened my understanding of the human impact of incarceration",
                "I would definitely recommend. The profs are legends and it shows. Discussions go to amazing places and youll draw connections about carceral logics that you never would have expected to. Multidisciplinary element is super special as well",
                "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in the topic. It was wonderful getting both the history and philosophy perspectives on mass incarceration from Prof Snyder and Prof Stanley respectively. The readings were great (although there is a lot of it) and the guest speakers were wonderful to have in class. It was truly intellectually challenging and exciting. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale!",
                "I would!! I learned and read a lot, and there was a lot of clear desire to learn and explore and be in intellectual community with one another.",
                "I would recommend the course, but with significant caveats about the workload and style of learning which I feel may not work for everyone."
