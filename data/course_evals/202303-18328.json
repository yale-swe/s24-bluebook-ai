Each week, we also read a scientific paper related to that week's topics and then discussed it in section. They were quite dense and initially really challenging for me to read, but I improved my understanding as the quarter progressed. I found the breakdown of the paper in discussion section to be particularly helpful. Usually these papers would demonstrate the experimental origin of a concept we learned about in class. It was cool to look at the data and see which types of assays and controls the experimenters used.",

I have definitely gained a much deeper understanding of the molecular processes that sustain life, the organelles in cells, and the research techniques that have been used to deepen our knowledge of molecular biology.  This course also helped me discover my own interest in cellular biology, so I am now planning on majoring in MCDB.",

Specifically in this course, it is mainly centered on cell bio (of course), but way more in-depth than what I originally knew. You learn about more organelles, their functions, and mainly, how their functions are carried out. You learn alot about proteins throughout the entire course, and a little bit about the other macromolecules here and there. You also get to learn about tissue biology and the immune system more specifically in the last unit, which I liked the most. But mainly, I appreciated that we were taught about the different types of microscopy, and this was a recurring concept throughout the course that came up on homework, quizzes, and the tests. I like how we also learned about the various methods of tracking certain proteins, organelles, or substances within a cell or system. This was a recurring, application-based topic that I saw throughout the course.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of the course are the recorded lectures and lecture slides available to students as well as the support offered by professor Horsley. Overall, the contents matter covered within half a semester proves to be challenging, and that is its only weakness. Also, TAs tend to grade homework differently and this creates inconsistency.",
                "STRENGTHS: weekly open-note quizzes and homework collaboration sessions\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: The course was very difficult to follow. Although the professor seemed very nice, the lectures were not laid out in a way that was conducive to learning. It felt like we jumped wildly from topic to topic, and gained a very little information about a lot of topics, rather than honing in on just a few topics. This also made it difficult to review the lecture slides and notes following lectures (when studying for the midterm or final) because it felt like there weren't clear sections or topics to be learned. I think this course would benefit from following a more structured layout - even following a similar layout to an AP Bio course (as a lot of the topics covered were similar). As this course is now, though, it is very hard to learn.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, many of the quiz and PSET questions were poorly-worded and difficult to understand. Although changes were made when these issues were brought up, they did little to alleviate the confusion.",
                "The major weakness of this course was how disorganized the class was because the weekly assignments are usually posted 3 days before they were due and most of the time they make many changes throughout the course of the week, making it hard to locate the accurate location of the work. In addition, the lectures were boring and occasionally not taught really well. The peer tutors are also always confused about the content and were no help to understanding the material. In addition, the quizzes and psets often contained information that were either not taught or outside the scope of the material covered making it extremely difficult to answer.",
                "The fact that lectures are recorded was extremely helpful especially when it came time to study as I could rewatch lectures that had occurred weeks ago and if there was information in the lecture that I had missed I was able to rewatch and take better notes.",
                "The strengths of this course were the number of people who were happy to help and explain the content in a way that would allow me to understand it better. I was able to attend weekly Zoom office hours which were convenient as I was able to ask questions and attend extra help when I had an emergency to attend to back home. I also was able to go to the enrichment office hours which greatly benefited my learning as it was engaging and fun to attend.",
                "Strength: good mix of examples and theory, and very interesting topics.",
                "Strengths: Important knowledge to know for Premed\r\nWeaknesses: Exams were not very fair; Horsley is not a good lecturer, she goes very quickly and doesnt give much room to breathe",
                "Strengths: The grading of the course is relatively fair and I was glad that the lectures were no longer asynchronous. I appreciated the homework help sessions being available, although I never went and can't comment on their usefulness. The EDstem platform was helpful as well and I appreciated that the professor\/TFs were always quick to respond there.\r\nWeaknesses: I don't know what it is about the bio sequence, but I think the class may just be cursed. I find bio very interesting, but I just really struggled to find this class all that engaging. The professor read off the slides for the most part, which were always in these enormous pdf files that we would never manage to finish, so we could always see that there was content that we basically just skipped. It was nice that she answered questions in class, but that meant that we just never got to a lot of the content and she often didn't know the answers, even if the questions were relatively basic. Sections were a drag -- we had to read papers, which I actually did find interesting, but nobody ever seemed to read them and then the section itself would just be people discussing papers they hadn't read. The quizzes\/homeworks\/exams constantly had questions with errors that made them impossible to decipher so 75% of the time, the course was testing your ability to figure out what the question was actually asking rather than your actual understanding of the content. The grading of the class was dependent on your TF, too -- I said it was fair above, but that's just because the professor would be understanding when you emailed to ask why your TF docked a bizarre number of points off an assignment.",
                "Strengths: Its a half semester so it isnt that long of a push. The Peer Tutors were seriously the best part of this course and I feel like I learned the most from them. Weaknesses: Professor Horsley is really disorganized and includes so many typos in the exam. The exam prep sessions were never really that helpful and you have to do a lot of learning on your own.",
                "Strengths: Horsely is the kindest instructor and really enthusiastic about biology.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The course was rather disorganised. Quizzes and homework questions were frequently edited a few days before the due date. It was not especially clear what information was necessary to learn compared.",
                "Discussion sections were the strength, lectures were the weaknesses. The lectures and info sessions were often poorly explained or somewhat incorrect.",
                "The support in this class was very helpful. It feels like the teaching team is truly on your side throughout this course, hoping you will succeed. However, the class was a little unorganized and it was difficult to understand what content was going to be tested and what content was not necessary for us to know. I think that the course would be good if it had a little more organization.",
                "The discussion sections were a strength that genuinely improved my understanding of concepts. I also liked that all the lectures were recorded so that I could watch them again if I needed to reabsorb the material. The organization of the rest of the course was a severe weakness. There are several examples that I will mention. The week with the guest lecturer Professor Mogessie completely derailed the rhythm of the course and what he covered hardly corresponded with what was on that week's Pset. Additionally, for each week's slideshow, there were at least 3 iterations of the same slideshow posted on Canvas: pre-lecture slides, post-lecture slides, and a \"final\" version. This made Canvas hard to navigate and made it harder to study. I think they could have deleted past iterations of the slides. I also got the sense that not a lot of time was put into the assignments, quizzes, and tests that the teaching team made. Our quizzes were riddled with mistakes  typos, blank answer selections, missing word banks, repeat\/ambiguous answers  that would cost us points that then had to be corrected later. The final exam was filled with sentences that were gramatically incorrect with ambiguous interpretations that changed the meaning of what was being asked. One question asked whether we would use a \"rabbit, hamster, or mouse\" antibody and then the answer selections immediately following were \"goat, hamster, or mouse.\" When Dr. Horsley \"corrected\" this mid-exam, she said we should choose between \"goat, hamster, and mouse,\" which presented two potential options for the right answer. I told a TF during the exam that there was no way to choose between \"goat\" and \"hamster\" and she agreed with me, explaining that Dr. Horsley had \"made a mistake\" in her correction but \"didn't want to correct herself again.\" There was also a  sometimes substantial  disconnect between the Psets and the lectures. In my opinion, Psets should build on and bring class material to a higher-thinking level, not go in a completely different direction. The peer tutors thankfully were able to help a lot with homework questions. One example of this disconnect that I remember in particular was when there was a question about the regulation of homologous chromosome separation vs. sister chromatid separation. The protein shugoshin was an important player in the process, which the peer tutors strongly expressed. When asked during our final review session if we should understand shugoshin's role in the cell cycle, Dr. Horsley laughed and said \"shugoshin? I don't know what that is.\" I find it concerning that Dr. Horsley did not know of an important protein that was part of one of the PSet answers. Also, the complex topics (for example: cell cycle checkpoints) explored on our PSets would rarely be incorporated into the tests. This course could be improved by more streamlining between Dr. Horsley, Professor Benavides, the peer tutors, and the TFs. Additionally, I think the use of guest lecturer was a mistake. If Dr. Horsley had to be absent for a week, I would have preferred pre-recorded lectures. We had gotten used to the rhythm and speed at which Dr. Horsley taught and the types of graphics she used. Switching to another lecturer for a complex topic was stressful (especially when the homework felt unrelated to his material) and we then had to review those topics again with Dr. Horsley. Another small change that would have improved the course a lot for me would have been to post the discussion section slides ahead of time. I like following along with the notes during discussion section so that I have all the material in front of me and can add my own comments or annotate the pictures.",
                "As someone who just switched to pre-med, I wasn't particularly convinced by my peers who warned me about the issues they've found with the intro bio sequence at Yale, but GOOD GOD were they right. While I think that the information we learned was quite interesting and important, the manner through which it was taught along with the general disorganization and lack of effort put in by the professor of this course were, quite frankly, extremely appalling. The lecture presentations were often very unclear, and students were constantly asking questions for clarification during lecture. Horsley's presentations tend to be pretty sparse of explanatory information meaning that studying outside of class is sometimes a bit of a struggle. The class was also very unclear in terms of what information was important to retain for exams, and the professor seemed to have issues following through with certain actionables like posting recordings of review sessions, etc.",
                "Good faculty support\/clear lectures. Wish it could be more organized (i.e. no typos\/updates on new versions of psets)",
                "Strengths - interesting subject matter, workload was manageable. \r\nWeaknesses - lectures are poorly organized and very difficult to learn from. I had to put in a lot of extra time to even vaguely understand what was going on (I.e. attending lectures and spending an hour afterwards reviewing the slides and looking up information). Homework and quizzes often tested us on topics that we hadnt covered, or applications of topics that we needed background knowledge to understand. It seemed as if a lot of classwork had been reused from previous years, but not updated for changes in the curriculum, leading to a lot of confusing and time consuming issues. Though mistakes were (usually) corrected eventually, it made completing classwork frustrating, as there were reliably multiple issues with every assignment.",
                "I liked the material learned in the course, and I feel as though the weekly quizzes and psets were very helpful in reinforcing the material learned during lecture. There were times were I felt like the material did not connect to each other very well, but it is also hard to learn a lot of biology concepts in a short period of time, so i understand this downside.",
                "I think the lectures in this course were a bit disjointed. There was a lot of information and a lack of communication as to what was being tested and what was just extra information. The discussion board wasnt updated frequently so many questioned were left unanswered for long bouts of time. I think the class would be better as a 3 day a week lecture for shorter period of time like chem 161 instead of two longer lectures.",
                "Strengths are different styles of assignments that allow you to learn in different ways",
                "This course was poorly organized. The lecturer did not seem to understand what she was talking about at times, making the lectures hard to comprehend and stay focused on. The lecture slides were packed with information, but they were not organized in a manner that was conducive for allowing one to go back and just read the slides and understand the content without rewatching the entire lecture recording. The exams contained ambiguous questions, forcing one to decipher what the question was really asking.",
                "Strengths: BIOL 102 covers some very interesting material that I was never exposed to in high school biology, and it develops useful skills in reading scientific literature. The EdDiscussion is incredibly useful for quickly clarifying questions about assignments or content, and Perusall is also used effectively to encourage collaborative commenting.\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures and assignments don't seem very well planned out; there regularly appears factually incorrect information on lecture slides, confusing wording, grammatical\/spelling mistakes, and technical issues with Canvas quizzes. The fact that EdDiscussion serves to notify instructors of certain issues seems like more of a remedy to this problem than a real sustainable solution. I often found myself Googling concepts like \"necessary\/sufficient\" or \"V-type\/F-type ATPases\" because I was confused by the explanations in the lecture.",
                "I think the strengths are it is in person but the online option is available so people don't get behind and the weaknesses are some of the test had questions that were worded a little weirdly and sometimes it was hard to know what to study to be prepared for that. The pace of the content was also fast-for example we would learn many complex topics in one class so I would have to rewatch lectures multiple times.",
                "The weekly homework sets were incredibly helpful for the preparation of the midterm and final assessments, as they allowed for the development of critical thinking skills to apply the material learned during lecture and apply them to real life scenarios. A weakness of the course would be that sometimes the homework and quizzes were not released until later in the week, so there would be less time to complete them, which may be problematic for some students who have heavier work loads towards the end of the week and are looking to complete the homework earlier.",
                "Strengths: amount of content covered felt manageable, slides had understandable diagrams\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the explanations of things felt all over the place, the guest lecturer made it harder for me to understand that content",
                "this course did have many opportunities for students to do well, however i felt that it was somewhat disorganized. the quizzes had to be edited a lot once they were already opened, and the midterm and final didn't exactly seem representative of the things we learned during the semester.",
                "Strengths: \r\nWeaknesses: organization, progression of topics \r\n\r\nThis course was not designed for people with no prior biology experience. Topics were introduced with no context, and materials were rushed through and not explained. There were spelling and grammatical errors in the psets, midterm, and final.",
                "This course could be improved by going further into the papers in discussion section and providing more guidelines for what the exams will look like.",
                "Strengths: The content was very fast, and detailed. Although it was very strenuous (more weekly workload than my other three courses combined), I came out much more knowledgeable about cell biology.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The organization was embarrassing for an Ivy League university. Every week, there were multiple grammar issues that would interfere with comprehension of quizzes and homework. The professor frequently was confused about the content of her class, and students would have to correct her or wait while she figured out the correct answer. Assessments frequently had mistakes that were not communicated to all students (ex: students with accommodations).",
                "The course content was both too vague and too specific at times. Lectures passed over most material too quickly, but usually at least one topic was given a disproportionate amount of attention.",
                "Course wasnt bad. Most of content was relevant.",
                "The strengths are the weekly quizzes. I think they should make vocab lists for every week and have more 1 on 1 meeting availability.",
                "The content of the class was organized very messily. It was really difficult to figure out what we would be tested on based on the content taught in lectures, since the professor was hard to follow and did not include a lot of information that was on homework\/practice quizzes.",
                "This course jumped around from topic to topic. If I hadn't taken AP Biology in high school, I think I would have been completely lost in the course. The lectures were very boring, the content had the potential to be interesting but wasn't taught in the most engaging way, and the the lectures simultaneously didn't go into enough depth to be challenging, nor painted a good enough story to make the surface level knowledge interesting. Also, please don't take 15 questions during a 250-person lecture!",
                "This course was structured really well.  I really appreciated the fact that the recorded lectures were available on Canvas so that they could be re-watched and studied in preparation for exams.  At times, there were some issues with clarity in the wording of questions on the quizzes, P-Sets, and exams, where it was difficult to understand what exactly was being asked.  Aside from this, though, the course was very enjoyable and definitely augmented my understanding of cell biology.",
                "The weaknesses of the course were that the professor many times was very confused about the topics that she was teaching. This was hard as a student since I did not know how much detail I needed to study and I had to spend a lot of time outside of the course relearning the information because the lectures were all over the place. The strength was that the course was understanding in that many students could have had things that were going wrong. The weekly quizzes that were open notes were very helpful because they were very hard and were not related to the content that was taught.",
                "Strength: The main topics were clearly laid out, and any questions that were asked during lecture were answered.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I did not like the organization of the material very much. There were many times where a specific protein or biological process was explained for a few minutes and did not appear again. Other times, specific proteins that were barely touched upon were key to a problem set or quiz. You did not know which proteins were important and which ones you could ignore.",
                "Tests felt written by AI. Lectures were great.",
                "Strength Is that the quizzes are open note so instead of worrying about the grade, I can learn from the quizzes. Weaknesses are the lectures move really fast over really dense topics.",
                "The course seems a little bit disorganized, maybe ] more resources for the Homeworks and Quizzes could be helpful. Also, sometimes the grammar and wording of test questions is off and can make the material unintentionally confusing, so maybe some proofreading might help.",
                "I felt that the problem sets furthered my understanding and allowed me to practice describing my ideas in a way that was applicable to the midterm and final exams. One thing that could be improved is the organization and clarity of explanations in lectureI often felt confused at first but was able to understand better after rewatching the lecture on my own time and doing problem sets.",
                "Having a guest lecturer was confusing, as the professor was not present for the guest lecture and was unsure of what was discussed. I liked the open notes quiz format. The homework questions were not related to what was discussed in class.",
                "It is very fast-paced but the teaching team does try to offer various avenues for support",
                "Strengths: good pacing, interesting content and examples; collaborative, open-note quizzes were a low-stakes way to practice exam-style questions; positive incentives for attending lectures, instead of getting docked for not attending. I found bio 102's midterm & final better than bio 101's weekly quizzes because I could focus on big picture understanding rather than cramming content for a quiz each week and forgetting about it. Weaknesses: the bio 101-104 sequence does not publish grade cutoffs & adjusts them year-to-year, so while you're able to calculate your raw grade, you never have an idea of where that places your letter grade.",
                "The lectures felt disorganized; we often ran out of time, and topics that weren't reached were still included in weekly quizzes. The topics we did cover were explained in ways that left me with many confusions by the end of the class. The PSETs were helpful in actually coming to understand the topics we covered despite sometimes having confusing wording; the optional weekly homework sessions were very helpful in understanding how to approach the PSETs or topics from class. The guest lectures were better structured but did not really fit into the flow of the rest of the class.",
                "Pros: Professor Horsley and Professor Benavides are both super helpful and organized with the course. Professor Horsley is very clear with her teaching. Cons: Test questions are often unclear but regrades are offered. Guest lectures can throw the curriculum off.",
                "Strengths: grading wasnt too harsh, lecture slides were posted, extra credit opportunities, psets were manageable and helpful for learning\r\nWeaknesses: weekly quizzes really incentivized doing them with other students (I didnt know anyone else in the class very well), lectures did not align with quizzes and psets, exams were poorly written",
                "Strength is the organization of the class and I like the meme contest. Weakness is the class is a little long per session to digest all the information.",
                "Lectures were stilted and difficult to follow. Improvements in lecturing as well as changes in the course's structuring and organization of topics and slides would be appreciated.",
                "I am not sure how it could be improved. I struggled understanding the broader concepts because I feel like there were often glazed over to go into great depth of things that we would not actually be tested on.",
                "The class is terribly organized, lectures are not engaging at all. Prof Horsley should reorganize her lectures to make them more coherent and logical to follow. She is not good at explaining concepts or answering questions and the fact that she always sounds unsure doesn't help. I don't know how she's still chosen to teach this course.",
                "I think the professors could develop a better method of teaching the course and focusing on important key aspects of the material rather than try to lecture on everything.",
                "The enrichment sections were a strength. \r\nOne week, my discussion leader was not present. It would be beneficial to have a backup plan so that I could still complete that lesson.",
                "The topics were interesting, and the weekly homeworks and quizzes were helpful for reviewing concepts from class and were still very manageable. However we usually wouldn't get through all the slides in class, and the lectures and slides were often pretty unclear or had to be corrected later on by Professor Horsley. The same thing happened with several quizzes which had to be corrected after they had been released. Some midterm and final questions were also written in a really confusing way or had to be clarified or fixed in the middle of the test.",
                "We always run out of time for lecture. Quizzes and psets test us on material that we did not cover. Guest lecture speaker spoke very fast and covered a lot of details that we didnt need to know. Ed discussion response is slow.",
                "The weaknesses included : class organization, poor explanation of topics, expecting students to understand concepts despite this being an intro level course, placing questions on homework and quizzes that we had not covered, constant amendments to assignments, uploading 10+ set of slides that students were expected to go through to learn. \r\n\r\nStrengths: my teaching fellow. \r\n\r\nHow to improve: Other than hiring a new professor, Dr. Horsley needs to focus on reorganizing the content to make coherent sense and cover the content she is going to quiz us on.",
                "The collaboration fostered among students and the support from teaching staff was a strength. One weakness was the topics that we glossed over. I understand that going into careful detail about everything was not the goal of the class, but I was sometimes left more confused when things were not explained more. Also, I didn't feel like the discussion papers added very much to my learning, and I was often left more confused.",
                "I think that lectures were too fast-paced, but the homework and tests helped me understand the material.",
                "I thought this was a great course, at times problem sets had errors or included content we didn't cover in lecture so had to be revised later in the week, but overall it was well-organized and I enjoyed the structure much more than BIOL 101.",
                "good",
                "Lecture content was extremely interesting but the lectures were somewhat unorganized",
                "The the homework each week never correlated to what we were actually learning in class and I felt really hard to keep up each week when feeling like the quizzes and material just didnt add up with one each other",
                "Strengths: I enjoyed the applied nature of the concepts in this class. It was nice to hear examples of processes or experiments in action, and they helped me better understand the material. The course content was basic enough to find on Khan Academy, and using online resources was key to succeeding in this class and actually understanding the material.\r\nWeaknesses\/improvements: This class could be much better organized and taught. Concepts were explained confusingly and unclearly during the lectures, and it was tough not to be able to get through all of the planned material each week. This mismatch in the course content covered made reviewing slides, study guides, and studying for tests extremely confusing. In the future, it would be helpful to remove the content that is not covered during the lectures from the slides, practice tests, and study guides.",
                "I think the material could have been presented in a more effective way, and I think that the exams could have been designed to better fit the course material.",
                "The course could be improved by sticking to the BIOL 101 model.",
                "The strengths are that it covers a lot of material, the weakness is that we went too much in-depth sometimes on material that wasn't even tested on the midterm or final exam.",
                "I enjoyed discussion section discussions and they served as a great place to strengthen understanding of the material",
                "Strengths: Covering a large amount of material in a short time. Reasonable homeworks and good access to faculty outside of lecture times.\r\nWeaknesses: The lecture style was very hard for me to engage with. I felt like sometimes the lectures would go tangential. As far as the quizzes, there were some phrasing\/spelling issues that made it confusing, especially when attempting to do it earlier in the week.",
                "Some strengths of the course were that the initial structure of the course was very clear and straight forward, with the course calendar and weekly assignments, so we always knew what to expect in terms of workload each week. Also, the weighting of each assignment category and opportunities for extra credit were very generous, and allowed for students to demonstrate their learning in different categories, whether that be on PSETS, quizzes, or other ways. Some weaknesses of the course are that there weren't many resources to get help with assignments earlier in the week. The only office hours with professor Horsley were on Thursdays at a time where I and many other students had classes, making it very difficult to attend. The only peer tutoring times were during the weekends as well, which made it so that many students could get homework help from the peer tutors was right before the deadline for PSETS and quizzes. I think offering more opportunities for peer tutoring and office hours, including earlier days in the week would allow students to get help and submit assignments earlier, considering how large the class size is.",
                "Lecture went well and I was able to learn a lot.  Sometimes though there was just a lot of information to try and process and we would go through slides quickly.",
                "This was overall poorly taught and frustrating. The overall structure of the course lacked logic and direction. The lecturer made it extremely difficult to understand what was necessary for us to learn. Exam questions were not well worded and had many grammatical mistakes. I spent half of my final exam trying to understand what the exam questions were asking me to write about.",
                "Strength- I liked the content and general formatting of this course more than Bio 101. \r\n\r\nWeakness Wise- there are alot of ways that this course could be improved. I would say that this course could be more organized.\r\nThere was always some sort of formatting issue with the quizzes. They need to be updated.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 different office hours hosted by the peer tutors for this course, and you can get the answers to all the problem sets from these office hours. There were offered in-person and on zoom, which made them pretty accessible. They helped out my understanding of application-based concepts so much. But even after getting the answers and wither correcting what I previously had, or incorporating the answers to what I already had, I would still get a lot counted off. Even though I attended the office hours, the answers we were getting were not always correct, which isn't cool. On top of that, we get counted off on the homework with no feedback on what was wrong on the questions that I missed. So, I had no way of knowing what to improve on.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness of the course is that most of the time, Dr. Horsley would get get behind every lecture. Her lectures were about half actually lecturing, and the other half was answering questions that students had because they were not made clear the first time. As a result, we would not get through all the slides, and this would throw off our homework and quizzes. To catch up, she had to speedrun through much of the content, which is not fair for the sake of our learning and comprehension.\r\n\r\nThere was one instance when Dr. Horsley did not know that a certain question was asked on our last problem set. We all got 3 points counted off for not mentioning a certain mechanism for a question on our last problem set, but we had not even learned about it. This proves that the quizzes and problem sets needed to be looked over, or even have the rubric updated beforehand to make sure that they are compatible to what was actually taught to us. Dr. Horsley would bot have known about this either if a student had not mentioned it during our final review session. Dr. Horsley said she would manually go in and give us those points back which was nice. But, it does make you wonder if the same thing happened beforehand without our knowledge."

                "I would not recommend it to first years (which this class is intended for) but it is a prerequisite to almost all biology classes. I do not think its a fault with the course--professor horsley does very well making the course supportive--but the content matter is very dense for half a semester.",
                "I would only recommend this course for those who need it as a pre-requisite, otherwise I would not recommend this course.",
                "Yes, this course is very good as an introduction if you are interested in cell biology but I wish more time was spent on specific topics instead of a small amount of time on many subjects.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to learn more about cells and development.",
                "Yes, it is very interesting and I loved the teacher.",
                "I think its important general knowledge, and not the hardest class, but a very tough class for sure",
                "Honestly no. That makes me sad because I do find biology really compelling as a field and think that everyone should have a basic understanding of biology, but unless this class is required, I would just take something else. The lectures and the format of the course made the content uninteresting. I felt like the design of the class made me more stressed about my grade rather than my understanding of the content, which was unfortunate.",
                "Only if you need to fill the BIOL sequence. Try to test out if you can.",
                "Yes, if necessary for your major or out of interest.",
                "I think the subject is fascinating although very difficult, but this course does a good job of breaking it down. Would recommend.",
                "If you are interested in biology or think that you might want to major in the life sciences, then I would take this class. But, if you don't like biology and this class isn't required for you, then I would not take it because it is a lot of effort and a fairly large workload.",
                "I would recommend because it gives you a solid foundation for biology.",
                "I would only recommend this course to fill a prerequisite. If you're looking for an easy science credit, there are better options. If you're actually interested in biology and want to learn about it (which I am), I have to imagine there are better, more-organized options.",

                "Yes if youre majoring in bio\/are pre-med",
                "If you have to take bio yes, if not I would consider a different science credit",
                "No, but I understand it is required for biology students. It is definitely something you have to get through.",
                "I would recommend this course if someone who is interested in biology and other STEM courses, but if you are someone who is just looking to take a interesting science class for fun, I maybe would not choose this one just because it is a very inteoduction-oriented course.",
                "I dont think u would necessarily recommend this course because it was difficult to fully comprehend what I was learning. Especially for people who dont need this class as a major requirement, I wouldnt suggest they try this course.",
                "Would not recommend as a fun science credit, but to see if biology is an interest for premed requirements",
                "The course content is interesting especially if you like to learn about the cell and body. Just make sure you know that this course may not be the most organized.",
                "I know this course is a requirement for several majors, and I think it is incredibly useful for developing a background in biology. That being said, because of how disorganized the course seems at the moment, I can't imagine someone taking this if they didn't have to.",

If you have to take it, I do recommend that you try to take the course with Professor Horsely. was really kind and genuinely invested in our learning which I appreciated.

                "No, unless you have to take it for a major or graduate school requirement. It is very rigorous, which would be fine if the professors organized it well (which they did not.) There needs to be more teaching assistants available during the assessments, and a new course coordinator.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are interested in learning more about the cell or doing anything remotely related to living organisms in their future studies\/work. A more solid foundation greatly changed my understanding of how cells and their processes work, and I feel that this is essential for pretty much everyone interested in biology.",

The lectures were confusing and we never got to all the topics on the slides, even though they were often on the quizzes due each week. The Thursday homework sessions are very helpful for the PSETs and quizzes; I highly recommend attending these sessions in order to understand the assignments.",
                "Yes",

                "Unless you have to take this course, I would not recommend wasting your time. Lectures were hard to understand due to both instructor knowledge and format of information, little help was given for exam preparation and exams were difficult to parse, and most if not all of the content was left for student to learn on their own.",

                "Yes, if it's required. The workload is much lighter than Biol 101. If you have the time to use online resources to truly understand the content (it is often left very unclear in lectures), students with zero background in biology can succeed. A good TF matters.",
                "I think that this course is reasonable in its scope and difficulty as part of the intro biology sequence, and so I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in getting a look at biology at a level more in detail than high school biology.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think it's an important class to take, and I learned a lot from it. However, I would advise them that I felt like a significant amount of my success in the course was due to independent study to supplement lecture and discussion.",
                "I would, because it's a pre-requisite to many biology courses at Yale.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, because it provides a necessary basis for most STEM courses.",
                "I would only recommend this course to those who are required to take it for their major, or have a genuine passion for learning biology, because the way that the course is conducted (especially as an intro biology course) can be very frustrating at times and may deter some from continuing to study biology.",
                "Yes, if you have to.  You will learn much about the cell, but there is just a lot of content to get through.",
                "No. I love biology, but this course was just frustrating. I could not tell you what I learned from this class, or even what the class was about.",
                "no because this class was very disorganized",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. The only reason why I am taking the sequence is because it is required for my major. If you are looking to fulfill a distributional, there are way better sciences to take than the bio sequence.",
                "Only if 1) you need to take it, 2) are really interested in the material and are willing to invest time and mental energy, or 3) if the structure\/organization of the course is changed."
