The course greatly altered my own perspectives surrounding the American landscape and wilderness as a whole.",

I also developed my skills in different kinds of writing, such as writing exhibition labels and op-eds, in addition to more formal academic papers. Crucially, I learned so much I didn't know\/hadn't been taught about America's use of nuclear power and weapons in its colonial and imperial projects."

She curated a list of very interesting readings for us each week, and she was great at moderating our class discussions. I appreciated that she incorporated diverse ways for us to discuss our readings, including small groups and by writing key themes\/terms in concept maps on the chalkboards. The field trips were also awesome!"
