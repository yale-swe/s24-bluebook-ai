Crucially, I learned so much I didn't know/hadn't been taught about America's use of nuclear power and weapons in its colonial and imperial projects."

She curated a list of very interesting readings for us each week, and she was great at moderating our class discussions. I appreciated that she incorporated diverse ways for us to discuss our readings, including small groups and by writing key themes/terms in concept maps on the chalkboards. The field trips were also awesome!"
