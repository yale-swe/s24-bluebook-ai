                "In taking this course the main skill developed was the ability to read and speak Chinese, more sophisticated vocabulary was introduced as were slightly more complex grammar structures. The main emphasis is on speaking ability but reading was also considered important. After taking this course I can very clearly feel how much stronger my Chinese has become as a result.",

                "Strengths: well organized so it was easy to get ahead. That also means it was easy to fall behind. Weaknesses: the entire class was taught off lecture slides, except for the occasional group work which I appreciated and liked. This class is so much work, but its definitely rewarding when youre able to have full conversations in Chinese by the end!",
                "The course is very rigorous and does a great job of drilling vocabulary and grammar concepts into the students. However, the Friday asynchronous lessons don't work particularly well, as they are often limited in their range, and I feel that simply another class day would have been overall more beneficial to my studies.",
                "The course moves so quickly. However, the professors are very accommodating.",
                "The strengths of the course are in its organization and scheduling. Students actively practice their skills everyday and are given opportunities to do this in a variety of ways. The class size is small also and for this reason their is a great deal of attention given to every student. The individual tutorials and asynchronous activities are also wonderful features of what has to be one of the best courses in the college."

                "I would - Chinese is a very interesting class and is useful in helping develop a skill you'll use throughout your whole life. I plan on continuing my own Chinese study.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. L3, although very difficult to get used to, was very helpful to only speak Chinese in class. I learned so much more from only using Chinese to communicate and I believe it made my Chinese speaking much more fluent and natural.",
                "I would recommend this course only if you are fulfilling your language credit or you are genuinely interested in learning Chinese. It takes a lot of personal motivation to get through this course and succeed. It is not a light workload, but the Professors are very forgiving if you miss a homework assignment (you can usually make it up for full credit). There are a two final projects and a final exam so keep that in mind. The class itself isnt exactly the most interesting (heavy on grammar taught through presentations) but its rewarding and youre guaranteed to learn something new. Liang Laoshi is really chill (although her grading can be tough sometimes!) so use your TA to help practice and read over assignments / essays!",
                "This is a good course which helps you expand your Chinese knowledge -- although it can be challenging at times, it is undoubtedly foundational for anyone who wishes to improve their Chinese and pursue fluency.",
                "I would, but only if they were aware of how much work the course requires, and were aware of their own weaknesses as a language learner. If this were there first time learning another language, I would not recommend it.",
                "Yes, maybe I am a bit fanatical but I believe that all the students regardless of major should make their way to take L3 Chinese.",
                "Yeah! If youre not scared of grades being bad."
