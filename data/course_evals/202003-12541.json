                "I worked very hard to develop my critical thinking skills, and the ability to read and retain a lot of material on a weekly basis.",
                "Each week, I engaged with material that provided a new lens and\/or methodology with which to view the dynamics of memory, politics, ethics, and so much more. I also developed the skill of drawing upon and challenging these works through my weekly reflection essays. Notably, I developed the simple yet essential skill of communicating with peers, as I was quite shy at the beginning of the course. Though I had worked one-on-one with peers in the past, the idea of actively discussing materialespecially the incredibly sensitive material encompassed by this coursein front of 10+ peers remained intimidating, and I found the peer review workshops to be particularly insightful. I also became a stronger writer through the course, and I attribute this to the clear and thorough feedback provided by both the instructor and my peers."

                "The course has a great organizational structure and we are taught how to incorporate the theories into our own writing. We got opportunities to present our own ideas. The workshops were especially useful because everyone could give you feedback to improve. However, the format for the writing assignments was unclear and I did not know how to improve.",
                "The reading responses were rigorous and I always learned quite a bit from the reading, and the paper workshops were relatively helpful. I thought there was quite a lot of reading and we didn't always have enough time in class to discuss it all, and I also didn't enjoy the final few weeks of the class since we spent so much time on how to write anthropology papers to a particular specification rather than discussing ideas.",
                "I absolutely loved this class, both because of the fascinating content because of Prof. Koga and the students I got to know. Prof. Koga is kind, genuine, and an incredible teacher, who guided each class wonderfully and created an atmosphere of scholarly respect, candid reflection and collaboration. I gained so much from getting to talk and listen to people from a variety of disciplines and communities, and my own ideas and research could not have gotten to where they did without all of us spending so much time thinking together.",
                "The strengths of this course include the dedication of Professor Koga to the students enrolled. She worked tirelessly to engage the class every week and to facilitate invigorating conversation and discussion. By assigning the weekly reflection essays, she prepared each student to show up prepared to offer their insights on the material for each class.",
                "For me, the greatest strength of this course was its focus on collaboration. The course involved several writing workshops where students had to come to class prepared to constructively critique the work of their peers. These workshops gave students not only the chance to learn from their peers but also to gain new insight on their own projects through their critiques of others. Similarly, students were tasked with reading their peers weekly reflection essays before each weeks discussion. This helped facilitate the conversation far beyond what would have occurred had students simply read the weekly material and focused on their own written essays."

                "I absolutely hate learning on zoom, but the seminar format is better than lecture. Yukiko did a wonderful job of engaging the class, and requiring us to come to office hours (that was super helpful!). Our discussions, and Yukiko's encouragement to us to keep ourselves unmuted was helpful in facilitating discussions.",
                "I think the small number of students, the workhops held, the availability of the professor both during office hours and through email, and the pace\/timeline of deadlines were all well suited to learning during the pandemic. A small thing is that sometimes it might have been useful to check in with everyone and see if we might need a 5 or 10 minute break midway.",
                "Although this course was strictly virtual, the course format did not seem to be greatly affected by the pandemic. Given the small size of the class, we were still able to have active seminar discussions while seeing everybodys face on one Zoom page. Often, Yukiko would request that students keep their microphones turned on in order to make the discussions more natural. While the virtual format may have hindered the class from being able to partake in some minor class festivities (such as Yukikos tradition of sharing food during peer review workshops), class discussions remained just as engaging and lively as they would have in person. I do not have any critiques for the virtual format of this course."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student wanting to learn about the political bases and effects of trauma and how countries have worked with them. Yukiko is very kind and knowledgeable and she is extremely willing to help.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who enjoy looking at politics from a unique angle. Personally the course was not my cup of tea; it sometimes felt like we were doing a survey of past genocides and atrocities. We began with a reading on the formation of trauma as a concept, then moved on to anthropological studies that dealt with subjects like the Tulsa massacre, sexual slavery of Korean women in World War 2, the Hiroshima bomb, the massacres at Sabra and Shatila, Holocaust memory transmission, and the legacy of American slavery. I suppose I should have known that political memories tend to involve tragedy (and should have read the syllabus more carefully), but man, thinking through all that heavy material in the middle of a pandemic was difficult for me. I also don't come from an anthropology or social science background, and I had difficulty achieving the grades I wanted on reading responses and essays. It's a challenging course, but I did feel like I learned quite a bit. On the other hand, I'm not sure if it was worth the cost.",
                "Yes, but be sure you are interested in the topic. the course is fascinating and you learn SO MUCH but if you don't have an interest, you might be bored by the long readings. I would suggest shopping it if you are unsure because it's actually SUCH A COOL CLASS!!  I wish I had taken this in a semester with fewer courses so I could really focus on the content in a deeper way.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this class to any student, and any class with Yukiko!",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend it. This course encouraged deep reflective engagement on both personal and academic levels.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. In full honesty, this course made me constantly uneasy, as the concepts discussed were very sensitive and controversial, yet it was this uneasiness that made the course so insightful. One one hand, I would say that this is the most challenging yet most rewarding course I have ever taken at Yale. On the other hand, I would say that the concepts discussed in this course reveal how frustrating and sometimes unrewarding the politics of memory can be, knowing that the world is a broken place and that I play a role in this brokenness. Ultimately, I recommend this course because it has impacted me in a way that extends far beyond the confines of a four-month semester."
