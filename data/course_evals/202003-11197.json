            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The course is very organized in that the schedule on the syllabus is exactly how class goes. The homework is the same every week: fill in the blank\/vocab selection and reading comprehension. The tests are somewhat difficult, but with studying, they aren't a problem. A lot of it is geared toward memorization.  Also, Su lashi keeps class fun with his random stories from his younger days. \r\nWeakness: the expectations are somewhat unclear for presentations\/essays, which are a weekly thing. The scores seem somewhat arbitrary (though they tend to be pretty forgiving) in that there is not rubric.",
                "There aren't really any weaknesses about the course but it also depends on your mode of learning. Compared to the lower level Chinese courses, there is not much room for discussion in 162. Most of the class time was just the professor going over the lesson.",
                "Strengths: Su Lao Shi\r\nWeaknesses: More clarity on deadlines!",
                "Strengths: professor is really passionate about what he teaches and makes himself available for us students\r\nWeaknesses: (this is mainly just because everything is virtual) not enough time for students to stop and ask questions or really talk during class, seems more like a lecture",
                "Something that could be improved is having a way to check our homework answers. Su Laoshi mentioned wanting a teaching fellow and I think that would've solved a lot of the main issues I had, including the homework grading and more clear individualized feedback on the essays. Overall, the biggest weakness was that there was not much individualized feedback on homeworks, essays, and presentations. Either way, I still felt that I gained a lot just by finishing these assignments and listening to others' presentations.",
                "Strengths - my Chinese greatly improved, particularly my ability to read and write more formal and poetic essays. Su Laoshi does a good job in explaining the nuance of the language - for example, the way that traditional Chinese language construction is different from some of the Western-influenced language patterns that are in colloquial use today.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I would have liked more grammar and explanations about sentence construction. We went over this with examples and some intuition but sometimes I was still confused.",
                "Strengths: Su laoshi is so great. He always tells us stories from his past which I enjoyed. You learn so much more than just the Chinese language. Su laoshi does a great job of tying in stories from Chinese culture\/philosophy which makes this class that much more rewarding. Weakness: Only thing is that depending on your class size, sometimes you only speak once or twice in class which makes it hard to improve your speaking skills.",
                "The course really forces you to get out of your comfort zone in using Chinese and helps you practice your speech. I wish that there could be more time for students to practice speaking, since I feel that a good amount of time was put into lecturing.",
                "Strength: Su Laoshi",
                "This course focuses quite heavily on Chinese as if you were about to live thereusage of correct words, translating very quickly between Chinese and English, cultural connotations behind certain words and ideasand its very successful at that.\r\n\r\nHowever, I did feel that there wasnt very much opportunity to practice organically forming sentences and responses using new terms, so while my comprehension improved, my ability to do things with that comprehension isnt as high."

                "I LOVED this class!! I was able to make quite a few friends as a First-year, and a lot of it was through bonding over funny moments in class. I would absolutely recommend this class, especially if you're looking to expand your Chinese vocabulary and improve upon your Chinese fluency.",
                "For anyone trying to further their study in Chinese language, I would definitely recommend this course!",
                "Yes absolutely! The essays\/presentations can take some time but overall the course is relatively low stress. Su Lao Shi is also so amazing and if you're interested in Chinese definitely try to take a course with him :)",
                "Yes, a great way for anyone who is interested in improving their Chinese to take this class.",
                "Yes, I'm glad I took this course to keep practicing Chinese at college and beyond just a colloquial level.",
                "Yes! Su Laoshi is a really caring teacher and has a lot of unique personal and cultural experiences. I think the course does give you as much as you put in, but personally I found it really rewarding to see how much my language abilities increased. I think there is a particular focus on reading and writing (esp in a literary style) so make sure you find some time to practice speaking as well.",
                "Absolutely. If you grew up speaking Chinese at home and want to expand your skills and vocabulary this is a great class to take. It's a really rewarding if you genuinely want to learn about the Chinese language and its culture. You will meet some great friends who come from the same cultural background as you so that's another plus!!",
                "Yes, Su Lao Shi is a very interesting teacher with a lot to share. I think you'll like this course if you want a more casual and unstructured environment in learning Chinese. Do take note that the weekly vocabulary is a lot and you may need to commit a good amount of time every week to learning it.",
                "Absolutely yes! Su laoshi is a wonderful professor, and this course heightens your Chinese ability so much that you end up being able to write Chinese essays at the same ease as English essays.",
                "Yes! I learned a lot of cultural nuances that I hadnt known before, and I considered myself already quite ensconced within Chinese culture."
