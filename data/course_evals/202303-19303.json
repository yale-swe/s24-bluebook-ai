Dina Roginsky was an incredible, open-minded professor and I felt like I belonged in her class environment.",

Big takeaways are solid foundations in the root system, some verb forms, and in the written language (both script and block letters). I must say, the most impressive part of this course is how well you are able to read in Hebrew by the end."

                "For strengths, I'd say the class teaches a lot while simultaneously being low-stress. This is nice, as I can learn Hebrew without consistently worrying.\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, it is just difficult to meet 4 to 5 times a week. It can feel like a lot.",
                "Lots of homework",
                "Strengths: Prof Dina is fantastic! She gets everyone taking an engaged with the course, it starts out from the basics. The feedback quantity and quality is good. The course is well organized and structured. It provided many opportunities to engage with Israeli and Jewish culture through the Hebrew Tables and cultural events. Very inclusive to all backgrounds and religious beliefs. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The work is a lot! It's very very easy to fall behind but Prof Dina and the other students will support and help you catch back up.",
                "The course was very well organized, with opportunities to learn and practice new skills across all language domains (writing, reading, and speaking).",
                "Strengths: Nice variety of assignment, well-structured, quizzes were all take-home, teaching staff was lovely.\r\nWeaknesses: More of a complaint with Yale languages in general, but meeting 5x a week is a lot, and it really limited what other courses I could choose.",
                "The coursework, exercises, and exams are well structured to help students improve in writing and speaking. Each week follows the same structure with different vocabulary and grammar. The course provides a lot of extra resources for those interested.",
                "I had little to no grievances with the course or its structure, so I can't really think of any weaknesses. Biggest strength is its structure, which is really helpful for a class that has students of all different levels and backgrounds with the language. Dina is always prepared and sets up a great structure to learning, so as long as you show up to class (attendance is mandatory!), there is no way that you would not be able to learn the material. I came into this class with absolutely zero familiarity with the language, and there was never a moment where I felt like I was leagues behind any of the other students or that I didn't belong in the class. No matter what level you are, this class is structured for you to succeed so long as you can put forth some effort."

                "Yes!! Just be prepared to need to be really committed.",
                "Definitely! As someone who isn't Jewish and had no prior knowledge of the language, I didn't know what to expect coming in but it was the highlight of my semester. You will be shocked with how much of the language you are able to learn in just a couple of months. The small class size makes participation very easy and Prof Dina fosters such a fun, inclusive community for people of any background. But be warned, Modern Hebrew is not for the faint of heart! The daily homework and weekly quizes were definitely overwhelming at times but you just need to trust the process and do what you can to keep up. The work is hard but it is incredibly rewarding! And have I mentioned how great Dina is! TAKE HEBREW!",
                "Absolutely. In a short time, I gained elementary proficiency and can't wait to learn more next semester!",
                "Yes! It's a well-organized class and a great introduction to the language. The workload was pretty manageable, and all of the quizzes were online. If you need a language credit or are at all interested in Hebrew, I recommend it.",
                "Yes, this is the perfect course for anyone who wants to learn Hebrew.",
                "Absolutely, yes. I have taken several languages at Yale, and I have never been so invested in learning a language at Yale until I started taking Hebrew. In most other language courses, a lot of people are taking the class just to get their requirement out of the way, which is totally fine until it's the entire class doing that. Then, it just leads to you feeling like you're just wasting your time every day because no one participates and you spend most of the 50 minutes being cold-called. The way I see it, if I have to be in a class 4-5 times a week, I want to at least take something away from the course. Hebrew offered exactly that. Every person was taking the class for a different reason, and we all came from extremely different backgrounds. I totally anticipated it just being Jewish students, but there was a decent portion of us that weren't Jewish (and also notably a decent number of grad students and international students). I really got to know a lot of people in the class, including Dina, which was truly a treat. All in all, this Hebrew class will go down as one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale."
