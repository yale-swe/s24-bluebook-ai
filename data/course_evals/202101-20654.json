By the middle of the semester, we were all well versed in the structural properties and biological processes of trees which maintained a strong portion of about half the course. In the last third of the class, we learned about furniture, instruments, invasive species, carbon exchange, forest stages, limitations to tree growth, and climate change. As an Environmental Studies major, this course was a great way to explore trees in the context of climate change and the importance of trees in our ecosystem.",

I found most of the lectures to be very interesting and I thought the assignments and tests contributed to my learning and overall understanding in a way few classes do. The tests were also very straightforward and although semi challenging, they always felt like a fair test of my knowledge and growth in the class. I would have really loved maybe slightly less furniture/music info and more tree identification and practical identification knowledge.",

                "The lectures could be kind of try, as it was often hard to follow along with what was actually important for us to take away. It was difficult to study for tests given the lack of clarity about what would be on them and where we could find the material. Also, I was hoping I would learn more about tree identification from this course. \r\n\r\nBUT I really enjoyed everything else about the class! The assignments were all super engaging- the kinds of assignments that require you to walk around, explore campus, take pictures, and look at plant cells through a paper microscope. All of the discussions were also wonderful. People in this class came from all different backgrounds and majors (but all liked trees), so there were always quite a few different perspectives to draw on in discussion. \r\n\r\nOverall, the lectures could definitely use more clarity, but everything else about the course was fantastic.",

The sections were very interesting and I think very well adjusted to the online sphere. The assignments too were very flexible and I loved the combination of online and scavenger hunt/outdoor activities.",

There were lots of interactive activities that involved exploring the New Haven environment. We received foldscopes at the beginning of the semester so we were still able to conduct research on stem and leaf cells from home and then talk about it over zoom. Professor Brodersen also has a setup that made his zoom lectures very easy to understand and I never found myself distracted or lost within the powerpoints. I would say that lectures during the covid time are quite hard.  Knowing that watching the recordings later on 2x speed is an option makes it a lot harder to log onto zoom and go to class. This of course has no reflection on the course but on my work ethic this year and the challenges of Zoom fatigue. I can't imagine what the class looks like in a normal year with 200+ students in a big lecture hall.  I greatly enjoyed the intimacy of our course and the more personal learning.",

I love the premise of this class and I think its description honestly really describes the class so if you're excited by the description you'll really enjoy this class. Because it covers such a broad range of topics, I think it's only expected that some of the topics didn't interest me as much as others (like going into the biology further or specific applications in furniture) however I left with so much more knowledge than I came in with. I always had a fun fact or two from every lecture! Professor Broderson is engaging and warm and although I found the lectures occasionally boring, his energy and passion for the class are obvious and that makes every lecture more fun.",
                "Yes, absolutely!  (I already have) This course is a fantastic course that explores trees in all aspects. We really get to dive into the biology and science-y side of trees while also placing trees in a global lens and exploring their major impact on the world and on us as people. The activities each week are really fun and Interesting ways to apply our knowledge and learn through doing. One week, we were able to determine the age of a violin using the growth rings of the wood, definitely not something you get to do in any other course. There are scavenger hunts and field trips and guest lecturers and Professor Brodersen is fantastic. He enjoys what he teaches and he teaches it well.",
