                "I gained a better understanding of the Francophone world while learning more about French grammar! Specifically, I feel a lot more comfortable with: the subjonctif\/indicatif\/infinitif choice, \"tout\", le verbe devoir, le discours indirect, and les pronoms relatifs, among other subjects. I really enjoyed the selection of texts and films for this course since they give a broad survey not limited to France. Learning so much about WWII from Un Sac de Billes was also super insightful. I love how we got so many opportunities to practice speaking since I feel a lot more at ease with the language now.",
                "I developed a much better grasp on grammar, something I hadn't gotten enough teaching on during my high school French days.",

                "Strengths: small class size, organized class structure. Our class was <10 people so I feel like I always got a chance to speak and get to know my classmates well. I also think this contributes to a lot more comfort around oral activities. \r\nWeaknesses: At the start of the semester, I relied a lot on the syllabus for all my assignments but sometimes there were assignments (small ones) that were not on the syllabus. Not necessarily a weakness of the course, just something for future students to note and always pay attention to!",
                "I'm not sure if this is a weakness of the course or the French program in general but I feel like I was placed in a level too low for me. Oh well. It was easy!",
                "The strengths of this course is the immersion within class each and everyday. I feel like I understand French better each and everyday within the class. The failure within the course is the level of the other students. I feel like the quality of the other students in comparison to my French overwhelms me. They should not have been in the same class with me with their large knowledge and constant years of practice in high school, and I felt like my learning suffered because of that. The placement test was not an accurate representation because I took 3 semesters of French prior to this at Yale and still felt under prepared.",
                "The class was perfect in almost every way (mostly because Professor Burton made the class so comfortable and natural by combining the perfect mixture of critique and encouragement for language learning by). The structure of the class was extremely well-organized and thought out. It never became dull or repetitive or just about grammatical exercises. The break from grammar by reading novels made the class hugely enjoyable."

I think the Announcements feature on the FREN 140 Umbrella site could also have been used, but I have minimal complaints about that. The use of Zoom breakout rooms and sharing screens were both really helpful, so I think those are two features that my professor used well.",
                "The class did the best with what it had. I feel like the lack of going over the reasoning behind answers is a big one. We were just provided with the keys and not the reason behind the answer, and this hurt my ability to understand my mistakes. The same with not being able to see your test and the mistakes you made on those. I do not understand what I did wrong in most circumstances because the answers were hidden on the test, and this is the same for the oral portion.",

                "Yes, do take it!! As they say, \"Le franais, c'est la plus belle langue du monde.\" It's true, and Mme Burton is one of the best people with whom you should take it. Highly recommend staying on top of the audio recordings since I would often do those last, and I found that they would have been helpful to do those first in each day's assigned homework. I recommend taking any course with Mme Burton; she's very understanding, funny, and makes the class what it is!",
