                "Very interesting texts and engaging, group explorations of texts. Unfortunately, by necessity, DS often feels like cram studying each week.",
                "I think a clearer explanation of some of the harder philosophical topics would be useful - whether in additional online resources, handouts, brief introductions, or otherwise.",
                "Strong course load.",
                "The explanations of arguments via lectures and handouts were helpful but could have been made easier to understand since the texts themselves were already complicated and we could have used simple step by step explanations in plain language",
                "I liked the reading list a lot and Professor Maxwell was great so I definitely had a good experience. The only weakness I can think of is some of the lectures were way too jam-packed with information. For instance, we'd have a lecture on Kant that would cover 4-5 complex arguments and attempt to treat them in all their complexity in one hour. This is useful if you have time to go back and spend a few hours with the lecture slides but that's hard when the workload is already so high.",
                "Strengths: all round great course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes we don't go through all the really hard arguments in section. Still don't know how Fichte or Sellars work. It's hard stuff and I wanted to get to grips with it more.",
                "It might be helpful to spend some time at the beginning of the class learning the vocabulary of philosophy in order to be as precise as possible. The inclusion of Fichte's Foundation of Natural Right seemed a little strange in that it was a little obscure compared to philosophers not on the syllabus like Wittgenstein, William James, Heidegger, etc, who came up in lectures and seminars multiple times as influences on the ones we did read. Also, I felt like I would have gotten a lot more out of the Second Sex with a general grounding in existentialist philosophy first.",
                "It is a good survey course for modern Western philosophy, but it would benefit from a greater emphasis on the consequences of each thinker's thought. That is to say, we often spent all our time simply trying to comprehend each thinker rather than attempting to trace the larger impact each thinker's thought had. This is definitely due to the limited class time devoted to each thinker, as is characteristic of DS, but I feel it was a particular issue in modern philosophy. Whereas in ancient philosophy we'd discuss the immortality of the soul or what it means to adopt a stoic attitude, both of which have more apparent consequences for how we act on a day to day basis, in modern philosophy we'd investigate whether sense-perception is deceptive. I think it would be useful to offer greater context for those issues, perhaps by situating them in the scientific revolution and investigating their larger consequences."

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. Whereas the first semester feels like a bunch of different camps of thinkers, this semester you can really see how philosophy is progressing. It feels great to understand how each successive thinker is responding to his or her predecessors and pushing forward the way we think. It is definitely a grind at times and you will not love all the readings as you're doing them but when the ideas all come together it's cool, and I think that's the most you can ask for from a survey course like this.",
                "Absolutely. I went in thinking philosophy is a bit of a waste of time. I went out thinking much less so.",
                "Even if you weren't fond of Plato, Aristotle, and company, it's still worth considering second semester, as starting with Du Chatelet a lot less of the arguments are clearly silly and wrong than first semester. There is a lot of reading, but the lectures were very helpful for explaining the main arguments and possible objections to them.",
                "I would. The forms of thought introduced by the course will definitely broaden your mind and give valuable context for contemporary philosophy."
