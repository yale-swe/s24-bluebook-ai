                "Strengths: The course material itself is already interesting and engaging, but the passion that Professor Levit brings to the subject made the class all the more enjoyable. Robert, the course Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA), was instrumental in explaining difficult concepts that Professor Levit would sometimes breeze through during lectures. I truly do not believe that I could have made it through this intense class had it not been for Robert's understanding and support.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The grading in the class was frustrating and provided little room for students to learn from their mistakes. Assignments were returned months after they were due so that the feedback was no longer relevant and/or useful [and there were 11 students in this class]. The week-long take-home midterm and final exams set unrealistic expectations regarding what students could achieve. I spent an exorbitant amount of time on each, only to just barely understand the questions [and I believe I had a good grasp on the course material].",
                "The lectures were very strongly delivered by Arie. Robert was an amazing ULA who devoted a lot of time to the class via weekly workshops and office hours.\r\n\r\nThe take-home midterm turned out to be very hard, but the final was fair. As other students may have written, not getting feedback/grades back on time was a big problem. Otherwise, I think the class was amazing."

                "Yes, but probably not with Arie Levit (well, he's leaving after this semester anyway so this is irrelevant). The material was extremely interesting and very deep and my math maturity has grown more than with any other course in the math department so far. However, it was very disorganized. We didn't get pset grades back until a month later usually, and we got midterm grades back on the last day of classes...",
                "Yes, I would recommend taking this course with Levit. Sometimes his teaching style can be a bit disorganized, but he's on top of things where it counts, and, he makes up for the former by being reasonable and accomodating towards students. He made an effort to increase student engagement with the material this semester via student presentations, which was fun. In spite of a few hiccups, I would say the course overall was enjoyable and easy to recommend.",

                "Despite being a challenging course, I would 100% recommend this class. It is true that this class may be more or less difficult depending on who is teaching it though. \r\n\r\nAfter this class, I have a very clear understanding of what pure math looks like. Here are two reasons why I think you should take this (during a semester where your other classes are easier than this class):\r\n1) Algebra is a beautiful subject whose main purpose is to understand the structure of mathematical objects. You will view other math that you have already learned from a new perspective (e.g., matrices, polynomials, integers).\r\n2) There is a learning curve in the beginning, but I promise, a few weeks into the semester you will appreciate how much mathematically developed you've become already. Hopefully, you will want to take further classes to continue the sort of mathematical narrative that this class introduces you to.",
                "Yes! \r\nWell, if you're a math major, you probably need this course to take other interesting courses in Algebra. If you are not a Math major, Group/Ring theories are extremely fun fields with a lot of applications in other majors. I think this was the first time Arie was teaching this course and while he wasn't as fluent in teaching this material as Miki was, he made up for that by putting in 110%! \r\nOverall, yes!
