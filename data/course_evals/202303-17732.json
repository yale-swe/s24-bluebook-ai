                "I think the set-up of this class works very well--my only suggestion would be to focus a bit more on review in the beginning of the fall semesters (since it's after summer break).",
                "Strengths: Asynchronous hours were often quite fun and interesting. There is a lot of flexibility built into the class. Homework isn't super time-consuming and manageable with the other parts of the course, Professor was very accessible\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Grading wasn't done consistently. Sometimes, quizzes and exams were quite hard, particularly the receptive parts."

It is such a fun and cool language to learn and I love communicating with others with my hands and there was so much that I was able to learn about other people as a result.  I did hate signing naturally this semester so if possible I would nix it.",
