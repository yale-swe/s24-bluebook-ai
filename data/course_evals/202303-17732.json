Homework isn't super time-consuming and manageable with the other parts of the course, Professor was very accessible\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Grading wasn't done consistently. Sometimes, quizzes and exams were quite hard, particularly the receptive parts."

It is such a fun and cool language to learn and I love communicating with others with my hands and there was so much that I was able to learn about other people as a result.  I did hate signing naturally this semester so if possible I would nix it.",
