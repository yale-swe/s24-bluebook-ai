The lessons on how much to reveal the audience and how to approach time in our writing were especially helpful! I also learned how to participate in a workshop and give constructive feedback to peers.",

The syllabus was printed and updates to it were verbal / by hand. Several students in the class often checked in with one another to clarify homework assignment contents, which caused stress for everyone. Uploading assignments online would go a long way toward alleviating confusion & stressed.",
                "Strengths: close-knit group of classmates whom I could trust, written and oral instructor feedback, instructor's general attentiveness, class meeting structure\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: only one full workshop per student, lack of consistent momentum of writing (i.e., huge leap from short exercises to full-length stories, and only one full-length stories)",
                "I loved the emphasis that the course placed on writing regularly and then workshopping pieces with peers. The structured weekly exercises were great, and I loved how much freedom we had with the longer short stories. I wish there had been a few more small group workshops in addition to the class-wide workshops. I found the most effective critique session to be the small group workshop for the second short story."
