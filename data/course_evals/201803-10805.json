   "comments": [
    "My academic and literary reading ability was greatly enhanced. I feel more comfortable talking about academic topics in the humanities and social sciences at a high level in Japanese, and reading materials such as newspapers, novels, reports, and op-eds.",
    "This is an amazing course taught with care and consideration for each students needs. If you have made it this far in Japanese you will probably have a good idea of some of your strengths and weekness. Though this course focuses on reading, speaking in class about complicated themes that come up in the readings also helps with verbal communication skills. Overall, I definitely learned how to read texts more closely and discuss them in a more academic setting. We also read literature from many different periods so you learn how to interpret a bit of Meiji \/ kobun writing styles.",
    "I further improved my ability to read business and academic Japanese by gaining new knowledge of grammar patterns and vocabulary. Conversation skills were also emphasized through in-class and one-on-one discussions with the professor and a teaching fellow. Near the end of the course, we also learned to read some classics that used old Japanese syntax."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Great reading material, useful homework assignments, balanced workload.\r\nWeaknesses: By having more focused goals for what we learn over the course of the semester, it could be more clear exactly how I improved my Japanese.",
    "This is a great course! I really have no complaints or weaknesses to point to. If you like Japanese and literature you will love this course.",
    "Strengths: professor is very responsive to student feedback and also gives great feedback to students; class is overall engaging at all times and topics discussed are broad and usually interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing comes to mind, but if I had to pick out something, it would be that sometimes work would ebb and flow, with some readings being noticeably harder than others."

   "comments": [
    "If you're trying to take your Japanese to an academic\/professional level, this course is the first step. Mainly novels\/short stories and some social science materials in economics, history, sociology. Depends on the teacher but Hiroe sensei is excellent (as are pretty much all of the Japanese sensei!).",
    "Definitely take this course! If you are an advanced Japanese learner and want to learn how to read very meaningful and difficult texts, this class is for you!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to students interested in Japanese. The classes definitely seem to get more interesting and complex as you move into higher levels, and there is a lot of flexibility to study topics you are interested in since the class sizes are usually small enough that the professor can tailor certain portions of the course to individual students' interests."
