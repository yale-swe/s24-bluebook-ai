    "I got a better grasp and understanding of the grammar rules underlying certain parts of the Spanish language.",
    "Audited course: accelerated learning of Spanish and being able to have a basic conversation in Spanish.",
    "Enough Spanish to begin to engage with individuals in Spanish-speaking countries with some confidence.",
    "The ability to read, write, speak and listen in Spanish. I would say this class improved my writing, reading and grammar\/vocabulary more so than my speaking and listening - to improve the latter two as much as I wanted to, I had to do a lot of outside study on my own (listening to podcasts\/videos\/music in Spanish, having conversations with native speakers on online language exchange platforms). However, this course does give you a good foundation to build on as a stepping stone to improve your listening and speaking.",

   "comments": [
    "I enjoy the small classroom seminar-style format and enjoyed the opportunities to participate in the course. However, it would be great to be able to engage more and practise more real-world conversations as opposed to manufactured conversations based on a textbook on topics that are at times not relevant to us.",
    "Strengths- Professor Garcia is an amazing teacher.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- intensity, 5x\/week with 1hr of homework\/night is a lot.",
    "Strengths: This class is a great introduction to a new language and is organized in a way that is logical and intuitive. You learn how to speak, listen, read and write, and a sufficient amount of attention is given to each component. The class also incorporates many different learning styles (listening to music, Kahoot etc) which made it interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Daily homework can sometimes be a chore, but it really does help. One thing I would say is that it was slightly frustrating in the beginning to come into the class not knowing a thing about Spanish, but then having classmates with some prior knowledge about Spanish (from middle\/early high school). But ultimately this shouldn't hold you back from taking the class - as long as you work hard and commit to learning the language, you can advance and see incremental progress throughout the semester.",
    "Excellent course"

   "comments": [
    "Of course if you want to learn Spanish at Yale. Class size was really small so there was no where to hide in the back- you have to participate.",
    "Spanish I is an excellent course. The course covers fundamentals and reviews them. It builds nicely, and the Supersite homeworks are very helpful to practice the langauge.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. First of all, Spanish is a practical and relatively simple language to learn (compared to other more difficult ones). As long as you keep up with the material (and the class moves at a manageable pace), you should be able to hold conversations or write a basic, short composition in Spanish with relative ease by the end of the semester. Also, the class is taught in a way that incorporates many different learning styles (listening to music, Kahoot etc) which made it interesting.",
