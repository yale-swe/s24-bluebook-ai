                "The opportunities to talk to native speakers through LinguaMeeting and the conversation partner program as well as the small class size were definitely strengths in expanding opportunities to practice speaking in Spanish. Professor Seymour was also kind and enthusiastic, and the course's specific focus on grammar allowed us to delve into details that are often overlooked in Spanish curricula. Another strength was the way that the final grade did not depend too strongly on any one assignment, which helped minimize stress and, in my opinion, is a more fair means of grading. The only potential weakness I can think of is that the homework felt a bit like busywork sometimes, but this probably just a necessity of a grammar-based course.",
                "The different grammatical elements we covered in the course definitely expanded beyond what I had dealt with in AP Spanish in high school, and I came away feeling much more well-equipped to express complex thoughts. The built-in conversational aspects of the class like LinguaMeeting and compaeros de conversacin also added a lot to my skills and confidence.\r\nThe main weaknesses of the course were that it was online, and so that made it a bit harder to engage sometimes. However, Prof. Seymour definitely made the online format work.",
                "strengths : Professor was very engaging. Even through an online format, we started off every class by asking each of us how our personal lives were going and what we were up to. Weaknesses : A lot of different tasks. Homework was very consistent between accuracy work, quizzes, completion work, conversations, and recordings.",

Furthermore, student participation was a central component of this class, with breakout rooms each session and group participation to help keep us engaged. This may just have been my personal feeling, but, due to the fact that all of our interactions with one another were in a second language, I felt an extra dimension of disconnection from the class community that we would have formed during a normal year, but I'm not sure that there is any clear way to improve upon this.",

I enjoyed the course, especially the Linguameeting and conversation partners components, which gave us the opportunity to talk with native speakers. The workload is consistent but not heavy, and you also get to read short stories and watch movies.",

                "Yes, this is a great class for anyone looking to improve their Spanish skills (especially conversation), particularly if they are interested in Spanish grammar specifically. The workload is reasonable, and the balance between breadth of topics and depth of discussion of each topic was perfect, in my opinion. The opportunities to converse with native speakers (as well as my classmates) helped me feel significantly more comfortable speaking, and I feel like I have a much firmer grasp of many aspects of Spanish grammar than I did before the course. Prof. Seymour is kind, provides ample feedback, and sets a joyful tone for the class. Overall, a great course!",

                "If you want to improve your Spanish quickly, take this course.",
                "I would recommend this class to another-- It was quite difficult at times, but if you are interested in improving your spanish/confidence in speaking spanish, it is a wonderful class to do so. If you are looking to simply check off your language requirement, I may hesitate given this was a large class to be taking work wise, where every other night I would have to set aside most of the night to be working through the homework. Still doable.",
                "If you love learning Spanish, then yes. I think the class would've been difficult if I didn't already love the language. I wouldn't recommend this class if you are just trying to fulfill a requirement."
