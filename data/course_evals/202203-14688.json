                "I learned how to write more efficiently than ever- this course enables you to learn core concepts involved with academic writing that translate usefully to other courses. You also learn to zoom in very well on small details and build close reading skills, which allowed me to write over 5 pages on less than 10 lines (something I had never done before). Time-management is also a key skill embedded throughout this course.",
                "Most importantly I learned how to write better, but also how to read faster and how to balance my workload. We read and discussed the texts and pulled themes from them. I learned how to work together with peers and through discussion come to interesting conclusions.",
                "I learned how to write in a more focused and concise manner. Professor Valdivieso was very clear with her demands for how we ought to write, and helped us improve our writing with step-by-step, achievable exercises (e.g. rereading our work to cut unnecessary adverbs and adjectives). In terms of the course as a whole you also develop the ability to read more quickly and effectively, especially given the extremely heavy reading load coupled with regular essays.",
                "I am a much stronger reader and writer. DS Lit has forced me to read actively and to consider themes and connections between texts, and yet also be open to changing and reshaping ideas during section.",
                "I like to think that my writing improved while taking this course, and my ability to close read.",
                "I developed significantly as an academic writer, since the regular reading responses (1 per week) as well as the papers offered a lot of training on which I received very useful and productive feedback from my instructor.\r\n\r\nThe focus on close reading-analysis helped me discover ways to engage meaningfully with a text without any secondary source material and thus made me more confident in developing and defending my own interpretation of it. This was a significant step for me in terms of producing original texts in an academic setting.\r\n\r\nI learnt new and meaningful ways to engage with ancient literary texts and literary texts in general - how to connect them thematically and stylistically; how later writers were influenced by earlier writers.\r\n\r\nI became a more intentional book-annotater and reader because of the amount of text I had to go through every day. Reading the course material was extremely rewarding.",
                "Academic essay writing skills improved drastically, particularly close reading skills. Ability to interpret texts and articulate interpretations also developed a lot.",
                "The instructor brought in context that added nuance to our conversations, as well as providing knowledge about classical reception.",
                "I gained a whole new way of reading texts--I feel much more focused and sharp when reading books I deemed too difficult before, and I learned how to digest a lot of text in a short amount of time."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: teaches you to write well and quickly, emphasizing values like the economy of language and getting to analyze fundamental texts throughout the Western canon. This propagated a greater interest and understanding in such topics for me.\r\nWeaknesses: Not much thoroughness with each of the texts, since there is such little time to cover each book. A lot of reading for each class as well.",
                "I really enjoyed this class, it was probably my favorite one. I think the way the professor instructed the seminars was nearly perfect. She allowed us a lot of time to discuss and bounce ideas off each other while still taking time to explain the stories and move us along.",
                "A key strength of the course I appreciated was that there was a clear logic to why certain texts were chosen; following the development of the 'Western canon' chronologically allowed me to see the connections between texts and traditions, as well as how successive texts built on one another. A weakness is that there might have been too much time spent on particular texts, such as the Aeneid or the Gospel of Matthew, that could have been used instead to cover other texts.",
                "I think that the strengths and weakness are entwined. Each text in the enormous breadth of literature covered this semester was fascinating, and as a whole, the course structure gave me an intimate look at a certain, but certainly not the only, literary tradition. On the other hand, I felt like I would equally enjoy a course in which we read and analyze any one of these works in greater depth.",
                "I really loved the discussion sections and how Professor Valdivieso facilitated those, as well as her writing feedback.  I just wish we didn't have to move quite so fast, only taking 2 days for Dante's Inferno was really tough for example.",
                "Overall I was extremely happy with this course. Sometimes I wished we would have had the literature lecture before we started reading the texts, or at least earlier in the reading process, since they enriched the reading experience.\r\n\r\nOur class discussions were extremely interesting and well-moderated by professor Valdivieso, in a way that we felt free to talk about what had interested us the most, but at the same time were guided through the reading process and through how to interact meaningfully with the texts. Professor Valdivieso made me feel well-prepared for writing my papers as well as my final exam. Her regular weekly assignments ensured that at least most of the class stayed on top of the reading material (since we had to submit something related to its content for every class), which I am convinced made our discussions more lively and interesting. \r\n\r\nSomething I thought would be a bigger part of DS, however, is an ongoing discussion on the legacy of the text we read, within the literary tradition but also regarding how the narratives may have inspired or been used to justify actions and practices, for example within the context of colonialism or environmental destruction. We did address this in class from time to time, but if there would be a way to incorporate more contemporary readings of the texts into the program in a more systematic way I am convinced a lot of students would be very positive towards that.",
                "Strengths:\r\nEngaging, easy to discussion sections that included a variety of activities. Fascinating lectures that effectively framed the texts we read. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSometimes felt like we had a few too many time consuming discussion posts so maybe class could be improved by cutting down on the number of required discussion posts.",
                "It really does expose you to a breadth of knowledge that is useful for understanding other things later on; for example, when I was reading someone's thesis on rage in classical texts, so many of the characters and referenced books made sense because I had read them before. However, the course went by way too fast and I had a difficult time processing everything and I feel like I will have to go back and reread them in order to truly understand what was happening."

                "yes. prof valdivieso is a tough grader but she is incredibly knowledgeable and helped me improve my writing more than I thought would be possible",
                "Yes, especially with an incredible professor like Prof. Valdivieso. She is very thorough with criticism and easy to talk to, and she made the class dependent on how much work you put in.",
                "Yes, DS 001 Literature is a great class. The stories and texts we cover aren't only intriguing but also teach us much about the past and ourselves. While the workload is a lot the skills you learn are definitely worth it.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to understand the intellectual background\/foundation\/context behind works of Western literature. However the necessary trade-off is that there is relatively little engagement with texts outside of this Greco-Roman-Christian tradition - I liked the inclusion of Andalusian poetry this year but many students might feel unrepresented in discussions of these texts.",
                "Definitely. DS' pace and amount of reading can be frustrating, but it is ultimately deeply rewarding and useful.",
                "Yes, most definitely.  I would warn them that it is by no means easy, but that if they want to read some excellent literature and meet a great group of friends then they should take this course.",
                "Yes, texts were significant and well selected to form a great snapshot of the western literary cannon. Despite covering a ton of texts we still were challenged to developed nuanced interpretations of the texts in both discussions and essays. Was always excited to attend class and although it was a lot of work my reading and writing skills improved a ton.",
                "Although I actually liked DS Lit and I'm truly appreciative of what I learned, the answer would be no. DS caters to a specific kind of student, and even if you want to learn, it can be hard to keep up if you're not used to that level of intellectual rigor\/if you don't spend all your time on work and actually have a life.",
                "Yes, it gives you an amazing basis at ancient western literature and it challenges you to think about a lot of different aspects of the west."
