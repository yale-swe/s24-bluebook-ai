                "Yes I would. I have taken a lot of English classes at Yale, and Romanticism as a concept gets thrown around a lot. This class, more than any I've taken, has finally helped me get a real grasp of what that movement meant, especially to the poets who were writing during it. If you are wanting to take this class because you want to read the niche Romantic poets, that isn't what is focused on. You start with Blake, then Wordsworth and Coleridge, then Shelley and Byron. The poet focused on the most is definitely Wordsworth, and his influence will appear throughout the class and other poets. So if you want to learn more about Wordsworth, especially \"The Prelude,\" then this class might be good for you.",
