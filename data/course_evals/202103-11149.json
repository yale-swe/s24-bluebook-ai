                "I gained greater insight into the complexities of Spanish grammar, increased my fluency in spoken Spanish, and practiced reading and writing in Spanish at a college level.",
                "This course is aptly named. You will learn Spanish grammar, and I want to emphasize the fact that this course is indeed advanced. For people who have taken L4 courses in the past (or even L3), you will recognize a lot of the basic concepts: subjunctive, imperfect\/preterito, etc. However, this course takes it to a much further level, and it moves quite quickly. \r\nAlthough this course is focused on written evaluations, you will have ample opportunity to practice speaking. The entire course is taught in Spanish, including office hours, emails, etc. As part of the curriculum, you will practice with native speakers in two ways. The first is a multi-week online coach whose weekly lessons correspond to one of the grammatical concepts you have been learning about. The second is a \"pen pal\" of sorts. You will have four one hour meetings, half in English half in Spanish, with a college student living in Ecuador.",
                "I learned most of the rules with subjunctive in different connective phrases, relative pronouns, some nuances of specific verbs, and various other grammatical tools. I also got to practice speaking with a language coach and a student from Ecuador. I learned the official rules of Spanish which I didn't really know all too well before.",
                "Great class to take to help solidify advanced Spanish grammar and feel more comfortable and fluent in reading, writing, and speaking.",
                "I definitely improved my speaking skills through the LinguaMeeting and Compaeros de Conversacin sessions!",
                "I took this as a Spanish refresher course after taking a year off (I took L3 and L4 my freshman year). This course SIGNIFICANTLY improved my Spanish in all conceivable areas- speaking, listening, writing, etc. I became more fluent and my vocabulary also improved.",
                "Specific facets of Spanish grammar really well; lots of subjunctive and some work with adjectives\/pronouns that I'd always wondered but never known.",
                "Before starting this class, I had never formally learned Spanish. I learned Spanish from my parents as a native speaker, so my grammar was unpolished and my vocabulary was not too extensive. I learned so much more about proper Spanish grammar and picked up on vocabulary as I went along. I gained confidence in my speech as I felt I had more control over my speech to get my intended meaning out."

            "comments": [
                "For strengths, all of the course materials are very well laid out to help you develop a thorough understanding of each topic, even though they can be hard. The lectures, combined with textbook explanations, homework, readings, movies, are timed perfectly so that you build upon each new topic. The course does move very fast, but the timing of assignments and assessments in the syllabus was never outrageous. It is also a perfect size of course to be able to ask questions and have enough time to practice speaking. In short, if you are willing to give this course enough time (and I am talking 1-2 hours for homework between each class plus any meetings or office hours), you will absolutely improve your understanding of Spanish language. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of weaknesses, I believe we could have had more structured conversations to practice the grammar spoken instead of just written. The only formal spoken assessment we had was a short debate at the end of one class. Although I greatly improved my grammar when writing, I need more practice in a classroom setting speaking what I have just learned and getting feedback on the spot when I made mistakes. Things like the language conversation exchanges were nice, but the other university student was not going to correct my grammar every time I made a mistake in Spanish.",
                "The strengths are definitely the language partners to practice speaking, the professor is very supportive and knowledgeable, the textbook is really well written and we follow it along very closely so it was a good read. Another strength are that the assessments are fair, both the exams and essays although sometimes I feel as though we had too many assignments and it did feel a like a constant grind that was a little frustrating. Exams are really simple if you just read the textbook, they basically test exactly what the textbook mentions. The weaknesses are probably that a lot of the time in class we just review the assigned textbook reading so if you did the reading then basically class was a little redundant although it seemed many people didn't do the reading anyway. I think this class could have a little less homework but besides that great class,.",
                "Great variety of interaction with Spanish culture, ranging from movies to articles to stories. Also had the opportunity to have an exchange program with students in Ecuador to practice speaking. The workload is heavier due to being an L5 course however manageable as the professor was organized and pre posted many assignments.",
                "strengths:interactions with native speakers. weaknesses: overwhelming amounts of work that did not really seem relevant for advancing communication skills",
                "Strengths- frequent practice (homework and in-class discussions and activities) improved my fluency; tests and assignments were straightforward and explained well; conversation partners were fun and helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- honestly, aside from my own personal failings, I dont think this course is flawed in any significant way. Its basically a continuation of L1-4, but in a way that will improve your Spanish significantly. I think it could be boring for some people, but for me the intellectual challenge of the language learning process was enough!",
                "Strengths: lots of practice speaking and writing\r\nWeaknesses: not enough practice with the topics after them being explained in class. We'd have homework assigned before class that had to do with the new topics, so I'd struggle through figuring out how it worked, and then once it was explained in class there wasn't any work to cement the new knowledge in.",
                "The course was definitely demanding and required a lot of work, but that is what forced me to become better at Spanish. All of the writing practice helped me understand the grammar rules a lot better. The homeworks due before class were helpful for getting familiarized with the content and getting some practice in for the content of the week. It was great that they were graded based on completion, as it really was just meant as practice rather than being a stressful assignment. I appreciated the variety of assignments given, which meant your grade did not heavily rely on one single element. The exams were reasonable, the papers were about fun topics, and the lectures were very engaging. The professor was very understanding about conflicts with deadlines and class, and was always willing to help you in the course in one way or another. She was a great teacher and person overall which made her class conducive to learning as well as enjoyable. It was also great to get a taste of Latin American culture through the stories we read and the movies we watched for the course."

                "Yes! This course is named appropriately, so if you are interested in Spanish grammar, you will love the class. If you are just looking for an L5 course and don't love grammar, then probably take something a little bit less intense. However, it does exactly what it aims to, and I have become a better writer and speaker because of the course.",
                "Yeah this course is a must take for anyone serious about improving their Spanish. It builds the fundamental grammatical understanding that will allow to rapidly grow in the future. The textbook is well written and should provide a good reference for later if you wish. The class is really fun and we got to do several fun activities including a debate and watch movies. Getting a good grade is not terribly difficult 94% for an A so if you study and do the homework you will be fine. Professor Seymour is very kind at her office hours if you have questions too. Be aware though that this class does have a good amount of homework but it is pretty evenly spread so its more or less manageable.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course. I loved the culture immersion and the confidence it gave me in my Spanish writing, speaking and grammar.",
                "I would recommend this class ONLY if they have the time to dedicate to the workload and really practice their spanish grammar. I wish the class emphasized speaking a little more and growing in our communication skills as opposed to super technical grammar.",
                "I think students serious about improving their Spanish should take this course. It isnt what I would consider a fun course, just because it focuses so much on grammar and is basically structured like a lower level language class, but man my Spanish got so much better. It is also a TON of work- you have ~ an hour of homework before every class, and you meet three times a week. On top of that, there are a ton of writing assignments and extra stuff like Zoom meetings with language partners. Be prepared to work really hard in this class, but it will pay off!!",
                "Yes, if you're looking specifically to improve your grammar. I don't know if my Spanish improved tons in a broad sense, but I'm no longer making grammatical mistakes that I didn't even know were mistakes before.",
                "Yes, but only if you truly care about improving your Spanish skills to a high level as the course is a lot of work. If this is your goal, then you can expect to learn a lot and have fun in the process. Professor Seymour has done a great job picking the stories and movies to structure the lessons around, and she is a wonderful teacher and person so I definitely recommend taking the class with her."
