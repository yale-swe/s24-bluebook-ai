                "I learned the standard techniques of architectural representation (section, plan, elevation). I also learned more about the iterative process of design and how to express ideas physically.",
                "I improved my ability to brainstorm design processes, produce a design narrative, and share my design process and narrative.",
                "This class was my first studio as an official architecture major. Not only was I challenged to explore form at its purest extent, I was given room to explore multiple mediums to represent it through drawings, both digital and hand-drawn. Despite sometimes feeling stuck or burnt out creatively, I picked up technique son how to refresh and find passion in the projects again through inspiration or well-written prompts.",
                "I learned how to apply a strict rule set in order to bring order and sense to creative ideas. I greatly improved my software skills as well as my technical drawing techniques. I feel like I really learned how to work through all my ideas and materialize them into the 3d and 2d form.",
                "I gained many skills such as knowledge of Rhino, model-making, and drawing from this course.",
                "I experimented a lot with space and planes in this class. I refreshed my Rhino and Illustrator skills. I improved my technical drawing skills.",
                "I developed my model making skills and my spatial awareness with this course. I also learned baseline skills, like line-weight in plans and sections, how to use rhino for projects, and managing my projects."

            "comments": [
                "strengths: Lots of consistent and clear feedback. Personal attention from all instructors made me feel very supported throughout the semester. Stimulating assignments that allowed for significant creative latitude. Nice mix of technical and expressive work, with a heavier weight on the expressive stuffa good structure for an introductory architecture studio, I think. Emphasis on collaboration.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: Could have used more guidance on how to document process. Occasionally some readings and precedents were given, but it would have been helpful to have a central place where all these references were listed. Sometimes the prompts or feedback were a little silly, but I think this is just an architecture thing.",
                "This course was strong in its overarching theme of learning through section. I appreciated how projects built upon one another, and while some students wished there to be more distinct projects, I really appreciated the strong through narrative behind every project. I think it allowed for more room to dig deeper into design. I think this course was so concept rich, that I wish there was more technical training built into class time. I spent so much time outside of class building, that it would've been helpful to have more in class time practicing technical skills like rendering or rhino tutorials. One session for 30 minutes didn't feel like enough.",
                "Strengths: extremely attentive TFS, consistent desk critiques, good space to work in, dont feel restricted to just buildings, get to explore many types of materials for model making and mediums for drawings \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: felt slightly detached from the world, with more technical exercises that werent grounded in a place or a social context, felt a bit disconnected from my projects sometimes. Would appreciate more inclusion of urban studies and history.",
                "I think a bigger focus on software tools or real life application could be helpful. Sometimes it feels a bit abstract, but overall I loved this course and feel as though I learned how to think like an architect.",
                "Strengths: Hard work always paid off because I learned many skills, knowledge of Rhino, and how to self-evaluate. The course strengthened reflection and analytical skills. The course taught me a lot!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes when desk crits switched professors\/TFs too often it was hard to make large progress without repetiting oneself.",
                "I thought this class was overall very good. It was engaging and challenging. It was difficult at times to get inconsistent feedback from Professor Barrett and Professor Garcia and our Teaching Fellows. Crits were good time to get work done and have feedback from your professors and teaching fellows but if you needed feedback at a specific time about a specific thing usually our peers became the better people to go to. I also wouldve enjoyed more lectures about theories of architectural creation or ideas that were relevant to topics we were discussing in studio (such as push\/pull, stretching, repetition, these are all words we use and understand but how have they historically functioned in architectural terms?)."
