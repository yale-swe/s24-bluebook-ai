                "I think the material is interesting but the professor was absent for much of the course. He cancelled many classes last minute and failed to assign homework and projects like he promised, resulting in a chaotic class experience. We never got grades or feedback for the few assignments we did do. It was difficult to stay engaged with the material and actually learn anything with such inconsistent instruction.",
                "The course talked a lot about Verilog at the beginning but had no real assignments on Verilog. Similarly, we never got to access an actual FPGA board, only discussed the potential security issues with certain configurations. Although I found the topics interesting, the course was not super organized and the plan changed many times.",
                "I wish you learned more verilog and did more hands on programming.",
                "Not many strengths in the current state. The weekly research paper reading assignments were very dry as the content was not at all geared towards an undergraduate audience, although the papers did a good job of ground the course content in modern practices and the latest developments in the field of cloud computing with FPGAs. The lectures attempt to teaching code through slides which ends up making the entire semester incredibly unengaging."

                "In its current state, where Professor Szefer clearly has a host of commitments that require his attention ahead of this course, I would absolutely recommend NOT taking this course. Your learning will suffer as most of the things listed in the course description were not effectively addressed. If you are expecting to learn Verilog in this course, look elsewhere: the first time the students themselves were asked to attempt Verilog was on the midterm, and the next was the final project. Throughout the semester, the already sparse project was stripped even more as students simply did not possess the technical understanding to carry out an actually interesting project. It would be a better use of your time to get a Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA board and follow youtube tutorials to learn about FPGAs than enrolling in this course."
