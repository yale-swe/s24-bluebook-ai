                "The course is very engaging and interactive. My teacher was also extremely helpful. She was the best.",

Canvas made it so difficult for me to go back and review homework, tests, and quizzes that I would often not do any review at all. If not for the links in the Microsoft Word weekly schedule we download from the website, I would not have been able to find anything on Canvas."
