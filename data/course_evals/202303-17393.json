                "This class taught me so much about Haiti that I never would have otherwise known. Each class we discuss a new topic ranging from the environment and the 2010 earthquake to the Vodou relgion and the language of Kreyol. At the beginning of the course, we all read a book about Haiti's history which is arguably the most interesting part of the course. Each student also leads the class once which improves presentational skills.",
                "I feel I learned valuable writing and presentations skills in this class. Each student had to present and teach the class for a full hour on a specific chosen topic. I think that this was a very useful skill to practice that you dont get experience with in most other courses.",

                "I think this course was so involved I really enjoyed it.",
                "Strengths: Professor Geballe makes this class casual in the best way possible. He is extremely (!) flexible with the essay deadlines, cares about each student, and is quite funny. The student-led seminar aspect of the class is also very interesting. Overall, the class is very laid back and definitely a gut while also engaging.\r\nWeaknesses: I would not say that I came out of this class a better writer. The only feedback\/edits I really got were to not use \"it\" or \"there\" and to cite more completely. Professor Geballe is amazing but he is not an expert about Haiti. He's more there to facilitate your learning through books\/outside sources. Almost everything you learn is from your classmates and reading.",
                "Strengths: very low-stress about grades makes the class enjoyable so you can focus more on learning. Professor Geballe is always very welcoming and often available to meet one-on-one so you can get individual attention for your papers\/presentations. Classes are enjoyable and you develop friendships with your classmates because of the limited class size. Deadlines are very manageable and Professor Geballe is flexible if you ask ahead of time. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I wouldve liked more criticism on my writing as most of the comments were short and small changes.",

                "I highly recommend this course to another student. I found it so interesting and informative, even with having not a lot of prior knowledge of Haiti.",
                "Absolutely! I am extremely glad I took this course.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Geballe is a wonderful instructor and creates a welcoming, fun environment. I am grateful to have taken a seminar with him and felt good about not worrying too much about my grades but rather focusing on improving my writing and presenting. I feel like if you put the work in, show up to class, and schedule some time to meet with Professor Geballe out of class it is not difficult to do well.",
