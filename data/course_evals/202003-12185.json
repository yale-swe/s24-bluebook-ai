At the beginning of the semester, I was very uncomfortable with the idea of performing alone in front of other people, but the class built up my confidence and comfort-level with performance.",

                "One of the strengths of this class was its size. We took this class in a virtual format, which made it especially nice to have 8 classmates. I knew everyone pretty well by the end of the semester and it was comfortable to workshop with peers. I also appreciate the range of plays we watch. We watched pieces where one actor took on several characters, monologues, and stand-up comedy. The professor is also extremely accommodating and encouraging, while still providing helpful criticism. There were some limitations due to the Zoom format, but the class was still enjoyable. I am a proponent of more acting exercises in the class. Though it isn't really an \"acting\" class, I think it would be really helpful to do more activities to help students who are a bit less comfortable with performing. Also, I would prefer that we read more stories and plays than materials on creative method. I really enjoyed some readings, though, such as Murakami.",
                "Strengths: Hal Brooks, the course material \r\nWeaknesses: some of the paper assignments aren't as clear as they can be",
                "This was a great community building course, and taught me a lot about one person plays and how to write them. I think there is a bit of an imbalance between composing and performing, and I wish we spent more time working on performing and a little less composing.",
                "strengths: great way to express yourself and try something new (you're a freshman only once so take this course even if you're not a theater studies major), great sort of creative break from the rest of your mathy classes, awesome professor, dedicated peers\r\n\r\nweaknesses: i guess maybe assignments could've been given earlier in the week so we didn't end up doing them on the weekends",
                "Strengths: Hal is a great professor, all of the course material is very interesting, and you develop a strong bond with your classmates even over Zoom.\r\nWeaknesses: I still think there could be more opportunities to perform\/write in class. Overall I was happy with how much we got to do this semester, but I also realize that our class size was somewhat smaller than a usual year, so I just think that it's something to pay attention to.",
                "The strengths included Hal's valuable insights into our work provided through comments on essays or feedback after performances.",
                "The class exercises were all incredibly interesting and engaging. All of the selected pieces we had to review were also great. It was such a wonderful class that I can't think of any way to make it any better than it already is.",
                "Strengths: the class environment is super welcoming and encouraging, the acting\/writing exercises are fun, there is a lot of variety in the one-person plays we viewed, Hal is a kind and approachable instructor who made the class enjoyable, this class really lends itself to bonding with other students -- these elements all make it an ideal first-year seminar\r\nWeaknesses: There's a bit of a learning curve for students who don't have theater experience. It would've been nice if we had more guidance in composing the short one-person play itself and more opportunities for critical feedback. The class could be a little more organized -- we'd sometimes receive assignments a little late in the week"

            "comments": [
                "The class was largely successful because it was small. A lot of classes felt depersonalized. This class managed to avoid that. I think 2-hours is a long time to sit in front of a screen, but we usually got a break in the middle. I would advocate for either a longer break, or two short breaks. I liked that in this class people mostly had their cameras on, though I understand that no teacher can mandate that.",
                "I wish we had had some in-person elements, but overall, I think we did what we could and I learned a lot",
                "I think that this class was one of the best examples of a Zoom class working well. Because of the nature of the one-person play, being alone in your room doesn't interfere with the creative process as much as it would in a more collaborative theatrical setting. Although I would have loved to take this class in person, it was fun to play with what Hal described as \"zoominess\" in our works: technical elements like frame shifts, moving closer or farther away from the camera, and virtual backgrounds, for example. I really don't have any suggestions for how to improve, because I think that the course embraced it in a really effective way.",
                "The Zoom performances while interesting and conducive to learning still took away from the performances ultimately. Unfortunately, better solutions aren't easy to find.",
                "The instructor's encouragement for us to embrace the new virtual format in our own plays was perfect, as it led to some really interesting and creative approaches towards making a one person play that was truly unique to our situation.",
                "The nature of this class made it adapt really well to a virtual format, and it ran pretty smoothly for the most part. I would've liked to see more breakout rooms, however, because we didn't really get many opportunities to chat with our classmates as we would've in a normal year."

This course was a highlight of my week and is a really great way to get to know yourself and your peers. Also, Hal lives up to the hype! He is very attentive to each individual student's needs, and he always brings a positive, easy-going vibe to the classroom.",
                "Yes, this course facilitates development in a niche area of performance that is rare to practice.",
                "Yes! While out of many's comfort zone, this class promoted a supportive and encouraging atmosphere that could put all of the class at ease about performing. This course was so much fun, and I am very glad I took it in my first semester at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course to a specific kind of student -- one who is passionate about theater\/creative writing and has decent time-management skills. The weekly work is actually pretty light, but a big chunk of this course is writing two complete one-person plays, which takes a ton of patience, creativity, time, and discipline. We also had to write three pages in our journals each day. Don't take this class if you just want an easy A -- take it if you're actually extremely interested in theater and playwriting and willing to devote lots of time to practicing your craft."
