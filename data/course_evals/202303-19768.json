                "Undergrad students in this class MUST have swipe access to the print shop!  We did not not semester.",
                "A major strength is Professor Kidanu, she was kind and helpful and clearly passionate about her subject! The course was well structured and we learned so much, this led to it being a bit stressful and fast-paced at times, but I wouldn't want to have missed out on anything either. I also appreciated our discussions on printmaking as a medium rather than a focus on exact editioning or technical perfection. My major frustration with the course doesn't have to do with the professor/course itself, but rather the printshop and the limited hours as you can't access it without a graduate student monitor unlike the other art buildings (7-12(midnight) M-Thursday + 2-10 Sunday). We often had things due Monday, and it was always a stress as the weekend was unaccounted for and I personally felt uncomfortable walking back from the printshop alone at midnight or in the dark which is anytime past 5-6. I will commend Professor Kidanu for recognizing this limitation and being flexible, allowing students to come in before class time to finish any last things, but I hope the SOA will prioritize undergraduate access in the future.",
                "Though the expectations were high for our work during the course, this challenged me to engage further with the course and create a substantial body of work. I learned a massive amount in a very short amount of time and made work that I am proud of. Hasabie was a thoughtful, helpful professor who pushed us to create a high level of work and helped create a strong sense of community among the class.",
                "In addition to this course, I would love to see more classes offered in printmaking so that we can spend a longer period of time on each medium. I'm so thankful for the broad introduction to each process, but regardless of how well the course was structured, there should be more classes within the discipline, like how there are classes dedicated to specific foci in painting, drawing, sculpture, and photo etc.",
                "Strengths: Has; expectations were very clearly laid out; we had class time to work on assignments\r\n\r\nWeakness: The main issues I felt the class had were not so much due to the class itself. Rather, most of the issues had more to do with the print shop. There was always ~something~ wrong in the printshop--washroom being flooded, people stealing screens, not having enough cleaning materials, etc etc. Also, the shop hours being from 7Pm-12AM M-Th made it very inaccessible. While I loved the class, I was very frustrated by the state of the print shop.",
                "I think a mixed bag of this course is that because the overview of printing styles was so thorough and diverse, there was sometimes a quick turnaround between projects, which was complicated by the fact that the print studio was mostly open just at night and closed Fridays and Saturdays. But none of this was the instructor's fault and I think Hasabie did a great job in terms of course organization, critical feedback, theory, and support."

                "Yes, it was awesome!",
                "Absolutely!! This class was AMAZING and so well organized. Has is just the best. I went into this class having no prior experience printmaking and came out of it feeling like I really understand what makes this medium so special. The language of printmaking is uniquely fascinating, both conceptually and visually.",
                "Absolutely! It was a fantastic course that exposed me to so many types of printmaking and make me think about the medium in an entirely new way. Just as an example, we discussed the why prints can lose value if more are made and is the person printing or the thing being printed the \"important\" part. I also learned a lot about print history like about Corita Kent, who I had never heard of in my past art classes. If you're at all interested in printmaking or even just want to explore beyond painting/drawing definitely take this course. That being said, like most art classes, there is time needed outside of class. Ideally, you can make the most of class time, but if you work slowly you then have to navigate the printshop's weird hours (unless that's fixed). This is a time intensive medium, but for me at least it was definitely well worth it!",
                "Yes, absolutely.",
                "Absolutely; the work is engaging and exciting, and because the printshop is only open in the evenings it is easy to balance time spent there alongside other classes, regardless of whether or not you are an art major.",
                "Yes, but only if you're willing to come to the printshop behind the School of Art VERY frequently.",
                "Great for getting an overview of a bunch of stuff hahahah",
                "Yes! Hasabie is amazing and the readings and context provided for printmaking was really great. The class is a lot of work, as there is crit almost every week, but it is absolutely worth it."
