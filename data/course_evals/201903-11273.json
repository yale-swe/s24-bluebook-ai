   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Helpful problem sets and practice exams\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures",
    "I thought that this course moves at a reasonable pace, but you definitely should always try and go to class. That being said, the textbook is pretty clear and helpful.",
    "The lectures is well organized.\r\nI would recommend to add a systematic outline in the introduction so we can know the structure of the course.",
    "Strengths: problem sets are challenging but not unreasonable, peer tutor hours were accessible and helpful, lecture was engaging. Weaknesses: it seemed like our section was pretty disjointed from the other section even though we were supposed to be on the same tracks, it would have been helpful to have homework and practice midterm solutions, also would have been helpful to get homework back in a more systematic\/frequent way because there was a stretch of multiple weeks that none were returned",
    "Course is well organized and the topics logically flow from one to the other. The textbook was high quality and very helpful. It would be interesting to have more of an emphasis on the applications of these techniques, which would be practically useful for students and also help reinforce the abstract concepts by seeing how they are actually used in the real world.",
    "Prof. Hoskins was able to synthesize what was explained in the textbook in a relatively simple manner, although it was sometimes difficult to understand what he was trying to say.",
    "Not too bad, just very fast-paced and not much discussion on applications",
    "Providing practice midterms was helpful. Also the problem sets reflected what we did in class mostly. However, the last few classes felt slightly rushed.",
    "Jeremy is a great teacher that was super accessible and explained concepts very well. The problem sets were a good length and did a good job at facilitating learning matrix concepts. The problem sets weren't too long, and I think the timing of the course moved at a smooth pace (maybe a little on the slow side). I wish the notes were online though.",
    "Lectures sometimes unclear",
    "Very fast course and difficult homeworks",
    "I like that we had a discussion section, it would be nice if it was longer and we got more practice.",
    "I really liked Jeremy and thought he was an incredible teacher. I wish solutions to the psets\/practice exams were posted so I could have them to study off of for exams. Other than that, the class was great.",
    "The course is decently well structured. It moves very slowly during the beginning of the semester and speeds up a lot at the end.",
    "Better syllabus. Lectures just jumped around and was hard to follow. Very disorganized course",
    "No outline to course materials, difficult to determine what to study in book if a lecture is missed",
    "The course was not taught well at all. The problem sets were fine, but not doable unless you went to peer tutor sections. The professor never went over any applications in the lecture. They would just go over the theoretical material and leave us to figure out the applications on the homework ourselves.",
    "Strengths: Prof Hoskins was cool, and the tests were very straightforward (except for exam 1, which took off a lot of points for not explaining things that was never asked in the question unfortunately)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that sometimes I had literally no idea what's going in lecture because the prof had to go pretty fast in the 50-minute class. However, once I took the time to do the problems by myself, the concepts were very manageable.",
    "Concepts are difficult to understand with little time offered, and office hours do not feel as helpful as they should be.",
    "Professor did not teach the concepts very well. I understood little to none of what was discussed and that felt like the majority opinion of the class.",
    "i thought the professor was incredible, especially compared to years past",
    "I think that the course material is extremely relevant and applicable to all fields making it very engaging. I think the course could be improved by having a greater emphasis on applications of linear algebra.",
    "The class modeled the textbook well but I wish it was more proof based.",
    "Taught in a fairly clear way, but I had to learn a lot on my own through the book. Pretty dry material overall",
    "The main weakness in this course was the instructor. Hoskins is a nice guy, but he really cannot teach. Sometimes I felt as though he would purposely confuse us because I would watch Gilbert Strang videos after class and fully understand. Jeremey tends to go on a long diatribe, writes down symbols and numbers (not explaining where they come from) and then ask us if we have any questions. When the class is silent, he would assume that we all understand, when in reality everyone is lost to a point where we dont even know what to ask. In addition, the exams were fair in terms of that it was very similar to the practice exam, but he would grade very harshly. If you used the wrong formula (ie, basically the formula but you are missing something such an a negative sign or inverse) he would give no points at all. Its just so frustrating because you can work very hard Amin the class but get a bad grade due to one simple mistake",
    "The professors in 222 aren't good and the textbook isn't good either. After talking to several people in higher math classes I've learned that what we did in class was silly and we didn't focus on anything correctly. What we learned was taught in an odd an non-uniform way. This whole class is a weakness. No strengths. If I hadn't hired someone to teach me linear algebra I would've gotten nothing done.",
    "it was a good, comprehensive course, but irritating that there was little support outside of lectures in terms of knowing what to learn. a lot of people don't do well in big math lectures, so it would have been nice to have had a better textbook or a more thorough syllabus to know exactly what we were accountable for",
    "Some strengths are the lectures.",
    "Strengths were the teaching weakness would\r\nBe more resources needed for help",
    "I believe that the material notes could be posted",
    "Good teacher, well-organized. The end material felt a little rushed",
    "ULAs were very helpful especially since they did not have pset answer keys so they had to walk through the problem with us. However, it would've made it office hours more smooth if they knew how to explain the problem beforehand if they were provided with an answer key. No clear weaknesses or strengths of the course itself--pretty much a standard math course at Yale. The only thing I will mention is that the second midterm covers a lot of new material right after the first midterm. Since linear algebra is all built upon stuff learned before, I can see how it is easy to fall behind if one does not fully understand concepts at the beginning so be careful.",
    "Strength is its overall scope is very manageable yet interesting. Super helpful for a quantum class that depends on eigenvalue\/eigenvectors. A weakness is the organization of study materials before exam times and getting back papers and psets after exams.",
    "The class was more of a speed note taking class than a math class. I found myself not learning much in the lectures, but teaching myself from notes while doing homework.",
    "The biggest strength was the kindness of the professor and the preparation materials for exams (ie midterms and final practice). The biggest weakness was how fast certain topics were covered that ended up being very important.",
    "Weaknesses:\r\n\r\n- Extremely poor teaching (perhaps one of the worst I have had in my life, very unclear, unintuitive, unnecessarily complicated for such an intro course. Many fundamental things (as I learned later) were just briefly mentioned; the professor didn't seem to have any experience in explaining\/teaching this material, so a lot of the explanations would rely on some reasoning which one can acquire\/understand only after having experience with linear algebra). \r\n\r\nSide note: I was always in love with Math (was on the National Math Olympiad), and for the first time in my life, I felt so incredibly powerless and almost, like, stupid. The material was new for me, and the course was not expected to be a hard one (there is Math 225 with proofs + it is an intro, 200 level course). But starting from the third week and up until the first midterm, I always felt like I did not fully understand the professor and the theoretical part of the material. I asked questions and still didn't understand. It was frustrating. After I failed the first midterm, I started looking for other resources, and I found Gilbert Strang's videos. Holy Moly. That was a revelation, God's blessing!! The material was, in fact, so straightforward and beautiful and easy to understand that I started loving the course. Only after watching the videos and solving the problems in the book by myself, I began to understand the lectures much more; though, my understanding stretched as far as Gilbert's lectures went. \r\n\r\nI used to spend hours preparing for the Olympiads, and the one thing I learned in this process is that one should be very skillful in basic things to be good in more complicated stuff. Yale can attract many bright students; however, if it can not provide experienced professors who can teach introductory material well, there is no point in having brilliant Mathematicians like Professor Hoskins. Many students passionate in Math would not reach that level of difficulty without the proper foundation. \r\n\r\n- Passive-aggressive attitude (i hope it wasn't intentional, and I think that the professor is a nice person, but he was clearly indicating his unwillingness to interact with students, almost getting annoyed \/ raising his voice when you ask him questions during office hours.  When you start walking towards him after the class to ask smth, he would turn around and walk away from you, as if he doesn't want to interact at all. I had almost to beg to be heard, repeat his name like five times in front of other students, which was honestly humiliating. I thought that this passive-aggressiveness was only something that I experienced, that I misinterpreted or imagined, but it turned out to be something that all people I spoke with in our course also noticed. Again, I think that the professor is a nice person, but the way he often appeared was not. )\r\n\r\n- the lack of helpful TAs\/materials (some of the TAs could not explain well the theoretical aspects of the material; they could only tell how to solve the problems, not even show\/explain how to properly write down the solution with all the theoretical nuances involved.)\r\n\r\n- The lack of a clear explanation of what is expected from us (this aspect improved after the first midterm. The emphasis in the classes and in the homework was on solving computational problems. Still, the exam involved a fair bit of theory, and the grading punished hardly on these theoretical nuances. When one made mistakes in computational things and was punished strictly for that, the professor justified that this course is all about computing, and when you made a mistake in some theoretical aspect and was also punished strictly for that, he said that the theory is central for the course or smth in this vein. Very convenient. :) All of this was, of course, unfair to students who relied on the professor's lectures, HWs, and TAs in preparing to the first midterm)",
    "Strengths: The material covered was interesting and I thought the amount of material covered over the semester was manageable. I thought the pacing was really fair. Weaknesses: Course lectures often lacked structure. The course is titled \"Linear Algebra with Applications\" but we really did not learn about any applications. The professor would take us through a concept and vaguely say something along the lines of \"this is used at Facebook\" but not really go into depth about how. We didn't have problems framed in terms of applications (except for a select few homework problems at the very end of the course relating to difference equations). Grading on the homework was not an accurate reflection of grading on the exams. I think the course could be improved by adding some more conceptual questions to the homework, which often focused on computation (I liked getting the computation practice, but I think it should be supplemented).",
    "A major weakness of this course was that the professor's lectures were extremely hard to understand, so there was little incentive to go to class."

    "No",
    "If you need to take this course for your major, definitely take 222. It's a very reasonable work load (but try to get a good prof - that makes all the difference).",
    "Highly recommend for anyone who are interested in Maths, Statistics or Data Science.",
    "Yes. The material is quite interesting and useful in the real world.",
    "Could be difficult if you have no background in matrix multiplication or manipulation. You will be fine if you are willing to put in the time though.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student with an interest in math. It is definitely different than any other math I had taken prior, and the learning curve was a little steep coming from calculus. The exam and midterms are definitely challenging and required a great deal of preparation to do reasonably well. A challenging course for sure, but I found the hard work to be rewarding (for the most part)",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if he\/she was very interested in math and was willing to self-learn much of the material of linear algebra.",
    "Certainly fine if you want to get rid of linear algebra requirement, but if you want to learn true math, take either 230 or 225.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone seeking to continue math at Yale after calculus. It is taught well and teaches you to think differently about numbers.",
    "Yes, I think linear algebra is a course that has lots of real world applications and is one that is important to learn. Jeremy does a very good job explaining all of the concepts necessary for the course, and I think I learned a lot, even though the math was simpler that what you find in other high-level math classes. It's all about finding new ways to think about old concepts, and I think linear algebra definitely teaches an important, new way of thinking about linear systems.",
    "Only if they have to take it",
    "Yes, the applications of linear algebra exists in many fields.",
    "Yes! Its cool to think about and you learn a lot without even realizing. I really enjoyed it.",

    "No",
    "NO I would not. Do not take this if you have Jeremy Hoskins",
    "I would recommend this course, especially when taught by Professor Hoskins. He was likeable and tried to make the content as engaging as possible.",
    "No. If they have to take it, then yes, but I would STRONGLY suggest looking up Gilbert Strangs MIT Open CourseWare videos.",
    "yes if you have to",
    "Yes, I definitely would because it covers very important material for all STEM fields.",
    "Yes! I think linear algebra is an important subject for anyone in the stem fields to understand both the theory of and the applications of.",
    "Only if you need it for your majornot really a class I would take just for fun",
    "Unfortunately if you are majoring in Math, S&DS, or any math heavy major, you will have to take this course. Its sad Because Yale just simply cant teach math.\r\n\r\nI would not recommend taking this course for fun or for a QR credit. If do not plan on doing STEM please go love yourself and take a different course",
    "Never. You won't learn well because Yale doesn't have good profs teaching 222. It's syllabus comes from Gilbert Strang who has odd terminology (so it's hard to ask others for help).",
    "I think if you have to take linear algebra, it's a good class. But if you just want to learn linear algebra, you can do that on your own through Khan's academy or something and not waste a course credit on this.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Although the course starts slow by the end of the semester I feel like I learned a great deal about how to solve complex linear equations.",
    "Yes. Hoskins is fantastic",
    "Yes. If it is necessary. This is a foundational course you should take nonetheless",
    "Yes if you have to take it Hoskins is the best teacher I know of. Would recommend over 225 based on what I hear from others",
    "I assume that you're taking linear algebra because its a requirement or it satisfies something and not because you want to do it because it's fun. I haven't taken 225 but I would recommend this course if you're looking to complete linear algebra and come out pretty satisfied. This is mostly attributed to Jeremy so if he is teaching this course, I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, linear algebra's super interesting and a lot of its concepts open up a whole way of thinking that'd be helpful in other science disciplines.",
    "I would, only if you are prepared to teach yourself outside of class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in math because I believe it is a good bridge into the harder upper-level math classes at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course only with an experienced professor, who has taught this course in the past and did that well.",
    "Overall, I liked an enjoyed the material of the course--Linear algebra is really interesting! However, if you are looking for applications, this course doesn't have them. The workload is very manageable (a problem set a week, 2 exams and a final).",
    "I think linear algebra is a great class to take. However, this class was extremely disappointing. I survived in this course by relying on my knowledge from taking linear algebra in high school and watching lectures online.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the course to another student because of how poorly organized I felt the course was. The transition between different topics and chapters didn't make sense and often times, I wasn't sure how different topics are related."
