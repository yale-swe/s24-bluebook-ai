Developed the skill of making and evaluating arguments about syntactic structure, using grammaticality judgments, cross-linguistic comparisons, and semantic and morphological evidence. Lots of practice reading and writing binary tree structures of sentences in natural language.",
                "You learn ALL about syntax trees and what makes a sentence grammatical. Not to mention, you do this through the lens of several different languages, not just English. Make sure you attend class though, so you get the most out of the course.",
                "I learned an entirely new way to understand and analyze language, and more about the specific features that world languages share. This class helped me clarify the distinction between syntax and semantics, but also to understand how these two fields blur together and reinforce one another (e.g. with selectional restrictions). I especially valued learning how to conceptually distinguish between a word's theta role and the case and position that the word holds within its sentence.",
                "foundational tools in syntactic analysis, mainly based in X-bar theory. how to interpret data from both english and non-english languages. really really good syntax class and im so glad this is required for the ling major",
                "I had a really interesting deep dive into the field of syntax.",
                "The main skills were an understanding of syntax in relation to the overall linguistic processes,  the ability to diagram the structure of sentences and for me personally it was a good introduction to use of the scientific method in linguistics.",
                "We studied constituency tests, arguments and adjuncts, X-bar theory, thematic relations, head movement, and DP movement.",
                "I learned so much about the structure of language. We learned how to draw trees that diagram sentences and questions and tell the structural difference between sentences that look the same but have different behaviors.",
                "I learned a ton about the structure of language and ways of analyzing it! This was a wonderful class.",
                "The basics of syntax from a generative-grammar framework. The course first built up a basic understanding of grammatical categories and structural relations, leading up to an understanding of X-Bar Theory that was then used for the rest of the course. We covered binding theory (explaining how pronouns and reflexives work), argument structure/theta theory, and various movement operations (head movement, DP movement, Wh-movement) - allowing us to explain things like why \"It seems that I won\" is grammatical but not \"It hopes that I won,\" or why we can't say \"Which game did who watch?\" While the material covered was far from exhaustive - there's Syntax II for that! - it provided a great introduction and I now feel able to explain why all sorts of syntactic patterns I'd never noticed before work the way they do.",
                "We learned the running theory of how language is structured in the brain, and learned some of the structural differences in languages, and generally how to break sentences of many languages into structures (trees!).",
                "The course is a very comprehensive overview of syntactic structures across languages. I learned how to draw syntactic trees, how to analyze word order, and the underlying factors that make sentence structures different in different languages.",
                "I learned foundational syntactic theory in this class, primarily focused on English but also with some cross-linguistic application. I learned how to draw syntax trees, which I had been hoping to learn for a long time before taking this class. I feel set up to study further in just about any subfield of linguistics, not just syntax.",
                "The basics of linguistics. I had no prior knowledge of linguistics, as this was the first class I took. It was still manageable and a good class to take, very well organized."

            "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
            "comments": [
                "Strength: Both instructors did a great job modeling the thinking that syntacticians do. They approached new material generatively, describing a shortcoming of the model we had up til a certain class and offering different suggestions for how to change it, then making an evidence-based and accessible argument for one particular change over others. The impression I got was that that is how academic linguists actually do think about, and ultimately resolve, new controversies, so watching that thought process be modeled out in front of us was fantastically helpful, and being asked to go through that thought process on our own, for new and different theoretical gaps, on our homeworks was also a great learning experience. \r\nA fun, engaged, and active classroom, where student participation guides what topics are focused on in a given lecture and big, wide-scope questions are often taken at face value. \r\nThe framing of the class and the project of generative grammar in the first few weeks was particularly thought-provoking, though it could have accommodated a few more details on the cognitive side.",
                "Strengths: Professor Zanuttini is INCREDIBLE, I loved every class with her. The content itself is also very interesting and rewarding. \r\nWeaknesses: I felt like some of the discussion sections were a bit unclear, and the assignment feedback can be a bit vague.",
                "I legitimately can't think of a way for this course to be improved. The material was clearly and regularly presented, the workload was high but reasonable, and the professor and TF were both fantastic.",
                "strengths: extraordinarily well organized class, ka fai is the best TF ive ever had at yale, raffaella is very friendly and extremely receptive to feedback and help outside OHs. weaknesses are that classes can be easily sidetracked but thats the nature of discussion-based ling classes where everyone is arguing about their own intuitions",
                "The lectures were really good because they weren't very large. Psets were challenging but doable and even fun at times.",
                "The course was extremely well organized but on occasion the course will have students operate under and assumption for awhile only to through it away later on which is a bit confusing.",
                "Strengths of the course are definitely Prof. Zanuttini and Ka Fai. Prof. Zanuttini is so sweet and genuinely cares about her students. She also always reviews content from the previous lecture in the current one, which is was very helpful. Ka Fai was an absolute god, hands down the best TF I've had at Yalealways responds to emails, his section handouts are amazing and so are his office hours. Weaknesses: you basically have to unlearn most of the content from the first half of the semester during the second half, but I don't think there's a way around that. Also sometimes we didn't cover all the content for that week's pset during class because it took too long to answer questions or discuss tricky examples.",
                "Strengths: you only need to bring your native knowledge of English to class in order to understand whats going on in class. The psets are not too bad and we got to work in groups for the later ones. Youre allowed a cheat/notes sheet on the midterm and exam, so you dont need to memorize any content",
                "The course feels very well-honed in its structure - there's not much I'd want to see changed. It smoothly builds up from fairly obvious and familiar concepts at the beginning of the course to complex syntactic operations by the end, and Prof. Zanuttini and Ka Fai (the TF) made sure that no one was lost along the way. Perhaps my only suggestions for improvement are that a few classes felt like they spent too much of the time reviewing the previous day's material at the beginning, and the readings from the non-Carnie textbooks could be extremely hard to follow (but fortunately, they weren't really necessary at all because the teaching in-class was so clear!). Moreover, I might particularly have enjoyed more optional readings/in-class information about the history/development of the field, the origins of the theories we learned, how they were built on or contrasted with previous work, and what assumptions they made - since it sometimes felt like new theories/principles/rules were introduced as Laws of Nature, despite the fact that they're seemingly all pretty ragged around the edges in the end. If you accept the theories as-is, you'll leave the course feeling like you have witnessed the hidden architecture of the beautiful system that is language. If you're like me and are not completely sure you accept them, you'll still have an appreciation for the beauty of the theoretical program that this course follows, but you may also leave with a nagging feeling that something you can't place doesn't quite add up, and wish you could learn about some alternative programs (maybe that means I need to take Syntax II, though...).",
                "Strengths: the homework assignments were always just challenging enough, never felt unfairly difficult or long, but were always thought-provoking. Professor Zanuttini is also excellent, and happy to discuss any of the material. The overall atmosphere of the course is very friendly and collaborative--I especially like the option to work with a group on some of the homework assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course moved a little too fast in some places, especially in the week before the midterm and the week before the final, where a lot of information was conveyed very quickly. I think some of the movement units could have used an extra week (especially DP-movement), and the beginning of the course could move a little faster to make up for it.",
                "The biggest strength of this class by far is how organized the class is. There is always a pset every week, there will always be office hours, there will always be section and handouts for help, et cetera. There are so many resources to help you succeed on the psets and on the exams. The psets were also quite fun in my opinion.\r\nThis next point is both a strength and a weakness. At first you are taught very basic syntactic theory, and as the course progresses the things you learn earlier in the semester are rendered obsolete by the new theories you learn (like X-bar theory). I think this is a very good teaching model, but it also means that the gross amount of content you learn in the semester is not maximized to the length of the semester. If we just started with X-bar theory we would be able to cover a higher gross amount of content, but this would be at the cost of both a steady introduction to syntax and a chronological trip through syntactic theory. So, I think this is a subjective matter."

                "Yes, definitely! It's required for the linguistics major, but it's also really useful for developing the way that you think. Despite the fact it's an intro class, you get the feeling that you're doing linguistics, not just being told what to think about language. I really liked the way Prof. Zanuttini and Ka Fai helped you to be able to think about the material for yourself. There's a pset every week, but they start to get to be pretty fun once you find a proper study group to work with!",
                "Yes. Take this course if you are interested at all in the structure of languages. You DONT have to be a linguistics major. I am a CS major and loved this course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student interested in linguistics, computer science, cognitive science, or just generally interested in (e-)languages.",
                "absolutely. on its own, its just a really good intro linguistics class even though its narrowed in on its subfield. on a wider scope, this class was essential to furthering my understanding in the other linguistics classes i was taking concurrently. this is THE class to take if you want to improve your linguistic reasoning skills, and i can honestly come away from this feeling like i have well and truly learned something on a deep analytical level that will help me dissect language in a more sophisticated way",
                "Yes, even if you don't know linguistics, it's a very interesting course for logic and grammar.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would, yes. I think it is a good introductory course and should prove enjoyable even to people who are not especially interested in linguistics.",
                "Yes absolutely! But be aware that the content is very technical.",
                "Absolutely! It was SO cool to learn things about language that are contained in your knowledge of the language but you dont even realize it. Everyone in every major should take this class!!",
                "Yes, absolutely. Probably the best course I've taken at Yale.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course. I'm a linguistics major but didn't think I was particularly interested in syntax before this course. Afterwards, I'm still not sure I'd want to commit myself to focusing on it, but I totally understand why syntacticians love doing their work -- the questions asked are fascinating and it really feels like you're getting to the root of the architecture of language. If you're a non-major, whether this is the right course for you will depend on whether you find the structural, abstract approach to language appealing; if that's less your thing, I might suggest taking another linguistics course first. As for the course itself: it's structured incredibly well, the problem sets and exams are appropriately challenging but never too hard, and most importantly, the instructors are amazing. Prof. Zanuttini is simply the most caring professor I've ever had. Between remembering bits about the lives of different students, bringing in cake to the final exam, patiently explaining concepts in office hours, and making sure that everyone's questions are always answered to their satisfaction, she makes sure that her students feel completely comfortable in the classroom and welcomed into the world of linguistics/syntax. And TF Ka Fai is probably the most dedicated TF I've had yet, with review materials meticulously prepared out for every single section.",
                "As a CS major with no linguistics background, I thought this class might be interesting and it was! I would probably take syntax II as well if I had the space in my remaining schedule.",
                "Yes! Especially a linguistics student (for whom the course is required for the major). If you have any experience with syntax (intro ling, semantics, etc) and you found it interesting, you'll like this class. You'll also like the class if you enjoy sorts of formulaic puzzle-solving, with set rules that can be applied in new ways. Some general advice I would give is to read the chapters BEFORE lectures, not after (which is the order I usually prefer). The lectures assume some basic knowledge from the readings.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this to another student, even if you have never taken a linguistics class. This course is a great introduction to both syntax and to the discipline of linguistics as a whole, and it is very well-structured to help you learn even if you have never taken a linguistics class before.",
                "If youre planning to study linguistics, then I would definitely recommend this class. Raffaella is such a kind and considerate teacher! She learned everyones names, shes always considerate in scheduling psets and exams, and shes great at answering questions in class. Ka Fai, our TA, is also wonderful. He ran an extremely helpful section every week. I will say I found the actual syntax material to be pretty dry and technical, so if youre just looking for a fun linguistics elective, I would recommend taking a more applied class.",
                "Yes! If you attend office hours, you will succeed. It is a great course!"
