Traced the development of James' style across his writing career. Also engaged with James' theories on the novel and writing fiction.",
                "A fabulous span of Henry James' work!",
                "I learned a lot about Henry James, and the transition between 19th- and 20th-century literature.",
                "We read many of the works of Henry James in this class; hence we read some good books with lessons of their own but also learn about Henry Jameshis style, his thoughts, his ideas. It is a very interesting course with lots of rich material. The later works are more difficult but prove worth wrestling with. I certainly became a more astute reader as James demands that.",
                "Reading James intensively over the course of a semester transformed my sense of literary scale   and enhanced my interpretative abilities accordingly.  Seminars frequently toggled between analysis of individual novels, analysis of James's corpus of novels at large, analysis of James's expository writing (what might now be considered his theoretical texts), and, occasionally, analysis of James's role within the generic development of the novel. This approach was a rewarding follow-up to the training in \"close reading\" that contours introductory and intermediate literature classes at Yale. In reading and discussing James, I found myself entertaining multiple streams of thought simultaneously, tackling text and context at once. Writing the final research paper further honed this skillset. I'm leaving the course not only with a deep appreciation of James but a better grasp of the mechanics of serious literary criticism."

                "A great course!! Reading the novels is a lot of fun, and the seminar discussions were always really interesting. Course is well-organized. The final paper was the longest essay I've ever written, but it was a valuable academic experience and Prof. Yeazell offered great support along the way. Not really any weaknessesthe only thing I'd suggest is perhaps shortening the session with the librarian, which was rather too long.",
                "Strengths Great discussion and great reads!\r\nWeaknesses inevitable, but, a ton of reading. Never enough time to discuss all the good stuff in class. I know Henry James has so many amazing works, but I think I would enjoy the class more if we could spend two class periods on one book rather than just one (Maybe two 75 minute classes would be a better setup than one 1h50 minute one?)",
                "This is a wonderful course!",
                "This was a terrific class. The books on the syllabus complement each other in interesting and complex ways, and Professor Yeazell is a fabulous teacher. I came to this class not having read any James, but I think it also would have been interesting and worthwhile for someone who had.",
                "Excellent course--just wish it was longer!",
                "The course's chief strengths are structural and pedagogical. The syllabus is artfully coordinated so as to encourage enriching cross-reference between novels. Prof. Yeazell is also an incredibly talented seminar leader. In every class, she found points of entry into the discussion of James that were (1) accessible enough to generate participation and (2) sophisticated enough to rocket us to the heart of the work in question. Her conceptual and historical framings of the various novels, moreover, helped ground our conversations and give them stakes within the greater context of James's corpus. Overall, the seminar achieved a balance of spaciousness (for open-ended student exploration) and directedness (towards the uncovering of key thematic elements at play in the novels). \r\n\r\nWhile the quantity of weekly reading is not a weakness in itself, it did mean that we often left class with much left unsaid. This was particularly true in our study of the late novels, whose density and difficulty made comprehensive investigation all but impossible. Further subdividing the later reading, however, would likely require limiting the early material, which provided an invaluable point of reference for the rest of James's work. Perhaps a solution would be to offer a voluntary section towards the end of the semester."

                "Virtual Seminar worked well.",
                "On occasion, particularly towards the beginning of class, students could be a bit timid when contributing to the discussion. I imagine the hesitation was influenced  in no small part  by the unusual circumstances we found ourselves in: it's significantly harder to have a sense of camaraderie and collective investment when your peers are digital representations. \r\n\r\nI found that Prof. Yeazell's use of break-out rooms successfully counteracted this effect, fostering collaboration among students. For the most part, however, break-out rooms featured in our discussions only in the first half of the semester. I think it would have been helpful to continue to incorporate them, intermittently, into our later discussions, in order to get us thinking and talking amongst ourselves."

Do be aware, though, that this course has a lot of reading--even compared to other upper-level English courses. If you're a slow reader or having a busy semester, you'll want to do some serious strategizing about how to set aside enough time.",
