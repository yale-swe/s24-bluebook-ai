                "I developed an extraordinarily strong foundation in \"doing\" constitutional law (as Prof. Amar would put it). Prof. Amar conducted his lectures almost more like a history course (rather than a poli sci course) which was very helpful with contextualizing all of the readings and material from small-group sections.",

                "The lectures are overall very engaging, but at times they can venture into topics that are unrelated to the material. The class is very fast paced, so students to learn a lot, but the guidelines for the assignments are very vague, so it is important to discuss those directly with the TA's.",
                "Best course I've taken at Yale. Interesting lectures, fascinating subject area, engaging readings and sections. All around amazing.",
                "Strengths: the readings, Professor Amar's books supplement the course really well, and the sections led by teaching fellows are a must have. They are all such wonderful TA's who have such interesting backgrounds that bring them to this course\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes Professor Amar's lectures ramble a little bit and are hard to follow, but having the section there helps with that",
                "The strengths are the TAs and the content, and the weakness is Akhil Amar. The lectures were incredibly useless and did not clarify anything about the topics we were studying. But the sections and review session were fascinating and I learned 90% of what I know from this class with the TAs.",
                "Professor Amar's lectures are very engaging, and he is clearly a scholar of the material. My section was also a strength -- our section leader, Robert Capodilupo, did a great job of consolidating and explaining the material in a clear manner. I would say that a main weakness was the lack of organization of the lectures. I often left class confused about what the main point was and only understood the takeaways of the material after attending section. I think that the lectures would do well with a bit more of an outline and structure.",
                "The material itself is extremely interesting. Professor Amar assigns a fair amount of reading from his own books  while a useful supplement, the cases are really where you learn.",
                "Strength: Professor Amar is a great lecturer, and I've heard nothing but amazing things about the TA's.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the lectures were off topic, and I wish the class would occasionally read something by other authors.",
                "strengths: The exams are intensive but help cement the material you've learned. TAs are amazing and you can attend as many of their sessions as you wish\r\n\r\nweaknesses: anything you get out of ConLaw is what you put in. If you don't want to read ahead, go to section, or even read at all, you'll get nothing out of this",
                "Amar's lectures can sometimes be a bit all over the place, but section is a life saver. I could not have understood the class material without going to section. I think that the final should not be 60% of our grade, that is kind of ridiculous.",
                "The course covers a LOT of material which is great but overwhelming. I found myself relying almost exclusively on external resources (Oyez, TF summaries) rather than the cases because it was simply not possible to get through all of it.",
                "I really liked the structure of the grading system, particularly how there is an opportunity to write an optional research paper that can only have a positive impact on your grade (and would be disregarded if it were to have a negative impact). The teaching fellows were also extraordinary and exceeding helpful during lectures, sections, and while preparing for exams. Professor Amar also dedicated so much time to supporting us, including at lectures, post-lecture lunches, and during office hours each week.",
                "Professor Amar is really passionate about the material and lectures are really engaging.",
                "Strength: the discussion session is very helpful.",
                "Personally, I wish the lectures were a bit more engaging and the syllabus was clearer on what cases we would need to know. I found that many TFs were recommending different cases for issues and that got confusing.",
                "Strengths: course material, engaging readings, wonderful and intelligent TFs\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes, lectures lacked structure",
                "The lectures were often very confusing and hard to follow. They could be seriously improved with structure such as slides. The courses strengths were the teaching fellows and how they cleared up the lectures.",
                "Strengths: section is very useful, the cases are interesting \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: while I enjoy Amar's lectures, they're kind of all over the place. They're primary use is that in the middle of an exam, I may remember what he said about some cases and think \"I bet he wrote about this\". Then find a quote from his book.",
                "The strengths of this course were the professor, the content, and the exams, which really taught me to understand the material well. Perhaps the weakness was too many assigned readings. I wasn't able to do all of them, so I would have liked fewer so I knew which ones to focus on.",
                "I absolutely loved this course and found the material fascinating. That said, it would be nice if Professor Amar didn't repeat himself for the first 30 minutes of every class so that we could actually cover all of the material without leaving it to section.",
                "Amars lectures are hard to follow and tangential, and almost sometimes totally unrelated to the readings, section, or exams. the TA's however, are fantastic and brilliant and a quick and organized resource. they taught me everything",
                "Professor Amar's generosity in time and knowledge (as well as our TF's engagement) were the highlights of this course. The only improvement I can think of is that lectures could sometimes be a bit more structured.",
                "Readings and section were great, lectures are often rambling and unhelpful",
                "While brilliant, Professor Amar's lectures tend to be unorganized and difficult to understand. Much of my practical learning was done in a section with my teaching fellow. One of this course's strengths is that it treats students like law students. Professor Amar is also committed to the well-being of undergraduates and even goes as far as getting regular meals with students. This course does a wonderful job of exposing students to new ideas and challenging old ones.",
                "Strengths: Amar is brilliant! Section for this course is fantastic  highly recommend! \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures slightly unorganized, your notes might be a bit of a mess.",
                "Strengths: Super dedicated professor, Great section & TAs, challenging, opportunity to engage outside of physical course at lunches\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were not very structured, difficult assessments, lots of reading",
                "Lectures could be more structured",
                "Strengths: Sections and TA are the best aspects of the course. Amar's scholarship is expansive and impressive. The class ties well into current legal affairs and debates. The course content is very important and interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The beginning of the course spends too much time on one aspect of judicial power, judicial review, and the end of the course has an exorbitant, perhaps unrealistic amount of reading for undergraduates with 3-5 other classes. There should be better balance, perhaps more evenly distributing the amount of reading and content, to allow students to more fully engage with the material, especially at the end of the course. Amar's lectures and books are densely packed, go on many different tangents, and are, as a result, not very useful or accessible when engaging with other elements of the course. Expectations for the midterm and final exam are unclear if not unrealistic. For example, written instructions make no mention of citing Amar's books, but some TAs emphasized the importance of doing so mere days before the exams while others emphasize the importance of instead spotting and explaining issues. It is understandable that the exams are meant to feel like a true law school exam, but if that is the case, the TAs and Amar can be more forthcoming about how long the exams will take to complete and how long they are expected to be (i.e., Do not say students will not have to take a full 8 hour or 24 hours for the exam when many students indeed had to.)",
                "Amazing course. Absolutely loved it. Amar is a strength as I found him to be incredibly engaging as a professor. Only thing is that sometimes he lacked a little order with the syllabus and would spend like 30 mins in the beginning of class summarizing what happened last week, which was a bit excessive at times.",
                "Strengths: Akhil Amar is a terrific lecturer, elucidating key details from the casework, making the course accessible to a STEM major, and teaching one how to think through opinions in the context of history. His lunches were also quite fun, and an incredible opportunity. Don't be scared of  the workload. I spent about the same amount of time on reading as I would on the weekly pset in an intro science / math class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Akhil Amar is not very modest, although he does not have great reason to be, so this is somewhat understandable. Additionally, the course is more a history of law course, taught through stories, than a constitutional law course.  Go to section! All the section leaders were hand picked, are law school students, and they will get you through the exams."

                "100%, it is a lot of work and hard to get a great grade without putting all of yourself in the course, but I think it is a must take for any Yale student. A very reasonable Credit-D-Fail.",
                "If you are interested in constitutional law, you should take this class. I would recommend this class to a student who is self motivated to do the readings and go to section. Going to lecture will not give you much and will leave you cramming for the midterm and final. But if you go to section every week and try to stay on top of briefing the cases you're learning about, you'll be fine!",
                "I took this class Credit/D/Fail my senior spring, which I intended from when I started the course. Taking it in this manner definitely made the material more approachable. I do think that if a student wants to take it for a grade, they should expect to invest a significant amount of time studying for assessments and reading material. That being said, I do think that it was worthwhile.",
                "If you are interested in law, this is a great class to take. Professor Amar is a spirited lecturer, and there are a lot of students who take the class to try and cozy up to him with the idea that he will get them into law school. This does not have to be you. Even if you disagree with some of Professor Amar's stances, the TFs do an amazing job of teaching the material in a really thorough and neutral manner, and you don't have to agree with him! Learning why you disagree with someone can be just as educational as learning why you agree with them. If you do take this course, absolutely do section (it is optional). I don't know how anyone understands any of the material without going to section.",

                "yes",
                "I'm a huge fan of this course. It gives you a reason to develop a close relationship with a student TA from the best law school in the world, and you even get to make a well informed choice on who your TA will be. Hell, you can even have multiple TAs and they'll all give you valuable insight on ConLaw, law school, and consequential topics in our world today. \r\n\r\nI know the main complaints about this class are that \"Amar only teaches his view\". All teachers do this but only Amar is up front about it. Besides, if you want another perspective on ConLaw you have 8+ TA's who would be happy to talk. In my experience, most of the people who have a negative view on this class are know-it-alls who think their you-know-what doesn't stink. If you're so smart that you think your view is better than Amar's, that's totally fine because he's not even the one grading you. \r\n\r\nThrow yourself into this class and be prepared to adjust for what you enjoy learning. You might like lectures more or certain TA sessions. You might like short exams or longer ones. This course offers all options and I guarantee it will be rewarding if you explore those options.",
                "Yes, please please take this course if you have an interest in constitutional law. If you don't know anything about the Constitution, I would say that this class might be challenging for you. However, for those interested this class is a must. It starts off a little slow but really picks after spring break and becomes super interesting. These days, Amar is THE con law guy and to be able to learn from him about how to make a constitutional argument was invaluable. This class could be frustrating at times and there was a lot of reading and Amar's lectures didn't always get to everything. But, in hindsight, this was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. If you get frustrated with it just know that is normal and to keeping going anyway!",
                "I would but go in with a plan to either Cr/D/F or figure out how to slice up the readings so you're staying engaged but not drowning.",

                "Yes! Great introduction to constitutional law and good indicator of whether or not you might like law school. Don't take this first year though or if you are going to, not with 5.5 credits. There is a lot of reading and to get the most out of the course, you're going to want to do it. So take it with a courseload of 4-4.5 credits.",
                "Yes! This is a classic Yale course for a reason. Professor Amar is extremely dedicated to the class and its students. While lecture can be a bit confusing at times, sections &TAs are fantastic and help clear anything up. It is not an easy class, but is manageable if you put in lots of effort.",

                "No, I would not recommend this course to another student even if you are prelaw. You can read Amar's books, listen to his talks and podcasts online anytime you want. You will little if anything from taking this course, unfortunately.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is probably my favorite that I have taken at Yale. Absolutely loved it. SUch an interesting course and it is a great opportunity to take a class with a Sterling professor.",
                "Yes! Akhil Amar is a wonderful lecturer on examining Constitutional law cases through a historical lens, clearly loves the subject, and takes the time to get to know his undergraduate students through his lunches after every class. If you spend the time to take this course, it will make your semester!"
