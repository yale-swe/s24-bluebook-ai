    "I learned about French colonialism and Black History.",
    "This class was very interesting for anyone interested in how colonialism (and subsequently, decolonisation) was carried through texts. The idea of offering counter-narratives to stories we know a little too well was, me, incredibly fascinating. I learned to read through history and understand the role of literature in both oppressive and emancipatory movements.",
    "I learned how to be a more careful reader of themes, such as language, power, and race, that are incredibly important in our society.",
    "Learning about post-colonial literature in light of the colonial contexts the authors were responding to.",
    "I was pushed to analyze books in the ways they respond to other works of literature but also on their own.",
    "I learned to appreciate literature for its plot, style, tone and historical context. I learned to write literary criticism."

    "Strengths was the material and strong syllabus.",
    "It was rather perfect.",
    "The strengths of this course are its syllabus and, of course, Professor Miller. Prof Miller is fantastic at leading discussion. He introduces each text very well and fosters an engaging and meaningful discussion based on ours and his curiosity.",
    "Professor Miller was very encouraging with us, even when there were very few students in the class. I was really excited to see that he pushed every student to speak and listen, because I think it makes for the best discussions. Sometimes we had a whole book or two books to discuss each week and that is always daunting, but I have realized that is just the way Yale college courses are structured.",
    "Great reading list! Amazing discussions facilitated by our wonderful professor - Prof Miller."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Such interesting conversations and the syllabus is outstanding.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class, if Prof. Miller wasn't retiring. I hope someone can fill his shoes in the French department.",
    "Yes. I would recommend this course to any student who wants to dive deeper into the themes of language, power, race, and many more that are incredibly relevant to our society. I would recommend this course to any student interested in literature as a way to explore these themes too.",
    "Professor Miller's workload can be a little extensive, but connections between texts practically draw themselves as you read, so the more you read the more you get out of the course.",
    "Yes--I loved the material and it was such a great idea for a class. It is so important to study colonial narratives along side their postcolonial counter narratives, because it is a discourse that is present in our everyday lives and it is not exempt from great literature. Definitely take this course if it is offered again, even if Professor Miller isn't teaching it. Great idea and he will be missed.",
    "YES! But Miller is retiring so I can't speak to the next professor. The idea of the class is really interesting and you get to read really cool post colonial works!"
