   "comments": [
    "I would also like to study the application in other fields.",
    "reasoning",
    "Strengths are that it combines matrices with multivariable calculus... having learned the two together now, it is a wonder that they are ever taught separately, as they are naturally very synergistic and reinforce each other. For the time period the course was given, there was a large base of material covered effectively.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of this course are that it didn't fit the bill of what was advertised. For being an applied course, there was very little in terms of examples of application, and almost no applied problems so to speak.",
    "While I understand that the four-week course is designed in a way that is compressed. This class was taught in such a way that there was no room for questions that prolonged each day's agenda. As a result, the course felt rushed in a way that was not conducive to learning the material. The professor approached each subject as if it were review for everyone, and as a result, no topics in the class should be new to us. When another student (from my graduate program) and I indicated that we were taking this class because we haven't worked on this material in a very long time, the professor indicated that we should have properly prepared for the class by reviewing every topic we covered. Had I known that I should have just taught myself the course material before starting I could have saved myself quite a bit of time and money. Office hours were hard to come by and emails were responded to infrequently. \r\n\r\nReviewing homework assignments is a good way to help students understand what concepts they grasp and which they don't. Our instructor declined to review any of our homework assignments, even though the answers were not made available to us (thus no way of checking our work) and went so far as to discourage us from asking questions about the homework in class \"because we didn't have time\".\r\n\r\nOverall, I was disappointed with this course. My graduate program described it to me as a mathematics course that is sensitive to the diverse backgrounds of both graduate and undergraduate students in the sciences and social sciences. This missed the mark by miles.",
    "Strengths: \r\n- the course covered a significant amount of content in a short amount of time\r\n- evaluation was well split between quizzes, a midterm, and a final\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- the content was fairly complex, however, was not explained in the most clear way possible. The way to explain math in an intro course is not through more math. Proofs of concepts are usually more confusing than the concepts themselves\r\n- there was no syllabus posted, and no readings given, meaning that students were unable to prep before each class",
    "Too much of the course was spent on reviewing rudimentary math. Applications to social and\/or life sciences were hardly discussed."

    "Definitely!\r\nIt kindled my interest to study math. It is also helpful for me to improve my problem-solving ability!",

    "Yes. The amount of material is suitable for a summer course. You do not require deeper understanding than what this course provides in order to continue you Calculus studies.",
    "No. I took this course to prepare for the mathematics involved in the IDE program, which I do not feel that it did in a productive or efficient way.",
    "No. Most of the content can be covered online (Khan Academy), so it's not really worth the $4,050 sticker price",
    "One should only take this course if it is a prerequisite for another."
