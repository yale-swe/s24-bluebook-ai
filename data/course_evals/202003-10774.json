                "I learned about different Latin American Literature mostly from the 1400-1500s. Because the readings were from centuries ago, they were sometimes difficult to understand, but I think this challenge improved my Spanish reading skills. I also learned about the writers themselves, what they argued, and the role their literature played in society.",
                "We read famous Latin American texts, written by non-native and native authors, and learned the historical conditions prompting their creation. The readings spanned many topics-- feminism and colonialism, for example-- and brought unique perspectives to some of the political debates being had today on nationalism and the like. At the end of the course, we created plays based off of assigned readings which was an interesting creative opportunity and deepened our original understanding of the texts.",
                "I definitely learned how to read older texts in Spanish that I never thought I would be able to read and dissect in detail. I learned to analyze devices in these texts as well that I would normally do for English texts, and I was able to expand my vocabulary in Spanish.",
                "I really enjoyed this class because I felt as though it helped me with reading and analyzing Spanish texts.",
                "I became more confident in my conversational spanish skills in a low pressure environment.",

                "We read texts from Latin America written in the time period between the early 1400's and late 1600's. Taking this course helped me analyze the texts and improve my reading comprehension. The feedback from the oral commentaries was helpful in improving pronunciation. There were also opportunities to work on writing skills.",

                "The class was on Zoom, which really takes a toll on the efficacy of language classes. For me (and several others who I've spoken with), it's much more intimidating to speak in a Zoom class (where one person is the sole center of attention at a time) than it is in an in-person class. So overall, I got a lot less experience speaking than I would in a traditional class. That said, Dr. Adorno is amazing. She made the lectures engaging, interesting and memorable and I think I got a lot out of the class. I certainly got a lot of experience writing, reading and listening to Spanish. One thing to note is most of the readings are in original ~15th-century Spanish, so it's a bit of an adventure in interpretation as well as translation, but it's not terribly difficult.",

                "Strengths: easy class (I'm a native Spanish speaker), low workload, readings were interesting \r\nWeaknesses: not too engaging at times, monotonous, readings were sometimes too long and difficult to understand\r\n\r\nThe class format was the same every day. The professor went through her powerpoint, where she'd discuss the writer\/historical context\/etc. and then would talk about the reading that had been assigned. At times, it felt a bit monotonous because we were just reading from the powerpoint what we had read for homework. I would have liked more group work during class and a change of structure once in a while to keep class interesting and engaging.",
                "The professor truly cares about her students and works to make the learning environment welcoming and difficult texts accessible. I took Spanish in high school but took a year off and was concerned about fitting in, but guided questions and detailed slides make historical texts manageable. Our class engaged in some interesting thematic questions during some lectures, and I think it would be nice to include more of these overarching questions over basic understanding ones.",
                "I think that a big strength of this course is that it tries to get at the heart of the texts that are presented--past the notions that people generally agree on about the people who wrote them. It was definitely very fun and engaging. One weakness of this course was that the process of annotating and having a presentation on each text was a little repetitive.",
                "I cannot think of any weaknesses. The class was set up in a way that I did not become overwhelmed with assignments and had enough time to engage with the course content.",
                "The course material was engaging and I really enjoyed the mixed lecture \/ seminar format.",
                "It was a great course hardly any complaints. Professor Adorno is a sweetheart and is very passionate about what she does.",
                "Some strengths of this course were the variety of assignments, the resources provided ahead of class time, and the responsiveness and knowledge of the professor and TF. One major weakness was that the larger class size combined with a lecture format made it a little bit more difficult to meet the requirement of participating and staying engaged in live classes.",
                "Loved this class. Prof. Adorno is amazing and so knowledgeable about the literature and history of the region. It was conducted really well online in my opinion.",
                "The profesora was absolutely excellent, and managed to keep us engaged even in an online format. She made the course fun and interesting. The final project, a theatrical project, was a great way to finish off the course.",
                "One of the weaknesses was the lack of grade check-ins throughout the semester. One of the strengths was that Professor Adorno was always available to meet and discuss the literature we were studying.",
                "I think the weakness was that the lectures were not recorded. As a I lived in California, class was at 6 AM and it was very difficult to be engaged in class. Furthermore on the coursetable syllabus, it did say the lectures would be recorded.",
                "Good workload. Very manageable which allows you to focus on the actual material.",
                "Strengths: Professor Adorno made herself available to students for asking questions, etc. Student participation was a key part of the course. The schedule was well organized through the \"Modules\" section on Canvas.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were several group projects, with the final being the only one where it was mandatory to work in groups. However, it was difficult to form groups with classmates given the virtual setting. I think random assignment would have worked just as well (or the assignment method used to determining the final groups).",
                "Strengths - Depending on your Spanish skills this is a quite easy course and depending on your Spanish comfort, it can be a great 5th course. Professor is sweet and kind and truly encourages participation. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The class is generally relaxed, but at two points in the semester the assignments piled up in the same week so just make sure to have those two sets of 3 consecutive assignments in mind. It's still not much, they just come quickly and it's easy to forget them. Also there were some awkward moments and some possibly problematic moments that had be a bit confused\/wondering what was happening.",
                "Dr. Adorno and Prof. Crespo are definitely strengths of the course. They are incredibly helpful and engaging. Honestly the only real weakness I can think of is that the class was on Zoom, I feel like I would have gotten a lot more out of it, especially in terms of speaking, if I took the course in-person. But the instructors adapted to the new format effectively and it was really a pleasure to be in the class!",

The weaknesses of the course were in the classes that solely consisted of students reading sentences on the screen. This led to less engagement and did not help with my Spanish knowledge.",

People were spotlighted, could use virtual backgrounds and filters, and overall it was very seamless. I think that it was a great success in that sense. One thing that I think could be improved is the process for asking questions during class, because oftentimes I did not know when to interrupt the professor who was teaching to ask a question.",

It was also really helpful to have the presentation slides posted before class so we could look at them for key takeaways and comprehension while doing the readings.\r\n\r\nIt was also SUPER helpful to have all the class readings available online.",
                "At some point in the semester everyone had their cameras off, and professor asked us to keep them on. A plus of this is participation, we could see each others' faces and participate in discussion. A negative though is that some days you just want to have your camera off and don't want to be seen. I think it was okay if you kept it off for a day but you would likely get called out (in a surprisingly kind way, but still called out). I wish there was a bit more space to keep the camera off without feeling horrible about it. \r\n\r\nA plus was the participation. We were not just passively watching but rather professor really brought everyone into the lesson through simple and fairly easy questions.",
                "There were group assignments and opportunities to engage in the course. Towards the end of the semester, the Professor became very demanding about having cameras on even though attendance was listed as not being required in the syllabus. The Professor was not the most considerate to technology issues that would prevent a camera remaining on or cause a student to not hear what she said clearly, but the Professor was also not the worst in this regard.",
                "I think one improvement that could really help the course would be to make more use of breakout rooms. The trick with that is you have to develop enough of a rapport beforehand so that people will take risks and stick to Spanish in the rooms, which is difficult online. It's a lot easier to do breakout room-type stuff in a physical classroom when everyone is in eye and earshot of each other, but I think the instructors are capable, charismatic, and engaging enough that they could pull it off. If you're reading this review to decide whether or not to take the class, I would strongly recommend it despite the online format (assuming it stays online). If you're willing to speak up in class (which you really should be) it's very much worth it.",
                "The online readings and comments (on Perusal) worked out very well. The zoom lectures also worked out well but the professor could have made more use out of break-out rooms to keep the students more engaged.",
                "I very much enjoyed our virtual, theatrical performances. I think they were a good use of technology and were very engaging. The aspects that could be improved is the formatting of reading power points. I think overall, more discussion and less repetition would have been helpful.",

If you're looking to improve your reading, writing, and speaking, this class works great. Not only do you read, but you also write essays (that were fairly easy), and do oral assignments (very short, low stress).",
                "Yes! I think this course is a great way to become more familiar with fascinating Latin American texts while being guided by an expert in the field. The professor is very kind and genuinely cares about her students, and I would recommend visiting her office hours for any questions or just to expand your understanding of the material. The class is forgiving to less advanced Spanish speakers like myself as the slides can help with questions of plot as they highlight important quotes and thematic elements.",

If youre looking to improve you spoken Spanish and discuss texts more deeply, I would recommend looking for a class class that has fewer students and a discussion-based format. Also, I would note that a more appropriate title for the class might be Literature of Spanish Colonizers of Latin America since thats who most of the readings were written by (there were only two Indigenous authors on the syllabus).",

                "Yes, I would. I loved Professor Adorno. Every class, I learned something new, and I just generally had a good time learning.",
                "Yes I would because this was a very interesting course.",
                "Absolutely. Great L5 course and Adorno is amazing.",
                "I think milage will vary depending on the student. This is a literature class at its core, meaning that discussion is focused on what is in the texts. Some of the authors in the syllabus are certainly controversial due to their role in colonization, including Christopher Columbus, Hernn Corts and other conquistadors. While I think a critical approach was generally taken to the texts themselves, the course content focuses on the given texts, not the obviously condemnable actions of the authors themselves outside of what is depicted in the writings. This is something to keep in mind, as this class challenges students to judge the material within its historical context. If this is frustrating for you, I'd recommend a different class. However, I'd recommend this class if you're interested in learning about some of the first Spanish-language works to be written in the American continent (there are also a couple readings in Spanish translated from Nahuatl) and their historical significance. I was exposed to a lot of authors I had not previously heard about. Also, because the readings are from hundreds of years ago, I would have struggled to read and understand them on my own. Taking this class with guidance from Professor Adorno and Esteban allowed me to access what I wouldn't have been able to otherwise.",
                "I'd recommend it for the Language credit or if you're a native\/fluent speaker and just want a 5th course. It is at 9 am but it is easy and a break from very intense seminars\/lectures.",
                "Sure. If you're interested in the content or simply need another Spanish course, take the class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot both about the Spanish language and about the history, literature and political context of the first cultural encounters between Europe and the Americas. The class was engaging and enjoyable, and I learned a ton.",
                "I would but I would also explain that this class was run more like a lecture and lacked some of the elements of discussion that I would have liked.",
                "I would recommend this course to students wanting to learn about colonization in the Americas. I would not recommend it to students trying to practice their fluency.",
                "This is definitely more of a history class (essentially early colonial history in Mexico, Peru, and the Caribbean), than a literature class, so keep that in mind.",
                "Yes only because of the professor"
