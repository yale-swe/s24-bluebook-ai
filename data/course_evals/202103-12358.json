                "The teachers are great, but a little unorganized. Some days the homework that was due for the day would be posted at 8pm the day before it was due which made the small simple assignments quite burdensome. Also, the book they follow is in an illogical order, and I wish they would structure their class in their own way instead of following the book to a tee. However, I really enjoyed my time in the class and was surprised at how much I learned.",
                "The class was enjoyable but the workload and course content was a bit disorganized.",
                "The greatest strength of the class is that the professors and TF are warm and approachable and create a wonderful class atmosphere. I definitely bonded with my classmates and improved my Hindi. The greatest weakness of the class is that it often felt disorganized. We would be assigned homework on Canvas around 6:00pm in the evening that was then due at 9:00am the following morning. In class, we sometimes went on tangents that were counterproductive and frustrating. We rarely got practice worksheets. It would be helpful for the professors to create more opportunities for practice and feedback, to assign homework earlier, and to set clearer agendas for each class.",
                "This course did a good job in introducing grammar concepts and the Devangari script. However, I feel like the course was held back by the textbook, which introduced concepts and vocabulary in a peculiar order that didn't make much sense. I also think that more time could have been spent on learning vocabulary in class.",
                "Course was fairly disorganized compared to other languages Ive taken at Yale.",
                "Strengths: amazing faculty, engaging environment. Weakness: weekly quizzes were sometimes stressful, but they were overall fine",
                "Strength: Class was very flexibly taught and made learning hindi enjoyable.",
                "This course was not as organized as it could've been. The professors are always there to help if you need them, however, sometimes the classes felt unprepared."
