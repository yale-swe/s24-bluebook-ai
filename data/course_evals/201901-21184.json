    "Tons of knowledge about the ancient world - Judaism (duh), history, classical civilization, Hellenistic culture, Roman Empire. Great class, lots of different time periods. Also never taken class involving Bible before, great introduction. Prof Fraade is great - been teaching the class for 40 years, very nice guy.",

    "Great overview of ancient Judaism!"

    "Yes - great professor, fair workload, learn a lot but not overwhelming",
    "YES",
    "Yes, you should take this course if you are interested in learning about the development of Ancient Judaism."
