                "strengths: homework assignments and weekly quizzes were a good format\r\nweaknesses: heavy focus on memorization of extremely specific molecular signaling pathways and processes, focus on depth not breadth, lectures were not very engaging",
                "I felt like we did not receive enough feedback on our quizzes which made it difficult to take the final exam. I think this class has many very interesting concepts, but we felt somewhat lost with the amount of inferring we had to do.",
                "Lectures should be uploaded and recorded to help with information",
                "I think that the lectures could be more engaging and the quizzes should be better worded and crafted so that they will actually help students learn and not just decrease grades.",
                "Material was presented in a clear way and the course has several features in place (ex: peer tutoring, enrichment) to allow students to succeed. Material in some lectures (early development genes) wasn't presented clearly and discussion sections did not give us enough time to thoroughly discuss material and ask questions.",
                "Strength: very well organized, lots of materials available on Canvas, peer tutors are very helpful\r\nWeaknesses: the material was not explained very clearly in lecture at times, and clarifying questions were sometimes not fully addressed. More difficult topics (neurulation,  maternal effect genes, morphogen patterning) were glossed over very quick in comparison to less difficult topics. On Ed Discussion, questions were sometimes not addressed clearly.",
                "I thought that the quizzes did not reflect the material taught in class",
                "The quizzes did not address skills covered in class and contributed to an exhausting and demeaning culture throughout the course. Quizzes were also not gradely equally across the different TAs and getting points back, and even clear answers on your mistakes, was difficult. The only great thing about this class was the peer tutors; they were incredible and helped fill in a lot of gaps from lecture.",
                "By far the highlight of this course was the passion that the professors seemed to have for teaching students and ensuring that we were learning and connecting with the material. Hearing about Professor Irish's research in the context of what we were learning in class was really interesting and very inspiring to me as a woman looking to enter biology as a career field. The content of the course was very interesting and engaging, but I do feel that the order in which the lectures were presented was confusing. We would switch back and forth between lectures on neural development and other processes, and I felt that it just wasn't a smooth way to connect our learning. I feel that it would have been smoother and simpler to remember if we had learned the early lectures in their current order, then learned about patterning and gradients such as in the limb bud, then sex assignment and chromosomes, and finally spent the last several lectures on neurulation and neural cell development as a cohesive unit rather than sprinkling neural cell lectures in with the rest of the course. The slides themselves were also really helpful - just the right amount of information such that it isn't distracting in lecture but I still know what's going on when reviewing later.",
                "Strengths are the lectures and textbook readings. Weakness is the quizzes which were very specific to what was said in lecture instead of the general concept.",
                "Strengths: learn a lot of information and study guides were super helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: learn too much information at once. Could be improved by having more text on the slides. Normally with just figures, it is hard to understand the context of each slide and the professors start rapidly talking which makes it hard to understand each slide without context.",
                "lectures were not very engaging and the professor's voice was monotonous. The way the lectures were taught was also very confusing and the quizzes were extremely challenging. I think to improve the course make the content and teaching style more engaging.",
                "Badly taught, bad preparation, quizzes were not related to the class material and I did not get appropriate feedback",
                "You do learn a lot however the quizzes and homework are a step up from bio 101 and 102",
                "Strengths: the content is really interesting, and the figures/examples used and repeated on lecture slides are clear and helpful. The class is very organized and you always know what is expected of you. I also thought section was much more productive for this class than for other bio sequence classes. \r\nWeaknesses: the quizzes are confusing for no reason and don't really support or align with what we are learning in class. Although you do get feedback on your responses for short-answer questions, you don't ever get to see the correct answer. Also, there seems to be a disconnect and/or slightly hostile relationship between the teaching team and the students.",
                "The amount of resources was certainly a strength. Many students found themselves struggling with the material, but the support systems, which ranged from office hours (which unfortunately took place right after class at a time some students found to be inconvenient), peer-tutoring, Enrichment sessions, Ed discussions, and conversations with discussion section TFs, were certainly a highlight of this course. I would say that a weakness of this course would be the lack of communication about what is expected of students for both the research proposal, in which many found themselves to feel completely on their own, and the quizzes wherein students were frustrated by the fact that points were taken off despite having what appeared to be detailed responses.  These expectations were clarified towards the end of the course, but it would have been nice to have known them earlier on.",
                "Strengths: The course content is interesting and we learned a lot of content in a short amount of time. Professor Loreng and the teaching team are easily accessible and very willing to give support. \r\nWeaknesses: I did not enjoy the homework assignments for BIOL103. I do not think that the process of writing a research proposal did anything to reinforce the course content. There was basically no guidance on how to write a research proposal (we did not read a research proposal, or learn how to write one; the instructions for the homework were very vague and did not provide concrete advice on how to go about answering the questions. It would have been helpful if there were problem sets that reinforce course content and also give practice for the quizzes. With so much course content and so little quiz time, I always felt overwhelmed by the amount of content that had to be studied for each weekly quiz. I think that problem sets would help to narrow the focus for studying. If anything, I wish that the last lecture on biotechnology happened earlier, so I could use those techniques in writing my research proposal. Additionally, if the writing component wishes to be kept, perhaps a literature review or an in-depth analysis of a paper (for example, like a journal club where each student prepares a presentation on a paper) would better reinforce the course content. I also wish that time in the discussion section was used more wisely. Reviewing a dense paper that was only tangentially related to course content did not help my understanding of genetics or development. The time we did a p'set in section was much more helpful.",
                "Researching the details about our chosen genes and using the information of the course in our scientific writing was very useful for our future as aspiring scientists. Though the content of this course was pretty interesting it felt a bit unstructured at times, especially with the guest lecturer's topics. Therefore the course could be structured differently (for example covering limp development at once instead of spacing the contents over the course of several lectures) and connections between different topics we covered could have been better communicated.",
                "The lecture time was way too long to keep up the focus until the end, especially because the information presented was very dense.\r\nIt does have a clear message, although some lectures did not seem to tie into the central concepts well and somehow interrupted the timeline that was supposed to help orient students towards the bigger picture.",
                "Weaknesses: The course is designed not to teach, but to trick students on minutia that are seldom essential to understanding the fundamental processes that govern genetics and development. Weekly quizzes were not difficult in content material, but difficult in the particular wording or assumptions that questions assumed. Averages reached a low of around 60%. The low grade is not an issue - it is only problematic because even the instructors acknowledged that most students missed questions not because they misunderstood course material but because of \"test-taking errors\" - a telltale sign that questions are poorly worded and designed, rather than a sign that students are not grasping the course material. TAs were not allowed to share powerpoints or resources with us, and it was clear that responses given by some instructors or TAs on the ED discussion section were particularly unhelpful at best, or misleading and contradicting with current literature at worst.\r\n\r\nI have been deeply passionate about biology my entire time at Yale, and this is the one course that has made me reconsider my major choice due to the poor teaching quality and low effort that was invested into the success of the students. I am disappointed and deeply ashamed in the biology department at Yale, and am now considering switching majors.\r\n\r\nThere are no particular strengths, other than the course made me extremely self-sufficient in studying and reviewing content due to the lack of support.",
                "Strengths are the levels of organization\r\nWeaknesses were lectures moving too quickly, being unclear, and assuming background knowledge of AP Biology and other biology coursework\r\nQuizzes were also much harder than the material",
                "Quizzes were way too difficult and didn't help develop knowledge of the class subjects at all. Meant that no one really knew what to expect from the final.",
                "Strengths: the presence of the weekly quizzes (not necessarily the quizzes themselves, see below) because they forced me to review the material weekly, which meant I had less cramming to do for the exam. enrichment with professor Loreng was pretty helpful. the content of the lectures was actually pretty interesting -- the most interesting out of the bio sequence in my opinion. having the study guides for each lecture and also the lectures available before class to download were both helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures were so dry and boring. I get 8 hours of sleep but would often find myself dozing off during lectures because they were not engaging. professor Irish was not very good at presenting the information in an understandable way, and when people asked clarifying questions, she would struggle to answer the questions in a clear way, often leaving us more confused. the quizzes were ridiculously difficult -- if the average grade on a quiz is an F, then that is the fault of the professor, not the students. the exam was also pretty unreasonable, but more reasonable than most of the quizzes. also, there was very little support in terms of doing the research proposal, and it was very difficult to do, but thankfully they graded pretty leniently on it so it ended up being a nice grade boost. there was also very little help in terms of preparation for the quizzes and exam. it would have been nice to have practice questions for both, even if it were just past quiz/exam questions. \r\n\r\nalso, sometimes they wouldn't even tell you what the correct answer on a quiz was, making it difficult to study for the final, since the quizzes were basically all we had in terms of practice questions. \r\n\r\nthe quizzes and exam were also worded pretty poorly. they were often looking for a very specific answer, but the wording of the questions was so vague that it made it difficult sometimes to understand what they were looking for. there were often dangling and misplaced modifiers within the question that made it difficult to understand what the question was asking. \r\n\r\non ed discussion, the answers we received were pretty awful sometimes. sometimes a teaching fellow would link a scientific paper in response to our question, rather than answering the question himself. scientific papers are pretty hard to follow in general, so I don't see why a link to one was considered an acceptable answer to our questions. additionally, sometimes what was said on ed discussion contradicted what was said in class. there was one time in particular that I remember when a teaching fellow or someone drew from a scientific paper to answer someone's question; however, what was in the paper was new research that contradicted what we had learned in class.",
                "I think the course could be organized better to make it easier to follow especially when it comes to development; we kept on jumping between genetics topics and development that it made it hard to really understand either, especially for development where there are a lot of processes to understand. I of course realize that the two are connected, but I feel like there definitely is a better way to divide the topics to make it make more sense.  Also, some of the quizzes were wildly unfair; there were questions that we did not learn about in class at all, not even in the sense that we had to apply things we had learned, there was simply no way for us to know the answers. While it wasn't a huge deal because everything is curved relative to the rest of the class, it was just frustrating. There also was very little feedback on the quizzes so we could not even go back and understand it afterwards, since all of the provided answers were very vague.",
                "Lectures have a bunch of random information. Was not really sure what the goals of the class were.",
                "Quizzes and tests were very hard to study for. Was more difficult than how the material was presented in lecture.",
                "If I'm being honest with myself, I did not use every resource available to me to help me in this course. However, I do not think the questions we were tested on were appropriate for the level of understanding we had from class and discussion sections. The average on two of the quizzes was lower than a C, which I know will be reflected in the curve, but cannot understand how being challenged past our understanding of the course material was needed.",
                "The lecture in this course was not very engaging, and oftentimes hard to follow.",
                "Strengths: The course is well organized and the lecture slides are relatively easy to follow. The homework assignments help you learn how to write research proposals, which can be useful in the future.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The quizzes were difficult and knowing everything in the lectures didn't help as much as you would expect. The course material is very broad. We covered a lot of topics in a short amount of time but didn't go into too much detail.",
                "The quizzes were way too hard, and sometimes the professor lectured too fast. The TA's and peer tutors were very helpful.",
                "Only weaknesses. Awful Professor and course coordinator. Took joy in failing grades and poor performance of students, instead of it being a reflection of the deficient instruction.",
                "-",
                "The strengths are that the material is actually quite interesting. The weaknesses are everything else. The lectures were disjointed and hard to follow, the instructor (Irish) regularly shut kids down when they tried to answer a question, the quizzes were INCREDIBLY difficult to study for and did not test the material so much as they tested 'test-taking ability'. Overall there was very little support for students. If they keep the course format the same for future semesters, I would recommend studying the study guides and referring back to your notes with a focus on the concepts highlighted in the study guide, not necessarily the ones in the lecture. Attending office hours also might help, as you can get a sense for the types of answers you're expected to give. I really hope this course is taught differently in the future as the material is genuinely so cool and it deserves better.",
                "Strengths: Amazing community. Dr. Irish is a very caring professor who took the time to answer our questions and even attend our final presentations! The TAs and peer tutors are also so, so passionate about teaching difficult topics.\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n1) The quizzes. Dear god, the quizzes. Practice problems / concepts that are reflective of what we may see on the quizzes should be integrated more into lecture and/or section. Perhaps my mindset is not cut out for STEM, but I do not understand how the quiz questions were helpful in any way for students to understand concepts. The difficulty and formatting of the quiz questions would have been better applied in a discussion format rather than a timed quiz. This is not how you teach students to be concise. This is how you teach students to be terrified of whether or not their answer is \"correct\" rather than why the \"correct\" answer is what it is.\r\n2) TAs were not allowed to share their slides?? This blew my mind. I was told that the reasoning behind this was \"fairness for all students\", since some students may have TAs who make different slides (or not at all). If this is the case, then why not have all the TAs share the slides so all students have access regardless of their section? Perhaps one might then argue that students would not come to section, but then the easy solution would just be to have TAs take attendance. Maybe there's another reason, but at the moment I believe the restriction of sharing seems like gatekeeping. I had the most amazing TA in this course who created slides that paired very well with how I learn best, and while I did take good notes, I was disappointed to learn that my TA was not allowed to share those slides.",
                "NEED BETTER LECTURE SLIDES",
                "Weaknesses\r\nThis course would have been better taught from recorded lectures, since an overwhelming amount of material is covered and the lecture slides and study guides have minimal explanation on them. The lectures didn't explain concepts well enough, and I feel like I didn't understand them until going to peer tutoring hours. Late into the semester I found out from classmates that the lectures had been recorded. This information would have been helpful to know earlier.\r\n\r\nThe weekly quizzes were way too hard, yet the poor class performance on quizzes was barely acknowledged by the teaching team, nor were tips given on how to improve our performance. Despite being told that we would be tested on the application of concepts, quizzes also seemed to test minutiae and details that were not relevant to understanding the overall concepts or were badly worded to almost feel like trick questions. \r\n\r\nThe homework assignments took extremely long to complete since we were tasked with finding the equivalent of a needle in a haystack. The homework directions were also poorly worded and resulted in confusion and then points being deducted. Each week in discussion, the TA would go in-depth into what we SHOULD have done on last week's homework...this was very frustrating since the TA's directions cleared up a lot of the confusion, but it was too late to change last week's assignment. These directions should be included, from the beginning, in the homework instructions. \r\n\r\nBecause of the amount of content and level of challenge in this class, discussion sections would be better used to reinforce topics from class. We are already interacting with scientific papers to do our homework assignments and I don't think reading more papers for discussion is useful.",
                "Very much a self-taught course. Lectures briefly introduced complex material, homework assignments were not designed to help exercise new concepts, and quizzes were the first real look at any problems about the complicated concepts. I believe that writing the research paper had its benefits, but the course did not seem to have the goal of being an introductory coursemore like a course designed to force the students to learn things on their own and then surprise them with difficult quiz questions that were never exercised beforehand in class or through homework.",
                "I liked the course a lot and I think the profs were very enthusiastic, but sometimes I could have benefited from more clear explanation of some of the concepts (especially of the setups of some of the foundational experiments I felt like sometimes we were given results without fully understanding the experimental groups etc.)",
                "The lectures could have been far more engaging than they werethey seemed glacially paced at certain times and skimmed over key concepts at others. When concepts weren't explained clearly, I felt myself frequently having the rely on the internet. The quizzes were very challenging and often didn't seem to truly evaluate how well we understood the material in lecture. I think the fact that the averages were consistently in the C-range or below attests to this issue.",
                "The homework doesnt really prepare you for the quizzes",
                "Quizzes did not seem to correspond to lecture material, and if they did, answers seemed to differ from what we learned in lecture. In addition, no answer keys were provided for quizzes, making it very difficult to review material I did not get correct. Moreover, homework assignments were busywork without much guidance; they took hours and did not connect to what we were learning.",
                "well organized but i wish there were more thorough study guides and practice problems",
                "If anything is missed in lecture, it is extremely difficult to get that information from other sources. This is compounded by the difficulty of the quizzes and the sheer over importance of the scores in determining the grade. It is very difficult to be able to study for them, not only due to the wording and specificity of the questions, but also the fact that I do not know what I do not know. I learned that I cannot trust the study guides, as the only give the broadest information, and nothing that will help too much for the quizzes, which are the majority of the grade. Notetaking was a very good skill to learn, however it did not help at all considering how convoluted the quiz questions are. The lectures are much too fast, goes over too much information, and we are expected to take all of it in, and then apply them to very confusing questions. I did not feel like the homework was relevant at all to the bulk of what we studied in class, just another assignment to worry about.",
                "Lectures could flow together better",
                "strength: good material, felt like i learned a lot \r\n\r\nweakness: hard quizzes - didnt feel like the professor prepared us well for the style of questions",
                "This course does cover very interesting and engaging material. However, as much as I found what we learned fascinating, the way that we were assessed made myself and my fellow peers feel extremely discouraged. I understand the reasoning behind making the quizzes intellectually challenging. But the problem is that this course is not set up in a way to properly reinforce the material taught in lecture. I do see the value in writing the scientific proposal project as homework, but I strongly suggest assigning PSETs that cover the material in lecture instead of this final project. This way, students will be able to better assess their understanding of the material and be better adept to answer these difficult application-based quiz questions. I really hope this course can be restructured to better facilitate student's learning, because I truly feel like the material taught in this course could really be the stepping stones to help inspire aspiring scientists.",
                "The weakness is that the homework/research proposal did not seem too connected or beneficial to the overall concepts we were learning in the lectures. The proposal was so difficult that it almost seemed to confuse everything we were learning about, and more time and attention was devoted to the proposal then the content which was hard.",
                "Strengths: course is a good indicator of whether a biology major may be the right choice\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: video lectures are not made available, the pacing of lectures in neurology are too fast, the discussion section power points are not made available",
                "Strengths: content is very interesting but also very difficult. Easily not an intro class because everything is new material.\r\nWeakness: Quizzes and exams make up 60% of the grade, and the quizzes are very difficult.",
                "I found the problem sets to be a lot of work for very little intellectual reward in return; they weren't connected to the material being covered in class at all and felt like they were assigned for the sole purpose of creating work. I was also really irritated that my section was repeatedly cancelled, forcing me into other sections which were much less ideal for my schedule.",
                "Strength: The peer tutors were the only people who I felt could actually teach the concepts in this class. Weaknesses: Everything else about this class. I never received clear feedback on the quizzes (the quizzes in general didn't seem like they were testing you on knowledge, they just wanted you to fail); all of Michael's lectures made no sense; my TF was trying their best but I always left my discussion sections more confused than when I walked in; the research proposal was a waste of time that could have been spent drilling in concepts in the lectures; and even more!",
                "The study guides were definitely a strength as they outlined what principles we needed to have a strong grasp of. The lectures were well organized and presented a manageable amount of information. The quizzes were sometimes much more difficult than expected, which increased the stress level of the course. However, the quizzes did a good job of pinpointing what I needed to study so in the end, the final was fair.",
                "Ed discussion is a very useful tool. I can't always ask questions in class but I can ask questions online or see others' questions. My least favorite part of this class was the quizzes. Many of them felt much too specific, and having them be worth 40% of our grade really hurt mine. Though I studied hard and did well on the final, it wasn't worth enough to impact my grade and improve it."

I've heard otherwise about spring term 103, but fall term 103 was very enjoyable. I found myself remembering the reasons why I majored in bio in the first place while listening to Irish's lectures. If you have to take 103, I strongly recommend taking it off-sequence.",

Unlike other courses, you're not able to lean on a textbook or outside material for further support and understanding of the subject.
