                "The virtual format was a bit difficult to handle, especially for a lab class like this that involved a lot of hands-on work. However, the faculty did a great job of allowing virtual students like myself to feel engaged. I was able to participate on the digital side as my lab group member in person set everything up.",
                "Strengths: The teaching staff were all very nice, and did not hesitate to clear up confusions that we had on assignments as long as we emailed them in a timely manner. Also, even though I was remote, I was still able to remotely control screens for one of the experiments so I did not feel completely detached.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It took 4 weeks for our first lab report to be graded, so I didn't know what they would be looking for until I had already submitted two lab reports. This was 20% of my grade, so knowing what I could do to improve my reports (i.e. the TAs grading faster) at a sooner time would have definitely helped.",
                "Grading for lab reports could have been more explicit",
                "Strengths: Very hands-on, collaborative, and engaging. The topics of the labs were also really interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it was unclear as to what we were supposed to be doing, and if our results were correct. Physiological data is very messy and variable, so maybe it would be beneficial to have your graphs\/results checked before leaving lab. It was hard to write lab reports without knowing if your data was correct or not. The respiratory lab was remote (for obvious reasons), but the data given to us was pretty messy, and we didn't know how to interpret it. More instruction and guidance would have been helpful.",
                "Content was interesting. Some of the labs were unnecessarily tedious.",
                "Labs were fun to do, and awesome for applying the knowledge I had learned before! I thought that report workload could be a little high at times, especially the lung lab; even though we didn't do the data gathering, the interpretation and processing of the data took me a long time. The final was more difficult than I expected; I felt like it should have been open note, given the amount of content it was covering\/the fact that this was a lab and not a content class. Lastly, some of the questions on the reports were confusing\/not clear; I thought I was answering them correctly, so I didn't ask the TA's, but found out on my grading that they were wrong.\r\n\r\nTA's gave quick and efficient feedback. Labs were well-explained and fairly graded!",
                "Strengths: interesting studies (I especially like the EKG lab).\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like some of the lab report manuals could be adapted for the COVID environment to be more clear for those working virtually to understand the actual lab procedure. There were also some parts of the lab procedures that were a bit hard to understand for my in-person lab partners so a bit more clarity would help!",
                "Since I was remote, I felt like the lab could be a little more engaging. For the most part, it was mostly my group members performing the lab procedure while I followed along. There wasn't really a lot of space for discussion or anything interactive.",
                "The lab reports were the most helpful for grasping the focus of the lab. I really enjoyed it and learned a lot. It was not an overwhelming amount of work. It would be helpful to see sample data after we leave lab to compare with our own to determine if we had made an accidental error. Our results shape our reasoning as well as vice versa, and we could have saved some time going down rabbit holes by knowing if our data was even accurate to begin with.",
                "The intensity of the lab reports don't line up with the lab.  It could be improved if the lab or prelab lecture was more in depth.",
                "This is a virtual lab course, and I felt it did not do enough to aid the virtual students, and those of us that were virtual ended up at a large disadvantage to those in person. The lab report questions were not clear at all and need to be more specific, and people were largely unresponsive in terms of advice for the reports.",
                "Strength: Labs were really engaging and the types of labs were fun.\r\nWeakness: Lab grading was often harsh and not clear in what was being looked for."

                "The use of Zoom to remotely control the computer in the lab was very helpful in allowing the virtual students to partake in the lab instead of just sitting and watching. \r\nI think it would've been helpful to have the pre-lab lectures live through Zoom, instead of pre-recorded, so that students could hear questions from other students and get a better understanding of the material covered in each lab.",
                "I think the hybrid in-person and online format of the course is unfair to those who are in person. I personally was fully online, but I recognize that I saved myself the trouble of actually showing up to class and doing most of the \"grunt\" work for the experiments. If the class were to be offered again, to make it more fair for the in-person students, all labs should be fully virtual.",

                "Success: integrating the virtual students into the lab! It was actually a better experience than I imagined. I think the hybrid groups with at least one in-lab individual per group was effective.\r\nWeaknesses: some lab procedures were hard to understand (as stated above) and virtual engagement was tough just given the nature of labs. Perhaps coming up with some alternative ways in which virtual students could be more helpful during the actual lab session could benefit those learning remotely. However, I know that this is a very broad suggestion and would probably be hard to implement.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I believe the course was a success in the COVID environment.",

I personally did not like the course at first, but then once I started getting the hang of how things worked in BENG 355L, it wasn't that bad. This semester it was also nice that we only had class session and an assignment due every two weeks. It was a little stressful that we only had one week to complete our lab reports instead of two weeks like normal, but it was nice having a pretty lenient class in terms of showing up.",
