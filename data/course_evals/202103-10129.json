                "Lots of case studies give a really good grounding. Maybe more consideration of how different protests have influenced one another",
                "I loved the layout of this course, it allowed for more conversation and less lecturing. I also went in with minimal knowledge and although participating in conversations was more challenging for me without background knowledge, I was able to learn a lot through listening.",
                "Longer class time so easy to lose interest in one subject",
                "I really appreciated the overall format of this coursein particular, that students come to larger understandings about revolutions by studying particular episodes throughout history, which are in themselves all very interesting. At the same time, in some ways this was also a weakness, in that it could feel like there was little to no continuity from week to week. Other strengths included the readings, which I found too be particularly fascinating, and classes in general, which were always interesting and engaging (which is not always the case in such 2-hour blocks), with a good balance of lecturing by the professor and then student-led discussion.",
                "The content is very interesting, but increasing the student engagement and participation would improve the course. The lecture style is good, but more class discussions would also be good to supplement."

                "Absolutely. Interesting case studies and very visually engaging powerpoints that explore urban spaces and the choices of people who depict protest in these spaces either through photography or after the fact through drawing, prints etc",
                "Yes, I think everyone should take a class with Professor Plattus, he is amazing.",
                "Yes if youre looking for a low work course",
                "No...despite it being a seminar, there was never any class discussion which dulled some of the incredible topics we covered",
                "I certainly would recommend this course to other students. I primarily took it because of my major (architecture), but I would recommend it to any student, perhaps even particularly to those who know little about urban studies or the history of revolutions. As someone who came into the topic knowing very little, at no point did I feel lost, and I came to appreciate both what I learned and how much more I could learn, should I seek to. Also, the readings and discussions were enlightening, and the workload was relatively light.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this class. It has changed the way I think about space, and I really enjoyed the content."
