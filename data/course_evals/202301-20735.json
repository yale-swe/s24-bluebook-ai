                "Before this class, I thought photography was all about form, technical skills, composition, lighting, etc. People always said my photos were great, so why not sign up for a photography class, right? I thought Id learn how to take better photos, and I did. But it was what I learned beyond that that made it so much more of an experience. We learned skills in photoshop which I wish I had known for the thousands of other photos Ive taken. We learned how to give constructive critiques to our peers and incorporate their critiques in our own efforts. \r\n\r\nMost importantly, I learned that photography isnt just a medium to capture a moment in time, its also *art*. Through this class, I expanded my understanding of what it means to be an artist, not just a photographer. We looked through several various artists photos and went outside the classroom to the archives and galleries as well.",

                "strengths: this class provides a lot of freedom to explore photography as a medium. ted is a very chill professor, so it makes it a fun and relaxed environment for learning and artistic expression. \r\nweaknesses: there could be a bit more time to learn how to print, as we definitely did rush a little bit at the end of the year. i also think the paper was quite expensive, so i wish it would have been provided.",
                "The professor is awesome. The only improvement I would make is to add more time to the class, but that likely isnt feasible. The class really needs a lab section so that during the two classes a week, we can study and present art, but on the lab day, we work in lab on our photos.",
                "Great course",
                "Strengths were the professor! I loved the way Ted taught this course. It challenged me and my peers to take different kinds of photos and edit.",
                "The class was very enjoyable and got me to get out into the New Haven community to take photographs. The class could have been better split between class time to take photographs and working in the lab. Sometimes the class periods ran a little long, and I ran out of stuff to do.",
                "Strengths: allows people to really be creative unlike other courses, also teaches us skill that will directly translate in other aspects of life",
                "Strengths: very pleasant and thoughtful conversations; crits are super fun, and Ted and Davion were really kind and helpful when asked for help.\r\nWeakness: more structure is needed in the course, more emphasis in the actual practice of photographing",
                "It's a really great chance to take your interest in photography to the next level! You have the freedom to work on the projects you want",
                "i loved the opportunities for feed back and space for creative work and personal development"

Its a very hard class to get into, so I recommend making sure you understand and can effectively communicate your why. Also, be open minded. You may not like a lot of the art you see, but if you stay open, youll discover why the photographers are famous.",
