                "very good teaching, very organized course.",
                "I thought this class did a good job teaching the content it was meant to teach. I think this can depend a lot on the professor you have since it's a smaller class setting. One of the weaknesses for me was the explorations that were due before each class. Before class, we had to submit 1 or 2 short quizes that were meant to give an introduction to the material in the class. I honestly felt that they were useless and I would usually just submit the quiz as many times as I needed to get full marks.",

                "This course went very fast, it would have been beneficial to have access to recording of the class to review after the class. However, the resources for help were good and helpful.",
                "I really enjoyed the guided worksheets and the Canvas pre-class activities. I feel that these class materials really supplemented the in class learning!",
                "The course is very thorough and there are many resources to aid learning. There are lectures, worksheets, explorations, office hours, extra practice sessions, and a lot of past exams to study. I just wish we had also covered partial fractions, but time is limited and it is only a minor detail."

If a student needs to take math 115 for whatever reason, I would say as long as you dont hate math youll be fine, I did geniunely enjoy the class but that just depends on how much you like math.",
