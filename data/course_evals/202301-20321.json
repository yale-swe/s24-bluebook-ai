One of the weaknesses for me was the explorations that were due before each class. Before class, we had to submit 1 or 2 short quizes that were meant to give an introduction to the material in the class. I honestly felt that they were useless and I would usually just submit the quiz as many times as I needed to get full marks.",

                "I really enjoyed the guided worksheets and the Canvas pre-class activities. I feel that these class materials really supplemented the in class learning!",
                "The course is very thorough and there are many resources to aid learning. There are lectures, worksheets, explorations, office hours, extra practice sessions, and a lot of past exams to study. I just wish we had also covered partial fractions, but time is limited and it is only a minor detail."
