                "I learned about a variety of African-American thinkers, on the more conservative and more liberal side, and their views on a variety of topics. Considering the questions of ethics, politics, and economics in light of African-American history made them feel much more important and brought needed practicality to what is often a very theoretical major.",
                "This course was a complete introduction to many of the authors\/thinkers on the syllabus for me. The syllabus covers a massive amount of different authors, readings, perspectives, and time. While this class is primarily African American thinkers, it also incorporates a standard western cannon philosopher every other week or so, connecting how the ideas established through the classical political\/philosophical cannon are adapted by African American thinkers. I learned to put the thinkers we read in conversation with each other, either as continuing a tradition of thought (e.g. Du Bois to MLK) or in dialogue with each other (e.g. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington). Structured in-class debates forced me to dig into the arguments posed by the thinkers, whether or not I agreed with them, and work with my classmates to deliver arguments.",

                "Interesting and engaging readings  class discussion could be a bit more structured\/guided, but reaings were extensive so class is understandably a bit scattered.",
                "If you are looking to take a class in radical (or even slightly radical) Black scholarship, this is not the class for you! That's not necessarily a bad thing, but you should know not to expect Angela Davis on the syllabus. The class focuses a lot more on considering the mainstream Black conservative and liberal viewpoints on a variety of issues - civil rights laws, Reconstruction, reparations, affirmative action - than on viewpoints that might not be considered mainstream or that wouldn't be debated in a high school classroom. That being said, the class had really engaging discussions even when talking about views that most people clearly didn't agree with, and class was rarely boring. I think the syllabus could be improved by adding in a greater variety of perspectives within the Black community, especially on the far-left end, because I think the best discussions happened when we were able to compare people whose opinions were more radically different.\r\n\r\nWould have been cool to visit archives or library or something during the class! Also, I think the class on early Black feminism and the class on religion both felt a bit misplaced- may have worked better to have had a class on more modern Black feminism towards the end and to have put the class on religion closer to the beginning.",
                "This course emphasizes a diversity of opinions of thinkers across the political\/philosophical spectrum. I found this valuable because it forced me to consider arguments with which I strongly disagreed to understand them. Understanding counter-arguments through this course helped to strengthen and broaden my own beliefs. There is a lot of material in this class and only so much time so many great thinkers\/writers that would be great to cover are left out because they don't fit the politics\/economics mold as well as the authors chosen for the \"EP&E flavor,\" but Professor Collins understands this and is receptive to adding discussions of these thinkers at the end of the course.",
                "We had really great, illuminating discussions in this course, but the role-plays got a bit repetitive. Also I found the overrepresentation of Black, conservative thinkers in the course to be unnecessary. Finally, given the course's name, it'd be great if Yale could find an African-American professor to teach this class.",

                "Yes! Especially if someone is tired of the old, white, Western canon that usually accompanies the EP&E major, definitely take this class.",
                "I would recommend this to a student looking to get a broad survey of Black scholarship on American issues. If you're looking for a deep dive into Black history or Black radical politics, you might be better off taking a class that's not confined by the EP&E framework, but if you're an EP&E major, I'd certainly recommend this over the traditional Classics class, as the topics are interesting and the readings are a lot more applicable to real life. I felt much more able to engage in conversations about race and ethics\/politics\/economics after taking this class, and have cited the readings in real life conversations many times.",
                "I would recommend this course. Especially if you have already taken any classical political theory \/ philosophy, this course is refreshing in its approach to the issues of ethics, politics, and economics. It is a great alternative to the other EP&E prereqs, and the structure of the course is very engaging. The readings are fantastic and Professor Collins is great. This course was great for expanding a foundation in ep&e while discussing difficult and relevant racial issues.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class over the other EP&E classics class. It felt so much more meaningful to be studying this material!",
