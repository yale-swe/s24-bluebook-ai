He displays a kind of commitment to the course, his students, and their learning that I think is very rare to find amongst other professors. Despite the long hours, this class feels like you're spending time with some of your favorite people for 10 hours every week. I appreciated the seminars Dr. Wolenski took us to at least once a week. It was always valuable seeing cutting edge research being done in a vast variety of subfields within cell biology, and our time there was almost always informed by what we learned in class."
