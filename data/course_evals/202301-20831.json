                "This is a fantastic course with clearly specified learning objectives. Every assignment is flexible with tons of space for introspection and creativity while still somehow providing a crystal clear understanding of what skill you're working on. I took this course thinking I'd be just focusing on perfecting my sentence structure, but it gave me so much more. I'm finally overcoming my writing & public speaking anxiety, imposter syndrome, and perfectionism. The course taught me to look at writing as a means of exploration, and I think it's probably the best seminar a freshman can take to gain confidence and comfort with writing and humanities at Yale. Other skills we developed are: detecting problems of interest and disturbing moments in film & literature, responding to criticism and incorporating citations in our essays, reflecting on and revising our work, creative writing, and thinking about speculative fiction in general. I can't recommend this course enough.",
                "Reading for complexity, film analysis, how to write a critical response",
                "More than I ever imagined. Creative writing, learning how to be comfortable in an uncomfortable situation, and using speculation as a tool to relate to allegorical issues.",
                "I felt I really tapped into a humanities approach in reading and writing. I felt that I've expanded my toolkit for critical and deep reading, watching, and writing, and gotten a lot more comfortable with writing critical essays and communicating in seminars. I've also just learned a lot content-wise by reading our books and discussing them in class; it's been hugely hugely rewarding. :D",
                "I grew in my ability to open discussion and further discussion through disagreement. I also feel more confident in my writing ability. I feel more confident in how to develop ideas and find insights in work on my own.",
                "improved my analytical and critical thinking writing -- how to write more deeply and think more closely about speculative and literary texts",
                "This course used the platform of speculative fiction to teach students the skills needed to succeed in future writing and humanities courses at Yale. Particular emphasis was placed on learning how to interpret and reformulate your reactions to texts during the reading process, presenting your opinions in a seminar format while simultaneously engaging with others' in a constructive manner, and writing persuasive, clear arguments that still manage to encapsulate the tensions at play within or across given works.",
                "I learned to read more intentionally and to pay more attention to the reading process.",
                "I learned a lot about the concept of close reading, the importance of trusting your gut when writing, and giving argumentative and critical perspectives when writing about text and film."

                "The syllabus, though changed often from semester to semester, always contains engaging, thought-provoking books and movies.",
                "No weaknesses, only strengths. An incredibly kind, understanding, and supportive professor (the best teaching figure I had in my entire life); clear structure, learning objectives, and communication; incredibly easy to reach out and get accommodations if necessary; amazing assignments with lots of great feedback. This is not an ENGL 114 per se, and Professor Guy focuses on us getting comfortable with writing in general, not perfecting the details. People in this class are brilliant and genuinely kind, and every one of them is a treasure box of insights and knowledge. Every class meeting was like a family reunion. Such a comfort class.",
                "I really enjoyed many of the texts and the assignments were very accessible, especially for a writing credit. (I prefer many shorter essays rather than having fewer longer essays) Class discussions were fun and lively, assignments forced me to write essays in new ways (eg theory of speculation).",
                "Strengths:\r\n- perfect course scheduling. One day for watching a movie, the next day to be eager to discuss it. \r\n- the best professor Ive had\r\n- such an incredible class environment. \r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n- maybe a class reading session?",
                "I really liked the structure of the course (one book every two weeks and one movie every week, one 2-hour seminar every week) and I liked the assignments we had (shorter, more frequent assignments), though, I can honestly see this course flourishing equally well with longer, less frequent assignments. I think perhaps more timely feedback would be nice, though I very much understand where the professor is coming from.",
                "The strength is absolutely the discussion. I love getting to debate with my classmates. Our professor was great at opening and furthering discussion through asking complicating questions. I wish we spent slightly more time on writing, although I wouldnt remove from the discussion time.",
                "I loved this course! Speculative film and fiction is a topic that I had never really studied before, so it was interesting to watch things like Pan's Labyrinth and Get out and books like The Lathe of Heaven and Cloud Atlas. The small size of the class faciliated discussion really well, and I always learned new things by coming to class and engaging in conversation. I do wish we had a bit more time to read the texts, just because often the books were 400 pages or so and we only had a week or two to read them through",
                "Everything about this course, from the novels we read to the films we watched to the assignments we completed, was obviously curated with great detail by the course instructor. Every week, I was excited to engage with other students in interpreting creative works that toyed with my understanding of the world and humanity's role in it; it truly felt like we were one unified community tackling these complex questions together in order to achieve a higher understanding, rather than just 13+ people in a room talking at each other. \r\n\r\nI think I would have enjoyed the course even more if one of our workshops was on learning how to peer edit in an effective way - not only would this give us dedicated time to read each others' works and engage with their authorial voices (something I was craving to do this entire semester), but it'd also give us the tools to support each other in future classes. My only other comment is about variation in the assignment length of the course. It might have been nice to have the chance to develop our ideas in more detail by substituting a couple of the later papers for a longer one, after we've had time to develop our toolkit in the first part of the semester with the 500 word essays. This would also serve to reduce the amount of overhead planning (outlining, quotation collection, etc.) needed toward the extra-crowded end of the semester, which in my experience is fairly even regardless of paper length.",
                "Class discussions were especially insightful. I do feel that there was too much reading however. The assignments were very well catered to developing new writing skills as well as tailored to the books/films we studied.",
                "Strengths: professor Guy was an amazing instructor and was so kind, understanding, and gave critical points for the class to engage. The texts were well curated and extremely interesting, giving a wide variety for our class to experiment with. The assignments were many but also short in length, allowing for copious feedback and chance at improvements. The snacks were a plus. \r\nWeaknesses: none"

                "ABSOLUTELY. 100%. I don't know when and if Professor Guy is teaching this class again, but please please please try to get in. You can't imagine how much this class will help your mental state and comfort regarding writing here at Yale. You will find genuine friends and wish all of your 36 credits were taught by Professor Guy.",
                "Absolutely. If you are at all interested in science fiction, or just curious about film in general, this class is a perfect introduction. The course material and classroom environment leads to great discussions - everyone in the class also seemed to improve at writing and film analysis by the end. Definitely cultivates an extremely tight knit group as well. I can see myself continuing to be friends with many students in the class and prof guy.",
                "Yes, I absolutely loved it and also feel that I have a much better sense of how to improve as a an academic writer.",

                "yes! it exposed me to topics that I hadn't covered before and it made me think about the world in new, complex ways. Note that there is a decent amount of work - about a book to read a week, and a film a week, as well as frequent short essays if the format of the course stays the same",
                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to eligible students. I met so many amazing people during this class and was put into contact with such a wide variety of ideas; not only did I become a better writer, but I felt like my entire worldview was expanded by engaging with speculative fiction.",

                "Absolutely. It is a fantastic introductory writing course and not only helped me develops my critical thinking but also my confidence with speaking and responding to feedback."
