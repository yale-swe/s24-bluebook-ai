                "This course was amazing!! I really wish it could have been in person but for a virtual class it was amazing!",
                "This course covers a lot of ground on why segregation in public education exists, and covers equal ground examining potential desegregation efforts. There is a wide range of material that all works together in forming a clear vision for the things that must change.",
                "SMC is a strength!! her facilitation and having guests come every week to apply what we learn into practice were instrumental to my learning experience. I enjoyed devoting my energy toward an experiential project as opposed to some arbitrary final paper that only is ever seen by myself and the professor. weaknesses: with how busy we were with frequent guests, we rarely had time together as a seminar to truly integrate the readings/materials in a coherent way (though I would say, especially in a pandemic semester, the guest visits outweigh this weakness).",
                "Strengths are that the course was very organized and every week was building off of the previous week. The guest speakers were amazing and such valuable additions to the class. Readings were useful and informative and class discussions were fruitful. Only weakness is how late in the day the class was.",
                "There were so many strengths to this course. My favorite part was our ability to work with grass-roots organizations as a part of the class. All the organization-based projects were committed to ending harm in the current school system and increasing access to resources for marginalized students. I got to hear and learn from everyone else's projects in the class, and it was great to understand the different tactics used in organizing for educational justice.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-The professor is very receptive and clearly demonstrates her application of student feedback\r\n-Readings and in-class activities build off of the previous weeks, so there is a clear connection and build-up\r\n-Allows you to learn from practitioners in the educational space, as well as from students \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "I believe it is partly due to the zoom format, but it was difficult to connect as a class which typically occurs in a seminar. That is to say I believe the course would benefit from more opportunity to learn from the class.",
                "Professor SMC was certainly a strength of the classshe was so open to feedback at any given point, tailored the class material to our interests and curiosities, created a welcoming and inclusive environment for students, and genuinely expressed how much she cared about us. Another strength was the fact that we had a mini-lecture at the beginning of the course, which helped to make sure that our frameworks of analysis and our understandings of key terms being thrown around in the class were grounded. The shared inquiries portion of the class (i.e. class discussions) could have been better organized, perhaps improvement could look like organizing thematically rather than the chronological order of student's comments in the Zoom chat (though I think when classes are in person, this wouldn't be a problem). Another weakness was that the course, at times, felt a bit repetitiveI think to address that, we could have learned more about how public school systems worked in rural areas and suburban areas, rather than an intensive focus on New York City.",
                "I appreciated the course structure of having student-led facilitations and guest speakers.",
                "The strengths are the readings, facilitation, exposure to organizers in the space, and the space provided for students to discuss the readings. The outline of the course is also very good for laying out an understanding of the context in which school segregation exists, and moving towards current efforts to integrate schools. \r\n\r\nThe discussion posts prior to each session are also a great way to track which bits of information from the readings resonated most with the class."

The online format of the class made it easier for us students to meet these speakers.",

                "Having guest speakers and using breakout rooms to engage with them worked really well. I also appreciated that Zoom's technology allowed us to address some accessibility issues that typically aren't addressed in an in-person classroom space. We got really creative in the class in terms of student discussion and engagement (i.e. the interactive PowerPoint slides worked well).",
                "A Zoom panel-discussion was sometimes difficult to engage with, but breakout rooms made it more personal.",
                "Successful practices were the daily agenda announcement, break, space for students to leave their cameras off if need be, and content warnings. The breakout rooms also worked well to provide space for interlocution with the guests.\r\n\r\nHaving the discussion posts due at noon also gave us a good amount of time to look over them before class."

The readings and discussions of the first few weeks serve well to increase your understanding of the historical context the caste system and school segregation exist within.
