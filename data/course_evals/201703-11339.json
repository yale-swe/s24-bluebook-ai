    "This was a whole new form of history, and I found it very intimidating at first but by the end of the course I had learned how to interpret different testimonies and how to critically analyze them.",
    "Discussing complex topics in a small group setting.",
    "This class gave me insights into the relationship between history and testimony in the context of the Holocaust. I gained important skills for analyzing historical arguments as well as had the chance to explore historiographical questions. I learned how historians incorporate victims' testimonies into their historical narratives, as well as how the role of the witness has changed over time. As a result, I believe I have a stronger foundation to write my senior thesis about the Holocaust.",
    "Thorough understanding of narrative history, historical memory, and history's utility to the public",
    "I learned how to look at Holocaust History in a different manner. This class was able to give me the ability to look beyond stereotypes and re-shape my knowledge about the way in which Holocaust History has been remembered and the impact of that.",
    "I learned so much about how important perspective is in the telling of history and how history is not objective. I also learned how to curate a more intellectual argument and defend such with various types of texts. I also think I became much more appreciative to the significance of perspective in the writing of history."

   "comments": [
    "I thought this course was wonderful. My only suggestion would be to maybe include more video testimony. We only did that one day of it, and it was very impactful. I would have been really interested to see more.",
    "Some readings a bit long. Professor Dean is awesome.",
    "This course was well-structured to learn about the relationship between history and Holocaust testimony. Professor Dean was a fantastic seminar leader and always asked thought-provoking questions that led to interesting discussions. I learned a lot from both Professor Dean and my peers' insightful comments. The syllabus felt cohesive and allowed us to explore several important questions in-depth.",
    "Professor Dean is a fantastic professor. She truly cares about what she is teaching and is super easy-going about the class discussion. The books we read aren't classic Holocaust testimony novels (i.e. Anne Frank, but there is Wiesel). HOWEVER, sometimes this class feels more like a book discussion than an analysis of these texts side by side, or alone, as important pieces of Holocaust testimony literature.",
    "I think the strength of the class largely lies on the selected readings. I love the fact that we (usually) read a whole book per class. The best part was to hear how my classmates interpreted the same material.\r\n\r\nThis course could maybe be improved by selecting less memories and more books from non-Jewish witnesses or about how non-witnesses viewed the victims of the Holocaust right after it took place.",
    "The class was slightly smaller than a normal seminar, which made discussions very fruitful and allowed each individual to significantly participate every class. I liked how Professor Dean lead discussions in that they were not based on summaries of the texts but rather she asked intellectual questions that really made you think and analyze the texts and their relations to other texts we read for the class. I think sometimes class discussion would veer a bit from the main question at hand and Professor Dean would veer with the class, but eventually we would make it back to the text."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in learning more about the Holocaust and how the history of the Holocaust is written. It explored important questions about how memory and victims' testimonies should be included in the writing of this history. I gained greater exposure to histories written about the Holocaust as well as various prominent memoirs. As someone who is planning on writing their senior thesis on the Holocaust, this course was extremely valuable.",
    "YES. Take this class. Take it if it's only because of Professor Dean. She is truly great. The readings are engaging, the class is low-stress.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was very well-taught and the readings were quite engaging. A large part of the course being great were the students willing to participate and voice their opinions. If you're someone who enjoys doing that, take the class.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis class will also teach students how to use other resources available at Yale through the library.",
    "I absolutely loved the course. Professor Dean did an excellent job of picking readings that were both informative and incredibly interesting. She guided the conversation very well and there was hardly ever an awkward silent moment during our class discussions. I loved the class. Take it!",
    "I think any history major should take a class about the writing of history itself, and I think this class really taught me how to think about history as a subject in a very different way. I had a fairly broad knowledge of the Holocaust before the class, but this class is how the Holocaust is remembered rather than the exact events, which is rarely the main focus of the period. This class made me approach my other academic pursuits from a new perspective and really enriched my learning."
