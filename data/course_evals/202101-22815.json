            "comments": [
                "A strength is that you get to work with your friends, a weakness is that you pretty much have to learn how to use different frameworks like React Native on you own.",
                "Weaknesses is students can get away with doing little work.",
                "I liked project-based work and the lessons that covered more broadly different aspects of software engineering in a professional work setting. I would have appreciated more guidance on how to work on a software project in the context of a university class, which differs from a job setting.",
                "Strengths - great practice working on a group software project, really teaches you how to get better at documentation/code sharing/etc.\r\nWeaknesses - most things you learn in lecture are things you'd learn from an internship (agile methodology, how to work on a team, etc). Since this is an upper level course, a lot of people have had these experiences already so it may be a bit repetitive",
                "Focused on building a product, as well as a comprehensive insight into all the steps that go into it",
                "was not incentivized to attend lecture with the amt of work for the project, even tho lecture had lots of useful practical info. but, homeworks were very manageable and mindful on top of the project, a good resume booster if ur cs, and (if ur team is good/productive etc.) it feels rewarding to do a project",
                "I loved how project-oriented it was. It let's students work somewhat freely in their projects.",
                "Love the flexibility of the course, but I wish there was more guidance in terms of the stacks to use.",
                "I think there could have been lecture content related to the various frameworks/languages/tools for app dev",
                "Strengths: complete creative freedom to make whatever you want however you want to make it.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses, but the course could be improved by having workshops about some common backend and fronted frameworks. Some students were not familiar with any which made it hard to collaborate.",
                "The strengths of this course are Timos's planning and organization of lectures which induced a great learning environment. The only weakness of this course was picking the groups in the beginning which was hard to navigate and evaluate the team members one would be joining.",
                "I think the main strength is working with a group of friends on a project you like. You truly experience what it is like to develop something as a group, and you get to learn not only \"CS\" aspects but also teamwork aspects.\r\nTo improve it, I'd include more instruction on frameworks earlier on (e.g. a TA session on React outside of class) and provide students with more means to form a group--I got lucky, but it could've gone bad for me.",
                "Strength: You will come out of it with a project that is actually relatively large-scale, because you have multiple people and all semester to work on it.  You will likely learn new frameworks and get a lot of good experience for interviews and jobs.  Weaknesses: Didn't learn too much from the actual lectures unfortunately",
                "Most computer science courses at Yale are problem set based. A course which is project-based is a welcome addition to the computer science curriculum, as it allows students to build the softer skills involved in software development, as well as build a larger, more long-lasting project instead of completing a problem set and forgetting about the work forever. The material in the lectures was interesting, but as it correlated little with the actual grade received in the class, I found it difficult to motivate myself to go to lecture."
