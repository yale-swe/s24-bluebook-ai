I loved that we would split the course into both translating and discussion each time, and Professor Greenwood made extraordinarily reasonable expectations for course reading and assignments.",

    "YES. This might be my favorite course that I have taken at Yale (and certainly within the Classics department)! The material of this course is very interesting and provides a lot of fodder to work with in when thinking about social constructionism. You will develop a better understanding of the meaning of \"justice\" in Athenian law courts and grapple with the importance of narrative development. This class is a MUST if Prof. Greenwood is teaching!",
    "Probably only to students who are interested in Greek history or literature -- it's a lot of work to put in if you're not interested in the subject matter.",
    "Absolutely.  The course material was interesting and entertaining, and Professor Greenwood was a stellar instructor, equal parts engaging and informative.",
