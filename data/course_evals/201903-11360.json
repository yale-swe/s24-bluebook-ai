   "comments": [
    "I learned about the circuitry of the brain by studying other animals. I learned how to use electrodes in combination with oscilloscopes.",
    "NONE. NOTHINGGGGGG. THIS COURSE TEACHES YOU NOTHING EXCOET HOW TO WASTE YOUR LIFE.",
    "how to do a dissection, how to use electrodes, etc.",
    "Firsthand observation of electrophysiology in worms, frogs, grasshoppersneat!",
    "I learned how to make intracellular and extracellular recordings of various model organisms.",
    "frog dissection (but you likely still won't be competent even after 4 weeks of dissecting)",
    "I learned about some methods for studying neurobiology with animal models.",
    "This course provided a foundation in electrical recording and dissection techniques and allowed me to actually see the concepts discussed in the lecture course be carried out in a practical setting.",
    "This course was super useful for how it contextualized and helped me better understand+remember material we learned in the neurobio lecture and introduced me to foundational (particularly electrophysiological) techniques. I was hesitant\/nervous about taking the course because of my lack of experience with STEM labs at Yale, but the teaching fellows were so helpful and supportive (thanks Ganesh and Mahira!). I appreciated how they emphasized engaging with the science over mastering a precise and arbitrary form in our lab notebooks and reports. Also, it was fun and enriching to simply listen to Haig tell the stories of the science we were learning and develop an appreciation for the growth of neurobiology as a discipline.",
    "I learned how to apply concepts learned in lecture, as well as various laboratory techniques.",
    "I learned a wide set of laboratory skills, how to work with other students, the importance of writing every detail in science experiments, how to talk to instructors and ask questions, being patient when working in labs."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is very hands on and you learn a lot. Workload is manageable. No weaknesses.",
    "You can never do anything so teaches you sqaut.",
    "strengths: cool experiments\r\nweaknesses: many of them did not work. most of the lab time was spent trying to get the setup to work, not performing the experiment and learning the concepts (membrane potential changes, etc.). I wish that some of the preparations would have been done prior to the lab so that students could learn and complete the intended goal of the experiment.",
    "This was the most disorganized lab course I have ever taken. It was pretty chill but I felt like it was not planned well, from lectures being difficult for everyone to hear with the often loud ambient noise in the lab and no microphones to the fact that the syllabus even admits that the course will often run later than its supposed to. I felt like a lot of time was wasted in lab, but at the same time the content was pretty cool and I enjoyed many of the experiments.",
    "I think the course workload has been worth the 0.5 credit, as compared to other lab courses I have taken. It was also a good way to reinforce content we learned in the Neurobiology class. However, I would have preferred more guidance for the weekly quizzes.",
    "This course has far too much lecture that directly covers what's in the book. A lot of time is wasted with long demonstrations. Otherwise, the experiments are fun and engaging.",
    "The course was interesting in that it allowed students to see concepts discussed in the lecture course carried out in real time. The lab manual was quite descriptive, and overall it was a good way to reinforce the lecture material and see it in a different way. However, there was a huge disconnect between the material present in the manual and what students actually did in lab. Time spent in lab was quite disorganized, with a lot of empty time and students almost always struggling to actually get their set-ups to work.",
    "The TFs' support is definitely a strength. I also really appreciated the lab manual's detail and contextualizing value. As for weaknesses, it was often difficult for any student to get usable data \/ successfully reproduce the classic experiments, and this was frustrating\/ bad for morale. However, the teaching team compensated for this by encouraging us to collaborate and prioritizing our scientific thinking \/ interpretation of results to show our understanding over perfect data collection\/records in their grading. One more remediable thing -- I felt like I was never properly introduced to the physical organization of the lab and often struggled to\/ was frustrated by putting together the experimental setup.",
    "The course is engaging, however the organization of the course makes it very difficult to follow the material sometimes.",
    "This was the most poorly organized course I have ever been enrolled in at Yale. Professors would spontaneously lecture about how neurobiology disproved religion and regularly interrupt lab procedure to talk at us. This course could be improved by providing students with a structured, accurate schedule of how each lab will be conducted, and by refraining from haphazardly lecturing at students who are trying to do their work.",
    "strengths: tackles a wide variety of topics using a wide range of laboratory set ups that allow students to grasp a wide array of laboratory skills\r\nweaknesses: sometimes the laboratory set ups did not work, student to faculty ratio was off, too many students for one lab\r\nimprovements: improve student to faculty ratio for the lab, provide more staff, or simplify experiments so that students can work independent of teaching fellow assistance"

   "comments": [
    "Yes this class is fun and you can get out early if you work efficiently. The instructors are good and the workload is not bad at all.",
    "No. You cab major in neuro with other labs take Gregory McCarthys lab he is a saint. This guy haig is a joke dont take any classes with him bc he will not teach you.",
    "Yes. It is a good way to tie in what you are learning in class. The content is interesting and the dissections are cool. However, it is frustrating that things hardly work.",
    "Pretty chill albeit frustrating course. You will get more out of it by not going through the motions in the procedures",
    "Yes, it is one of the lab courses with relatively lower workload.",
    "The labs in this course sound really cool (like recording action potentials from giant earthworms, or recording postsynaptic potentials from a frog NMJ), but in practice, you rarely collect any data and instead rely on the prof's demo data. As a result, labs are very frustrating because they feel like an exercise in learning how to set up an oscilloscope (only to find out that your oscilloscope is actually broken)! It is cool that you attempt to replicate a lot of very important early neuroscience experiments, and I did walk away with a better understanding of how action potentials are actually measured (basically every lab revolves around this concept), but I'm not sure if it was worth the hours of boredom of sitting in lab, waiting for a TF to come help fix your setup. This lab is wayyyy longer than it needs to be. However, if you're looking for a lab with a low workload, this lab is for you-- the only assignments are short lab summaries and prelab quizzes.",
    "Only if you need it.",
    "I would recommend to students with a very strong interest in neurobiology, but warn that I found it to be an extremely disorganized and frustrating course. I would also warn students that they should not take it if it will bother them to kill animals.",
    "Yes, particularly with these teaching fellows and instructor! Although I often felt frustrated with the course and its emphasis on learning-by-doing in relation to my own struggle with anxiety and risk aversion, I grew a lot as a student of neuroscience from it, it improved my performance in the lecture, and its grading and workload were more manageable and fair than I've heard from many other labs. This is a great lab to take for the neuroscience major requirement",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to take an enjoyable lab and apply skills learned in lecture.",
    "I had fun doing the labs. It was a great exercise to focus on learning the content in lab and organizing\/analyzing the data. I feel like the techniques we learned were very applicable and useful to have experienced.",
    "No. Do yourself a favor and do not take this course. Yale offers many biology labs better than this one.",
    "Yes!!! It is very interesting and helps to explain several neuroscience topics and neural systems without making the subject daunting. No laboratory background is required to succeed in the course because the lab manual and instructors are very helpful in explaining and assisting."
