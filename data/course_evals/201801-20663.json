    "The course is incredibly well taught and well organized. Students improve their Chinese very fast. My only wish is that there was more of an emphasis on Chinese culture in the course. I want to learn more about Chinese society while I am learning the language. Would this be at all possible?",
    "Great course. Lots of work. Would have been nice to have a greater variety of office hours, or just general drop-in tutorial hours. I kept trying to fit office hours into my schedule, but it often required skipping lecture.",
    "I really enjoyed the professors, they are all very thoughtful and kind people. I personally really enjoyed doing our final oral presentation. I felt that writing in Chinese really forced by to synthesize my understanding of the grammar in ways that doing the quizzes and homeworks didn't."

    "Yes! Learning Chinese is not easy (I didnt really know what I was getting myself into when I signed up for L1), but if you are willing to work hard, you will learn so much. If Chinese is something you are willing to dedicate yourself to, then Yale is a wonderful place to learn it.",
    "Yes. I mean, if you have the time to put in the effort, it's probably a much better experience. The class always made me feel bad because I knew I could have learned Chinese better if I had more time, but some of the rote memorization just required repetition.",
    "Yes, the Chinese program here at Yale is phenomenal and you will learn so much. It's a lot of work, but it's absolutely worth all of it, and the professors make it feel that way."
