                "This course was by far my favorite course at Yale. And the most challenging for me, as well. In this weekly seminar, we discussed different pandemics in Africa, from the Spanish Flu to AIDS, Ebola, and COVID-19, and explored how those pandemics played out in conjunction with local/international politics, public expectations, and technological capabilities. As a traditional STEM major, I left each seminar in pure shock by Prof. Steinberg's insights... such as how microbes, too, take agency in shaping human history or how setting a stage is an important political response to pandemics. I definitely think I've learned more about global health issues, international power dynamics in the past century, and approaches we should take to thinking about infectious diseases (e.g. can it ever be a purely scientific issue, as many leaders have said with COVID-19?). Anyone interested in public health, science, international relations, or even those who want to recap our collective experience with COVID-19, should definitely take this course.",
                "I learned about how people -- from colonial administrators to working class South Africans -- have responded to pandemics over the past century. I came to understand how the epidemiology of viruses really affects their impact and how public health reflects politics.\r\n\r\nThe course also provided us with a theoretical framework of how to think about healthcare (e.g. what is the difference between \"traditional healing\" and \"biomedicine\"). We also broke down the different social factors that influence how people respond to diseases on the ground.\r\n\r\nThere wasn't a big emphasis on primary-source research, but I learned how to write about more technical topics than most history courses demand using a mix of scholarly literature and more journalistic sources."

                "I wish Professor Steinberg would lecture just a bit more but overall great course. Very interesting subject matter and I loved the zoom guests.",
                "There are so, so many strengths to this course. I (and we) absolutely loved Prof. Steinberg. He is a brilliant academic who has such insightful ideas to share. He is incredible with how he leads/guides group discussion; we always left each seminar with diverse perspectives about the topic and yet also with the main takeaways that Prof. Steinberg wanted to convey. Though the class was big, I thought I could participate if I wanted to and had something to contribute to the discussion. The writing load is quite large for a Social Science credit (at least for me, who is a STEM major). We had two 10-page research papers and three 1-page reading responses throughout the semester. Though these papers were quite... painful, I learned so, so much from these research projects, and discussing ideas with Prof. Steinberg one-on-one was one of the highlights of this class (I just can't emphasize enough how much I love talking to the Prof). I think I also grew throughout the semester as a thinker, writer, and speaker. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness is that we're only meeting once a week! I wish that we had met more frequently for longer hours.",
                "This course was fantastic. Every discussion was fascinating and the readings weren't too intense (especially in the second half of the semester) so I was able to really engage with the material. Professor Steinberg asks very insightful questions and made it feel like we were on an intellectual quest to figure out what makes a pandemic response effective, rather than simply taking a college course.\r\n\r\nThe guest lecturers were also very well selected and I liked that we read their work ahead of time so we could ask informed questions. I also liked the fact that the reading responses weren't paragraph-long posts every week. Instead, we could pick a few weeks to really dig into the readings, write a meaningful page on them, and get feedback on our thoughts. \r\n\r\nThe syllabus wasn't perfect. Sometimes we would read a very abstract paper without much preparation and, some weeks, I felt like I was reading newspaper articles that were informative but didn't really have the same analytical depth. That being said, I think the level of engagement with the readings was much higher than most seminars and that might be partially because they were digestible. And a lot of the assigned readings were really thought provoking and creative (e.g. a fictional podcast about a mental asylum).\r\n\r\nOverall, though, this was one of the best courses I took at Yale. If there was any shortcoming, it would be that there were slightly too many people in the seminar."

                "YES, YES, YES! I would take this course again if I could!! The professor is brilliant and so so intelligent, and you'll learn a lot from the class about public health, politics, and pandemic response. If you are a pre-med student, pre-public health, pre-policy, pre-scientist, or pre-anyone student, please please strongly consider taking this class.",
                "Yes! Professor Steinberg is a really unique professor who has thought deeply about pandemics and manages discussion well. A lot of professors are interested in their subjects in a detached, academic way but you can tell that Professor Steinberg is asking questions to identify how society can actually improve and that's exciting. \r\n\r\nThis isn't a standard history course and pre-meds shouldn't expect a very biology-heavy class either. But, if you want to look at pandemics from a social-science perspective, this class is perfect. \r\n\r\nThe mix of students (grad students, STEM majors, and humanities students) was really unique and I think that improved our discussions."
