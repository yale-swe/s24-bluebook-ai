I learned to learn about not only Africa but anything with an open mind and considering different perspectives in analysing the world. it was very eye-opening. I learn to free myself of stigmas in understanding the world and others. The skills go beyond understanding just Africa."

                "This class was really engagingthe environment was growth oriented and not intimidating. Assignments all very reasonable. I would like a little more specificity in the curriculum though. It is very broad and I wouldve liked to avoid generalizing to the whole continent.",

The skills you gain are invaluable and everyone should learn them. it's a very chill course. sometimes it could be a little more stimulating but overall great course. take it with the goal of learning amazing flexibility skills and if you want a relatively chill class",

You read a lot of both foundational and cutting-edge work in postcolonial theory and get to discuss them in a warm but intellectually vibrant environment. Leslie is a great professor who will make you think about things in a way and with a depth you never have before. If you are even remotely interested in African studies, postcolonial studies, migration, global affairs, etc., this class is a must-take."
