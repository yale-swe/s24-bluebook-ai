I learned how to express myself more greatly in speaking, how to write at a higher caliber, and how to appreciate Chinese more.",
                "Throughout the course of the semester, I've grown a lot in my knowledge of Chinese vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. Talking in Chinese everyday and practicing grammar rules have really helped my conversational speaking abilities and ability to speak more spontaneously. I've really enjoyed my time in this class."

                "This class was incredibly proficient at teaching the intricate grammar of Chinese and the various skills needed to succeed in learning Chinese. By interacting with the professor face to face and having to speak Chinese every single day, proficiency was built up through practice. The assignments were also geared towards learning and were not overbearing.",
                "I believe the course overall is setup perfectly for the goal- one day asynchronous is definitely a good arrangement so that youre not always worrying about the daily character quiz and so that you have a little bit of time to sleep in after a week of 9am classes, which is much needed. But overall the structure is kind of perfect.",
                "I think that one of my weaknesses in the class is pronouncing certain words incorrectly because of the old habits I've been used to when speaking. I believe that the more I practice speaking and being more intentional about my tones and word choice would help aid my speaking abilities."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. The community you have, the support given to you, and the family you make through class everyday is really something special. The Chinese teachers at Yale are some of the most wonderful, kind, and generous people you'll meet."
