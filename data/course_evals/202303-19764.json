                "I learned SO much in this class. We talked about so many different artists that I was able to be inspired by for my own work and was encouraged to leap outside my comfort zone and it was just really fun to learn about all areas of photography and what the industry really looks like.",
                "I learned how to sequence, how to view and make photo books, and how to be a professional photographer. This class is clearly designed to explain and show what it means to do photography as a career (but it wasn't pushy). It was really helpful and interesting to learn about how to make photos that weren't just pretty, but also had significance.",
                "How to depict narrative and story through photography, sequencing, photobook making, what a career in the arts could look like.",
                "We learned a lot about the photo industry and ways to work in it, artists' processes, and the history of photography. We learned about different ways to present stories through photos.",
                "I can confidently say that I learned more from this photography class with Prof. Ivis than I believe I will in any other photography class. It's truly unfortunate that Prof. Ivis won't be teaching at Yale in the foreseeable future because the depth and breadth of knowledge and experience she brought to the class were unparalleled.\r\n\r\nThe core focus of the class was the art and practice of storytelling through photography. What made this class exceptional were the incredible guest speakers from various backgrounds within the industry. We had the privilege of learning from a top photobook publisher and printer, an award-winning artist who graced the cover of TIME and the New York Times Magazine, who is also a member of the prestigious Magnum Photos agency. These guest speakers provided invaluable insights into the professional world of photography.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these outstanding speakers, the class offered unique opportunities, such as a special tour before the opening of a renowned photographer's exhibit at MoMA featuring An-My L. We also had the chance to tour an iconic exhibit at the Yale Art Gallery, led by the curator, and engage with a photo editor from The New York Times.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of topics covered in this class was astounding. We delved into everything from the intricacies of printing and the art of creating photobooks by hand to gaining a deep understanding of how the photography industry operates behind the scenes. Prof. Ivis emphasized the importance of storytelling through photography, teaching us how to sequence photographs effectively to convey a compelling narrative. We even learned about the meticulous work that goes into setting up museum exhibits.\r\n\r\nOverall, this class was an incredible journey into the world of photography, offering a comprehensive understanding of the art, craft, and industry. Prof. Ivis's expertise (she'd worked in the industry for Magnum as well!) and the diverse array of experiences she brought to the classroom made this class truly exceptional. I'm grateful for the knowledge and inspiration I gained during this course and will carry these insights with me throughout my photography journey",
                "Improved my knowledge of the photographic medium.",
                "I learned a lot about sequencing, approaches to photographing, a range of photographers and photobooks! All in all, there were so many informative lectures and amazing feedback on our work.",

                "Strengths: Natalie is incredible. Got to talk to a bunch of different really famous people and hear their stories which was awesome and the feedback was also very clear and amazing. We also got a special edition tour to a MOMA exhibit which was ridiculously awesome.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no class time to shoot or edit so all of the projects must be done on your own outside of class",
                "Strengths: Natalie. Incredible professor. She was better than many professors I had who had taught for 10 times as long. She is insanely knowledgeable and well-connected in the photo world and she clearly cares about each of our individual successes. Any student who takes her class is lucky. You learn how to do things with photos and tell stories, not just take photos.\r\nWeaknesses: Big paper costs money. But CPAs can help with that. I loved the YDN project, but there could be some improvements in the infrastructure of that project. But all around awesome projects.",
                "Professor is a strength. Natalie is an amazing professor that cares about the improvement of her students and makes herself available during and outside of class. Her experience in the industry in multiple fields allowed her to bring in a lot of professional photographers that work for big places. \r\nNo weaknesses",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Great lectures by Prof. Ivis and visiting artists\r\n- MoMA visit was very special \r\n- Projects were designed to facilitate student learning\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Workload was too much",
                "This photography course, led by Prof. Ivis and supported by the exceptional Teaching Assistant (TA), offered an extraordinary learning experience without significant weaknesses despite it being her first time teaching this course.\r\n\r\nIt excelled in its comprehensive exploration of photography, particularly its focus on storytelling. Prof. Ivis brought in an impressive lineup of guest speakers from various segments of the photography industry, exposing us to invaluable insights and real-world perspectives. Moreover, the course offered unique opportunities such as exclusive tours of prominent exhibits, including An-My L's showcase at MoMA, and a private discussion and lunch with the artist. We also had the privilege of touring a significant exhibit at the Yale Art Gallery, led by its curator, and engaging with a photo editor from The New York Times.\r\n\r\nProf. Ivis's dedication to her students extended beyond the classroom. She actively worked with Yale Daily News to get everyone published, providing us with an invaluable opportunity to showcase our work to a broader audience. The TA's dedication, knowledge, and willingness to go the extra mile significantly enhanced our learning experience. Their assistance with assignments, clarification of concepts, and availability for questions outside of class were invaluable. Their passion for photography and commitment to helping students succeed were evident throughout the course.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this photography course, bolstered by Prof. Ivis, the outstanding TA, and the opportunity for publication through Yale Daily News, was a comprehensive and exceptional learning journey. It provided a deep understanding of photography and storytelling and offered invaluable real-world insights. It's a regrettable loss that the course won't be offered again, as it undoubtedly left a lasting impact on all of us fortunate enough to participate.",
                "Excellent course. We learned a lot about photography via guest lectures, field trips, and analyzing the work of those esteemed creators.",
                "The strengths of the course were how much content we covered and how amazing the classroom dynamic was. We all got a long so well thanks to Natalie's facilitation! She also provided such prepared and interesting lectures, brought in great speakers, and came up with great class exercises. I think we could have spent a little bit more time in the digital lab and working on our technical skills and editing.",

                "Yes because I feel like I have been exposed to photography in such a new way and have fallen in love with the practice of it all in a short amount of time. We crammed so much into one semester that I definitely got my bang for my buck with this one.",
                "Certainly. If you have never taken a photo class before, it would be beneficial to take an intro class first on the actual process and skills in creating works. This picks up from where those classes leave off, teaching you what to actually do with your photos. It is really designed around each person and their goals for the class. Also the YDN project is super cool (although the YDN needs to get its act together in the collab).",
                "Yes! This class is amazing for anybody that wants to enhance their photographic abilities. You get to develop your portfolio and work on projects you care about.",

It was an unparalleled learning experience that not only deepened my understanding of photography, storytelling, and the industry but also provided unique opportunities to engage with industry professionals, visit prestigious exhibits, and even get published through Yale Daily News. Prof. Ivis and the exceptional Teaching Assistant, along with the course's comprehensive content, made it an unforgettable journey. I believe this course has the potential to positively impact any student interested in photography.",
