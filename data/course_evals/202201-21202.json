                "First and foremost, this class has trained my eye incredibly well. I took this class first and foremost to practice exposure and composition, and it certainly did that. On top of that, I learned a great deal about photo history, the landscape of the current art photography environment, what to do upon graduation to enter this world, and most importantly, the content of a great photo."

            "comments": [
                "The class benefits greatly from its format. It is a great opportunity for any photographer who wants to focus in on a single aspect of the work. Additionally, there are no technical lessons or recaps, every student is expected to come in with their skills refined enough to execute the project they have in mind. Being this self initiated means that the class will suffer if the students are not collectively up to it. The students who were really on top of it seemed to benefit greatly from the long-term engagement both with their subject matter and from Prof. Kereszi and the TA (Rosa Polin)'s consistent engagement with their project development. However, there were more than a few students who were still developing their technical skills and as such their projects seemed to be as much about navigating their technique as it was their concept. Other students consistently did not have work ready to show in class, which is a detriment not only to themselves but to the other students.",
                "I really liked looking at the past MFA theses. They were great examples of good projects and helped me to craft my own.",
                "This is the perfect photo class.",
                "Getting to be immersed in the Yale photo department (crits, lectures, visiting artists, general sharing of knowledge). I could have benefited from slightly more structure + deadlines, but I also think its important to learn how to manage your time and work without deadlines. I also wish we had more conversations following visiting artist lectures.",
                "This is perhaps the nature of an art class, or perhaps because I havent actually taken that many art classes at Yale, but at times I felt that what I was searching for as an artist was a bit amorphous, and at times I struggled to make steps towards a goal of improvement because the field of possibilities was so wide. Its hard for me me I think to identify specific ways this course could be improved because it was a strange semester, and I think the first two weeks being online really threw it off. The only thing I could suggest is maybe more frequent check ins? Or perhaps slightly more structured assignments containing loose guidelines that work towards you project. But then it might lose some of what was so valuable in learning about the current landscape of the photo world. Im not sure."

                "As it's currently set up, this class is very well suited for a student who takes photography seriously and wants to develop a singular project. That being said, unfortunately if the other students aren't as serious, the class will suffer. I would not recommend this class if you do not feel confident in your technical abilities. You are not going to get nearly as much benefit out of this class if you are simultaneously figuring out your technique and your idea.",
                "Yes of course. It was a great course and we were able to see a lot of great work. my classmates were making very impressive photos and i felt pushed to do the same myself.",
                "Absolutely if youre interested in contemporary art photography.",
                "Yes! If you are committed to photography and it is an important part of your life you must take this class (its where all the photo nerds go).",
                "Yes. I would definitely recommend. I think that my one caveat would be that prior to this course, students should spend as much time as possible thinking about and making photos. I was really glad I was able to take this course, and I would definitely make the decision to take it again if I was doing this semester over. However, I think that if I had been able to start the photo series much earlier and take the intro classes and then work on my own projects and spend much more time thinking about and making photos, then I would have been much more able to get a lot out of this class."
