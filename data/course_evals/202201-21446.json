                "I learned a lot about using scholarship to build an essay and about what world literature is and the purposes it can be used for.",
                "I learned how to better understand not only how to analyze global literature, but how to understand how history, distribution, and geography affects its impact.",
                "I developed an appreciation of literature beyond the western canon, honed my skills of close reading and analysis, and really improved my own writing!",
                "Expanding my knowledge of world literature and improved my Harkness discussion skills",
                "I learned how to perform in-depth close readings of world literature, and to connect my analysis to larger literary themes and discussions. We covered a lot of really interesting topics throughout the semester, including the notion of critical fabulation in relation to Autobiography of My Mother by Jamaica Kincaid, modernism in Banjo by Claude McKay, and postmodernism in Waiting for the Barbarians by J.M. Coetzee. Professor Iheka's depth and breadth of knowledge about world literature is enviable, and I feel like I gained a lot of appreciation for the texts we read as the semester went on. Our final essay required us to close-read a text and draw from external sources, and this was the first time I'd written such a paper, so I felt like I gained a great deal of knowledge of how best to go about acquiring outside material and incorporating it into my work from this project.",
                "I think of two things. One - that I got an amazing small taste of African literature, which, somehow, I haven't really been introduced to yet at Yale despite taking A Lot of English classes. I absolutely loved Banjo by Claude McKay and Waiting for the Barbarians by J. M. Coetzee. Two - I think this class talks a lot about truth and stories as they relate to post modernism, and I found that incredibly insightful. Related to that, I think, is the courses necessary conversation with how World Literature is perceived and shared. I think those conversations about panning to audiences or the dangers of translation were amazing to have as an English student and reader in general."

                "I liked the texts a lot and I liked the discussions. I wish people participated a little more so we could have more engaged discussions, but I still really enjoyed our classes.",
                "The professor did a great job with leading discussion, highlighting themes of each text, providing feedback on work, and making himself accessible to students. I can't think of any weaknesses - I enjoyed each class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Iheka and his masterful syllabus!!! Really he is a phenomenal instructor, so kind and compassionate. His insights are profound and thought-provoking. The syllabus as a whole is my favorite of any Ive had at Yale as an English major. It was really refreshing to read world literature: something not incredibly common here.",
                "I think a strength of the course is the class size my classes around 11 people which resulted in educated and civilized harnessed discussions. I dont think there are that many weaknesses in the structure of this course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Iheka is incredible. He is insanely knowledgeable about world literature, and hearing him speak about how the various authors we read explored larger themes in relation to colonialism, identity, and modernism was immensely valuable. I liked the fact that this class was a small seminar, as that really fostered discussion of the texts, and people were able to contribute a lot. I also just liked the selection of novels, plays, and poemswe read a lot of fascinating material. Weaknesses: I think there might just be one too many books on the syllabus. We were reading about a novel a week throughout the semester, and I feel like we often didn't have enough time to fully discuss some of the texts, just because we were grinding through so much material. I think removing one bookjust onewould have made it a little bit easier to fully engage with all of the texts. As it was, I wasn't able to finish several novels (although I got close!), and I barely started the last one, simply due to the pressure of the various other classes I was taking. Had my workload this semester been lower, I probably would've been able to engage more fully with the course. So I recommend taking this class in a semester when you know you'll have time to actually read the books.",
                "Absolute strengths are the syllabus. I think the base of African Literature is broad and enjoyable, and I think the branches we take to Irish and Indian literature with Synge and Roy were very welcome and provided nuance and insight to the topics we had been discussing.\r\nI think another strength was the feedback on essays that we got. Professor Iheka both made us bring in essay work way before it was due--which was helpful not just for timeliness, but also getting to know our peers and helping our essays grow--and gave great written feedback after essays were turned in.\r\nA personal weakness to this course was the engagement by some of my peers. I don't know if Professor Iheka could have done something different--it seemed to me like he really tried to make people talk--but a few would just not talk almost ever, even in 10 second silences or so."

                "Yes! This class is a very interesting introduction to world lit. You can learn a lot about how to improve your writing and how to close read a text.",
                "Definitely - Professor Iheka would be a great fit for many kinds of students. The syllabus was well developed and engaging, and my writing skills improved.",
                "YES! Of all the foundational English courses, this was my favorite. You explore such a broad range of literature and the seminar format allows for such great participation and learning from other classmates.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to a another student. The readings we covered were not only interesting when looked at alone but connected to each other often.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. I think it was a great foundational course for the English major, and the feedback was very helpful.",
                "If you like reading, analyzing, discussing, and writing about literature, then definitely, definitely take this course. Professor Iheka is amazing, and the texts are excellent as well. It's truly a win-win for an introductory English course. I think I probably would've enjoyed myself a bit more if I hadn't discovered halfway through the semester that I didn't really want to be an English major. That made slogging through the remaining texts and writing the final essay pretty painful. I also wound up contributing less to class discussions than I would've liked, just because I felt kind of intimidated by some of the rather intense English majors taking the course, and I felt a little bit out of place in general.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. With it, I have now taken all three required foundational courses for the English major, and it goes with the other two as classes I adored and learned so much from. I think it helps if you have an interest in themes and discussions of race, gender, and sometimes sex politics, but I really think anyone would benefit and enjoy this class. If you don't want to engage that much because you're busy, you don't need to. Come to class and listen to great discussion. If you can engage, the class becomes amazing. I can't speak to other professors, but Professor Cajetan Iheka was super friendly, incredibly attentive, and super smart. He also has a very fun collection of dress shirts, but that doesn't matter for this much I guess."
