Although I had previously taken courses focused on writing papers,  English 114 helped to educate me onto the writing process as a whole, from dissecting source material, forming theses proposals, and polishing my essays.  The course offered an excellent balance between exploring readings and films and diving deeper into texts, sparking excellent conversation with my classmates, and focusing on the writing technique and building skill.",

I really enjoyed the class discussions (the environment was so welcoming even people that might be afraid of participating will want to chip in!), the readings were all fascinating, and the writing process was enjoyable as it was broken down into very manageable steps.",
                "This strengths of this class really center around how multifaceted it is. Each day was a little different than the last and we explored so many topics that all eventually tied back into our writings. It is a very high interaction course that allows students to get personal with the topic at hand and each other. A weakness I noticed, especially towards the beginning of the class was that difficult to understand texts often created a barrier to conversation on topics we were meant to be discussion. This was typically solved by instructor intervention and taking a step back to dissect these themes together.",
                "The feedback on each essay was always helpful. I also enjoyed the movies, and how each unit and how the units built on each other. I think a weakness is that the instructions and feedback on citations weren't always clear. Some of the readings were also a bit dense at times."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. As a whole, I feel like English 114 offers an excellent base for students' writing abilities. It teaches the basics in a way that is still very intellectually stimulating and interesting to a wide range of students. Specifically, How Romantic! provided a deep dive into topics like love and morals and how they are portrayed in media and our personal lives that I believe any one who is even slightly interested in these topics would find thrilling. The readings and course material for this class were interesting and engageing and offered a look into a wide variety of topics and perspectives.",
