                "African history - very broad",
                "I learned how to go to the Yale archives and closely examine a primary source. I learned so much on Africa and colonialism that I did not know before.",
                "Thorough understanding of the causes, nature and consequences of colonialism in Africa",
                "I learned a lot on African history - precolonial, colonial, and postcolonial history. The course was a great overview on African history, and emphasized the trends and themes as seen throughout the continent.",
                "I got a fantastic overview of the past couple hundred years of African history, and also learned to use the archives in Sterling. I had never used them before, and I appreciated that the class had an assignment dedicated to teaching us to use the archives.",
                "I learned so much about colonialism in Africa, African independence movements, and postcolonial challenges to African states. The course does a great job of weaving themes throughout the lectures and covers a lot of ground.",
                "I learned so much about colonialism in Africa and the way it continues to have impacts today. I completely reframed my understanding of African history.",
                "I learned a lot about African independence movements and, in particular, African social and economic history through this course. In particular, Professor Machava consistently encouraged us to engage with the archive and outside history sources, such as literature, throughout the semester, which greatly improved my skills as a history student.",
                "I learned a lot about African history that I had never had covered before in any history class.  It was interesting to compare and contrast different colonial and post-colonial histories in Africa as well as the present day effects that persist.  The course covers a vast time period and geographic region - maybe too much - but it is a great introductory course, especially if you have never taken an African history class before.",
                "I gained a solid introductory background in African colonization and its aftermath. As part of the first short paper, I also made my first visit to the archives in search of a primary source document (which wasnt nearly as bad as I thought it might be).",

                "Strengths: Very enriching material on Africa and the various themes within African Historiography \r\nWeakness: Lack of discussion of East/Horn of Africa",
                "The readings are very interesting and build an understanding of the political, economic, and social systems over time in African countries. The textbook could be somewhat dense, but the primary sources and other secondary sources illuminated African experience over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. The grading distribution is very manageable and allows for engagement with a number of different paper styles and research.",
                "weakness:  African history - very broad a lot of info so hard to cover",
                "I wish we had more grades than just the three papers, such as weekly reading responses. I also wish the lecture style had varied more, as it could get very monotonous. Finally, I thought that the spacing of the due dates of the three papers in addition to the final exam was a little too close together. It felt like everything was lumped in at the end. I also do not think there needed to be a final essay exam, as I had already written about two of the 4 prompts in my papers.",
                "I really enjoyed the lectures, I thought they were very engaging and interesting. Professor Machava was a great lecturer as well and discussion sections and readings were interesting and relevant to the course.\r\n\r\nThe course got a bit confusing at the end, which I think is due to the nature of the history of postcolonial Africa - sometimes it was hard to keep track of what events were happening in each country/what systems of governance each country had. Also, in terms of the work for the course, we always focused on broader topics  (the prompts were very broad) which posed challenges.",
                "Strengths: Professor Machava is a great lecturer and we should absolutely have more classes on African history. There were so many times when he would discuss something in lecture and I would wish we could spend more time on it. Weaknesses: I'm guessing this is universally applicable to history lectures, but most people came to section unprepared and did not engage in discussion.",
                "I found the lectures to be super engaging and the material to be highly interesting. I think one small procedural change could be editing the Canvas page to make it more obvious which readings are for which lectures. I think it also would be helpful to have a bit more guidance and early discussion about final papers to make that process more straightforward.",
                "The strengths of the course were Professor Machava's lectures and the course material that we read. The class was incredibly engaging, and the teaching team and our material greatly enhanced my understanding of each lecture topic. However, the weaknesses of the course was that I feel like it didn't dive as deep into the material as I wished it had. My teaching fellow didn't provide much analysis or ask us very many questions during our discussion sections, often leaving me feeling dissatisfied with the level of depth with which we explored the material. Moreover, I sometimes felt that class was cancelled when it didn't need to be in order to allow us to work on our assignments. The subject matter of the class was so interesting that I just wish we had had more of it--I felt like I didn't learn as much as I hoped I would at the beginning of the semester.",
                "Strengths - nice professor, approachable TFs, interesting readings, variation of assignments\r\nWeaknesses - unclear/slow feedback, too broad a time and geographic range",
                "Where this course excels is as an entry point for Yale students interested in African history but without any prior knowledge or background. This course was nothing if not accessible, and gave me a clear and solid understanding of how colonialism varied across the continent and has continued to harm Africa. That said, the course was perhaps a little too accessible. I rarely felt challenged or pushed intellectually. While its understandable that a course on such an enormous topic would default to broad strokes, I do feel we could have gone much deeper. One good example is Timothy Snyders Eastern Europe to 1914, which also covers a sprawling period but does not sacrifice detail or rigor.",
                "The Professor was brilliant and supportive, but the course content was too general. I learned few national histories completely - except for those I studied for papers, which worked well for me."

However, exploring specifically African experience and the oppression which characterized colonialism and post-colonialist systems is so important and contributes to modern politics and approaches to diplomatic relations, aid, and government systems across the African continent.",

                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone looking to get a broad sense of the historical processes that shaped modern Africa from colonialism to present. The class covers a broad scope, so I would recommend it mostly as an introductory course.",
                "Yes, Professor Machava is a wonderful lecturer, and you will learn so much about not only Africa's history, but how that history has politically and economically impacted the present.",
                "For anyone interested in African history or world history in general I think this is an incredible course to get you thinking about important issues. The lectures are consistently engaging and the workload is very manageable.",
                "Yes. Prof. Machava is the best lecturer I've had at Yale so far.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I greatly enjoyed the subject matter and Professor Machava's lectures. However, I would also warn them that the class and the discussion sections are rather disorganized, leaving your learning largely in your own hands.",
                "I would recommend this course to another Yale student with the understanding that it is very introductory and just scratches the surface of the history of African independence.  Professor Machava is very kind and decently well organized, and the class is by no means taxing.  It can sometimes feel repetitive, but that tends to be the case with an introductory history course.  I would especially recommend this class to history majors who need a major requirement outside of their geographic region, as this class requires almost 0 prior knowledge.",
