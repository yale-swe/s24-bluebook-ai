Also, the class was a great introduction to the study of comparative politics in general, as I previously had mainly only studied American politics.",

The course helped me expand my knowledge on the topic and gave me good resources to learn more about how the Arab spring shaped the middle east."

                "The course is so great. I really like Professorthe best and most efficient professor I have ever meet. Hope to take her course in the future.",
                "The course was strong overall. Recorded lectures were clear and the material was relevant and interesting. The documentaries were particularly good. My favorite part of our classes were the discussions of current articles toward the end of our meetings.",
                "One of its biggest strength is how the professor and teaching assistant have successfully created this open environment where we are allowed to openly share our thoughts without being too self conscious about being wrong. It makes it easier to actually gain something from the discussions.",
                "Strengths: Professor and content\r\nWeakness: the not in person lectures",
                "The live lectures and discussion sections were very useful in clarifying the material. Because of the shortened class format, there were too many readings each week and it was difficult to engage thoroughly with all of them.",
                "The layout of the class was simple and straightforward, which I thought was very important considering it was only a five-week-long summer class. With such a short course, not having to worry about logistical issues or things like that was very important in getting more benefit out of the class, because it allowed me to focus as much as I could on the actual content of the class. For example: the Canvas site was laid out perfectly and in an extremely organized manner. It was always easy to find readings, weekly quizzes, reading response information, etc.\r\n\r\nThe short length of the course is not a weakness but it is something that anyone thinking about taking any YSS course should consider. Five weeks is long enough to get a solid introduction to a field or dip into some quality discussion, but it generally does not allow for the same level of depth or nuance as a full semester-long course would. In my opinion, at leas.t",
                "This course was well structured to give a general overview of politics in the Middle East.",
                "my main weakness was the course quizzes."

Professor Elizabeth Nugent is very passionate about the topic and very knowledgable about the region, it was an honour to be in her class.",

                "Absolutely! This course was fantastically well organized in all sensesthe syllabus didn't change erratically, the topic of the modules all made sense, and every reading was relevant and built on each other. I think I came out of this class with a much better grasp of the complexities of politics in the Middle East, as well as various concepts in academic political science as well.",
