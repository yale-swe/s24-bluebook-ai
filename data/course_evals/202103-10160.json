            "comments": [
                "strengths: you can do it completely online so u don't have to run up and down science hill & the ta's are really engaging and help a lot with the weekly psets and will review anything at anytime & jdrs is a great guy and an even better professor",
                "Strengths: JDRS (seriously, great, engages with students, and super understanding in and out of class); lectures were digestible, fun, concise, and explained the concepts well. I felt I did not need many external resources for studying beyond those provided (p-sets, lecture recordings, office-hours, and homework); office-hours (you really, really should go. There is no excuse not to get an 100 on all of the homework assignments, in my opinion. I made the mistake of acting too cool for office hours on the first homework, missed points, and started attending. Did very well on the rest of the assignments. Bury your shame and ask for help, because the buffer of quiz + homework grades can really help you on the exams, which are more difficult than the homework and quizzes); second half of course is fun, and easier than first half. Overall, I felt very welcomed as a first-year in my first QR course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: TAs in second half of the semester were weaker than first half; one in particular seemed to have little understanding of the homework beyond the answer sheet, often showing preference to students and giving them the answers with no learning process involved while providing others very little useful information. Also, office-hours availability is greatly reduced in second half of the course. This does not at all apply to all the TAs. I really only have one on my mind. The rest were great, but I did miss a lot of the TAs from S&DS 100; exams were not concordant with homework assignments or quizzesthough I did well on the exams, I felt the difficulty was far greater than on our other assignments; the Probability unit. JDRS jokes about the unit, and it is funny, but if \"everyone does bad on the probability unit,\" I feel some sort of change is warranted. I thought the teaching here could be improved, and more practice problems could be provided (providing, say, 3 pages of practice probability problems would have been very, very helpful); Homework grading was weirdly strict at timesquestions would be short and ask for little direct information, but in reality there were several pieces of specific information we had to provide. This, again, gives people who go to Office Hours a big advantage. Several times I went to a last-minute office hours, and was given a random piece of information by a TA, off-hand, that ended up saving me points. More clarity on grading, and what explanations are needed would be very useful.\r\n\r\nI have more weaknesses than strengths listed here, but I do think overall the course was fun, useful, and well-taught. Thanks to JDRS and the TAs.",
                "It moves very quickly, but knowing that going in and going to office hours with questions definitely helped me stay on top of it.",
                "It has few flaws, but it would be great if questions on Ed discussion were answered more quickly.",
                "Strengths The course being made available through modules was very helpful because i was able to go back and review content much later. I also thought it had very strong office hour availability for help. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses  Sometimes it felt as though the psets were not fully testing my understanding; I would have appreciated more practice problems especially in preparation for the exams.",
                "There really isn't anything to improve on, JDRS has the Intro Stats sequence down to a science and I would recommend this course to any student at Yale. The strengths of this course was the availability of resources to everyone. There were over 50 office hours a week hosted by the professor and teaching assistants, so there was always a time where I felt like I could go if I needed help. Another important thing for my peers was the fact that this course was offered in person, online, or completely asynchronously so you could choose how you wanted to learn.",
                "While the class was very fast-paced and at times questions on homeworks were ambiguous, there was an abundance of support from the TAs and ULAs. Multiple office hours with different people were available throughout the week.",
                "Strengths: powerpoint slides were very helpful and informative, lots of office hours and TA help available. Weaknesses: moved very very fast and was to fall behind, also easy to not go to class because can do it all online",
                "I LOVED this course! At the beginning of the semester, I could have not anticipated citing stats as my favorite class, but the strength of the professor combined with the commonsense grading approach truly made it my favorite class. \r\n\r\nStrengths: Tests are open-note, open-book -- little stress. Lectures are great and engaging. You learn a lot of stats!\r\nWeaknesses: This may just be my fault in that I did not anticipate how closely they would be grading the homework.",
                "Strengths - manageable workload, predictable deadlines, plenty of Office Hours times (!!!), easy to access modules and lecture recordings online\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - N/A",
                "Strengths: JDRS is a really nice professor, puts all lectures online, lots of office hours",
                "I liked how there was an asynchronous choice for this course. It made the learning and material very accessible. I did not like how it moved very slow at first but then very quickly all the sudden.",
                "I feel that the class moved very fast. Concepts are only mentioned once and then it is assumed that you know them. I didn't really like this because I ended up feeling lost a lot of the time. I went into class everyday, but I liked how there were pre-recorded videos in case I had a conflict. JDRS made the material as interesting and fun as he could.",
                "Strengths: \r\n-JDRSs teaching skills\r\n-The resources he provided such as recorded lectures, modules, and 60 hours of office hours.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-To be honest not much to criticize really",
                "I thought the course was super interesting, and the examples used in lecture and psets were really fun to engage with. There was a lot of material, but it was pretty easy to follow along.",
                "I think this class was formatted excellently to allow for students to learn at their own pace and receive the help and guidance that they needed. I really appreciated that we could mix and match between in-person classes, livestreaming classes, and taking the class purely remotely, as it offered a flexibility that none of my other classes provided. Additionally, I really appreciated that there were over 50 hours of office hours every week so that students could get the help that they needed on PSETs and other assignments whenever they needed it. \r\nMy one comment for improvement is that it might be helpful to offer students specific practice problems and other exercises that they can do beyond the psets and the quizzes. I know JDRS provided a list of textbooks that students could potentially work with, so maybe just picking out a few examples from those books that students could try would be really helpful to give people additional resources for practice.",
                "The online prerecorded lectures were actually really engaging and JDRS puts a lot of effort into making the class enjoyable.",
                "Strengths: JDRS as a professor, flexibility of how to consume the material, focus on understanding and applying the concepts in the real world",
                "Great and passionate professor-- just wasn't interested in the material. No changes suggested.",
                "I think the strengths are that the lecture was very engaging and interesting and that there were ample opportunities to get help at least for the first part of the semester. I think the weaknesses were that once we split up into individual sections it felt like there weren't as many opportunities to get help or they didn't line up with the problem set due dates.",
                "The strengths include the amount of office hours and the option to engage with the course fully asynchronously. A primary weakness is that the module material can be quite overwhelming - some recorded lecture videos totaled to much more time than the class actually ran for any given day. There was a lot of material packed in within a small amount of time, and it was often difficult to keep up. The course could be improved by focusing more exclusively on the principle concepts and less on the \"nitty gritty\" points that are not essential for us to master.",
                "The strength of this course was the ability to complete it at your own convenience. This really helped me personally learn the material and make sure when I was learning it, I was completely focused. The only thing I would suggest being improved is maybe including more examples in class that are similar to the problem sets.",
                "The course is completely asynchronous which is SUCH a huge help. I was able to fit all the work in at my own pace which is especially helpful during the busy times and the lags in the semester. There is also SO MUCH SUPPORT. JDRS is such a great lecturer and the TAs are all very helpful. If you simply do everything in this class you will be fine.",
                "Strengths: the online version of this course was extremely well organized, and TFs/JDRS were always super accessible for questions.\r\nWeaknesses: n/a",
                "Appreciate how the course was able to be taken as a mix of asynchronous and live.",
                "It was great and online midterms were a good idea with pandemic going on.",
                "I liked how it could be taken asynchronously. JDRS is also the best!",
                "This courses strengths lie in the teaching and the flexibility provided to students. The professor did a phenomenal job of giving engaging lectures and teaching information I was unfamiliar with in a very clear way. The class was also on zoom, recorded, and in-person, all especially helpful during this unusual semester. I felt that the course was hard to keep up with as it was very fast-paced, however, this was clearly stated on the syllabus.",
                "The strengths are that JDRS is a wonderful teacher, and he actually cares about his students. In other words, if you show up to office hours, you'll know what to do on the PSETs, and for the tests, you always have triple the amount of time he expects it to take. For the final, we were given 6 hours. I doubt anyone spent all 6 on it, but knowing I could waste an hour thinking about a question and still have time left reduced my anxiety surrounding the exams significantly.",
                "I really value that this class was recorded so it could be taken asynchronously. One thing I would recommend to improve is to perhaps use a different software instead of Minitab because to my understanding, Minitab is not widely used in the stats field.",
                "Strengths: RECORDED LECTURES! Office hours are extremely helpful and ample (make sure you check ahead tho and don't wait until the last minute). PSets really teach you the statistics (lectures just introduce you to them). Open-note, online exams are very fair for the style of teaching employed in this class.\r\nWeaknesses: The psets can sometimes be very vague & TAs can be rather harsh when grading them (taking off points for things that were not explicitly asked in the pset questions). PLEASE ADD OPTIONAL PRACTICE PROBLEMS... psets were helpful but taught you more MiniTab-related statistics rather than conceptual statistics... this made exams somewhat difficult (although, if you study the quizzes, psets, and go through all the notes exams weren't horrible).",
                "moved very quickly towards the end",
                "The format of this course is ideal. The course can be taken completely virtually, which is extremely helpful, as the material can be conveyed well virtually. Also, the weekly problem sets as homework work well.\r\n\r\nA weakness of this course is that it is not always super interesting.",
                "Strengths: asynchronous format and JDRS makes stats really engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the asynchronous format can make it a flaw because if you don't keep up with your work, you will start to fall behind",
                "Our professor definitely kept me awake by cracking a lot of jokes, using real life examples, and doing different voices throughout - I appreciated his energy and use of comedy in stats esp because I have attention and hyperactivity issues. Also had very flexible office hours and an online discussion forum."

                "If you are like me half a year ago, you're a fairly nervous prefrosh interested in the humanities looking for an \"easy\" QR course that is also usefulone that isn't a gut, but has a light workload, is interesting, and allows you to take full advantage of the rest of Yale during your first year. If that's you, I recommend this course, and specifically I recommend the section taught entirely by JDRS.\r\n\r\nA good grade is attainable without too much stress, and the workload is balanced, much less than my other courses. Beware of the examinations, because they are probably more difficult than you think, and GO TO OFFICE HOURS. I said this in my other comment, but getting all 100s on the homework assignments is very much possible if you engage with the TAs, who were mostly great this year. \r\n\r\nAlso, note that the Probability Unit is by far the hardest part of the class, and that the second half is smooth sailing.\r\n\r\nI think some of the other reviews here can be scary (?), saying stuff like \"don't fall behind!\" or \"it's really hard to catch up.\" It's true that the class moves at a fairly quick pace, but nothing beyond what you are used to in previous courses. Great course for non-STEM people needing a QR credit, and a useful course generally to have a basic knowledge of statistics. Anecdotally, this course seems to cover more material than similar classes at peer schools, which is a merit to JDRS and the teaching staff.\r\n\r\nIf you at least watch the lectures, go to office hours, and do everything you are supposed to, you will find a reasonable course that is enjoyable and engaging taught by a great professor.",

                "Absolutely! Having a fundamental knowledge of statistics is incredibly helpful in most every profession, and this class does a great job of teaching it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone looking for a positive, encouraging space in which to explore and deepen their understanding of statistics. The course is well-formatted to facilitate learning and to offer help to students who need it. It is important, however, to keep a good pace because the course covers a lot of material over the semester!",
                "Only if required for your major. Definitely not a bad course, but the material is dry and there are way better classes to take for fun at Yale.",
                "Yes! Stats is a great QR -- it's really useful stuff to understand, and the class is actually pretty low-stress and fun. JDRS is an amazing prof, and there is a huge availability in office hours so it's easy to get help.",
                "Yes! I would recommend  this course if you want a basic introduction to statistics. I think I came away from the class with a decent amount of knowledge in statistics but I definitely don't feel like I have the expertise to plan and carry out statistical analysis of data if I collected data for a thesis. But I do feel like I know what questions to ask and would be more equipped to approach statistical analysis with help from an expert. \r\nThe class format itself is very flexible and accommodating since lectures are recorded, and there are so many office hours. \r\nOverall I would recommend the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to get an introduction to statistics in a relatively stress-free way. This course has many real-world applications and students can choose a track that fits their interests. I think many types of students can benefit from knowing basic principles of statistics.",
                "Yes, it is an independent course which allows you to learn as much as you want to. If you don't want to learn, you probably could succeed in this course so the amount you learn is completely up to you.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the content. It is by no means \"easy\", you will definitely have to put the work in. But if you are a social sciences major it is great value for your time since you will need to know how to understand these statistical terms in your coursework. If you have a tablet or print out the notes PPTs I would recommend writing directly on the documents he gives so you can retain the emphasis on different parts during the lecture.",
                "Yes, if you plan to read or produce any kind of research in your career during or after Yale.",
                "Yes, its a good QR",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It contents are valuable to all students pursuing different forms of research. This course also has many resources and is very well taught.",
                "Absolutely. If you have never taken a stats class before, make sure to go to JDRS's office hours to understand the psets, and review every slide of the notes before the exams, and you will be fine. This was my second QR credit at Yale, and at times the PSETs stressed me out, but I found a study group that had me smiling and laughing while analyzing matrix plots, and I woke up early to ask JDRS questions during his OH, and in the end, it wasn't painful. So even if you're a humanities student, just know that you can definitely get through this class.",
                "Definitely! A good gut class that I still feel I learned a lot from. Definitely learned skills that will be helpful to my professional life.",
                "Yes! I would say, as someone who came in with no statistics background, it could be a little difficult at times (so be sure to attend office hours!! TAs are extremely helpful). Overall, this course does require you to put in some effort so do NOT slack or you will fall behind & quickly (the PSets help keep you on track, though). It is a great QR that is mostly a \"gut\" if you put in some effort.",
                "Definitely would recommend to another non-STEM person looking for a QR (even without any previous stats knowledge). The psets weren't bad and the tfs often went over the problems in office hours, the recorded classes were great to rewatch, and the exams were a lot like the preparation materials so I felt pretty prepared going into them. I wouldn't take this class if you see yourself getting behind, as it moves quickly especially in the last few weeks and missing a pset can have a huge impact on your overall grade.",
                "Yes! Its good to get a basic understanding of statistics and it is not too challenging.",
                "Yes! Stats is a good QR credit and taking it with JDRS is always a huge plus!",
                "Yes - very useful for various fields and helpful that the second part of the class is tailored more closely to a specific subject you choose (ie. poli sci, socy)."
