                "This class covered a wide array of poems, novels, and short stories from the 1600s to the present. This was a fantastic class for following the major currents of thought in French literature. It also greatly improved my writing and analysis skills.",
                "I read an amazing selection of French literature and improved my ability to discuss complex and abstract concepts orally and on paper! I also gained a broad sense of French literary movements over time.",
                "This class really pushed my French skills. I got better at reading, writing, listening and speaking in French, and throughout the semester, I found myself becoming more and more comfortable starting assignments and participating in class. This class was not structured as an introduction to French nor a grammar review, but actually improved my French confidence more than that would have by forcing me to constantly practice and engage with French.",
                "I learned how to analyze classic French litterature",
                "Fren 170 is a fantastic look through French literature over the past 1000 years, with a specific focus on the past few hundred. I learnt how to evaluate literature, of course additionally in another language.",
                "Good comprehensive foundational understanding of the seminal works of French literature",
                "I gained a great general overview of French literature, and my French improved tremendously.",
                "This course gave me a broad overview of French Literature throughout the centuries, beginning in the 12th century and spanning to present day. I got the opportunity to practice my French speaking, reading, and writing skills, and gained experience analyzing literary texts in French (particularly looking beyond just grammar and comprehension and looking for deeper meaning).",
                "This was the first time that I read a whole work of literature in French - I was so proud of myself! The course gave me the opportunity to explore multiple different types of text (poetry, novel, play, essay) in a short period time, which provided a rapid learning curve. I have learnt just how much I enjoy studying French and it encouraged me to become a Comparative Literature major."

            "comments": [
                "weaknesses: the class is just way too big. This department has a serious lack of literature classes actually conducted in french, so the few that are become way too crowded. This is a symptom of a greater issue in the french dept.\r\n\r\nStrengths: I really loved the reading itself, and Maryam is a very funny intelligent woman i just wish the class were smaller so there could be more real discussion",
                "Strengths: A wonderful professor who will push the class to truly analyzing the readings and articulating their points in class. Some great readings. Plenty of opportunities to participate and practice speaking French. Weaknesses: Some of the readings are very long, might have been better for some readings to have excerpts assigned rather than the whole work.",
                "Mme. Sanjabi is amazing and incredibly knowledgeable about French literature. Classes were always engaging and I loved the works she chose. The detailed summary sheets of major literary movements/authors she provided were also really interesting and helpful!\r\n\r\nWith that being said, no native English speaking college student can read an entire book (or more) a week in French. The first few weeks of poems were great because the readings were manageable sizes and we had time to really dive into them. But by a month into the semester we were all skimming the first sections at best. I think we would learn more from this class if we had a few lectures on major themes in French literary history, and then spent more time diving deeper into fewer works. Four major assignments also felt excessive- two essays and a presentation would probably be appropriate.",
                "Strengths: Selection of readings was amazing, lots of women writers and readings from all over the French speaking world. I think Mme Sanjabi did an amazing job of explaining the context behind each text, and her sense of humor is so wonderful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish that the grading policies/what was expected of us in the presentation and essays were clearer. For instance, I never knew how much the presentation essay was worth and never got feedback on my presentation or the accompanying essay. I think it would also be helpful to receive corrections on our essays that were more hints than actual fixes (for instance \"incorrect tense\" or \"incorrect gender\") because as it currently works, you can just copy and paste the corrected version into a new document and send it back without actually internalizing any of the mistakes. I wasnt a huge fan of how Mme Sanjabi ran class discussions. It made it very intimidating to talk in class, and I felt like there was a right or a wrong answer when contributing. It felt very Q&A like, where people were not really building off of each other but saying a lot of Je suis daccord and just rephrasing each other a bunch of times. I wish we had small group discussions before breaking into a larger group, since I feel like that would make for better discussions.",
                "This class provided a really strong overview of French literature. I really liked the structure of getting small introductions about the authors before diving into discussions as well as the student presentations. One improvement might be that we often did more reading than was covered in class, so potentially fewer readings could be assigned so we could have more time to discuss each or some readings could be shortened or abbreviated. That being said, I really liked many of the plays we read, so I wouldn't have wanted to cut them.",
                "Weakness: its very easy to not do the readings and get away with it, a lot of the readings themselves are not very interesting its like taking a Shakespeare English class in French \r\nStrengths: Mme. Sanjabi is an amazing professor and knows what shes doing",
                "It is a good survey of French literature, and the 2 or 3 essays built on knowledge from classes. However, I felt that it took a long time (8 weeks or so) to do/receive the first part of graded work, so it was hard to know exactly where I was in the class.",
                "Less reading in class",
                "Discussions in class couldn't cover all the material we read, but they were very engaging nonetheless.",
                "This course covers a variety of topics over a wide range of time periods. Therefore, it's a great strength that we get exposure to a wide variety of literature through this course. The level of French is appropriate for an L5+ course and the amount of reading assigned each class was doable. We also take time in each class to analyze major themes in each piece rather than only focusing on comprehension. One weakness is that it was difficult to engage in the material at the start of the semester - maybe this would have been easier if we had some small group discussions in addition to those with the entire class. However, engagement got better as the semester went on, so this weakness eventually resolved itself. Another small weakness is that we moved through topics very quickly, so at times I felt I could not fully get into one time period before we moved on to the next.",
                "professor sanjabi is extremely kind, thoughtful, and brilliant",
                "Strengths: A very large variety of texts types from across 10 centuries was perfect for an 'Introduction' course. Having been exposed to so many different things (while retaining sufficient depth) I can now take away exactly what literature I like and want to engage with further. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I really liked having regular reading and 4 interspersed large assignments. I would, however, have liked to do a bit more writing to force me to fully engage with what I was reading. Perhaps more regular reading summaries or question answers could be helpful to further develop French writing skills!"

                "This is my favorite French course that I have taken at Yale! I really liked it more than any of the grammar intensive courses and I feel like it actually helped my French improve. That being said, if you don't like literary analysis or longer reading in French, it might not be the course for you.",

                "Yes! I needed an L5 and wasnt interested in a typical grammar/vocabulary class and this was an excellent alternative",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in French literature and who would like to improve their writing and speaking skills quickly.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student that wants a general overview of French literature. We read French texts in their original formats (nothing was simplified), so we got the real experience of reading and analyzing French literature. The readings each week were doable and we had sufficient time to write the two essays required in this course. If I was ever confused coming into class, I was also always able to leave with a deeper understanding and all my questions answered. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course to someone looking to dive into the world of French Lit without it being too intensive or in-depth.",
                "yes, professor sanjabi is a gem and truly cares about her students.",
                "YES! We read incredibly interesting texts, and our presentations enabled us to take initiative and read more about a chosen writer! The professor was engaging, patient and funny. This is the first class I have ever taken taught fully in French and she spoke at a pace that was incredibly easy to understand. Furthermore, there was a clear structure to the course and each week we received the reading alongside a document with guiding questions and images to help us!",
                "yes! I know Madame Sanjabi is retiring but she is one of the kindest and best French professors I've ever had at Yale and she really made this course great. Strongly recommend!"
