                "Strengths: The material of this course is so interesting. The background reading, secondary sources, and primary sources all worked really well together to allow us to have really fruitful discussions in class. Professor Ulrich is also so knowledgeable, and if there's any confusion on the history she always steps in to clear it up. Weakness: The reading is too long and dense. I enjoyed the readings, but it was frustrating that we regularly didn't have enough time in class to discuss all of them, even after I spent more than 6 hours reading a week.",
                "No weaknesses, perfectly suited to student learning",
                "I think the texts that we analyzed are the strength of this course. Everything we read provided something new to glean about chivalry and medieval literature. I think that discussions in the course were difficult to have remotely. I don't know why this class, in particular, was so difficult, but there was a disconnect between the students in this course. When this course is taught in person and there is able to be more camaraderie between the students and the professor, the course will improve.",
                "I really enjoyed class discussions, especially since everyone was so committed to contributing. The workload, however, was a lotand sometimes I found myself engaging with the material less deeply in order to just have the time to get through it all.",
                "This course was a decent amount of work and Professor Ulrich sets very high expectations. However, if you are a student interested in exploring new genres of literature, I highly recommend that you take this course."

It was so intensely time-consuming because there was so much reading, and we didn't even get to discuss all the reading in class because there was just too much. It was very interesting and I don't regret taking this classProfessor Ulrich and my classmates were all amazingbut I would tell another student to take another class with an equally interesting subject matter and less reading.",

However, it requires a lot of commitment to get something out of the course. It's not a class to just skate through. If you're willing to commit, it's great.",
                "Yes, but only if you are willing to put in the work when it comes to engaging with the material for this class. This is not the type of class that you can half-ass the reading and be okay. I loved this course, and if you have the time to commit to it, you will too!"
