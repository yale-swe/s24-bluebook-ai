                "I learned how to consider literature and history together in the nineteenth century. I had never considered the two disciplineswhich we are quick to separate in today's academic world, but were much closer in the periodtogether in quite this way. It was refreshing to devote a class to those questions, without feeling limited to one particular kind of text.",
                "A comprehensive view of the historical narrative and historical fiction landscape. Learned about this across authors, genres, and time. Also improved my ability to write at the intersection of close reading and secondary source analysis.",
                "I learned about 19th century British historical/literary writing (see the syllabus for details, but it really was a lineup of heavy hitters -- think Dickens, Eliot, Carlyle, etc.). What a neat period of writing! Each page I was able to read was a treat. I also improved my writing. The revision process for my midterm essay was intellectually satisfying. The final essay was the longest essay I've ever written for a literature course. It was both really challenging and really fun to write.",
                "I learned so much from this course. In terms of the specific course material, I gained a great understanding of how our idea of history developed in the Anglophone world and how fiction and nonfiction worked together (or were part of the same intellectual movement) to do this. More broadly though, I learned how to analyze books constructively. I went from asking \"What is the book trying to say?\" to \"How does this book, as a piece of literature, work to communicate a message?\" This leap has been invaluable. Also, I learned that I have a great love for 19th-century fiction."

                "Great survey, loved the discussions of each book, I felt like I gained a lot of historical knowledge and analytical expertise.",
                "Strengths: Professor Markovits and Professor Semmel are phenomenal guides to the era. Yes, theoretically, you could pick up Romola or A Tale of Two Cities on your own and attempt to read them, but I gained so much more out of the texts because of their explanations and guiding questions. They also have the best structure for writing that I have seen in a Yale seminar: we had the opportunity for rewrites on our midterm paper and to submit our final paper as a draft for robust comments. Area for improvement: in some cases, it would have been helpful to receive the opening explanation about a text instead as the conclusion to the prior seminar; sometimes, especially for the more unfamiliar excerpts, I felt like I was stumbling through the text without knowing what to look for, but everything always made far more sense at seminar. Nonetheless, it was a great course and I would highly recommend it!",
                "Strengths include: professors, breadth and depth of materials, small seminar\r\n\r\nWeaknesses include; All western texts/non from other traditions, a bit inflexible on certain grading and other course policies",
                "Strengths: Exceptional professors, great reading list, useful discussions in class.\r\nWeaknesses: Basically none, except for at times, there was heavy reading load, with not enough time to discuss all of it in class.",
                "This course is well-taught and well-planned. There is a good mix of theoretical/nonfiction texts and fiction, the reading is manageable but productive, seminars are extensively prepared for by both professors, and there is ample feedback on writing. I can't think of any weaknesses."

                "Yes absolutely.  The professors are both lovely, they complement each other in their teaching very well, and I feel like you learn so much about historical context that you dont get in other english courses.",
                "Yes, if you would like to learn more about nineteenth-century thought! I was struck in many ways how their era is similar to our own, so the course would be especially interesting to people thinking about how rapid changes in technology, new political developments including the rise of nationalism, and historical memory's relationship to modern state legitimacy. It's also a great balance of longer texts and novels, so I would recommend the course on the basis of the readings alone. Plus, Professor Markovits and Professor Semmel are superb instructors, and it was interesting to learn in a co-taught setting, which is a relatively rare opportunity at Yale!",
                "Yes I would. The professors are great, and its a small, good environment for learning.",
                "Yes! It's a significant lift on the reading and writing front, but very worth it. I'm not an English major, but I enjoyed every minute of it.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in literature and the intersection between literature and history. The readings are all interesting and Professor Markovits and Professor Semmel's teaching elevates them further. The workload is manageable. I looked forward to our seminars."
