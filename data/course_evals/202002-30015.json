   "comments": [
    "Learned a lot more about how energy is quantified and calculated.",
    "I learned the basics of the world's energy economy and environmental problems related to energy.",
    "I learned a lot about where we get our energy, the effects of our energy sources and usage, and potential future innovations in energy technology.",
    "I learned a great deal about energy consumption and energy conservation efforts, while also revisiting unit conversions which was a good brain exercise.",
    "Quantitative skills, insight into energy sources",
    "quantitative thinking & how science and politics interact with each other & how we put science into use.",
    "Lots of understanding about energy and the climate.",
    "I developed a thorough mathematical, environmental, and political understanding of national power systems and new power generation technology.",
    "I developed knowledge on the broad technologies and applications of renewable energies and the underlying dynamics of how energy works in our world today. I was able to gain insight into how our society uses energy, how much, what the distribution of energy looks like, and the possibilities for the future of energy use.",
    "The course gave a broad overview of the energy landscape in the United States and the world. It also described many different ways people are trying to solve the problems that energy production has created."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lectures were 3.5 hours long, which was completely unnecessary. The course could be improved by shorter lesson times and more organized lectures.",
    "The sessions are pretty long so it was got hard to pay attention by the end, but the information was relevant and understandable. Maybe shorter classes more often in the week?",
    "I do not study science or math and having been out if high school for so long I definitely needed extra help to complete assignments. I wish Yale had easier courses to complete the QR requirements, but again it is not impossible to do so it just means you have to put in more effort. That being said while you may be able to do well on homework assignments your true understanding of a course will reveal itself on the exams. While I know exams are the way in which we evaluate a persons knowledge of a subject I think Yale needs to revisit how students earn QR requirements and what knowledge they actually acquire from these courses because students should not be able to perform well on problem sets and yet not do well on exams, or forget all the material once the class has ended. Even though the physics and chemistry parts of the course were too difficult for me I was still able learn a lot of valuable material by learning about the socio-political and economic factors that relate to energy and energy technology, and that I will carry with me for long after this class. So when creating QR courses and requirements, I wish Yale would take into account that the material should be accessible to students like me so that we can truly learn rather and use these than encourage us to regurgitate math problems and chemical equations.",
    "Very clear slides, a lot of support from the professor",
    "Dr Prober is an amazing professor.",
    "I found the lectures (and questions that arose from students during them) and problem sets interesting and relevant to the course subject. They both answered a lot of questions I had about energy and power systems. The one suggestion I have is that the problem set questions felt a bit repetitive; it may have been better to supplement them with interesting youtube videos or questions about problems\/innovations from students' hometowns.",
    "The lectures were very long and it felt like a lot of them could have been shortened a little bit, or maybe spread out to 3 days a week with 2-hour sessions. It was great that we covered such a wide range of the technology and energy applications in our world today, I am glad that I felt like I gained a wide range of knowledge on the topic.",
    "I think the course suffered a bit because it took place online, so lectures which were designed to take place over multiple days took place on the same day. This occasionally led to overlaps in material that felt excessive. Also, the three hour long lectures were at times difficult to concentrate through. I would have preferred shorter lectures that took place more frequently."

   "comments": [
    "I would not, as it was very poorly taught and most of the material could be learned within a few hours by reading the textbook.",
    "Yes! Professor Prober is very passionate about energy and clearly loves to teach.",
    "Yes, the guest lectures are engaging, Professor Prober is very nice and understanding, and if you are already decent at math and word problems this probably won't be too difficult for you, but if your not always go to tutoring sessions.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, especially for students who are interested in STEM but not majoring in it.",
    "Yes! I found the course interesting and practical. Anyone who lives in an electrified society should have some understanding of the processes and technologies that go into creating their energy.",
    "Yes because I think it was a good foundation and survey of energy in our society today which I think is a really important topic.",
    "This course covers important material to know, and I think its easy to overestimate ones understanding of the global energy crisis. This class is a cure for that, so I would definitely recommend it."
