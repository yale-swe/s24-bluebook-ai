                "I learned a lot about Tocqueville and J.S. Mill and both of their political philosophies. I developed my oral and written abilities by discussing the readings in class and writing papers, respectively. I gained insight into how I can think about my own political philosophy and the tradeoffs of American political thought and institutions.",
                "At the risk of sounding too simple, I learned so much about both Tocqueville and Mill's philosophies. Prof. Wilford's knowledge about both of their work is extremely strong, and she is wonderful at articulating both of their arguments and theories in a way that is well-suited for her students to digest and understand the information. I also think this course helped me work on my reading skills, as the readings are dense and often difficult to understand. My critical reading skills improved with the reading we did in this course. Lastly, my writing skills regarding philosophy improved because I had not written many philosophy papers before. Prof. Wilford's feedback on the papers is very helpful and constructive.",
                "I learned how to read dense philosophical texts and come up with specific questions. I also improved my analytical writing.",
                "This class was a wonderful exercise in close-reading political theory, ensuring that we generate a groundwork to develop our own thoughts and opinions thoroughly informed by the philosopher we're focusing on.",
                "I learned more about the philosophies of Tocqueville and Mill. The class was a great space to dive deep into texts and thoroughly analyze the writings and meanings of the texts."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: everything, amazing professor, good reading, manageable workload, great feedback, and great in-class discussions.",
                "The students in this class were all very motivated and actively participated in the class, which made discussion very interesting and engaging. Prof. Wilford's knowledge of the material and her skill at explaining and articulating concepts also helped direct discussion effectively and helped students learn. The course material was interesting and the format of the course  focusing heavily on two philosophers, one at a time and then being able to draw comparisons and contrasts between them  was well thought out. The only major thing I would change about the course might be to make it two 75-minute sessions a week instead of one 110-minute session a week. Only meeting once a week for such a long period of time is challenging and sometimes it seems like two 75-minute sessions per week would make it easier to stay focused in discussion.",
                "The syllabus is excellent. Tocqueville and Mill complement each other naturally and its nice to focus on two authors rather than jumping around. Professor Wilford is also a skilled discussion leader. Instead of talking too much, she listens to students' ideas and responds to them. \r\n\r\nI also really appreciated the clear tips she gave before we had to write our first essay and the feedback she gave on our writing. \r\n\r\nFor some reason, the discussion seemed to stray from the text very easily and get bogged down in generalization. This seemed to be mostly a product of people not having done the reading. I'm honestly not sure if this is Professor Wilford's fault and I was sometimes guilty too.",
                "There were no weaknesses, as far as I'm concerned! I loved the focus on only two authors and the steady pace at which we worked through them, focusing on specific passages and wording.",
                "I think the times when we were able to have engaging class discussion were the most engaging parts of class. Unfortunately, these moments were fewer and farther between than I would have liked. Having more questions posed to the class that structure the conversation could be helpful in creating more dialogue."

And if not for the course topic, then at least for the Professor. Professor Wilford is an incredible human, facilitates great discussion, and takes a genuine interest in her students.",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course to any student interested in studying political philosophy, regardless of major or prior experience with the subject. Basically no prior experience with political philosophy is necessary to take this class, and Prof. Wilford does a great job of making the class accessible to everybody. If you're interested in the material, I would definitely suggest trying out this course.",
                "If you're interested in political philosophy and want to compare the ideas of two major theorists, I think it's a great choice.",
