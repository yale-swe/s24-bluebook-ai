                "Professor Burger and TF Nick Brown were both great strengths of this course. Lecture topics were well organized and matched well class to class, building a well-rounded context of the Inca Empire.",
                "Really interesting material, but not very well organized",
                "Really engaging course material! It was helpful having a list of terms during the first half of the semester, but it would have been nice to have continued posting the list to canvas. Workload was great, allowing people to take learning into their own hands by doing the readings.",
                "Lectures were informational and well-organized, readings were excellent supplementary content",
                "It has very little direction or linear progression, making it hard to follow. It is mostly a conglomerate of facts and findings.",
                "Strengths - very fascinating subject matter. Prof B also made sure to incorporate a range of media to facilitate our learning, including maps, drawings, documentaries and texts. I particularly enjoyed the Inca object assignment, as it encouraged me to go out to an art gallery and explore Inca art in person, which was a great experience.\r\nWeaknesses - the lectures did not include any slides and had minimal signposting. If I stopped taking notes for even a few minutes, it was often very difficult to fill in the gaps or catch up to where we were. Additionally, the readings were extremely dense. All of this meant that figuring out what we needed to retain for exams and assignments was challenging.",
                "Dr. Burger is not only an expert on Inca excavations but a brilliant storyteller! All of his lectures were extremely engaging and told in a conversational manner. Another wonderful thing about the course is that Dr. Burger incorporates a variety of perspectives and interpretations of the Inca Empire from scholars such as Tom Zuidema and Maria Rostworowski. \r\n\r\nThe only improvement I could think of was that the lectures could use more of a visual element besides the occasional projected photo. For example, I especially enjoyed the lecture on architecture of power in the Inca Empire because the presentation contained more guided questions, lists, and overall words to keep me grounded. The sections are optional to attend, but I felt that I got the most from this course by attending them and engaging in conversation about the material learned from the lectures!"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
                "Yes. Fascinating and broad overview of a great civilization. Sparked a deep interest in Inca studies.",
                "Yes! Professor Burger is an excellent instructor, as he often paired lecture material with stories that were tied directly to material. He's a perfect match for this course and helped expand my knowledge about the Incas. If you're any bit interested in learning about the Incas, fully recommend taking this course. The exams were very manageable, and the essay about an Inca object was something that could be done with class notes.",
                "Yes, but be prepared to organize yourself.",
                "Yes. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in archeology, pre-Columbian civilizations, or Latin American history in general. Professor Burger is a world renowned scholar of the Incas, and this course is a great opportunity to learn from him and his research.",
                "If you have an interest in Inca culture or in archaeology in general, take this class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to a friend because I found it easy to learn but by the end of the semester I had absorbed an incredibly large amount of knowledge of the subject.",
                "This was a really great intro course into anthropology. From optional section to a special movie screening with free snacks, this class can be whatever you make of it",
                "Yes, this class is very interesting and harbors a number of discussions and archaeological considerations.",
                "Yes  no other class offered at Yale on the Inca society. Good insight into an often undertaught culture",
                "Yes! I cannot recommend this course enough. I came in with zero experience in the Inca Empire and archaeology, and I left with a serious consideration to switch to a major in archaeology or anthropology."
