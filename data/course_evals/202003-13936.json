                "I think that sometimes the lectures were a bit too long and repetitive. I enjoyed the discussions, debates, and field trips that we had the most. this is a course that needs to be hands on learning rather than lecturing because of the course material. I absolutely loved the readings that we did, especially the Four Fish book.",
                "Strengths: The content of this course was easy to follow, and explained in digestible ways. The weekly food journals allowed us to apply what we were learning to our lives.\r\nWeaknesses: The low workload and ostensible lack of evaluations made it difficult to stay engaged during class. This could be improved by making weekly assignments\/reading questions more directly related to the lectures.",
                "The course proved to be very engaging, allowing me to discuss my interpretation of readings and experiences while applying it to daily life. Over all, it was a pretty good course, given the covid-19 circumstances.",
                "Strengths - interesting content; professor cares about students; manageable work load; small class keeps you engaged; field trips were a highlight even though we could only stay on campus\r\nWeaknesses - for a first year seminar, seemed deficient guidance in conducting and writing a research paper, maybe incorporate deadlines for smaller portions of the paper along the way w\/ feedback; sometimes becomes more lecture than discussion based",
                "Strengths: The in-person field trips were fun and the research papers helped us build skills in reading scientific text.\r\nWeaknesses: The field trips were a bit repetitive, although a part of that is because of this year's COVID restrictions. The class was also the size of a discussion section but the lessons were structured like a lecture that were not as interesting as the discussions.\r\nWhat could be improved: More discussion amongst peers and less lecture-oriented",
                "It was great that this course was in-person once a week. Professor Puth and the TA Erica were both wonderful at giving feedback and were always willing to meet, although sometimes the instructions for the weekly-written work were a bit unclear. I felt that the course was really geared towards first-years which I appreciated. The guest lectures we had were incredibly long and not engaging, especially because they lasted about 2 hours on zoom. Shortening those or having them in-person would have been so much better. Overall though, I learned a lot and the work wasn't very difficult.",
                "This course had many strengths. Mainly, the field trips we took as a class to the Yale Farm perfectly fit with the material we learned through the readings and seminars. The trips to the Yale Farm were very hands on, and we were able to employ organic farming methods to grow our own produce. The only improvement I would make to the course is the length of guest lecturers in an online format. Occasionally, I found that it was difficult to remain engaged for a two hour guest lecture on Zoom.",
                "The in-person field trips were a strength of this course as the gave a much needed reprieve from zoom classes. Also, Prof. Puth was always quick to respond to questions and provide feedback when a student asked for it. A weakness of this course is a little more guidance, or possibly an example paper, could be given when writing the final research paper to make the expectation and formatting of the paper clearer, especially considering it is many first-years' first time writing a scientific research paper."

                "The lectures and other information-based teaching translated fairly well to an online format. The visits to the farm were educational, but because of the pandemic, it felt like we were missing a key part of the class by limiting the in-person component.",
                "In-person, socially distant classes helped manage time and relieve stress.",
                "Succeeded: The online format was good for guest speakers to come and present\r\nWhat could be improved: More online activities that could involve everyone in the class, such as using the voting format, or break-out functions more often.",
                "The in-person classes were great! The guest lectures over zoom though were SO long and not engagingthey lasted about 2 hours on zoom. Professor Puth did a great job at facilitating conversation over zoom. I also appreciated that the lecture part of our classes was recorded because that way I was able to just listen during class instead of trying to take notes and watch my computer all at once. I used the recordings of the lectures to complete almost all of the assigned work.",
                "There was significant success in terms of small group field trips to Kroon Hall and the Yale Farm. Because we were only able to meet in person with groups of 5 people or fewer, I found that the level of engagement was higher and more intimate lessons were taught. Some other practices that succeeded were the virtual weekly seminars, class debates about course topics, and one on one paper meetings with Professor Puth and Erica. The only improvement I would suggest is shortening the length of virtual guest lectures.",
                "Discussions were very prominent and lively, debates were very fun. Sometimes lectures can be stretched too long and students start to get tired and unfocused.",
                "The smaller in-person meetings were a huge success as they gave a real-world example of the content we were learning in class.  Also having access to the recorded lectures and lecture slides was helpful too."

I came into the course thinking that I would be interested in learning about the food industry (since I took a similar class in high school), but I was disappointed because it was not as interactive as I thought it would be. Again, this could be the fault of the pandemic taking a toll on the field trips and such.",
                "Yes! Especially as a science credit for non-STEM students interested in the environment\/food. It does have weekly work (either submitting reading questions, filling out a lab worksheet, or writing a food journal) but those really helped with course engagement since the only big project is the final paper.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The material is very interesting and hands on, and the knowledge you learn in the course can easily be applied to everyday life. In the context of climate change and extreme weather events, is extremely important to understand basic ecology and sustainable farming methods.",
                "Yes, it is a great introductory course to ecology and if you enjoy learning where food comes from or how it's made, it's a great course for you.",
