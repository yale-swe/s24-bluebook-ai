                "Concepts that build on the ones I learned in 440. It's useful to see the actual applications of quantum mechanics to realistic situations.",
                "It was nice to learn about the real meat of quantum, the actual application of the theory developed in 440. I love SKL's Do-Easy method, demonstrations, and personalized lecture notes that he posted from time to time. Lectures were not the most attention-grabbing or easy-to-follow at all times, but fairly bearable. Workload was pretty light.",

                "I think the course would benefit from a younger instructor. Prof Lamoureax is extremely knowledgable but will sometimes gloss over steps or write down equations without explaining them fully. The course would also be better if it lined up more with the textbook.",
                "With this edition of PHYS 441, Steve K. Lamoreaux has transcended and will be cherished in the minds of everyone who stayed in 441. I will always remember his jokes in class and overall his encouragement to stay in science. He was always in office hours even though maybe just one or two students showed up. I think he also made quite some effort to go to the actual classroom, so I respect SKL a lot.",
                "Problem sets were very challenging and engaging. Professor Lamoreaux wants students to succeed and was always helpful at office hours.",
                "Strengths: really cool content, good textbook, excellent (albeit occasional) post-lecture notes -- really, the PDFs on density matrices, WKB approx., Lamb shift, etc. were absolutely terrific. I think the course can be improved by gauging the engagement of students in lectures, just checking in if they're zoning out (instead of just simply asking, \"Does this all make sense? Yeah?\")",
                "The course had low enrollment this semester which made for an excellent seminar-style environment that really aided learning. Prof. Lamoreaux was very receptive to feedback and did a great job making the material engaging, including some really interesting demos. The main weakness I would say was the Griffiths textbook; Prof. and students agreed that the third edition leaves much to be desired. Hopefully Shankar or Sakurai will be used in the future."

                "The course is probably never gonna be offered in the same format again, this was a once in a lifetime opportunity.",
                "Sure, if you're grad-school bound or a physics-intensive major or just really curious why on earth you learnt the stuff in 440! Might very much depend on the prof, tho! In some years, this has been the only reason physics majors got an A- or a B+ on their record.",
                "Yes, absolutely! It's required for the intensive major, but even if you are a non-intensive major or just someone with a strong math background who is interested in quantum mechanics, I would encourage you to take the 440/441 sequence. It is an excellent introduction to the material and provides good practice with both the conceptual and mathematical methods of the field."
