                "Definitely worth taking. It's fairly accessible (no need to take 320 beforehand), and it feels like a big payoff for whatever analysis courses you may have taken prior. Honestly, it's absurd how powerful some of the theorems you learn are - proving Hahn-Banach on the first day of class is like starting a Pokemon game with a Level 100 Arceus.",
                "Yes. If you haven't functional analysis before, or, if you're like me, and have very shaky point-set topology, this course would be really good to take. Various forms of vector space + topology appear everywhere throughout mathematics, and this course definitely gives you some very useful tools to deal with them.",
