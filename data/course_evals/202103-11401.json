                "The history of central bank, money, roles of central bank, and how to design a central bank.\r\nGained the skills of how to do case studies and write papers on certain policies. Insights from a \"regulator\" were adopted in the course.",

The case studies and tabletop exercises sharpened my ability to analyze complex financial shocks and a hands-on setting to think through the many policy responses that central banks must weigh in real-time. The informal guest lectures by top officials at different central banks also provided invaluable insight into the inner workings of the monetary policy field.",

We also did several case studies on central bank crisis response including 9/11 and the Global Financial Crisis and had several really great guest speakers. I gained a strong understanding of the ways in which central banks interact with private and public entities and make policy decisions to meet the goals of low inflation and low unemployment.",

There are so many intricacies that you don't think about regarding monetary policy and financial stability, and this class does a great job at covering most of the tools the Fed and other central banks have used to keep our economies stable. This class gives you a great overview of the roles and responsibilities of the Fed."

                "Professor English is incredibly knowledgeable and well-spoken. He does a wonderful job motivating both the theory and applied parts of class and engaging students.",
                "This course provides a large amount of information on central banking to the point its hard to absorb it.\r\nNonetheless, it very interesting particularly as it also brings in a lot of prominent guest speakers.",
                "Strength: Flagging the required readings and limiting them to one per week. It also wasn't absolutely necessary to do the readings since lecture was so comprehensive. Very well organized.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Saving all examination of the material till the final put a lot of pressure on the last few weeks of the course. I think I would have understood more of the material earlier if there was some sort of midterm. I was also never sure if section was mandatory or not. Getting to the fourth floor of the SOM was quite a hike as well.",
                "Very well organized and challenged us both with knowledge and with writing techniques.\r\nSometimes the assignments of case studies and papers are a little bit not that related to the course, so maybe have some recap throughout the course?\r\nAlso, really appreciated the weekly coffee chat on current events.",
                "I thought the content of the course was very interesting, but difficult to engage with if you don't have a high interest in central banking or previous exposure to terms like money mutual funds. I found it hard to sit through lectures and enjoy the class because of my lack of prior knowledge.",
                "Strengths: Content was dense but rich, assignments were effective especially the interactive ones.",
                "It might make sense to have the switch the due dates of the second case study and the first paper in order to make the workload feel more balanced over the course of the semester",
                "I appreciated that the classes were always recorded and that students had the option to attend classes virtually.\r\n\r\nProf. English went out of his way to organize informal coffee chats every Friday during which we could discuss emerging developments in the central banking and monetary policy world. \r\n\r\nMany of the readings consisted of academic papers. Prof. English would go over the key insights during lecture, but I think it would be useful to have a guiding set of questions to accompany and focus one's reading of the papers. It would also be helpful to have the lecture slides published well in advance.",
                "Good lectures",
                "This course has many strengths. Feedback is extensive. Professor English writes up full page responses to each paper we write, suggesting ways the paper could be improved and posing questions to think about. Its very thorough and Im grateful for the time he takes to do that. The course is also very well organized and I found the assignments interesting. We also had several really great guest speakers come talk to the class.",
                "Professor is incredibly knowledgeable and literally knows this stuff better than anyone else including people at the Fed. He has so much experience doing this stuff and has seen so much and teaches this class (and his other class) incredibly. Professor also cares a lot about giving feedback on essays and stuff; the comments always push you to think about the questions more deeply. Also the guest speakers are always great and are a highlight as well.",
                "The class has the perfect amount of content to move at a smooth pace where one learns a good amount of interesting, important information throughout the semester. The class moves itself because one lecture builds upon another, and it is really awesome seeing how every concept taught in the course pieces together to create a cohesive economic framework."

                "Yes if you are interested in the subject matter and how important central banks are to national and global economic functioning.",

                "Yes! This class offers an excellent survey of the major roles of central banks and the ways in which a central banks decisions interact with other sectors of the economy. \r\n\r\nThe workload is manageable and spread evenly across the semester and the few economic models discussed in class require very little math.\r\n\r\nProf. English is the biggest strength of this class. He has worked at both the Fed and the BiS, and is able to distill his vast expertise in a way that is accessible and meaningful to students who are new to the study of central banking. \r\n\r\nThe class is cross-listed at the school of management. A fair number of the graduate students taking this class have worked at central banks both in the US and abroad. I found that the class discussions were enriched by their insight.",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely! You gain such a great understanding of the US banking system which really helps not just in understanding the technical aspects of the US economy, but also in understanding current events (like the debt ceiling, government spending, what happened in 08 and what happened/is happening in the Covid crisis). One of my favorite classes.",
                "100%. If you are econ major, pls take class with Professor. If you are not, you should still take a class with Professor.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning more about the global economy, as all of the topics taught in the class were relevant to thinking about the macroeconomy. This course really dives deep into the fundamental macroeconomic drivers of the global economy and allows us to understand financial stability through a new perspective. These things are extremely important when thinking about long term personal investments."
