At the end of the semester, I was able to have conversations with people who were fluent in French without too much trouble. \r\nI also learned a great deal about French literature, culture, and cinema.",
                "I gained skills across all areas of my french, including written, listening, speaking, and grammar. I felt a particular improvement in listening due to the daily exercises.",
                "My listening skills have never been tested this much during a French course, and I think I've genuinely learned what to listen for in conversation and generally how to listen better to whomever I am conversing with. I also learned to trust myself and my instincts a bit more. I think coming in with no listening skills and then having to do the homework assignments that were completely auditory and being tested biweekly on those skills, you have to learn to go with whatever it is that you heard the first time around. I started trusting my gut much more just so that I would not panic about what I could've heard.",
                "I gained a lot of technical grammar knowledge and also became better at reading literature. My understanding is not just comprehension but also analysis.",

                "There were so many strengths to this class!! Even though it was on Zoom, I felt engaged and excited to go to class. I enjoyed the structure and organization of the assignments and M. Koizim's clear expectations. \r\nI genuinely don't have any instructions for how this class could be improved; it exceed all my expectations.",
                "The course is strong at improving listening and reading skills due to the large amount of readings and homework. However, there is a lack of practise available for speaking, which is arguably the most important element of a language.",
                "Even though I have been taking French for a very long time, this course made me realize that I still have a lot to learn. I enjoyed the texts that we read in class and my classroom environment. However, for a course that meets every single day, I think we got way too much homework. Any time I had to stay up because of my work, especially when we were reading a book, it was because of French. Maybe it needs to be explicitly outlined how we should go about reading the texts so that we don't get bogged down in the details or maybe we need to think about how many audio assignments are being paired with each reading assignment. While I am aware that L4 focuses more on conversations, I also thought that it was a bit unfair to test on oral skills when in class we don't usually get the time to answer opinionated questions about the material we're working with nor do we get to talk to each other that often. Not to say that our oral proficiency shouldn't be tested, I would just like to see more conversations happening in class in which students actually get to talk to each other and where we're talking about more than just the plot points of the material themselves.",
                "Weakness: on zoom so less conversation practice, also not many breakout rooms so not many one-on-one discussions with peers inside the classroom\r\n\r\nStrength: a lot of dictation\/listening practice, also thorough grammar teaching",
                "This course provides a lot of work that does help students get better at the language. However, some audio exercises were very difficult to hear and did not match many of the things we were doing in class. Therefore, some assignments felt like a waste of time. But overall, I found the majority of assignments to be useful.",
                "This course is very demanding in terms of work-load and engagement. In order to do well in the class, you have to be at your top game. Therefore one strength of this class is that the level of work you do almost directly correlates to the grade you receive.",
                "considering being on zoom, this class was as engaging as it could have been! sometimes some audio exercises felt a little too long on the same simple grammar exercises, but other than that really enjoyed the readings and course materials",
                "The learning feels very individualized, which is very encouraging when learning a language because I felt supported at every point."

                "I really enjoy French as a language and would recommend the French series to anyone if they want to be proficient very quickly. I think that going into this specific course, however, the student needs to be aware of the effort it will take to stay afloat in the class. I also think that the student needs to take into account what their other goals are for the semester before settling on taking this course because it is genuinely hard, regardless of how well you know French already. There are always new verbs to learn and the method of learning vocabulary words is something that I wasn't accustomed to before taking this course, and something I didn't get used to until half way through the semester.",
                "Yes, to progress with the language requirement this course is good. You feel as through your understanding has advanced and after completing it, listening comprehension and grammar skills have also increased. The downside is we have move past day to day conversations.",
                "I would recommend this class to students who are genuinely interested in French and would like to improve very quickly. Its a lot of work, but its nice if you enjoy learning languages quickly.",
