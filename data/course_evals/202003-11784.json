                "Strengths: very interesting material, professor tried to include fun parts like gifts, the presenters were very cool\r\nWeaknesses: some times material was too complex and hard to grasp if you didn't have a good understanding of it",
                "While definitely an interesting and engaging course, it was overall very disorganized and lacked any consistent day-to-day progression. In addition, the homework reflected little of what was being taught in class. No matter how detailed of notes I took in class or the level of effort I put forth, the grades on the problem sets seemed only tangentially dependent on the content that was being taught in class.",
                "A strength of the course is that the material is intrinsically quite interesting because of its great importance for our future. I think one thing that would improve the course would be to implement more structure in terms of what is being discussed. Specifically grouped and separated topics would be an improvement over the slightly jumbled current format in which I felt that some topics were discussed multiple times at wildly different points in the course (the prime example being electrical energy, which was probably discussed 3-4 *separate* times).",
                "The main strengths of this course were definitely the low workload (we only had three problem sets and one midterm the entire semester, which were \"open google\") and the vast knowledge of Prof. Prober. He knew a lot about everything he lectured about, and since this was a seminar, questions and responses from the class were encouraged and solicited. The main weakness (although this isn't really a weakness if you are good with this topic) is that it was very climate and energy-focused. It felt like AP Environmental Science a lot.",
                "More student-student interaction to increase attentiveness. Classes were all lectures so there was rarely dialogue from students.",
                "The course was a great fit for a small-group seminar. I enjoyed getting to know other students in group projects."

That is difficult to do over Zoom. However, the content presented was done in a good way.",

If you want to pay attention to the lectures, you can learn something about modern technology (and some technology policy here and there). This class had people of all science levels, but it was designed so that you don't need any science knowledge or experience at all going in. This was very reminiscent of high school AP Environmental Science at times.",
