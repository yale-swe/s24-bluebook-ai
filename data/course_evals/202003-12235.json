                "The strengths are guest lecturers and professors. The weakness is the lack of discussion in the class.",
                "The course had a lot of interesting content about children and mental disorders. We often had guest speakers present on different topics, which made learning the content new and interesting every week. However, since it was a lecture, it was not as engaging as it could have been. Breakout rooms could have been used to allow students to converse with each other.",
                "strengths: super interesting material, get to hear a lot of different perspectives from different guest speakers\r\nweaknesses: the course wasn't very structured (which might be a strength for some people, I just prefer structure)",
                "Of course, the core part of this course missing this semester was the practicum component of being able to volunteer with children. I think with that experience, this course would have been greatly enriched. For what it was, it was still pretty engaging, and I really appreciated the diverse range of lecturers that came in.\r\n\r\nI think I would have appreciated a little more feedback on the two earlier papers we turned in, as well as a bit more continuity from week to week in terms of topics and flow of class.",
                "I thought the professors did a good job of keeping the course as engaging as possible given the circumstances, but it definitely felt lacking without the opportunity to volunteer and participate in live, in-person discussions. All the guest lecturers were very knowledgeable though, as were Fred, Eli, and Dennis!",
                "the material is very interesting, but it could use a bit more structure, especially over Zoom. also, in the online format, I feel like it could have used more outside work besides the paper we had to write and some readings, such as additional reading responses or something of the like to make it feel a bit more organized",
                "Fascinating information and guest lecturers were brought in. I really enjoyed going to the lectures! Z",
                "I think having experts come in to teach the topics was really interesting. The class could be better by including more discussions.",
                "i came into the course with high expectations but feel like i didn't get much out of the biweekly lectures. maybe it's because it's an advanced seminar, but it would've been great to have had a quick recap of what each disorder was before a guest speaker lectured on it, or a final lecture that talked about psychopathology as a whole that tied together all the guest lectures we had this semester (i.e. what does the field look like today?) i don't know. \r\n\r\nalso, the final paper felt kind of out of the blue and really overwhelming. the final paper was basically self-work, without much application from what we learned in the course itself.",

                "The style of lecture is different from any other class I've taken before. There are three main professors for the course, but many of the lectures are taught by guest speakers.",
                "It is hard to evaluate the course for this semester because it would usually contain a component where students get positions working with children, and that was not possible this semester. I think that this component would have been a great addition to the class and a good way to apply knowledge.",
                "I think the strength is the professor. I really liked his lectures the most and they kept me attentive.\r\n\r\nThe weakness was the lack of discussion. Going in, I thought that the course was going to be discussion-based and it was just another lecture course. There was not a lot of time to discuss with the professor or with other students about ideas or experiences. It was also a bummer that due to covid, we couldn't do the volunteer portion of the class."
