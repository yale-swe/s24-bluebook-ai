                "Strengths: I like Paris a lot. Great discussion leader, very funny, asks good prodding questions. Readings usually pretty good.\r\nWeaknesses: Could've been helped by a little more grounding in Enlightenment thinking / general histories of some Revolutions (I.e. French) as these would become such recurring conversations that it seemed people had very different levels of experience to. Especially the Enlightenment stuff as the course often becomes as much a debate about the importance of Enlightenment thought / other ideology in the revolutions as it is a history of the Revolutions themselves.",
                "The readings are excellent and the class discussion is very well-structured; I think the class is great as it is.",
                "strengths: easy course structure, only two papers and participation\r\nweaknesses: hard to feel prepared for the seminar. he poses no questions ahead of time about what from the readings we will be discussing. often, he will just pluck paragraphs and ask us to react, but these will be fairly dense political excerpts. The class favors people with a good background knowledge on the subject in this way. There are weeks that we hardly touch the readings, and other weeks where we basically needed to do a line by line analysis to have an real impact on discussion, which can be frustrating."

                "Yes, but be warned that this is a political history course, with an emphasis on the politics. Traditional historical impact analysis is lacking. Much of it is trying to pinpoint the impact of certain \"political thinkers\" of the time on historical events, with little understanding of the actual historical events at play. The professor actively scoffs at looking at historical details at time."
