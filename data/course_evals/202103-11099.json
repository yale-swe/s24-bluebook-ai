                "The assignments were great helping you actually learn and understand systems. I wish they were distributed more throughout the semester and that we has more time to work on them rather than feeling rushed and needing to turn stuff in late. Additionally, lectures covered a lot and were a bit rushed at times.",
                "Strengths: the 2 psets are so real-world applicable which made them incredibly interesting to work on. Professor Yang is phenomenal and his office was always open to drop into whenever we had additional questions. Weaknesses: the workload of this course is extremely frontloaded, so the first have of the course made 323 look easy which was kind of scary",
                "Strengths: interesting content and assignments, wide coverage of topics in networking systems\r\nWeaknesses: slight lack of organization and feedback, limited guidance on psets",
                "Great course",
                "The lectures were too fast and I couldn't understand anything. He didn't pause long enough when he asked if we had any questions.\r\nThe powerpoint slides weren't very easy to understand on your own, so I couldn't just go through after the lecture and learn the material that I didn't catch in lecture.\r\nProf Yang was very helpful and kind in office hours, and was good at explaining things in a 1 on 1 setting.",
                "PSETS were not graded harshly, however the time to get pset feedback was extremely long. This course could be improved by scheduling a time with the TF to run your code, so they don't have to figure out how to run your code.",
                "This course is hard and it moves fast. I think making that abundantly clear at the start, or maybe having an intro class that gives some of the baseline would help students like myself not struggle so much",
                "Workload fluctuated a lot",
                "Strengths: First and foremost, Professor Yang is an excellent instructor. He cares deeply about his students: he is very responsive to students' questions and concerns and goes out of his way to hold office hours. Professor Yang also explains concepts well; the material is very challenging, but he always approaches his explanations with clarity and patience. The course material is also highly relevant: the units on BGP and data centers were particularly helpful in understanding many modern challenges and innovations in computer science. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked more information during add/drop period and the registration period on what skills were necessary for this course. For instance, I think some sort of object-oriented programming background should be a recommended/suggested prerequisite for this course, as the programming assignments are all in Java. Even though this prerequisite need not be enforced, a note that OOP knowledge is required can alert prospective students that they ought to do some preparatory work. The workload for this course was also much greater than expected, and prior knowledge of the workload would have helped me better balance my schedule (e.g. take other classes with lower workloads).",
                "Strengths: there is a large emphasis on understanding how the systems discussed in the class actually work. The projects, although time-consuming, were very educational in this regard. After actually having built a high-performance web server and TCP implementation, I feel very confident in my knowledge of these topics.\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes, the professor went a bit fast in explaining mathematical derivations of various analysis results. In fairness, he did ask us to tell him if there was anything we didn't understand, and I guess that we were just a bit shy in asking questions.",

                "This course is A LOT of work but you learn a lot. At times, it is very frustrating and seems not worth it. At other times it seems very rewarding. It's a great class for learning about networks but make sure you're interested in the topic. But Yang really cares about his students and does a great job walking students through concepts during office hours.",
                "Absolutely, I have never learned so much in a course (even 323). Professor Yang spent a lot of time in industry, so he makes his assignments extremely relevant to real world applications. A side effect of that, though, is that the course is really, really tough, especially in the first half of the course. There are only 2 psets: the first is done in September and the second in October. I spent around 50 hours on the first one and 70 hours on the second one so procrastinating till the last second (or even the last week) is really not an option. So be warned that it is a lot of work, but it is so so rewarding",
                "If you want to learn more about how networks work and have a good systems programming background, definitely take this course because it will be very rewarding",
                "Yes",
                "No, if you don't have any background with networks or java, this course is really really really hard. The psets aren't very clear, and they don't have test cases, so you have no idea if what you are doing is helping or hurting. The lectures were too difficult to understand, and there wasn't a textbook to help explain things more clearly and supplement the course material. The grading was confusing and opaque. One time, he drastically changed the rubric like the day before the pset was due, and I was so frustrated and exhausted that I just gave up.",
                "YES, one thing I've realized about CS at Yale is that meaningful CS classes will be difficult. This is by no means a gut or an easy class, but getting through the two psets and the final project makes you feel accomplished. Professor Yang is also a gem and is so generous with his office hours and he is clearly passionate and extremely knowledge in his field",
                "Highly recommend IF you have the time. This course is HARD but very worth it. You're taking on another 323 here but the opportunity to learn about the underlying web protocols that drive the internet hands-on is one I don't recommend you pass up.",
                "I would only recommend this course to a student who is genuinely interested in networked systems and does not shy away from challenging material and high workload. This was the most challenging academic course I have ever taken, but it was also one of the most interesting. If you want solid foundational knowledge (e.g. HTTP, TCP) of networked systems along with knowledge of the most cutting-edge developments in the field, take this course. You will learn a lot about protocol design and network architecture. However, be prepared to put in a lot of time and intellectual effort. To have a rewarding experience, one must be eager and proactive in their learning.",
                "Very much so (although be warned: there is a heavy workload). You will not only become very well-acquainted with the fundamental technologies of the Internet (and other networks), but you'll become a better programmer, too. Professor Yang is extremely helpful with feedback and generous with his time. In sum: one of the most rewarding CS courses I've taken at Yale."
