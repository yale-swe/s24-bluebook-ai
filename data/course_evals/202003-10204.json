In my own writing, I learned how to put my ideas in conversation with related previous academic works by agreeing with what they said and building upon it or disagreeing and explaining why.",
                "This class helped me build confidence in my writing ability and added writing skills and approaches to my arsenal such as using a variety of punctuation and effectively using counterarguments. Since this class focused on childhood and the ways that it's been constructed we also had many insightful discussions about toys, commercials, race, anti-adultism, and children's autonomy. As part of our final assignments we put into practice our research and analysis skills we had built throughout the semester."

                "I really liked how all of the material matched the topic so well, and felt coherent. The material is very relatable because we have all been children before. I wish the course emphasized grammar more. I feel my grammar needed work, and we learned shortly about grammar, but I don't know how much of it I retained",
                "I believe Eng 114 is a very well designed course.  In taking this class, I was able to learn about a topic of great interest to me while learning how to write college-level essays.",
                "strengths:\r\n-the weekly blog posts make for unique, interesting conversations\r\n-the essays are fun to right! they're open ended in a way that you can literally write about whatever you want which makes assignments a lot more interesting\r\n-it's fun! the class is structured in a way that nothing really feels like work; the assignments are essentially just the essays which feel like researching and writing simply because you're interested in the topic\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n-none?",
                "The course is divided into to different sections each with a corresponding assignment to cap off the unit. I think this progression worked very well and each unit built upon your previous understanding. I know that for my class Professor Klemann included a section about differing dialects in language where we questioned the standard conventions or English. I appreciated that mini-unit a lot and think that it should be integrated into the class permanently."

English 114 is a spectacular introduction to college-level writing and the seminar format creates an intimate format that allows for good conversation and one on one help when necessary.  Additionally, Professor Klemann is a passionate, caring teacher who will do her all to help you improve your writing and your understanding of different concepts.",

                "I could not possibly recommend this course more highly to another student. The conversations this class facilitated between my peers and I made me think of childhood as a whole as well as my personal childhood in a way I never had before. The professor was the most understanding I've ever had and really helped me develop as a writer. It was intellectually stimulating and a refreshing break from some of my other more dull classes.",
                "Yes, I definitely would recommend this course to another student. I think about this class all the time now as I consume various from of media involving child development. I especially recommend this class earlier than later considering the writing component. It helps them feel more prepared for writing essays in the rest of their college career."
