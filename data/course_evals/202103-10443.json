                "I learned how data affects EVERY part of modern life and the rules surrounding it are not sufficient enough to protect individuals or groups from a wide array of harms. This course gave me a broad understanding of modern conceptions of data privacy, the history of the right to privacy, and regulations such as GDPR and Section 230. The course also taught me how to evaluate and approach new technologies, how they can positively and negatively affect individuals, while also giving me a broad insight into tech policy, human subjects research, and introduced concepts such as the data life cycle, theories of harm, and proposed solutions to the lackluster data governance policies in place today.",
                "I learned the ways by which actors have historically combined highly theoretical normative frameworks with practical policy implementation and the political moments necessary to do so. I  gained a strong understanding of how technology has progressed over time and how policy has responded to it.",
                "Learned about this history of data ethics, starting with medical ethics until present day ethical dilemmas. We learned how to analyze problems through a critical lens, creating theories of harm. Talked about different ways to solve data related problems.",
                "This class helps you reframe the world around you. You will never look at technology or the political process the same way again.",
                "Broad understanding of origins of data governance ethics, laws, policy etc., how our approach to these entities is changing in the context of the present-day (with social media, smartphones, changing nature of conflict, etc.) and what it means for the future.",
                "I learned all about what data governance is, how it matters in each of our lives, how communities are being discriminated with data, and how to go about solving these problems. I also learned how to structure a description of a problem/solution (which is very useful!)",
                "I learned about the history of privacy, the definition of data, how to evaluate data privacy, and how to interpret data privacy standards in a variety of contexts. I also became a stronger writer and better researcher.",
                "So much insight into privacy law, the framework of data, harms of technology, and how to think about systems of governance for these issues!",
                "This course was really great - we covered data governance from the late 1800s to modern day. It was a great mix of history, issues, and modern applications. We learned a lot about current problems in data governance and ways that they might be solved.",
                "I learned about data governance systems, the data life cycle, theories of harm, and different solutions. The history of our right to privacy and contrast between US and European systems was insightful. From a macro-level, this course led me to think more about how our data is being used by individual devices, large corporations, and governments.",
                "I learned about the major data privacy issues and legislations in the US, EU and across the world.",
                "This course left me with a new lens through which to engage with privacy issues and the role of personal data in the online age.",
                "I gained highly valuable and timely knowledge on the history of data governance, from the origins of the right to privacy and to the difference in the current governing regimes of the US and Europe during the first half of the semester, and the current gaps and loopholes that threat actors are able to take advantage of when it comes to data. The second half was focused on allowing us to use this previous knowledge and to apply it to the most pressing data governance issues of today, ending with a deep dive that gave us the opportunity to figure out how to solve a problem of our choosing.",
                "laws, rules and cultures in data governance especially in the US and Europe.",
                "I gained an understanding of how we got here where corporations have so much control and insight into our lives. This is not just a data class but a class more on the technological age. You will learn to apply ethical frameworks, analyze terms and conditions, and gain historical and legal knowledge. Finally, you will \"solve\" a problem you lay out.",
                "You learn to think critically about how one collects, processes, analyzes, and stores data across disciplines; how and why technologies are harmful in instances of regulatory or human rights issues; the historical development of privacy (laws and concept), the differences in regulation between USA and Europe; etc. \r\nThis class genuinely changes your life and you will never look at data / technology the same way again (which is a good thing).",
                "I really loved the class - it taught me a ton that I did not know about the world of data governance. Professor Raymond is a great lecturer.",
                "I learned the proper frameworks and tools to be able to analyze data governance-related issues in modern society.",
                "Knowledge: I learned about the data cycle, the history behind data privacy laws and data governance (and the precedence/lack of precedence on these issues), and what data governance looks like right now vs. what it should look like in the future. In the beginning there was a good amount of studying historical precedents and different documents that shaped data governance of the modern age, and then moved into different ways to approach governing data.",
                "Understanding of data lifecycle, how data can be used to abuse, coerce, how date is power, how govts use data, US data regulations vs other countries. How to understand the world through the lens of data.",

                "Learned a lot about topics I had no previous knowledge on. Developed ethical frameworks on issues of data governance and basic concepts of tech/data."

                "Amazing lectures and assignments were so interesting to do. Main weakness was section. The class meets three times a week and the sections are just repeating the material covered in lecture and were mandatory. It seemed like a waste of time and everyone wished it would be discussion based. Only time it was useful were the times we discussed out final projects.",
                "Natty and the TAs are a great strength of this course. Natty is truly such a unique and interesting professor. Every lecture, I learned something new that completely changed the way I perceived the role of data in our world today. He is so generous at hosting office hours and answering important and unique questions you might have. I don't think there are any weaknesses in the course. I felt supported at all points throughout my Data Gov journey!",
                "Natty is an incredible professor who seriously is interested in anyone who asks for his attention (re: go to office hours). The TAs are also incredible.",
                "Strengths - INCREDIBLY interesting and engaging. Material feels accessible and relevant. \r\nWeaknesses - Natty doesn't have lecture slides (which is great), but sometimes it's hard to follow his train of thought - so you need to pay attention.",
                "Strengths: Raymond is a fantastic professor who gives students the attention they deserve. His lived experiences and course content make for some fascinating lectures. \r\nWeaknesses: Raymond is at times a little unorganized, but once you adapt to his teaching style you will come to love the class. The class also meets frequently, and can be time consuming.",
                "I am a data science major and took the course because I want to be able to understand what data-related harms exist, how I can handle data ethically, and how I can hold data handlers accountable. Overall, I found the course fascinating and actionableI especially enjoyed learning about the origins of concepts of agency, privacy, and current data governance policy. Sometimes, the class became a bit ideological and hand-wavy, but I found it valuable as a whole! I think all data science majors should take a data ethics course like this one.",
                "Strengths: Natty (the professor) is incredibly passionate and knowledgable about this topic. He also has a crazy wide breadth of experience (google Nathanial Raymond). He is also very aware of his coolness but thats true of many Yale professors. He is very kind and really wants you to succeed. If you go to office hours, he will really take the time to help you in all things (like career advice etc)\r\nWeaknesses: Natty did not have this years syllabus up until mid-October. There were times it could be a bit disorganized, but besides the syllabus, that was totally fine. Also, it is a FOUR DAY A WEEK CLASS (if you include section). That is too much!! I realize we needed the time to get stuff done, but it sucked to have friday morning class.",
                "Natty is absolutely the reason why this course is amazing, and the content/curriculum is also very interesting. I feel like this is a course that truly represents Yale's mission for academic diversity through the combination of different fields of study. No weaknesses!",
                "Such a fantastic course! Natty is an amazing lecturer and the readings complemented overall fascinating content! There is relatively low work, but just about everyone in the course was incredibly engaged in the class. The course could be improved by a bit more structure (like a formal syllabus) , but emails sent out every week that listed out readings and topics gave us a good idea of what to expect.",
                "A strength would be the readings - while they were sometimes long, they were always very relevant and interesting. The course meets very often, which some people disliked but I thought it worked well to break up the material into manageable amounts.",
                "Strength - Natty brings a great presence to each class with his stories and personal experience. The organization of the first half of the semester provided a very logical introduction to the background of data governance. \r\n\r\nWeakness - The second half of the course felt more disorganized and subjective than the first half of the course. I think it could be improved by covering more current issues surrounding data systems and regulation in America.",
                "Strengths: Natty's lecturing was always very engaging, the TAs were terrific at helping us unpack difficult topics, the way the course was structured with the first half of the semester focused on the history of data governance regimes and the second half on learning how to use those tools to address data issues of today allowed us to apply what we learned to solve a pressing issue. Weaknesses: sometimes the course was disorganized because we didn't have a syllabus for the majority of the semester, but it didn't affect my learning that much",
                "The professor is the biggest strength of the course - his passion and experience make the course material feel important and inspirational, and he cares so much about students and their success. The TFs were also incredible. IMO one weakness of the course is that that the first half felt very clearly defined (as it followed a timeline building up the foundation and history of modern data governance) whereas the second half felt a bit more like a survey of modern data gov issues and felt less engaging/clear-cut in the direction.",
                "The course was deeply interesting but felt somewhat disorganized, especially after the midterm.",
                "The course has provided me with a new perspective on the role data can play in being the mechanism of harm against unprotected populations - I have a completely new perspective on how the government should address this, and what the role of big tech should be, and how I, as a consumer and user, can be more conscious in my use of technology. Every week and lecture felt immensely impactful and the assignments aided directly in our deeper understanding of the content.",
                "Strength: the development veining of data governance is clear;\r\nWeakness: it will be better if developing each data governance issue critically.",
                "The class provides you with analytic tools and knowledge and allows you the latitude to investigate what you're interested in. The workload is light although we were somewhat unprepared for how difficult the final paper would be. Class however was fascinating as was section (though unfortunately neither could be recorded/the recordings be shared).",
                "Strengths:\r\nNatty is by far the best lecturer I've had at Yale, ever. From day one, even if you didn't come into the class caring much, you care and are involved. This is one of those rare classes where you're excited to do the readings before lecture. Super practical knowledge, as Natty himself is a practitioner (and has a truly unbelievable amount of experience in pretty much everything) and not the dry theoretical stuff you might expect from a Yale course.\r\nThis might be a hot take but I liked that the readings were announced quite shortly before class - you didn't get a chance to do them a week ahead and then forget all about it by the time class happened. I see how this could be frustrating to others, though. \r\n\r\nIncredible lectures, incredible and very relevant case studies (from what I understand, the syllabus changes from year to year to accommodate for real-life examples and developments). We were involved and familiar with current events. \r\n\r\nFor the CS majors out there: this is the best class at Yale you can take. Seriously. Do yourself (and the rest of us) a favor by taking it. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSometimes grading between the three TA's was noticeably different. Also, could've benefitted more from releasing essay prompts and guidelines a bit earlier.",
                "This class was phenomenal in terms of material taught, assignments, expectations, and engagement. I think that it could benefit from organization (readings posted earlier).",
                "Instructor was the course's greatest strength. He is so knowledgable and passionate about the material and his students. I only wish that the lectures were a little more organized.",
                "Strength: Professor Raymond and TA Annie Crabhill were definitely the strengths. Prof. Raymond is a great lecturer and Annie was a very engaging section TA who was very considerate/thoughtful to her students. Both were passionate and knowledgeable about the topic, yet they were quick to admit things that they did not yet know about data governance (since its such an evolving field and there are literally no answers sometimes).",
                "Strengths: Excellent professor, TAs, and course content\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Received syllabus a little late in the semester",
                "First half of course was structured to help students learned the basics of data governance and ethical frameworks and second half looked at the issues and remedies  it was structured perfectly to make sure students really understand the concepts before you look at problems. Section was also very useful."

It certainly has made me a more conscious consumer of technologies and made me wary of tech that promises to revolutionize the world. The opportunity to write your final paper on a topic of your choosing is a wonderful experience. Everything I have learned in this class is something I am glad to be taking away for the future.",
                "Yes. Basic digital literacy will serve you well whatever you end up doing, and Natty makes sure that you learn it in an interesting manner.",
                "EVERYONE should take this course. Data and tech are present in everyone's lives, and this course teaches people how to think critically about technology and the ways we share our own data.",
                "This is the best class I have taken at Yale. Raymond is a fantastic teacher who is genuinely passionate about the content and helping students learn. The content is incredibly relevant and engaging, if not a little slow in the beginning. However, once things get going, you will look forward to lectures throughout the week, as the subjects discussed are so captivating.",
                "Yes, I think all data science majors should take a data ethics course like this one.",
                "I would definitely recommend the class. I learned a ton, and it was all very interesting to me. This is the sort of big issue that is going to shape our world over the next century, so I would recommend taking a class like this so you can get a grasp of it. We always hear about \"Big Data\" and \"AI\" and such, but now I actually know a bit more what that literally means and how it can hurt you. \r\n\r\nAlso FYI, he does not use slides if thats a problem for you.",
                "Absolutely! This course is the best one that I have taken so far at Yale. The professor is a gem, the content is unique, and the assignments are meaningful.",
                "Absolutely! Amazing class, low workload, and such an important topic. Especially for those working in technology and science.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student regardless of major. The topic is very relevant to everybody in the modern world today.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. I think it's super interesting for people interested in the tech or policy side but also just good to know for everyone in our digital age.",
                "Yes! This was my first foray into a global affairs class and I learned so much about data governance, which is something everyone should be thinking about. The class will arm you to be a smarter citizen in a world where corporations are becoming more powerful.",
                "Yes, this is one of the courses that you should not miss if you want to work with anything related to data after Yale (also a great class to Cr/D/F following that train of logic). With the rise of social media and big tech, a lot of perspectives on global governance is warped towards how tech is going to safe us all. Natty forces us to pump the brakes on this and take a hard look at how data, seemingly benign, can lead to downstream consequences. By bringing in a humanitarian perspectives, this class gives us a human perspective on data and tech that is quintessential of why Yalies are special. Even though I may not have been fully convinced that tech is the demon that will kill us all, I will be walking away from Yale considering harm pathways, data life cycles, and how data can be used to exploit, exclude, and target vulnerable populations.",
                "Yes, this course is a must take for anyone with smartphones, on social media, working in tech, etc.",
                "Yes. Professor Raymond is an engaging and fun lecturer and the subject matter is deeply relevant to the current era.",
                "Absolutely - this is by far the best class I have taken at Yale. The stories and topic discussed in class don't just stop at the door when you leave, they are in the news, in the conversations you have with other students, and are being decided by history in this moment. This class gives you the skills and confidence to know when we leave Yale, you will be able to make informed decisions about ensuring the ethical use and future development of data and tech.",
                "If you hope to know about the pratical affairs of data governance, I would recommand it;\r\nIf you plan to do academic research, I would suggest you to take other course in other departments.",
                "I would recommend this class for anyone  CS, Global Affairs, or of any other major. As Natty stated, it was \"the most important course you'll take at Yale.\" It enables you to understand the ethics and business behind the current digital world and moreover, where things are headed. The workload is very light (a midterm and two two-page papers) until the final paper which was 10-15 pages... Keep that in mind.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially as a computer science student. In the CS major/department, I feel that the implications of new technology are rarely discussed. Yet, efficiency in new technology cannot be the only goal. Future roles in the computer science field must evaluate how the tech impacts different populations. Through a variety of past and modern examples of data governance problems spanning the Nuremberg Trials to the big tech industry, this class shows how data permeates every day life and how severe the effects may be if used maliciously.",
                "Yes. I've been raving about this class the entire semester and don't regret a moment of it. See for yourself. \r\n\r\nI would honestly be willing to give up my Yale degree if it meant this class, as taught by prof. Raymond, became a requirement for the CS / S&DS / any STEM major(s). Or even the entire college. The tech-oriented departments really REALLY need to take a page out of his DataGov book. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the semester, Natty summarized the class as something like \"my goal for the first half of the semester is to make you incredibly depressed about the state of datagov in the world right now, and for the second half, to show you why you should still be hopeful, as you can solve these issues we'll learn about\" and it's exactly what this class is. \r\n\r\nAlso the class is just overall cool -- get ready to talk about pre-19th century privacy, Facebook, human rights, Grindr et al., global regulation of data practices, etc. All your concerns about how you interact with the Internet and society at large right now will be addressed, and then some.",
                "Yes! Everyone should take this class - global, CS, S&DS. It is timely and gives you a lot of flexibility to look at what you are interested in. Its also a very interactive and pretty small lecture which was great.",

Data governance also dictates how so many world events unfold, and the impact of those events are far beyond our imagination.",
