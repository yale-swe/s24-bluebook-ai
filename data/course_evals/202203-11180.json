                "I think there was a huge amount of work relative to the amount my Chinese improved. While my vocabulary has expanded, I don't feel like I can construct sentences any more easily than I could before the class. Needs more emphasis on speaking, not reading, and an environment that encourages speaking without preparing. In class everyone worked hard to not make any mistakes when speaking, and they did that by reading the board or preparing for when they would be called on. This does not help one's ability to speak Chinese fluently.",
                "I did not like how procedural everything was. Feedback was never very detailed or constructive.",
                "The biggest weakness is by far that we aren't forced to use the grammar structures we are learning. A lot of the work feels like busy work.",
                "The main strengths of this course were the interesting topics we read about, discussed, and learned useful vocabulary for. The main weaknesses of this course were several types of assignments that were a lot of work but didn't help us learn much. In the intermediate level of Chinese, I believe recording the essays read for class might still be useful for practicing pronunciation and fluency, but at this advanced level, I don't think making recordings was very helpful. People didn't make very much progress, and it took a lot of time to get a good recording that could have been better spent practicing spontaneous speaking. Similarly, our grammar practice exercises didn't always help us understand the nuances of Chinese grammar, and whenever we did these exercises in class, people didn't understand what the sentences were about and that interfered with their ability to choose the correct answer and know why it was correct. These felt like a poor use of class time. I loved the documentary on voting that we watched, and I wish we could have watched more materials like that for class. I also liked our more general in-class discussions on the topics we read about, and I think more time could be devoted to those. The part of the course that most needs improvement is character writing. There is definitely value in knowing how to hand-write certain Chinese characters -- but we had to learn a large number of them for each quiz. It took a lot of time to memorize characters for the quiz, and preparing for the quiz was very stressful, and then after the quiz I would forget them again. I think the number of quizzes should stay the same, but the number of characters that must be memorized each quiz should be decreased by a large amount. In general, I think this course could benefit from more opportunities to practice speaking on interesting topics. I would recommend increasing the amount of online speaking practice (e.g. instead of having one speaking assignment with a choice of 2 videos to watch and respond to, assigning both videos but in 2 separate, spaced out assignments); increasing in-class discussion; reducing the recording assignments (perhaps by requiring a recording only of one important paragraph); reducing the character quizzes (perhaps by halving the number of phrases to memorize); and use the time spent in class on grammar more effectively, for example using the board to write down the correct structure of a sentence or explain the difference in grammar structures when someone gets a grammar question wrong.",
