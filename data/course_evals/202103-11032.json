I also gained exposure to various common phrases that I'm now able to incorporate into my writing and speaking.",

                "If you can take this class with Madame Burton, do it. Change your section. Change your major. I don't care what or how. Take this class with Madame Burton. She was absolutely incredible. As a native English speaker who was once in our shoes, she acutely knew what was difficult and focused on it. Additionally, she made class fun and engaging while still being sure to cover all of the concepts we learned (she jokingly called herself \"Madame Feuille\" for all the handouts she gave, but they were useful). Also, despite the fast pace and workload of the syllabus, she was very reasonable when assigning other book\/film specific tasks (comprehension questions, etc.). From what I gather, our section had significantly less work than most other sessions, yet I think I can confidently say that none of us felt underprepared for any of the exams--which were fair and doable based on the class content itself. My biggest gripe with the class is that Jules et Jim probably took up too much time in comparison to some of the other works, and it would have been nice to have some of its time to lighten the load throughout the rest of the semester. Additionally, it was a significant amount of work--it was a safe bet to assume anywhere from 45-90min of nightly homework outside of class time.",
                "The student gets a lot out of the course due to the time commitment and depth of the class, but the amount of busy work each night for homework is excessive and not helpful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Burton is absolutely phenomenal. As a student, I could truly feel her passion not only for the language but teaching as well, both of which made the course especially engaging. Because she learned French herself later in life, she is particularly well-attuned to helping students learn the language as she knows the common grammar, spelling, and pronunciation mistakes to highlight. Moreover, the actual course syllabus facilitated large improvements in understanding grammar and vocabulary.\r\nWeakness: Absolutely nothing substantial. A small thing is that there was one unit on a film that felt a bit long and could've been shortened so that we could either look at a different film or text or further explore different grammar topics.",
                "The strengths of this course come with meeting every day during the week. Your speaking, writing, and listening skills will greatly improve due to daily exposure to French! At times the workload of the course can become stressful, especially when you have assignments and exams for other classes, but if you put in the work, you will be able to get through the course. If anything, it might have been nice to go over the bi-weekly evaluations in a thorough manner."

                "Definitely! In addition to being with Mme Burton, I had a smaller section, so there was lots of space for each of us to get significant practice with the language. It's a good amount of work and relatively easy to fall behind, but if you can stay on top of it all then you will gain a lot from this class. If you're reading this review, chances are you've either placed into L3 or taken FREN 120. I feel confident in saying that taking this class is better than starting a whole new language from scratch--a vaut la peine if you will.",
                "I would recommend this course if the student is very passionate about learning french and has time on their hands. If not, I would try another language.",
                "100%, yes. Any student who wants to improve their French should take this class. You will not only learn a significant amount about French and see true improvements by the end of the course (particularly with written work), but the class itself remains engaging the entire semester. Professor Burton plays a huge role in the success of this class, and I cannot recommend enough to take a course with her.",
                "I would only recommend this course to students who are serious about learning French or if it is the last required course of the language requirement sequence. You will have to truly commit to this class if you want to do well."
