The class developed journalism skills such as interviewing, journalistic writing, and podcasting, while also taking a deep intellectual dive into several of the biggest controversies in U.S. public education today. Each week, we discussed a new topic, including debates like public vs. private schools, parents' rights vs state rights, the idea of meritocracy vs. the common good and the battle within education between church and state.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of public education and major recurrent political clashes, as well as the basics of making a podcast.",
                "This course offered a solid introduction to the politics of public education in America, which I believe is essential to understanding politics at large in our country today. Each week, we focused on a different debate (eg: church vs. state, parents vs. state) in the world of education, and we traced how the debates in education today can be traced back to the founding of the common school movement in America. This class also had a media element in the form of podcasting. Each week, we practiced a journalistic skill as we built towards the final podcast project.",

                "Throughout this course, I was able to explore different aspects of the public educational landscape in America. I also developed a new style of writing (and podcasting!) that was very rewarding."

            "comments": [
                "Each week, we had a journalism skills assignment due before the class session. These assignments were a strength of the course  they were very practical and well thought out, and helped us practice journalism skills that would actually be useful for anyone interested in going into journalism. Additionally, Prof. Berkshire's feedback for all of these assignments were thoughtful and useful. The selection of readings was also a strength  particularly, the balance in political leanings of the readings. We read or listened to close to equal amounts of literature from both sides of the aisle, more so (I think) than in any other class I've taken. This helped prevent class discussions from being one-sided echo chambers; instead, discussions were very engaging and legitimately considered both conservative and liberal points of view. Prof. Berkshire also created an enjoyable and lively class environment; as the semester went on, sessions became more and more relaxed and engaging, with students willing and eager to share their thoughts. The only thing was the amount of reading was large, especially considering that we had the journalism skills assignment each week too. Cutting down on the amount of reading might have made it easier to give the readings I did do a closer look.",
                "This class was honestly amazing- very interesting readings, lovely discussions with awesome people, and the guest speakers were fascinating.",
                "Despite this being the course's first time being taught, I thought Professor Berkshire succeeded in constructing a well-balanced syllabus with a variety of perspectives. We read authors and listened to podcasts from individuals across the political spectrum. The 2 hour seminar also seemed to go by quickly because Professor Berkshire did a good job breaking the seminar into different sections. Professor Berkshire also maintained good energy in the room. She has good sense of humor, and she always provided very helpful, positive, and constructive feedback. She is also very well-connected in the world of education, so she brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to the classroom. She also brought in many guests from across the political spectrum throughout the semester. I enjoyed getting exposed to a wide variety of individualsall of whom have the best intentions of our education system in mind, but who come to different conclusions on how to get there.\r\n\r\nSome weeks, I found the homework assignments to be rather tedious. I think some of them could be combined into larger assignments. I struggled to motivate myself to invest my best effort when we had an assignment every week.",
                "I think the assignments got a bit repetitive as we led up to the final project \r\ni also think there were certain students who took over a majority of the conversation in class\r\nweakness- i think some of the readings were too long / the weekly readings were a bit overwhelming especially when they included a whole book or multiple chapters along with a bunch of other readings\r\nbut i really liked listening to the podcasts and making the podcasts and writing articles!",
                "The seminar format works wonders for this course. It was so special to be able to connect with my classmates, especially since so much of the course involved sharing our own experiences. I also appreciated the different activities each class took (journalism workshop, podcast, discussion) because it kept the time moving and kept me engaged. This is really great since the period is so long! Although, I would have liked more discussion time for some of the weeks. The visitors were super cool, and I loved the opportunity to hear different perspectives. Additionally, the weekly topics were successful. We were able to get through a lot of material but still connect it all in a meaningful way! In terms of improvements, I think its mostly just smoothening out the logistics, but I believe that will come with time since this is a new course."

                "100%, I would suggest another student take this course. If you're interested in journalism, interested in public education, and definitely if you're interested in both of those things, then take this class. Be ready for a pretty significant, but not insane, workload, and make sure you're really interested in the topics, because if you're not I could see how class sessions and the assignments could quickly become tiresome. But, if you have an interest in the course material, like I did, I think this class will be very enjoyable and something you look forward to each week. The 3:30-5:20 time slot wasn't ideal so hopefully that changes, but even if it is offered at the time again, it's certainly worth it.",
                "100%- this class was honestly amazing- very interesting readings, lovely discussions with awesome people, and the guest speakers were fascinating. If you also want to build your journalistic skills, especially podcast skills, this class is great for you.",
                "Overall, I would recommend this course. It's a low stress, relaxed environment to learn about a field that underlies many of the political debates playing out today. Education rose to the forefront during the most recent midterm cycle, and I felt well-equipped to understand the perspectives on both sides of the aisle. This class certainly wasn't a transformational seminar, but it facilitated a fun, collaborative learning environment.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! Professor Berkshire provides very helpful feedback, is a very engaging professor, and really knows what she's talking about. This class is a great way to get into both podcasting/journalism and the politics of education. Great readings and very relevant homework assignments. We also had a couple of guest speakers, and they were great to talk to!",
                "yes! some great conversations were had and its an overall engaging and fun class",
                "Absolutely!! Take this course if you have the opportunity to!! This is a great environment to have genuine conversations with classmates that are genuinely interested. The assignments are really fun and rewarding, and the feedback we get throughout them leads to a lot of growth. Plus Prof. Berkshire is amazing!!"
