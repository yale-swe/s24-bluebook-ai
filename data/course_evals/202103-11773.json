While creative writing is a very personal project and creativity cannot be taught, the techniques and skills of creating compelling characters, interesting dialogue, believable plots, and conflict with stakes are all tools that can enable you to write better. I have a much better grasp on what makes a good story/poem/drama than before.",
                "I gained experience in a wide range of creative writing techniques, some of which I had limited practice in from high school and others which I had none. I learned how to think like a creative writer, as well as revise like one.",

                "The course uses great readings and exercises to guide the learning process. I think more in-class exercises would be helpful and maybe fewwer readings in the first unit as we read a lot which we never got to discuss and didn't seem very helpful. The class environment was very welcoming and helpful.",
                "Strengths: welcoming and low-stakes environment to try creative writing since people come from all types of academic backgrounds and varying levels of writing experience, workshops push you outside of your comfort zone and you gain a lot from the feedback and experience, readings are enjoyable since you're reading fiction, you get to hear from prominent writers throughout the semester. Weaknesses: we spent one half of the semester on short stories which didn't leave a lot of time for poetry and drama. Though the skills we learned in the short story unit were fundamentals that could be applied to the other units, I thought that if we had spent equal amount of time across all three units, I would have been able to delve deeper into modes of writing that I believe the majority of students are less familiar with.",
                "strengths: incredible professor - Professor Spargo is an extremely kind, supportive, committed, and inspiring professor. He encouraged fruitful discussion, gave extremely thorough comments, and was just generally an incredibly inspiring person. \r\nI also really loved the guest speaker sessions, the readings were all very helpful, I got specific, concrete ideas to hone in on my writing, learned how to write in new genres - really wonderful!!",

                "Definitely if you can snag a seat! It's a super fun class. Doesn't matter if you want to be a writer or whether you have any experience, this class will groom your creative side and help you discover skillsets that you might not know you have. Beware that this class does not give you a writing credit, which I thought it did given the name. Still, I think this is a great introductory class that helps you build up your portfolio if you want to apply to intermediate level creative writing classes in the future, which this class has inspired me to do.",
                "Probablyits fun and the work is interesting, and its accessible to everyone.",
                "Yes! I would! Be prepared to really dive into your writing. The revision of the portfolio is also quite extensive at the end of the course so I would recommend thinking about revisions throughout the semester.",
                "Definitely. Very fascinating and fun.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in creative writing. If you don't have prior experience, I'd recommend attempting a little writing on your own before you start the course - the prof doesn't assume that people have any background, but it's tremendously helpful to have some idea of your own writing style and process when you're doing the readings."
