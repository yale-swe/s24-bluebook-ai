However, make sure that you are set up for success with an advisor who will pay attention to the relatively lax, nebulous, and fluid HUMS senior essay guidelines and help you be successful within them. Also make sure to have a clarifying conversation about what a senior essay is and is not so that you don't have unnecessary stress by striving toward something that is not even expected of you.",

Use the free time it gives you to execute the project that you have always wanted to do, not something that you could get in the way of classes."
