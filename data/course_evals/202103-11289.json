                "I learned a lot about the foundations of Judaism and how the development of Jewish texts, traditions, and culture was influenced by Jews coexisting with Christians and Muslims. I gained some really cool insights into historiography due to how the course addressed certain 19th century perspectives with regard to the medieval history we were learning.",
                "I think this course gives a really interesting insight into this time of Jewish history. You get all the hits but Prof. Marcus will also go deep into very particular parts of the history and culture that are really interesting",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Marcus was very knowledgable about the course material and was an entertaining lecturer.\r\nWeaknesses: He doesn't use slides so it was very difficult for me personally to follow along with his lectures\/really absorb the material. I ended up Cr\/D this course as a result because his lecture style wasn't compatible for me.",
                "This course would be greatly improved by interactivity of literally any kind. Sitting and being talked at for 75min twice a week was not very conducive to my learning, and while I cannot profess that I want another discussion section on my schedule but even that would probably be an improvement for LITERALLY sitting and being TALKED AT for 75min with no visual aids of any kind, no discussion, no group work, no nothing. This is an OK class for people who are strongly audial learners but anyone else will probably suffer this class like I did. I use 'literally' so many times to emphasize to you how much this is not an exaggeration but actually just the experience of this course.",
                "Strengths: Lecture style. Professor Marcus sits and talks for 75 minutes straight, no PowerPoint or anything. Love this. Exams are fair and reflect material well, paper is challenging but fun to write. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture style. You might not like his lecture style (see strengths). I also did not like the readings from the Bible during the beginning of class, less because they were about the Bible and more so because ancient history bores me, though.",
                "Professor makes himself available to students, you really just have to go up and talk to him (either in person or email, whatever just do it). \r\n\r\nThis course probably could've used a section just given the sheer amount of things the prof rattled off in class. It's a lot of history to go through in such a short amount of time... and because of the amount of material, it seemed like the prof didn't even stop to breathe at times in class. There were also many tangents that I wasn't sure what was or wasn't relevant to the class\/tests. I think if the readings had just been the primary sources and then we came to class and he strung them together we would've gotten much the same experience.",
                "There are no weaknesses. The biggest strength of this course was the lectures and the final paper.",
                "Hard to improve this course. You learn a bunch, the workload is really nice, and Dr. Marcus is such a good person to know.",
                "Needed more slides, lecturer was a good orator",
                "Strengths: Prof. Marcus is a wonderful and engaging lecturer and I thoroughly enjoyed all of his lectures. Great readings, especially loved the Bible readings. Wish there couldve been more engagement with the Professor (maybe discussion section)",
                "The strengths of the course were how interesting the material was, looking at really cool primary sources, good and fair assessments, and lecturing that was really informative and also engaging and funny. \r\nI wish there had been a little bit more structure to some of the lecturing (powerpoints would've been helpful even if they were just a few slides long) and more opportunities to ask questions during lecture (although we were impacted by religious holidays in terms of time in lecture).",
                "Prof. Marcus is a strength. He's fun and interesting and crazy smart. Also I think the workload is a good amount for sure. A weakness is probably that the lectures are pretty much just Prof. Marcus sitting down and going and so if you miss things, it can be hard to catch back up. Perhaps more interaction with the class throughout could be helpful to make sure everyone's following.",
                "Professor Marcus is nice and funny, and clearly very knowledgeable on the subject",
                "This course has a pretty low workload and teaches a lot of good material. However, the one key thing I did not like was that every class was simply lecturing and without any visuals. The professor just talks about the history and does not provide any supporting visuals, slides, etc making it much more difficult to concentrate and stay engaged.",
                "The strength is that the course has great structure and the assessments are straightforward.",
                "A strength of the course comes from the fact that it was obviously taught many times before and as such has been refined to cover important topics in depth. Another strength is the structure of the assignments which I think were well suited to success in the course. The major weakness of the course centered around very low engagement between the professor and the students. Even though this course was taught in person - there was virtually no interaction with the professor which is a shame because I think the course would have been significantly better in a seminar format.",
                "I enjoy the its firsthand nature",
                "This class is very simple and straightforward. Lectures every class, two exams, and a paper. Sometimes the lectures could feel long, but that was because not everyone would ask questions.",
                "Having a map projected onto some screen during lectures would help visualize where events are happening in relation to each other.",
                "The material is fascinating, Marcus is a great lecturer, but it could use a little more structure.",
                "ez",
                "Great and informative lectures. It was hard to put the information together from my notes sometimes, though, and the weekly outlines were confusing rather than an aid to learning-- they read more like notes for someone giving a speech (i.e. somebody who already knew what was meant).",
                "This class was a lecture with readings, and it was clearly structured and the expectations of the course managed well. If you did the work, you could expect to do well on assignments, there was nothing meant to trick you."

                "Only if they are okay with a slightly more scattered lecture style and are able to really focus in lecture to gather as much detail as possible.

                "Ivan Marcus sits at his desk and talks for 75min straight with no powerpoint or discussion or anything of the kind. If you enjoy a straight lecture course, this will be fine and not particularly challenging for you if also not especially exciting.",

                "Yes. I took this class to learn about Judaism and (separately) how anti-Semitism exists in Christianity when Christianity came from Judaism, and I got my questions answered and more.",
                "Absolutely! Every class was fascinating and the requirements are very reasonable.",
                "Yes absolutely. Dr. Marcus is an incredible lecturer and you won't ever be bored in one of his classes. The workload is low, the paper is fun to write, and as long as you show up to class and take notes, the exams will be a breeze. You definitely do need to show up to class, I'm not sure how the people who don't show up manage to take any of the quizzes since the readings are more background than actual material.",

                "I would recommend this course if someone is looking for an interesting intro class to Jewish history without too much work. Very easy for someone trying to get into the subject for the first time",
                "Yes if you want an overview of ancient Jewish History.",
                "Absolutely, great overview of history and well organized",
                "If you are looking for a low workload humanities or history class then I think it is a pretty good option. If you want to gain a general overview of Jewish history and thought throughout this given time period it gives a decent overview from a secular point of view. If you are looking for a highly engaging, interactive course then this is not the one.",
                "Unfortunately, in its current form, I dont believe I would recommend this course to another student unless that student already had a strong interest in the subject matter before taking the class. Its a real shame because I think Professor Marcus is brilliant, kind, and incredibly knowledgeable. However, I think the course really suffers from the style of instruction. Prof. Marcuss lectures are long and can be difficult to follow. He frequently jumps from topic to topic without presenting a clear structure beforehand to follow along with. During the lectures, it felt as though if I had lost focus for more than a few seconds, I would have been completely lost for the remainder of the class because it moves incredibly fast. I would strongly urge Mr. Marcus to change the class to a seminar format which, in my opinion, would make it much more accessible. The class material itself is very interesting and Mr. Marcuss opinions are equally interesting, but I think I would have gained much more from a discussion based class rather than what is now.",
                "Yes. The outline of the course is clear. If you study the content, pay attention in lecture, you will do well.",
                "Yes! It was an interesting course that differed from my other classes, since I am a STEM major.",
                "For someone who is interesting in understanding Jews' placement within the broader religious world, this class is great. If you're not remarkably interested in the material, you may want to look somewhere else, because it can definitely be hard to stay fully engaged at times.",
                "ee",
                "Yes, very interesting and stimulating class.",
                "Yes, I would. Caveat, you have to take good notes and organize a lot of the information yourself to really make sense of the material, but as long as you do more than just sit there motionless and try to absorb it all, you'll learn a lot. The professor certainly takes a \"great men\" approach to history, which typically would annoy me, but since this is a survey course in an arena I don't know anything about, I still found it helpful-- I didn't even recognize the names of most of the men we discussed, and each did seem to epitomize their own era in one way or another.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in early Jewish history, it's a little bit of a specific topic, but definitely covers it thoroughly."
