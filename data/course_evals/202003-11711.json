                "The strengths of this course was that it was INCREDIBLY well-organized, and the tests were very fair. Having pre-typed out notes was very helpful as it allowed students to follow along very well during class. There were no weaknesses of the course!",
                "Strengths of this course were that the pace was very manageable and we could ask as many questions as needed.",
                "I thought this class was amazing! The material was very interesting and the lecture formats were really great and made the class understandable.",
                "Strengths - we had plenty of time to complete problem sets, and Prof Ochoa encouraged questions during lecture. Weaknesses - I felt like the prof was not that accessible outside of class (office hours were really early like 6am). Prof would split us into groups (breakout rooms) but no one would talk really so it felt useless at times",
                "I think we all relied a lot on in-class explanations, and it was no so effective for students to work together on problems over Zoom. If we were in person, perhaps working with other students. I wish office hours and resources outside of class were more accessible. It was really helpful to have so many problems to review, though."

In general I think math classes are particularly hard to replicate on Zoom because we cannot follow along on a whiteboard or work together. I think it would have been helpful to have sessions outside of class for reviewing problems, or more office hours available."
