                "Strength:\r\nThe instructor uses handwriting to teach the class, which is clear.",
                "Strengths: Lectures from Andre were solid, great at stopping to answer simple questions and was flexible with assignment deadlines. Teaching staff made an effort to host Friday sections to cover extra topics for our enrichment. Weaknesses: never got back grades\/feedback for project proposal and guidelines surrounding project were a bit unclear though the Edstem did help to mitigate it somewhat.",
                "very good lectures. The professor prepared very well and is so nice to answer any questions",
                "Andre is extremely knowledgeable in the subject, as it is his main research area of interest. He has written very interesting papers on some of the topics we discussed in class. Moreover, he comes to lectures very well-prepared and answers any questions that students might have, either during or after the lecture (in particular, he almost always stays around after class to address students' questions and devotes as much as an hour or more after class for such private QnA times). Perhaps one weakness of the class is that it is sometimes not easy to follow the entire flow of the course; personally, I was able to digest materials in each lecture, but the relationships between lectures were often lost amid the details of mathematical derivation. My advice for future prospective students would be to take note of the broader picture as they progress throughout the semester.",
                "Lighten the load of the problem sets very slightly - the extra work required of grad students was substantial",
                "I think the concepts can be more clearly explained.",
                "strengths\r\nhas notable strengths in terms of the professors' expertise, clarity, and organization. \r\nTAs are very knowledgeable and helpful as well, and offer valuable assistance. \r\nthe materials provided are well-structured, progressively moving from fundamental to advanced topics (and ultimately to a very useful application). \r\nthe problem sets are very helpful and very closely aligned with the course content\r\n\r\nhow could it be improved\r\nIt could adhere more closely to the syllabus (or adjust the syllabus accordingly).",
                "The course was well-organized and easy to follow the progression from class to class. The concepts are part of a new and emerging field and Professor Wibisono did an excellent job of teaching very recently published mathematics and theoretical results from this area of computer science, as well as providing citations to the papers referenced in lecture. However, I wish that we had had an extra week or so in the class to fully connect the theoretical techniques and convergence bounds proven in class to their use in empirical systems for generative modeling: I enjoyed getting a taste of the sorts of theoretical results proven in this field, but am very interested in how fast these theorems can be applied and made useful in practice.",
                "Strength : The assignments really helped understand the mathematics and the concept behind the jargon. Well designed and helpful.\r\nWeakness: I think the course introduction did not properly indicate what the learning outcomes of the class were going to be."

                "I would recommend this course if you have a strong math background (S&DS 241\/242, MATH 225 at least) and some machine learning courses. It feels better suited towards graduate students working on theoretical ML than undergrads with an interest in ML",
                "Don't be fooled, this is a high-level stats\/math class, not a CS class. I would recommend if you're looking to refresh your knowledge of and sharpen your quantitative stats skills, and if you're interested in learning various topics in machine learning from a theoretical, not application, lens. Your foundation in statistical and probability theory has to be solid (e.g. from S&DS 241\/242) to understand the lectures, and a good deal of multivariate calculus was on the p-sets as well. P-sets were mostly computational \/ theoretical though the later p-sets required some coding to plot some graphs, but definitely no intensive coding whatsoever, all math\/stats-flavored p-sets. Also, a lot of topics covered were niche and research-specific. We cover results as recent as 2022-2023 which was interesting and made our material feel relevant but also everything was completely theoretical so not relevant for those probably not interested in theoretical ML research. I also have a math and stats background so I enjoyed the class and didn't find the workload to be heavy.",
                "Yes",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to any student, especially if they have an interest in optimization and sampling. I took this course to better understand diffusion models, and I came out of this course a lot more aware of the machinery behind state-of-the-art generative models, such as DALLE or Stable Diffusion. The mathematics involved is difficult but rewarding to understand, and although the lectures can be dense, the bi-weekly problem sets are extremely reasonable. The course is really focused on helping students learn instead of evaluating or testing students' knowledge, which I found to be very conducive for my own learning (you can really focus on studying instead of worrying or stressing about exams).",
                "Yes, if you are serious about learning about the theory of machine learning, this course is a complete essential.",
                "Yes. The course is good for getting to know sampling.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to students who have an interest in diffusion generative model and are willing to invest the time. \r\nIt comprehensively introduces the fundamental theory and associated concepts and algorithms of diffusion generative models.\r\nThe course provides a well-structured path, providing essential tools and concepts necessary for understanding diffusion generative models, along with in-depth proofs. \r\nOverall, it is a valuable learning experience for those willing to dive into this topic.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but I would recommend future students weight the listed prerequisites when deciding whether to take the course. The listed prerequisites are less in depth and stringent than I think may be required for most students, and it would be helpful for students to keep in mind that it is helpful to have some background in optimization. However, if one does not meet all the prerequisites, the professor still did a good job of briefly reviewing concepts as they become relevant in lecture.",
