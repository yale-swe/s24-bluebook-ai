                "This is an incredible class that teaches you a tremendous amount of Russian. The curriculum is very well thought out and interesting, and Irina Andreevna is an amazing professor. The only weakness would be that the homework assignments can sometimes be very long, which is a bit overwhelming if they are posted close to class time.",
                "S: Love when we do group scenarios (ie Debates, conferences, business panels, interviews, etc). Irina helps us fill in the words we don't know why we get to practice. Also, the films for the class are a lot of fun. \r\nW: Homework could be a little disorganized, which can be stressful, but Irina is very good at quick feedback, and is very open to suggestions.",
                "The strengths are that you speak a lot of Russian, and do a lot of Russian homework outside of class. The only weakness was that the class was disorganized. It was not always clear what homework had been assigned, what tests were about, etc.",
                "No weaknesses. Strengths are the engaging material based on students' own interests.",
                "The course's greatest strength is that the topics we cover can be customized based on the issues the cohort is interested in! If I could suggest one area of improvement, it would be that there could be more frequent quizzes - at least on a fortnightly basis or once in three weeks.",
                "The strengths of this course are the flexibility and willingness of the professor to listen to students' interest and tailor content accordingly. The level of engagement and opportunities for debate and conversation were frequent and useful. \r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by having more grammatical exercises for new topics. I also think an organization of homework by type (articles with questions, vocabulary, etc) could be found in separate documents. The only confusion I encountered while taking the course was that sometimes the homework assignments were found on one document."
