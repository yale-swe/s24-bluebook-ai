    "Why do we die? Why do we die when we do? What is a disease, really? Autoimmunity, cancer, infectious disease, they are all just aspects of evolution that we need to learn about in order to understand medicine and human health. Are humans still evolving? What are the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and should be actually be finishing all the antibiotics we're prescribed? Are we literally doomed by evolution to be nothing more than vessels for the next generation. How do you escape existential dread? \r\n\r\nHow to write concisely. How to manage your time. How to use scientific arguments. How to read scientific literature. Etc. This is the best STEM seminar at Yale, if not just the best freaking class. Take it (if you have the time)",
    "The application of evolutionary concepts to a variety of problems on the from the level of the cell (cancer) to that of the individual and population. Completely new way of thinking about things. I think this sort of background in evolutionary medicine should be given to everyone intending to get an MD.",
    "I learned a lot while taking this course. I learned about a lot of aspects of medicine I hadn't previously thought about. I also learned new ways to approach concepts or problems, and how to critically analyze papers or problems. I also improved at stating my ideas clearly and succinctly.",
    "I developed a good understanding of the importance of reflecting upon and incorporating concepts of human evolution into the practice and research of medicine. I also learned how to engage critically with scientific literature and how to write as a scientist.",
    "This course offers so much knowledge and tools for thinking to anyone who has interest in medicine\/evolution\/human biology. After having taken various higher level biology classes this class has shown me new ways to think and apply the knowledge, and how to approach medical problems from an evolutionary lens."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: Constant active engagement in class with other students. A super confident professor - willing to walk out of the room and let the students discuss the material without him in the room before coming back and clearing out all misconceptions in a matter of minutes. He's also willing to accept the limits of his own knowledge - a rare quality that enhances all of class.\r\n\r\nWeakness: None. This class is not required for anyone. If it were weak, it would have been selected against through natural selection on Yale courses. Actually, beware of it taking ~6 hours to prepare per class. Not a weakness. Actually a strength, but I cannot emphasize enough that this is a lot of (rewarding) work",
    "It felt like a lot of my week was centered around reading responses, which could be less frequent and intense. The best discussion occurs in class and people who take this course are dedicated enough to do the readings anyway",
    "Overall it was a really good, if difficult, course. Most of the stuff we learned about was very interesting, and the in-class discussion brought it to different levels. Sometimes the in-class discussion got dominated by one or two people, I'm not sure what the professor could have done about that other than things like the screwdriver which did work well, but it was a little annoying. However in general the format of the class was well-done, and the idea of watching stuff and then responding to it worked well. I really appreciated all the personal comments on our responses to the material. I'm still a little unsure if section itself was actually useful since the class was already a seminar, but the class overall taught me a lot and was well designed.",
    "This course is, because Professor Stearns has been teaching this for so long, extremely strong. There are few places where it needs improvement, as both the pacing, the class atmosphere, and the material are stimulating and very conducive to learning. However, perhaps more help in deciding how to develop a good paper topic might be useful, especially since topics are pretty much decided when we're not even half of the way through the semester.",
    "The main strength of the course is the instructor and the format.  Prof Stearns is one of the most caring, enthusiastic and engaging professors. He really treated the class like a discussion group and allowed us to talk through all of the topics, never shying over from difficult questions about the ethics and societal impact of the issues we were discussing. In addition, because of the flipped nature of the class and the weekly homework load (which is considerable), everyone in the classroom was on top of the material, and more often than not every individual contributed to the discussion. This was one of the best experiences I've had in a seminar.\r\nThat being said, while it is not a weakness, the class requires a lot of time, energy, and dedication - so keep that in mind when deciding to take the course."

   "comments": [
    "Make sure you have enough time to do the multiple weekly response papers and watch the videos on top of coming to class. Not to forget the 20 page paper that will help you learn a lot but also will be a mammoth task",
    "Yes, there is no other course that lets you engage in biology, philosophy, scientific literature, etc. You name it, and you can choose to learn it. Absolutely take this class.\r\n\r\nNote: if you are looking to learn the mechanisms of biological processes (e.g. which cytokines cause which immune responses, which mechanisms mediate influenza-mediated endocytosis), this is not for you. But if you are looking for a new framework to think about biology and medicine that is broad enough to understand, well, almost everything, then this is for you.\r\n\r\nAlso: This class took be 6-8 hours to prepare for per class. Which means around 14 hours total each week. I was the slowest worker that I know of in the class. It is intense, but the most rewarding class you will ever take.",
    "Definitely, one of the top three courses I have taken at Yale, if not better. Prof Stearns is an amazing teacher and is genuinely interested in getting to know students outside of class. He is very responsive and supportive. The content in this course is fascinating as well. Students at the end write a final paper applying evolutionary concepts to anything in medicine, meaning most of the learning in this course occurs through yourself and in an area you are interested in.",
    "Yes I would; it was an interesting and engaging course. However, it is a high workload because you have to respond to a lot of different things very frequently, and the end paper takes a lot of time, so that's important to know. Overall I learned much more from this course than my standard lecture courses though.",
    "This course is incredible for anyone interested in evolutionary biology or medicine. Finally, a STEM course in which one is not just in a large lecture hall with peers who are needlessly competitive and not intellectually curious, listening to a professor regurgitating material that you are for some reason forced to memorize even though you know you will only retain it for the exams and maybe for the MCAT. I enjoyed hearing my fellow classmates talk about what they were passionate about in biology, and professor Stearns is just an amazing inspiration. One caveat though is you should definitely not take this class with many other classes with a large workload: the responses can indeed take a lot of your time.",
    "I totally recommend this course to any student excited by the material. However if you are not genuinely interested in learning you will not get a lot out of this course, and will have to put a lot of work in it. Do take this course if you've been looking for a serious science seminar like me, and you won't be disappointed. But the writing credit is no joke, and do remember that. I wrote 2*3*500 = 3000 words a week on average for the reading responses, and the final paper is about 20 pages or longer."
