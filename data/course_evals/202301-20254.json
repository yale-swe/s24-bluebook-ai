                "So much!!! Top 1 class! We covered Jewish history from the mid-1600s until the present in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, America, and Israel. It completely changed my perception of my Jewish identity and Jewish history as a whole. We also had to do so much primary source  and non-primary source  reading and had to get used to analyzing a lot of writing. There was also a whole lotta writing, and I think I improved a lot with my analytical essay writing over the course of the semester. Just a fascinating course.",
                "I learned a ton of content in this class!! Also, I was able to (hopefully) improve my analytical writing skills. Each of the five essays were challenging, forcing me to think critically and deeply about how to address the prompt.",
                "I learned quite a bit about differ t Jewish diaspora communities.",
                "I learned all about Modern Jewish History, specifically emancipation and how it played out around the world.",
                "I learned so much about Jewish history. This is a really rich and interesting history that I otherwise would not have learned in such depth or at all. I also learned about writing history papers."

            "comments": [
                "The strength is Professor Sorkin -- he is an incredible professor. Additionally, every essay you turn in a draft so you can get good feedback and incorporate it for the one that is graded. The weakness is section. The class is already treated like a seminar, so section is a complete waste of time. Also, there are a lot of readings but you don't have to do all of them.",
                "Strengths: All of the content. The readings are super interesting. Prof. Sorkin is HIM!!! HE IS THAT GUY!! He knows his stuff and is such an impressive lecturer. Just so knowledgeable and so good at conveying information and answering questions. Picked fascinating source material. Thought-provoking essay prompts. Makes you a better writer. AND SORKIN BRINGS CHOCOLATES!!! HIMMY NEUTRON!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is no reason this class needs to have a discussion section. It is a seminar. We were all tired and slacked off engagement-wise during section. It was a somewhat overwhelming amount of reading. Had to skim a bunch of them. Also we had writing assignments due every week, which was a lot.",
                "A definite strength of this class was that we submitted a rough draft of each essay first, then received feedback, then revised/rewrote, and then submitted a final draft. We only received a grade for our final drafts, not our rough drafts. This was very helpful because it gave us a chance to improve our work and apply our feedback. Another strength of this class was the small class size. It felt like a seminar! We were able to participate a lot, ask questions, etc. It was a much more intimate learning environment than a big lecture. Something else that I appreciated about this course was that we read books written by our professor which was amazing!! I felt so lucky to learn from the man himself! One weakness of this course was the amount of reading that was assigned. It was not really feasible to get through all the reading, and often the reading was in addition to writing/revising a paper. The reading often took me hours and hours to complete and it felt like it was pretty much all necessary because I wanted to participate in class, be engaged, and also use readings as sources in my papers.",
                "The lectures are interesting, and having a smaller class size was great for discussion. But assigning 5 papers with multiple drafts and then hundreds of pages of reading per class/week is outrageous. Way too much reading for a writing course, or way too much writing for a standard history lecture. Needs a better balance.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, Good support system and community.\r\nWeaknesses: Professor was at times not engaging, readings were extreme in length, paper prompts were poorly written.",
                "The class is essentially a seminar because professor Sorkin asks us so many questions, but the room is set up as a regular classroom. The chairs should face each other if he is going to expect us to talk. It is really important to do the readings but the updated syllabus is not available on canvas which was annoying. I think the amount of reading was kind of crazy, but it was still all very meaningful and interesting. This class should be made more approachable to people without prior knowledge of Jewish history and non-Jews; while I could tell this was cool stuff, it was sometimes hard to figure out why it was important to the rest of the world."

                "Yes, for sure! It will challenge you, but it is so worthwhile. Professor Sorkin is amazing.",
                "I would for the material or as a credit D option. Syllabus needs revision to be more manageable for students so they can fully engage with the material.",
                "This is essentially a 1.5 credit class because of the discussion section and the amount of reading and writing. I would recommend this class to anyone who is willing to put in the time and energy for it. I had never taken a history class at Yale and I learned a lot about how to make claims about history and support them. I would also recommend this class to Jewish students who are curious about the history of Jewish people because there is so much more to learn than what we are typically taught."
