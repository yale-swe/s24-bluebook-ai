                "Skills: Close-reading, active listening, creative and academic writing, and how to participate in a seminar.\r\n\r\nI also learned about a wide variety of forgeries that were super interesting that I wouldnt have known about otherwise.",
                "This course provided a fantastic introduction to various forgeries (from artistic to academic to literary) while also aiding in the development of creative thinking and writing skills. This course was also a fantastic introduction to Yale, as Professor Galindo provided us with the framework to engage with a college course load. Professor Galindo also walked us through strategies to analyze specific college-level texts (such as Barthes and Benjamin). Moreover, some of our assignments were more open-ended. While this was initially a little intimidating, I found that the open-ended assignments allowed me greater freedom to incorporate my creative side and follow my curiosity. For example, our final assignment included the possibility of creating a forgery or engaging with a forgery in a personal manner. I was then able to research topics that I wouldn't have otherwise followed. \r\n\r\nI feel that I left this course with a better understanding of forgery as a discipline, a better understanding of myself as a writer, and a greater appreciation for how my creative side can relate to academic endeavors.",
                "I was given a supported introduction to \"college writing,\" which I found extremely helpful in my first semester at a university. I also learned what it was like to join in on the rhythm of discussion, which I lacked during my high school career. The conversations during this class were thoughtful, and the professor did an excellent job in making sure every student felt comfortable but also fully engaged during the given time."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: I had this course with Dean Galindo, and I truly believe she is one of the best aspects about this class. The pacing of the class was amazing, and she really cared about our feedback and learning experience. She nudged our discussion towards the right track without dominating the discussion or lecturing. The material we went through were also very diverse and engaging with a lot for me to think about even after this courses end.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didnt love the separate writing lab on Fridays. Didnt feel as engaging or helpful. I mainly used it to drop in and get feedback on my essays before leaving early. The screenings and visits to the art gallery were fun, but I think overall the writing lab was just built in office hours.",
                "I think that a strength of this course was the diversity of the material we covered. We engaged with forgeries in different written styles (literature and academia) and explored other mediums beyond writing (film, visual, etc). While I sometimes wished we could have spent more time on individual pieces, I think that the overall effect of looking at so many items was an awesome overview of different kinds of forgeries. I also think that Professor Galindo's teaching style is a huge strength of this course. One assignment was for students to run a class, and I thought that this was a meaningful practice both when I ran the class and when I was listening to other students.",
                "I think the seminar-part of the class is the biggest strength of this course; it was academically stimulating but also rich in diverse ideas and insights. However, I think the 3-hour long labs every Friday could have made a better use of its time (an hour-long talk about something that could've been easily summarized into an email, etc.)",
                "Writing Lab was a large waste of time-- there was little time to actually work on essays for most of the semester, and instead had some random assignments that didn't help me grow as a writer (aside from the midterm/final papers). It felt like the professors in Writing Lab didn't do a good job organizing the course and developing lessons on topics that would have been genuinely helpful to us.\r\nThe seminar apart from Writing Lab was consistently great."

                "Yes!! Please take it with Galindo if she is teaching it. I loved the small, seminar format. It made me feel very comfortable in discussing my thoughts, especially as a first year in foreign territory, and I truly learned a lot. Theres also a lot of support, and the pacing is great.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Few courses have allowed me to explore creativity in the way that this course has. I found that for our seminar assignments, I was supported in actually leaving behind the academic 'mold' in order to better explore forgeries. Additionally, Professor Galindo creates a truly welcoming environment that encourages all students to contribute to discussions. I felt that we bonded as a group of people, and that led to more involved discussions. Overall, this course is a perfect class to take during the first semester at Yale! It is interesting, unique, and fun.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. As much as this was a seminar class dedicated to first-years, I think it did a wonderful job overall in helping first-year students assimilate into the new system of seminar and writing in college.",
                "Absolutely!! As a STEM kid, this was my favorite class because Professor G really guided us into the world of forgery with great, actually engaging texts.\r\nThe variety of works we were exposed to was really amazing and goes to show how well planned Professor G made the course. The texts dealt with things like forged identity, forged history, forged art, forged societal structures (i.e. along the lines of discrimination), what does it mean for something to be a forgery, why does it matter if something is fake, and who is affected (benefits from / is hurt by) a forgery.\r\nOne thing I want to add is that Writing Lab, which was once a week, was a little misleading to me when I signed up for the course it ended up being more of a large lecture (with all of the 6 PG classes) with really low effort to engage us. I learned almost nothing from it, and it felt like a waste of time."
