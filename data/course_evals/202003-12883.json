                "I learned how to read political philosophy essays, often multiple, in an efficient way. At the beginning, I would take multiple hours to just get through some tens of pages, but at the end, I could effectively skim the essays to both preserve my time as well as my understanding of the material enough to have a discussion over it. I also learned how to write political analysis essays according to the frameworks we discussed in class, and how to look at a situation from multiple perspectives and philosophies.",
                "Through the conversations held in this class, I gained insight on a variety of societal issues, such as the trade-off between privacy and security. I advanced my knowledge regarding the work of several political philosophers, like John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham, both of whom I was unfamiliar with before. I left this class with more questions than what I arrived with, and I am most appreciative of this, as one of the invaluable skills that I developed in the class was to pose questions that critically analyze a nuanced controversy.",
                "I learned about legal philosophies and theories from thinkers such as Mill, Rousseau, Nozick, and Rawls. I also learned how to apply these theories to real world situations.",
                "I learned how to apply the foundations of political ideologies, such as Mill's harm principle, to real world scenarios. I realized law is very complex in that there is always a trade off between law and freedom and it is difficult finding the right balance where it neither leads to anarchy or tyranny.",
                "critical analysis and debate",
                "I learned a ton about different political\/legal philosophies. I also learned how to think on my feet and push myself to develop thoughts and think critically on the fly during class.",

                "I learned about the fundamentals of liberal political philosophy and how they apply to modern issues, such as immigration, inequality, slavery reparations, and cultural conflict.",
                "I started to question everything I was taught to accept about our governments and law systems. While trying to find answers to very complex questions, I learnt to consider various perspectives, even the ones I would normally discard, and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.",

                "The strength of this course is the amount of discussion time we get with the instructor and other students. This allowed us to take our thoughts to their logical conclusions and defend or abandon them.\r\n\r\nOne possible improvement to the course would be to briefly introduce a political philosophy before the readings are due, so that we know what to expect while reading. Some of the works were tough to get through without prior knowledge.",
                "It was an amazing course that I wish I could take again! Truly the best course I took this semester, and I suspect will be a favorite in all my Yale career. It was exciting to go to and read about, even when I was tired of homework and classes. The beginning of the course was difficult because I had no prior experience with political philosophy or similar essay writing, but I quickly understood how to best spend my time and effort, and the course allowed for great discussion and transitioning between topics. I would say that I wish we could have talked more about certain topics than others according to what our class personally liked, so I wish we had the option to allocate discussion time ourselves a bit.",
                "The strengths of the course are evident in the format of it; I felt like I had a very close relationship to the professor and met with him one-on-one throughout the semester. Due to the small class size, I felt like I had a sizable contribution to the development of the class's intellectual discussions. I enjoyed the essay topics and was able to efficiently utilize the readings from the course to research for them. There's no weakness of the course in my opinion, but if I had to give a comment on how it could be improved, I would suggest that a longer class time would be better because the conversations that occur in this class are incredible, and one can often lose track of time.",
                "Professor Rossas was an amazing instructor. All of the seminars were incredibly engaging and the content we covered interesting and relevant.",
                "Strengths: The seminars were always very engaging and Professor Rosas does a great job pushing us to think deeper and challenging our views. Everyone also brought in very interesting points which made the discussion always lively \r\n\r\nWeakness: The virtual seminar took out the core of seminars which is the ability to naturally bounce ideas off of one another. Because it was done through zoom we had to raise hands and wait our turn to speak and sometimes the conversation would have already gone past what you want to talk about",
                "strengths: open debate, manageable readings, engaging professor, even over Zoom\r\n\r\nweaknesses: having to do the class over Zoom",

                "Our reading material was always very engaging. Our discussions were fierce and always thought-provoking. It could only be better if it was taught in-person, which of course because of the circumstances was not possible.",
                "The professor is incredible at facilitating interesting class discussion and helping students think through challenges. \r\n\r\nThe course's discussion-based format began to feel tedious at times and I think the professor could have introduced different exercises. I also think assigning some smaller written assignments in addition to the essays could have been helpful in processing information\/ideas.",
                "Strengths: Very engaging and thought provoking. Safe environment that encourages discussion.\r\nWeaknesses: Students leave the course with more questions than answers (this is probably good but frustrating)",

                "YES! Absolutely, without a doubt, 100% take this course! I am not a pre-law student, but this course really helped me expand the way I think about a lot of our present-day political conundrums. I even changed my mind about a few topics, which, as a generally stubborn person, is very unusual for me. If you have the opportunity to take this class, DO IT! In my opinion, everyone should take this class or some version of it, and Rosas is a fantastic professor. This course was a true gem.",
