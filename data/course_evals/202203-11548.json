This course was excellent, was incredibly engaging, and definitely enhanced writing skills.",

                "This course is set up perfectly in that it being a small seminar in LC with a professor guiding the way, students are expected to show up having something to offer. And based off of the incredible assigned readings it is impossible not to have something to offer if you complete the readings, and it makes for great discussions in class. I loved the focus and routine of the class, it makes immersing into Yale as a first year much easier and allows you to bond in class with classmates.",
                "So far, I can think of no weaknesses. The workload of this class is very reasonableyou quickly get into the rhythm of writing drafts and revising them every week. Professor Riley creates a supporting writing atmosphere that lets you speak your mind about writing and develop your own skills to your full potential. I really liked the prompts for the writing as well, I had never written personal essays beyond college essays (which really tainted the genre for me), but this course almost allowed me to write an anthology of works about myself and my worldview (and where it came from) that became a source of self-insight and reflection. There are some really powerful ideas from the essayists we read that also fundamentally changed the way I thought about the world."

                "Strongly recommend this class to everyone! Professor Riley is extremely sweet and will help you grow as a writer. All the essays we've read are carefully selected examples of crafted writing and were all thought provoking. This class is a lot of writing, but you are free to choose whatever you want to write about, and at a certain point, you start enjoying the high workload. Best class I have taken so far.",
                "Yes! English major or math fanatic, you will be glad to have learnt to write much better!",
                "This is always the first course I recommend to any student, and I managed to get quite a few friends to take it next semester. The level of engagement in this course is unseen in any other course I've taken, and it's entirely up to you to choose how engaged you want to be. It's also amazing given you get to learn from the writers you're reading, the professor, and your classmates, and having the three as a combination makes for a powerful learning experience. If you want something that pushes you to question certain beliefs, also reinforce prior beliefs, this is the course for you.",
                "Yes, a thousand times yes. Professor Riley is the most amazing professor, and English 120 is a class that will make you not only fall in love with writing again, but also that you are a better writer than you realize. I used to be a person who thought sharing my writing with another person was analogous to handing that person a knife, laying down, and letting them stab me. I was so insecure about my writing, but my class and the workshopping person changed that for me. I loved the workshopping process and gained confidence in my abilities not only to write, but to edit. The vibes of my section were excellent and I met so many amazing writers and got close to them by reading their writing over the semester and talking to them about our favorite writers and essayists. This is really a unique experience and should be a required class for all Yalies. Also, if you have the luck to get Prof. Riley, you will realize that she is one of the kindest and most insightful people you have ever met."
