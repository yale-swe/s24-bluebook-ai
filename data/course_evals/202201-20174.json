                "This class helped me conceptualize the many different forms of education and the intersections of government, politics, religion, and history in education. We learned about the realities of decolonizing education and some ways various indigenous communities are reclaiming education; we learned about test-based accountability and the rise of PISA around the world; we learned about education as a method of control and assimilation as well as a way to uplift and empower.",
                "I developed an understanding of key issues in international education and gained insight into \"best practices\" across different countries' education systems",
                "Think more critically about education systems around the world.",
                "Good understanding of other countries education system.",
                "I learned a lot about education systems around the world and how to think more critically about the purposes of each education system. I considered how they aligned with each system's goals and national priorities. It made me consider my own education in a way I never had before. I think this course helped me improve my writing and, for the first time, I wrote a paper with a partner.",
                "I learned to think about the goals, actors, and institutions of education. I began seeing how culture, nationalism, legacy colonialism affects the way we produce knowledge.",
                "I learned about the field of education studies, how education is important to building the nation and establishing national identity, how different nations have thought of education esepically in the context of empire and rebuilding post-independence, and how to conduct research on education.",
                "This course was an incredible introduction to the nuanced scene of international education, facilitated by student conversation guided by the diverse selection of readings. Dr. Debs is an incredible creator of a learning environment too!",
                "I learnt more about the different education systems in different country contexts.",

                "I learned a lot on the subject material, particularly through the kind of case studies we sometimes did into different country's education systems.",
                "I learned about different models and goals of education throughout the world. From the role of private education in different countries to how language and history education shape national identity or healing after national tragedies. It was fascinating to see how different countries tried to enact reforms and which methods were employed to increase enrollment or retention within schools. I have wanted to take this class since getting into Yale and it is easily one of my favorite classes. I learned research and data analysis skills in addition to how to write engaging and relevant research papers.",
                "I learned about the education systems in Finland, Singapore, South Korea, and Ethiopia. I developed my research reading skills and my argument formation skills.",

            "comments": [
                "This class is so forgiving! I was always excited for our conversations and the readings were so interesting, but anytime things got overwhelming, there were so many support systems. Reading groups give you peers that are always there for you, automatic extensions whenever you need them, and flexible reading response expectations. I think it might be helpful if some of the readings were more guided or the connections were more explicit, but overall, I really enjoyed this course.",
                "All strengths. Dr. Debs is an amazing prof and did a great job of helping us build a class community. Readings were interesting and insightful and not too long. The writing assignments were time-intensive but allowed for a lot of freedom to write on a topic that interested you. I liked how every class was structured around a different theme-- never felt like we were discussing the same things every week, but the themes also tied together very nicely. The small \"reading-group\" format for class discussions was really great and I think all seminars should do it",
                "Very comprehensive review of education systems. Discussions provided the platform to hear from my classmates perspectives.",
                "No weaknesses, only strengths HAHA \r\n\r\nKidding aside, this class was genuinely fun to show up to, and many of the readings were on point. All thanks to Dr Debs!!",
                "Strength - professor and classroom community. \r\nWeakness - too much reading",
                "I think there were many strengths to this course. Firstly, I think the number of readings and discussion posts were very feasible on a weekly basis. And, of course, the reading groups were fantastic. They also helped facilitate richer conversations. I\r\nI did sometimes wish we had more background provided, perhaps by the professor, on the country or region we were discussing that week. It would also have been helped to have more historical context before we began our discussion. I think background was provided for some discussions, but perhaps a bit more for each region would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: I liked how interesting, critical, yet manageable (30-40pgs) the readings were. Dr. Debs and her insights are definitely is a plus.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the classroom felt micro-managed",
                "Strengths: small reading groups, class discussions, guidance on writing assignments, understanding from prof. debs\r\n\r\nweaknesses: it is a very policy oriented class, very high level, so be prepared for that. I think the course would benefit from more time spent at the \"micro-interactional\" level of analysis. Also, Dr. Debs emphasized student participation a lot which was great, but this didn't always come through. It would be great if student leader's could spend more time leading class discussions.",
                "This class, like many education studies classes, was strong in creating a collaborative sense of community among students with Dr. Debs encouraging partnering for assignments and facilitating student interaction through the introduction of \"reading groups\", subcommunities within the classroom.",
                "I really enjoyed the course material! + reading groups :)",
                "This course is terrific! Professor Debs applied a case-study approach, grounding each class in a particular issue (ex: high-stakes examinations in South Asia) and its repercussions for 3-4 different nations. The readings are interesting, manageable, and informative. Can't think of much in the way of improvements! A terrific class!",
                "This course is still kind of young, but I think the syllabus is pretty much bulletproof! Dr. Debs put together a great timeline of learning theory first and then moving into case studies. If there was any room for improvement, it might be changing up the structure slightly.",
                "Strengths: Reading Groups!! The class is divided into small groups that discuss the reading together during class. My reading groups allowed me to make friends and meet some amazing Yalies and we all supported one another through the readings each week while also having in depth conversations on the topics each week. Additionally the work was well spaced out for each class in that I felt able to complete rough draft papers with time to edit and better my writing in a way I am not always able to in other classes when the deadlines are more clustered. Similarly the class was really well organized - expectations, deadlines, and readings were always very clear. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish the course had covered issues of education for refugees but this is less of a weakness of the course and more something I would have enjoyed learning about.",
                "Strengths: Too many to list. The ones that jump out at me are: the weekly discussion led by a groups of students, the low-pressure weekly reading discussion posts (no pressure to come up with a cutting edge analysis or a wildly original take. we were allowed to express our genuine first thoughts), the two day late submission grace period, and the flexibility of Dr. Debs in incorporating student feedback on adjusting the course as the semester went on."

All of the assignments are pretty open-ended, allowing students to dictate their own projects and giving a lot of room for creative freedom in topic and format.",
                "100%. Best class I have taken so far at Yale-- must-take if you are in Ed Studies and highly recommend for anyone else vaguely interested in education or international political systems",
                "Yes. Discussion is very insightful and I was able to learn a lot from my classmates.",
                "Yes. Dr. Debs is great. Interesting material.",
                "Yes! This is a fantastic course if you are interested in education around the world, considering how the priorities of each nation shape their curricula and the students that graduate from this system. I also think this would be a fascinating course for every international student who has experienced at least two difference education systems, that of American higher education and their upbringing abroad. Our class was very international and brought many different perspectives into our conversations, which was fascinating. I also appreciate that there is a push to steer away from U.S. based topics.",
                "Yes. Take this course if you're interested in international education, trying to find the purpose of education, or if you want to hear Dr. Debs' insights.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in education, especially around the globe, and ESPECIALLY if you like studying and writing about policy, this is the course for you!",
                "I would highly recommend this course! Dr. Debs is an all-around great professor, from her broad knowledge within the field of international education to the way that she conducts her courses to ensure for student collaboration and community. The assignments and readings also allowed for a wide funnel for student interests to be explored, giving an incredible blend of direction and freedom of choice for student topic exploration.",
                "Yes! I think this is a great course for students from any major, and I feel it is an important course for people to take.",
                "Yes! If you're interested in educational policy, this is the class for you. You'll engage with emergent points of contention in the global educational community in the company of peers. The class is quite collaborative and Dr. Debs takes great care to ensure that you get to know your classmates. Commentary is encouraged though often low-stakes. One of Yale's best seminars!",
                "Absolutely! It's an amazing course for anyone interested in the topic, and the assignments are all very fruitful. Others would find the course accessible regardless of their education background.",
                "I would 1000% recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about educational models between different countries. The class felt very open to different access points (i.e. you didn't have to be an ed studies scholar to participate and contribute to the class discussions) and in fact the class was really added to by the ability for students to share about their educational backgrounds. Other topics included: education and national identity, education and national healing, rural education, education reform, PISA scores and testing/accountability, goals of education and more. I would take this course again without hesitation.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in education, this is the class for you. Dr. Debs is an amazing educator and this class is so interesting. We spend a lot of time talking about the US in humanities classes and looking outwards is a breath of fresh air intellectually.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Professor Debs is an incredibly supportive professor, the conversations we had in class were interesting and eye opening, and the class showed me new frameworks through which one can evaluate education."
