                "Strengths: The books. They're pretty much all fantastic, and Professor Mahurin makes sure to bring you into her enthusiasm about every text. She is truly one of the most fantastic teachers I've ever hadI was glued to my seat for the entirety of each class, which is a big deal for me, since I often struggle with staying focused for more than 45 minutes. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Having an exam AND an essay at the end of the semester doesn't actually make as much sense as Professor Mahurin seems to think that it does. Her rationale is that people who are stronger on exams will have an opportunity to excel in the course, and the same being true for students who are better at essays. However, this logic would only really hold up if there were an option to pick one or the otherby having us all complete both, it's only making it harder for BOTH strong essay writers and strong test takers to excel. Additionally, the exam is essentially tests our essay-writing skills, so that sort of defeats the purpose. All of that being said, there weren't many other opportunities to receive academic feedback or to work on improving your grade outside of the midterm essay, the presentation, and the final exam and essay. I think Professor Mahurin should consider adding in some response papers or something and getting rid of the exam. Also, we essentially receive no guidance on either essay, so it would be helpful to have some sort of written outline of her expectations for these essays."

                "This is the best class I've ever taken, at Yale or outside of it. I cannot recommend it highly enough. If you like to read and talk about those readings, take this class. TAKE THIS CLASS. If you can, it's tough to get into, but Professor Mahurin appreciates diligence so be persistent and try to get in a year or two before you plan on taking it so that you can say you've tried in the past.",
