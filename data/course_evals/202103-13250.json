                "I have learned a lot about China's effort regarding environmentalism and the discourse surrounding it through readings by prominent authors.",

I learned how to evaluate these policies with a more critical lens, understanding the nuances of China's environmental stances and policies, insights into the environmental humanities in Chinese literature/documentaries, and more.",
                "I learned a lot about environmentalism, especially in China. In general, the course was a great class to learning more background the problems China faces.",
                "I learned how to think critically about literature and film and how to connect literary depictions of historical events to their cultural context. We evaluated how actions of the past have shaped China's current relationship with the environment specifically regarding the Maoist era. \r\n\r\nLi Laoshi also took the time to help us improve as writers. He conducted writing workshops to ensure that we were able to convey our thoughts effectively and fluently.",
                "I learned about the complex picture of China's environmental issues from the Maoist era to today. We looked at how socialism, global capitalism, and international politics shape China's ecological crises and their environmental protection agenda. From the Chinese government to Chinese citizens to the media, there are many differing stories going around about China's responsibilities in the climate crisis and their role in mitigating it,  and so it is difficult to gain a clear understanding of where China stands in this landscape. I learned how to unpack and analyze these layers of rhetoric to build my own perspective on China and the environment."

                "Strengths: Professor Li is honestly one of the kindest and understanding professors out there. He will make sure you understand the material and explain it more if you ask. The course is also structured in a way that you learn a lot each week but it's not an overload of information. Weakness: None. It was fantastic.",
                "I cannot think of a single weakness. The class was fantastic. Professor Li is the greatest strength of the class in being able to foster such a truly great learning environment. As a senior, this has been one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale and it is all thanks to the comfort and exploration Professor Li was able to cultivate here. I've never been so engaged with a course, the readings, and discussions in the class. He picked great pieces of literature, journals, documentaries, and films to better understand the environmental crisis in China.",
                "One of the strengths of the class was how interesting the reading was. All the reading were super engaging and it didn't feel like tedious work to doing the readings and engage in class. I think the content of the class is super relevant and nuanced, which made it a good topic to have in-depth discussions. Also, the reading amount and amount of work for the course was very manageable. It was enough reading to feel like I learned something, but at the same time not too much where it was impossible to finish. Sometimes though, there was some extra context that was needed to understand some of the readings. However, Cheng did provide some of that context to clear up any confusion.",
                "I thought the course was incredibly well taught. The course was tailored to what the students thought were most interesting, and Li Laoshi was very open to exploring deeper into topics that were particularly engaging. The class was rigorous, but still had an emphasis on student learning and not simple busy-work. I truly believe that everything we did had a purpose and was part of a larger mission to gain an understanding of environmentalism in China. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed how the class was largely discussion-based, but still incorporated elements of lectures. Going into the class I did not have an understanding of the nuances of the Maoist era, but the \"mini-lectures\" Li Laoshi conducted allowed me to understand the context of the literature we were reading and allowed me to participate in the discussion better. \r\n\r\nLi Laoshi also required us to post discussion posts before every class, which I found incredibly helpful. It kept me accountable for the readings and allowed me to know generally what I'm getting into before the class starts to better prepare for discussion. \r\n\r\nI would say the biggest strength of this course is having Li Laoshi as a professor. The class's topic in and of itself was interesting, but Li Laoshi really made the class an environment where every student can succeed and take something away from each class meeting.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of the class is that it was too small. With only 5 students, there sometimes weren't enough differing ideas to have a rigorous discussion, resulting in a potentially interesting conversation dying out.",
                "The reading materials were carefully selected to introduce us to some of the prominent literature on China and the environment without being overwhelming in the amount we had to read. There was a good mix of literary texts, documentaries, sci fi, and movies as well, which were an enjoyable and effective way to learn about these issues. I think this class is a great introductory class into the myriad of environmental problems in China, from plastic waste to air pollution to ethnic conflict to the Belt and Road initiative and my only suggestion would be to offer more higher-level courses on the specific themes we touched on, so that we could study them in greater depth"

                "Absolutely. Any class with Professor Li is amazing, based on how much he cares about the students and the passion he has for the subject he is teaching. In addition, Chinese environmentalism is also a very important that will be increasingly more practical to learn about as we move forward.",
                "100%, absolutely. I'm extremely grateful I found this class, and it really enriched my learning experience at Yale. I had been intimidated by the environmental humanities but Prof. Li made it very digestible and engaging. If you have the chance to take a class with Prof. Li, take it! The workload was low, but I put the most time and work into my assignments for this class because the learning environment made me want to do closer reads, re-watch materials, etc.",
                "Definitely. I think to anyone interested in taking a really chill class and is remotely interested in just discussing any topics related to environmentalism or China, they should definitely take the course. The class was very conducive to friendly discussion and learning. I didn't really ever feel like I couldn't meet the expectations of the class or couldn't complete any of the assignments. If you are scared to take a seminar because you are afraid of discussions or the workload, this class is for you. Truly, this course isn't stressful at all and is genuinely meant for students to explore the topics at hand.",
                "Absolutely! It was incredibly refreshing to get an insight into environmentalism through the lens of literature, culture, and politics. I often find that climate change based classes disregard human involvement beyond humans being agents of pollution. This class, however, analyzes human actions, responses, and motivations to climate change mitigation. The class's emphasis on China was also interesting. I'd definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in environmentalism, China, or the intersection of science and policy.",
                "Definitely! This has been the only class at Yale I've found that looks at China and the environment, and it's a rare opportunity to be able to dissect and formulate your opinion on China's role in the global environmental movement in an informed and multidisciplinary manner. As the climate crisis worsens and as China's position as a world superpower grows, a nuanced understanding of China is incredibly important for anyone who is interested in international politics, environmentalism, and development."
