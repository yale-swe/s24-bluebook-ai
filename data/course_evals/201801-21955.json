    "Strengths - Meetings and class discussion was generally pretty good, and \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - One semester is just not enough time to fully flesh out an attempt at substantive, original work. I also think there's pretty limited value in doing extended literature reviews (which ended up mostly as just random theorizing, or lots of historical summarizing).\r\nI also feel like half the semester was spent on just exploring possible ideas or research questions, which meant we just kind of sat there and talked about what we thought was interesting, which while not bad, was not that helpful.",
    "with the class so large, we had to meet double the amount of time which was hard to keep up with since we wanted to spend that time to work on the thesis",
    "Loved the format. Very student-led, structured around our needs and progress."
