                "While the lectures were great, I feel like the notes could be organized a little better. Going back to the notes from the beginning of the semester during the final, it was sometimes hard to follow the information. Also, the homework assignment questions could be a little less confusing.",
                "Strengths: The basic review at the beginning of the course is useful. The units on X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy are structured well. The weekly homework assignments ensure students keep up with the material. The homework questions are similar to exam questions. The study guides for the exams are useful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes homework questions were unclear (i.e., the wording could be confusing). There were also a couple instances in which homework questions addressed content that was not yet covered in lectures.",
                "Strengths is the topics it covered. \r\nWeakness is  explaining those topics and the clarity of the questions asked in the HW and exams. I had to spend many hours online to understand something that was taught in class.\r\nThe discussion sections were also very not helpful. Nothing came out of the discussion sections and I wish we had office hours instead of just walking up to TFs after class. \r\nI think it can be improved by better and more structured explanation. For example, after we discussed the x-ray part of the course and then Cryo-em, we went back to half of a lecture explaining what a Fourier transform is. A very important concept in the course. So I guess I wish I had lecture 17 before lecture 9 or so. it would have made the X-ray section way easier."
