I learned the tools in improving my writing and how to analyze others' essays to determine what I think is good or bad writing then trying to incorporate some of the writing decisions I did like into my own work. I also had experience in writing 5 different types of nonfiction essays, many of which were new to me. This was valuable for increasing my skills as a writer, as I was able to experiment with different literary genres and figure out which ones I enjoy writing, which ones I do not, and even which ones I am naturally good or bad at."

She cares about her syllabus, making sure that all the readings are diverse and engaging. In our one-on-one writing conferences at the end of the semester, she took time to get our opinions on the syllabus, writing down our favorite and least favorite readings so she can adjust for the next year. She is an understanding, caring, and beautiful person!!!",
                "Strengths: The course instructor, Lizzie! Being able to write so many different styles of essays and reading really interesting work. The workshops were also helpful. Weaknesses: Absolutely none!",
                "The strengths are endless. Not too much reading, interesting assignments, seamless structure with no midterm or final. I honestly can't think of any weaknesses this course was so well facilitated and enjoyable.",
                "Strengths: Lizzie is an exceptional instructor, the class conversation was always super engaging, Lizzie consistently articulated very clearly what the strengths/weaknesses of my essays were. Weaknesses: none.",
                "There weren't many weaknesses. Readings and discussions are always engaging and interesting, and they're very helpful when it comes to improving your own writing. In-class workshops and draft feedback were also helpful, allowing me to turn in my best work at the end of each unit.",
                "This is a fantastic course that is structured very well.",
                "Nothing much left to improve would consider making the workshops shorter (maybe 3 per class?)",
                "A strength of the course was the feedback we received on our writing and the course's direct commitment to improving how we write. I think a weakness would be the repetitiveness of the course's structure, which was entirely reading other essays and discussing. While I find this structure incredibly helpful, it became monotonous after some time. Having different activities in class every so often could be helpful in keeping the content fresh and most engaging. Something as simple as small group discussions often felt like a much-needed breath of fresh air."

You learn creative non-fiction writing, you are able to go through the revision and workshopping process, and you read so many amazing works. Throughout the semester, I found my voice in my writing, and it wouldn't have been possible without this class. You get what you put in, though, so I would make sure to make time for this class and the five essays that you'll have to write.",
                "Absolutely! This class does require a lot of effort and work to get the most out of it, but if you are willing to put that in, then it is one of the most rewarding classes that you can take at Yale. You will definitely come out of this as a better writer!",
                "I typed everything and lost all of my progress so ill be brief: \r\n\r\nYes, and I already have. One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
                "I would highly highly recommend this course to another student, especially if you are not an English major. It is an excellent course to strengthen your writing in ways that are useful no matter your future path. It also probes you to explore yourself in an unexpected but gratifying way.",
                "Yes. The writing prompts lend themselves to a lot of creativity and I felt like I had the freedom to write about whatever I wanted to. The readings were fascinating and Lizzie is great at facilitating class conversations and bringing everyone into the conversation.",
                "Absolutely yes. The skills you will develop in this class will extend into all other writing credit classes you take at Yale, especially if you are an English major or interested in taking more creative writing courses. It's a staple.",
                "Yes; for students pursuing any major, learning how to write in a variety of formats is an essential skill that class will surely help you develop.",
                "Yes! especially if the student wants to improve their confidence in showing others their work",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who enjoys writing and wants to genuinely improve their skills and develop their own style. I thought this course was especially helpful in both of these aspects. However, I would not recommend this course to students who strongly dislike writing and would only want to take it for a writing credit, as all of this course's work is reading, writing, and then correcting your writing. While this is a valuable experience I think everyone should have, humanities major or not, I think anyone who enters this course solely with the expectation of knocking out a needed writing credit might not get the most out of this course."
