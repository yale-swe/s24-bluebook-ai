                "The strengths of the course are the teaching. The weaknesses are probably that TAs grade everything and he doesn't hand out many practice problems.",
                "strengths: great TAs weaknesses: third midterm was basically a final because it was all cumulative but overall I think less work than I was anticipating. Spiegel was a really fun professor and I actually enjoyed being in class but if you didn't go to class there were no lecture slides or supplementary material. I also really liked how the course was only 2 days a week instead of 3",
                "Strengths were the PSETs. they were hard, but they represented the exams very well, so i never felt surprised. Also the professor was fun and entertaining. Never felt like falling asleep during this class. Also, the TFs and peer tutors were of great help.",
                "Strengths: David Spiegel is an old-school, thorough lecturer, and his style of teaching was amazing. I really appreciate that he didn't teach explicitly from the textbook or using PowerPoints, instead moving stepwise through the chemistry on the blackboard. It was clear he knew how to teach organic chemistry clearly, and I felt as though the pace of the class was really good. I never felt behind or ahead and was well-prepared for each lecture's material on the basis of previous lectures. It was a terrific class in the sense that it knew exactly what it was trying to do... I went into organic chemistry praying I'd be able to pass and came out absolutely loving the subject. Nothing about the class micromanages student learning p-sets were short, but each question had relevance to the material/exams; and the midterms themselves were always fair. Workload was exceedingly manageable; I wish all my STEM classes at Yale were like this one. If you showed up and engaged with the material I think it would be hard to have a bad experience. I also enjoyed the longer MW lectures as opposed to the gen chem MWF lectures; it gave me the weekend to prep for MW content. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought section could have a little more structure/talking points; they were open-ended for questions but sometimes I wasn't entirely sure as to what questions I should be asking. It would be nice to have a few more practice problems available before the exam (i.e. longer Exam Review sheets).",
                "The course was a bit confusing and sometimes all over the place, but I really preferred the lectures taking place twice a week instead of 3 times.",
                "The strengths are a great teaching team, small class, very useful sections, great peer tutors, and honestly prof spiegel is a pretty engaging lecturer because its pretty funny.",
                "Peer tutoring and TAs were very very helpful",
                "Prof. Spiegel is nice and helpful. I wish the lecture notes were posted",
                "I think the lectures were nicely structured. The problem sets were also helpful to learning. I did find myself in some classes lost by the end of the amount of mechanisms explained in a single lecture, but it was not often. Also, the two-day set up instead of three times a week felt much better and allowed me to be more involved in lectures. I would not have liked the course as much with the three-day structure that general chemistry has.",
                "Strengths: content was good. Classes were only on Monday Wednesday which was fantastic. The TAs were amazing\r\nWeakness: couldnt miss class as the content was entirely written on the chalkboard.",
                "Weaknesses: I would have preferred more examples in lecture. Strengths: spiegel is great!",
                "off sequence was great because smaller class, better vibes, closer with TAs/prof. having only Monday/Wednesday classes and no Friday classes was amazing!!"

Orgo definitely gets a bad rap  put in the time on your own to cement the ideas and the \"whys\" behind different concepts, and it is hugely fun and satisfying. I feel this class prepared me well for both Biochem and the MCAT to the point where I'm debating whether I should change my major to chemistry. Even if you had a bad experience/didn't enjoy Gen Chem, I think orgo (at least with Spiegel!!!) is a course everyone should take at Yale.",
