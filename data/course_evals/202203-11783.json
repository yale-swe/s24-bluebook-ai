                "Great overview of China! Learned how to write a memo and form arguments against different pieces of writing on China.",
                "I gained Chinese history and its implications for current affairs. The course offered insight into the CCP mindset and how it will determine the global future.",
                "Comprehensive introduction to modern Chinese politics, and a bit of background on Chinese history to inform that understanding. The emphasis is modern Chinese politics (since the rise of the CCP).",
                "I developed a thorough understanding of Chinas recent history, politics, political institutions, and role as a global super power.",
                "Learned a lot about China, totally recommend!",
                "We learned about Chinese history, domestic politics, and international relations.",
                "I learned all things China. We did a brief dive into Chinese history, then a more thorough dive into the history since 1900 ish. That was the first half of the class, the rest was discussing China's domestic and foreign policy. I feel very well able to hold a nuanced conversation on China's rise and what it means for the world, and I have enough historical understanding to back it. This was an excellent and comprehensive introduction to Chinese history and politics.",
                "I learned a lot about the history and current political situation of China.",
                "learned about China, engaging critically with readings",
                "Learned everything about China, great introduction to China.",
                "I became a better writer by writing the reading responses and I learned so much about China that I did not know before. I am definitely more interested in China and authoritarian governments after taking this course.",
                "You learn about the history of China, domestic politics, and international relations. The class starts off with a history lesson, basically laying the framework for understanding modern China. And then we move into domestic politics and international politics. You really gain a better understanding of China and why it acts the way that it does",
                "Learned a lot about China.",
                "I learned the history and evolution of China as the global power it is today. Learning about this helped me reevaluate my prior perceptions of China, which I think is extremely useful given today's political climate.",
                "The political aspects contributing  the rise of Chinese civilization, as well as the challenges",
                "I learned a lot about China's history and modern day politics. I really enjoyed Professor Mattingly's style of lectures. He is a great teacher.",
                "I received a fantastic survey of Chinese political history since the Qing, as well as insight into the inner workings of the CCP & PRC.",

                "I learned so much about all things China, from its history, to domestic politics, to international politics",
                "I learned a lot of knowledge about China's history and contemporary politics that is super relevant in the world today. It was cool to be taking a class about this subject at a time when China is in the news every week.",
                "I learned a LOT more about contemporary Chinese politics and how the Chinese government is structured. Furthermore, knowing Chinese history is CRITICAL to understanding why China is structured the way that they are and what motivations drive different actions, and the entirety of the first part of the class was dedicated to explaining this. The class was very naturally structured, and what we learned at the beginning led into our later lessons extremely well.",
                "With very little background knowledge on China, this class was a wonderful crash course into the fundamental principles that drive the country forward. From its history to modern-day politics, from international relations to internal dynamics, from military operations to free speech, we covered so much ground in one semester that I think every student who took the class can now reasonably have a well-grounded debate on what the role of China in the world is, why, and what it should be in the future.",
                "This was an excellent lecture. Mattingly was engaging and tied in ongoing events. The section I was in was a highlight, as the teaching fellow held us to high (but reachable) standards, which encouraged me to work to get a strong grasp on the material.",
                "I learned a ton about the way the modern Chinese government works, as well as a bunch of general frameworks for understanding political science.",
                "Overview of Chinese politics from the 20th century to now",
                "This was a great course that offered a lot of insight into China's rise and current state. The three short response papers were great ways to better understand certain topics and were completely manageable in terms of workload. Professor Mattingly did a great job incorporating current events into his syllabus and I really appreciated having the time and space to discuss that and learn more.",
                "Modern history of China as context for domestic and international political decision-making and policies.",
                "This was a very nice comprehensive overview of the modern contemporary China's rise in the political and economic power as well as U.S.-China relations. It includes key lectures that help students understand the Chinese political system and party structure, as well as the final crisis simulation that allows us to experiment with what we've learned about Chinese party incentives and roles.",

                "A wide variety of Chinese history and politics",
                "I feel confident now talking about China and its politics, coming from a background with no understanding of Chinese politics",
                "I learned an incredible amount about China and the factors that have both been key to its success and that have presented its greatest challenges.",
                "How to take Chinese history and apply it to modern day Chinese politics",

                "A basic understanding of Chinese history, international relations, and domestic issues. How to parse academic writing, and critically respond to texts.  Crisis simulation provided an in-depth look at how the CCP operates at an institutional level. How to write a memo.",
                "I learned much about the history of modern China",
                "Learned a tremendous amount about the history of China as well as the historical context that effects the politics of China today.",

                "Increased knowledge of China",
                "Rise of China will teach you a little about this history of China and a lot about political theories of the past twenty years of maneuvering within China. If you know a fair amount about China already, this course will not really teach you much new information  except maybe the genuinely interesting history part but it does go into depth on methodologies of understanding China and PoliSci theories of PRC governance.",
                "I really enjoyed this course and really felt engaged with the material",
                "a better understanding of China US relations",

                "I learned important skills such as to think on my feet when presented with solid counterarguments to my ideological posture.",
                "I learned a brief history of China in regard to Chinese politics, and gained an understanding of the ideologies and influences at play within Chinese leadership. The course also did a great job at keeping up to date with current events, and applying concepts from the course to further understanding of modern day international politics.",
                "Great intro class to Chinese politics",

                "- I learned a lot about the history of China and the current political debates going on there today",
                "Overview of Chinese history, domestic politics, international politics. Coursework tests your comprehension and ability to analyze readings.",
                "The course provides a comprehensive look at China's ancient and contemporary development, with some \"bumps\" along the way. As with most political science classes, you'll find the readings to be long at times but certainly manageable. The class is nicely structured to hold you accountable to the work you do but also provide flexibility for you to explore the content for yourself and construct your own ideas in the papers.",
                "China",
                "I learned a lot about the Chinese geopolitical structure and relations with the US. there couldn't be a more pertinent time to learn about this and i feel very rewarded in having done so",
                "This course provided a great overview of the history, domestic politics, and international affairs of modern-day China. For a course that covers so much content, I think that Professor Mattingly did a great job giving an overview as well as a deeper look into the complexities of the modern day challenges and successes with the Chinese government. Given current events, the course also adapted to look at the 20th Party Congress and Urumqi/Covid protests as the events broke out, which helped me be able to understand these events in light of China's history/domestic politics/international affairs.",
                "Crash course in the history of china. The organization of Chinese government. Current chinese events. US and Chinese relations.",
                "Important general knowledge on Chinese History, Politics, Culture etc. I really appreciated how there was ample time given to the history as well, so even though I didnt feel like the final simulation tested my knowledge about that section of the course I nevertheless value knowing about it. Skills developed were mostly general reading and close analysis of one or two sources for the response papers.",
                "This course was a very brief overview of Chinese history and politics, with a clearer political focus on the Mao era and some very interesting contemporary developments, such as the 20th Party Congress. Lectures included documentary footage, graphs and data sets, and political concepts, such as the dictator's dilemma and the commitment problem.",
                "I learned about the recent history of China as well as contemporary Chinese politics and international relations.",
                "I learned an overview of Chinas more recent history as well as an intro to their political/economic situation and strategies. Also some current events eg Taiwan situation and Covid handling",
                "I gained a very holistic understanding of Chinese politics.",
                "I learned about the history of China and its politics, as well as how to think critically about current events related to China.",

                "I learnt a lot about China, past and present in lots of depth and areas such as culture, politics, military, history. I feel I have a very well rounded understanding of Chinas rise and furthermore I understand more on current affairs to do with China.",
                "I learned a lot about China and its global connection. This is an excellent course because Prof. Mattingly always makes a point to connect current events to lectures and ensure that we're not just learning about China's rise as a global power but how that affects the current state of the world.",
                "I learned a lot of China's history and importantly how this context is primordial to understanding where the country stands today. The response papers taught me how to think critically about authors' point of view and provide my own opinion using class discussions.",
                "I learned a lot about China's history and how the nation-state has vertically climbed in power over the decades. Before taking this course, I knew absolutely nothing about China, except the US propaganda I receive from the news. However, in taking this course, I feel that I have a fundamental understanding of China and its inner workings.",
                "This course gave me a good overview of Chinese history (with an emphasis on the PRC era), China's domestic political institutions, as well as challenges facing the CCP and potential sources of conflict with other states. I also learned how to write a short response paper to a text, which isn't something I'd explicitly had to do before.",

                "I learned a lot about the political history of China and the power dynamics within the CCP.",
                "A skill that I learnt was the ability to think in the role of a Chinese political leader, which is conducive to understanding how policy decisions are made in the governing of a country. On the more theoretical side, mechanisms behind modes of government were taught.",
                "This course gives a systematic review of the history and recent political issues taking place in China.",
                "I improved my ability to present persuasive arguments to groups of people, and learned how to think analytically about political science issues.",
                "Learned a loooot about the history of China and its current state as it related to the US. I was very engaged throughout the entire course and pleasantly surprised by how interesting the course was."

                "STRENGTHS: well-structured, interesting readings, sections were engaging and not just regurgitating info taught in class, fair distribution of assignments, lots of content covered that ranged across a large amount of time\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: some of the readings toward the end of the semester were quite long, which made it especially difficult to complete them in time for the weekly quizzes on top of an already heightened workload. But overall, they were a reasonable length and quizzes weren't too difficult",
                "Strengths: Prof. Mattingly is great  lectures were engaging and interesting. The final, a crisis simulation, was a very cool way to apply the concepts learned throughout the semester. Overall,  it was a balanced class in terms of workload and reading. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times we ran out of time due to discussion of modern events during lecture. Its awesome to have that relevant discussion but might be helpful to build some cushion time in lectures to account for those discussions.",
                "Its strengths were the engaging material and lectures and structure with quizzes and papers rather than larger exams. There were no glaring weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Professor Mattingly, strong TFs and engaging sections, self paced assignments, interesting final crisis simulation\r\nWeaknesses: literally none. This class is one of my favorites at Yale, and Mattingly is able to make a 200 person lecture have an intimate seminar-style class with opportunities to ask questions, learn from fun guests and officials, and grab lunch with him.",
                "I can't think of a weakness. This was one of my top 3 favorite courses at Yale. The lecturers are very engaging, Prof Mattingly is awesome, the readings were interesting and not too long, and the assignments were relevant.",
                "The strengths of the course are that the workload is manageable, and the readings are engaging. It could be improved by posting class slides. They were sometimes, but when they weren't sometimes it was hard to get all of the information from lecture",
                "LOVED THIS COURSE!! overview of China and its political role in the past, present, and future. The final crisis simulation was a fun and non-stressful way that showed the overall engagement of the course. TAs and Prof Mattingly very accommodating and understanding",
                "Really great progression of the course because first you learn the history, then domestic politics, then international politics. It has a great structure.",
                "I liked that there were multiple components to our grade so that our entire grade did not depend just on the final simulation. I also really loved the final simulation instead of a normal exam, and it was actually enjoyable!",
                "A major strength of Rise of China is how much we are able to cover in a single semester. We learn so much about China in such a short amount of time. This is a great intro class for those not familiar with China, but also a great class for those who have some knowledge.",
                "A lot of debates and the crisis simulation was fun! Readings were long at times and lecture seemed a bit rushed.",
                "The course was very well-taught, and resources were made easily available. I think the largest strength about this course is Professor Mattingly and his lectures as you learn so much through them, and the readings provide helpful supplementary material to strengthen knowledge learned in lecture. There were also incredible guest speakers who had direct ties to political work with China.",

                "I think that the quizzes were not a good evaluation of whether people 1) went to class or 2) did the reading. As a student who always went to class I sometimes felt that I was memorizing things before the mini quizzes, despite learning the material. Also, I think that the crisis simulation should be replaced with a final essay.",
                "I think the studies in the last section of the class, on China's foreign policy, were pretty odd. Would have been more interesting to read case studies, history of the policies, or the policy proposals themselves. \r\n\r\nThat said, I think the lectures and the section design was very strong. The weekly quizzes were a great way to keep me on top of the readings, without too much stress!",
                "Strengths: \r\n- the syllabus allows students to focus on what they are most interested in regarding China \r\n- the amount of information was always right\r\n- the instructor was great and cared to get to know his students even if the course was very big \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- sections were a bit slow",
                "I loved that Professor Mattingly made the content he taught accessible to students with no background knowledge about China. He did a great job of making the course approachable and made the lectures really engaging. At the end of the day, the course workload was low enough that students could have pretty easily gotten away with skipping a lot of the lectures and not doing the readings, but it was actually a pleasure to come to class and to come to section.",
                "Strengths:  The lectures are extremely interesting, and the course is organized in such a way that you are never confused. Every lesson leads up to another lesson, keeping us engaged and learning actively. \r\n\r\nWe also stayed up to date with what was happening MOMENT TO MOMENT in Chinese politics, with lectures covering the Zero-COVID protests, the 20th party congress, and other events, which was incredibly fascinating. It was very interesting to get Professor Mattingly's perspectives on all of these events. The Professor also tied in these events into our lessons very well. \r\n\r\nProfessor Mattingly always leaves enough time to ask questions if you have them! \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures and readings would get unsynced from one another, but only by a lesson or two! This really wasn't a big deal. We had quite a few interesting developments in Chinese politics happen during the course of the semester, so we got off track talking about those (which was a good thing!).",
                "Great discussion sections, amazingly well-structured PowerPoints, readings and lectures. Very rare to see such clear-cut messaging about what we are required to know and then actually being quizzed on those exact things!",
                "The final exam (crisis simulation) was perhaps the most fun assignment I have ever had. I learned a lot from it, and thought it was a brilliant addition to the course.",
                "Strengths include a great lecture.",
                "Strengths: always very engaging, Prof Mattingly is an incredible lecturer, and sections actually felt relevant to the course\r\nWeaknesses: not really much, maybe more guidance with writing at the start of the course?",
                "No weaknesses!",
                "The strength is that the syllabus is very well allocated between different areas of Chinese influence, including the economy, politics, foreign policy, etc.\r\nA weakness is that the material felt too crammed together and rushed in certain lectures.",
                "Strengths: prof mattingly and the TAs, organization of course\r\nCant think of any weaknesses",
                "I think that the lectures were really great and very engaging. It was like coming to a podcast twice a week. Also, probably the first lecture I've ever had at Yale that had a high attendance throughout the whole semester.",
                "Definitely a very interesting section",
                "Strengths: super interesting, sections engaging \r\nWeaknesses: not recorded lectures",
                "Fantastic format and curriculum",
                "This class was so well designed by Professor Mattingly. It was not overly difficult, but still kept me engaged all semester. The grading was set up for you to have success if you kept up with the material. The assignments were relevant, engaging, and doable.",
                "Very organized, with quizzes to test comprehension",
                "This course was fantastic. Professor Mattingly is an engaging lecturer and presented interesting material in a very understandable way. I thought the arc of the course was great, going from China's history to its domestic politics to its place in the international arena.",
                "Strong teacher. No weakness",
                "To me, lectures didnt seem very neutral, it almost seemed to leave very important narratives out that students ended up asking about anyway.",
                "Very well organised with the three parts",
                "My strength would be writing and my weakness would be the weekly quizzes.",
                "Strengths: Straight-forward, informative, well-organized for learning. \r\nWeaknesses: It all feels a little intuitive/expected. There was no fact or opinion in the class that challenged my worldview or revealed any fundamental misunderstanding about China.",
                "Good quality lecture course, professor Mattingly makes himself very accessible to students, readings are very interesting and super insightful. They can be long, but I recommend you read them to get the most out of this course.\r\nWeaknesses--Lectures not particularly in depth",
                "Strengths was the in depth look this course had provided. Tremendous TAs and information in lectures",
                "The class was amazing! The readings and lectures were extremely interesting. I also really enjoyed the discussion sections.",
                "Strengths - prof mattingly is AWESOME. Expert on the topic and clear that hes poured years into researching China. Was able to answer every question well and lectures were very engaging. Weakness - none really. Loved the class all around.",
                "Strengths: it is well organized for learning there is not a ton of work to do, and none of it is confusing or particularly difficult. Lectures are easy to listen to, and the readings are pretty brief and generally interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it is easy to fall off the band wagon and not go to lectures or do readings, but then you end up learning nothing - which is a loss.",
                "I loved the course think it was great",
                "great survey course",
                "This course does not require prior knowledge and gives you a broad grasp of the contemporary rise of China",
                "Loved every aspect of this class",
                "Great professor, great TA!",
                "Lectures were very informative; sections were a great recap of the lectures. The weekly section quizzes also helped me understand the material, but you need to at least skim the readings to get full credit! They probably would've been a little more tricky had I not done the readings (which I think means that we were learning/that the readings were useful!).",
                "Strengths: This course really provides a strong foundation and understanding of Chinese politics, especially for those who are not very familiar with the topic. Lectures are always well organized and insightful, and assigned readings were well thought out, significantly contributing to understanding of the topic for the week. Discussion sections allowed for better clarification of the material. \r\nWeaknesses: I feel as thought it would be a great asset to the course if lectures were recorded and posted on Canvas. This is because each lecture covers a significant amount of information, and missing even one feels penalizing. Even though lecture slides are provided, they tend to have few words as a result of Professor Mattingly's teaching style, and therefore to extract information from by themselves. Additionally, it would be great to ensure that the slides for a lecture are posted on Canvas before it begins.",
                "This was a fantastic class in every aspect. I recommend it to any student at Yale",
                "Because it is a big lecture, it has less room for discussions.  Prof Mattingly is a great instructor.",
                "The material is very current. Sometimes I wish we could spend more time on the modern topics",
                "Super engaging. No weakness",
                "Strengths: material is organized. I enjoyed the structure of the course and how the topics were divided. The readings were relevant and the lectures were interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: The course could have been more engaging. Could have benefitted from weekly discussion posts instead of the canvas quizzes.",
                "I would have more group activities in section.",
                "Strengths are the organization, Mattingly, TFs! no real weaknesses",
                "I found this course to be very interesting without being very stressful. I learned a lot, but because there aren't many assessments, you'll get out what you put in. It would be possible to do a very low-engagement version of the course.",
                "history section felt very crash course and biased - china was communist and thats as bad and then became capitalist and everything was better. discussion of domestic and foreign politics was a lot more nuanced though, was definitely more in the professors wheelhouse, i really learned a lot and gained so much perspective",
                "I think the response paper mode is somewhat flawed because I didnt feel I had enough background knowledge about China to critique the expert papers.",
                "This course is well designed, accessible, and touches a very important topic. I like the structure of the reading response papers. I like the idea of the crisis simulation as well, though the execution is a little difficult.",
                "The lectures were structured really well and made it easy to learn and pay attention. The assignments made sense, though I wish that we had even more freedom to write reading responses based on issues that excited us.",
                "Strengths: excellent lectures, interesting material, appropriate workload\r\nNo major weaknesses",
                "Crisis simulation was an excellent format for the final exam. I really enjoyed all of the lectures as Professor Mattingly is a fantastic teacher.",
                "Strengths: Well-organized, knowledgeable and helpful Professor/TAs, diverse enough to pique anyone's interest.\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of engagement with reading at timescould be improved by using discussion section as a time to discuss the reading alongside major ideas discussed in lecture",
                "Professor",
                "Strengths: course material, professor's level of engagement, guest speakers, \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Few but potentially slowing down a little on the course content. Sometimes its a bit hard to internalize",
                "Strengths: interesting overview of Chinese history",
                "More taiwan talk",
                "I thought that this class was amazing and do not have any suggestions.",
                "Professor Mattingly is great, and I think the structure of the class - i.e. moving from history to domestic politics to foreign policy - is a very natural one to follow. The assignments are pretty well-weighed, I received great feedback from my TF, and the crisis simulation was very fun.",
                "This class is brilliant. Minimum effort, easy to follow, high payoff. Slides were well organized. Readings were relevant. Lectures were crisp and engaging. 10/10 one of my favorite courses Ive taken at yale.",
                "Many strengths of the course. I appreciated the three response papers giving us a chance to explore deeper a few of the readings of our choice, and the crisis simulation final was an enjoyable alternative to the final examinations of my other classes. However, I think the effort to make this course accessible did unfortunately mean I didnt feel pressured to do all the readings and learn as much material as I think would be useful to know later, and I do feel like the fact that after the history section we did not touch upon that knowledge again means I will likely forget a lot of the content.",
                "Strengths: Professor Mattingly is an incredible professor. He structures the class in such a way that the material shines through. Mattingly adds a humorous edge, and a level of seriousness when the specific topic warrants it. He invited some incredible guest speakers. Despite it being a larger lecture, Mattingly made the classroom feel individualized. He regularly made time for students to chime in, both in and out of the classroom. The workload was manageable, and Mattingly's approach to course structure is unique: rather than a few big essays across the semester, we had weekly quizzes, a few response papers, and a final crisis simulation. I learned across a semester rather than cramming a ton of information a week before. Weaknesses: None.",
                "The course was really interesting to me. And Dan Mattingly is really knowledgable about the subject. It was fun to listen to the guest speakers he invited. But sometimes I felt like a lot of the information could be found on a Wikipedia page on China. I'd like to hear more nuanced perspectives on China in today's world, and the Professor's thoughts and the future of China-U.S. relations.",
                "Great survey lecture and great teaching. I would say it was sometimes easy to fall behind because lectures moved pretty fast, but readings/section helped",
                "My TF Grace Lan was arguably one of the best that I've had at Yale.",
                "The lecture was well-organized, and I thought the discussion sections added understanding.",
                "Readings were very good.  Lectures were very good.",
                "The content of the course is extremely engaging. Section could have been organized better to highlight the most important parts of lecture.",
                "insightful and engaging professor who is an expert in what he is teaching",
                "Strengths of the course include its organization (assignments and expectations are clearly communicated, grades are promptly returned, class content is aligned with assessments, the Professor and TFs are accessible), meaningful, useful, and applicable content (I have learned a retained a lot I can use in actual conversations and apply to other classes and how I view the world), and very high entertainment value (Prof. Mattingly is an excellent lecturer who incorporates videos, jokes, and a high tempo to keep things moving, and the final simulation was the first genuinely enjoyable final I've had).\r\n\r\nIf there is a weakness to the course, it is perhaps that it gets off to a slow start because it tries to cover so much of Chinese history so quickly. Stick with it, though, and you will be rewarded ten times over.",
                "lectures were good, but moved a little fast. Section was very good, I had lots of fun in a smaller, slower paced classroom",
                "I very much enjoyed the class and cannot think of any weaknesses. I think the quizzes were great as they forced us to have a good understanding of the readings and of the lectures before going into section and the section were also very important to better understanding and going beyond class material.",
                "I love that each lecture specifically covers a concept and that there are slides and videos to accompany each lecture. Though there was a lot of reading, I really appreciated the selections for each week because it really helped me gain a deeper understanding of the concepts I was learning. The only thing I would improve is the lighting in the lecture room. I am super excited to attend class but at times a feel a little sleepy because the lights are off.",
                "I found the history portion to be the weakest part of the course, and I say this as someone who adores history. The attempt to cover all of Chinese history inevitably meant that the first few thousand years got incredibly short shrift. I get that the goal is to just give a broad overview of it, but anyone who has a basic knowledge of Chinese history won't get much out of it. I did, however, enjoy the post-Mao history because I was less familiar with it and we slowed down and went more in depth.\r\n\r\nI also really enjoyed how this course responded to current events. When a major event happened, like the 20th Party Congress or the Urumqi fire, we would cover it in class and relate it to what we've been studying.",
                "Builds great foundation, very easy class, barely any work",
                "Strengths: content was extremely interesting; lots of good discussions of current events (especially after the November protests); fair grading & timely feedback\r\nWeaknesses: sections could have been more engaging -- I wish we could've talked more about the readings and done less group activities",
                "A strength of this course is definitely the very engaging lecture series taught by the professor. A weakness would be perhaps a lack of coordination between the lecture and the dissuasion sections.",
                "The course is very well organized. But I do hope the quiz part can be modified in some way. I think people may have different opinions towards a certain issue, and it woud be nice to welcome more opinions in the multiple choice options.",
                "Strengths: The format of the class: lectures + discussion sections with weekly quizzes to test knowledge. The class was structured to help students learn. The final simulation was very fun."

                "ABSOLUTELY. Given how China is increasingly becoming a player on the geopolitical stage, I believe everyone should be well-versed in the nation's history and politics. This course is an excellent primer in all things China that would provide anyone with a strong baseline from which to understand China's position in the world. Further, Prof. Mattingly is an excellent professor! Take this course. You'll learn a lot, laugh a lot, and enjoy it!",
                "Yes! 100%",
                "Absolutely. I'm an East Asian Studies student, but I even learned things I never knew about Chinese history and politics. This course is especially great if you are only familiar with ancient or Mao-era China (which most Chinese history classes focus on) because it gives you modern context related to present issues. I'd recommend to non-social science students as well because it doesn't require knowledge of political theory or statistics but does a good job of explaining them when they come up. The assignments aren't too bad either, and you can choose the weeks you write your response papers. The final simulation was a bit underwhelming in terms of excitement/engagement but was a nice close to the semester and better than an exam just regurgitating info. Overall, great class!",
                "Yes - this class is a great introduction to Chinese politics that informs policymakers in the U.S. and around the world. A fascinating introduction to the CCPs rise.",
                "no",
                "Yes! This is an excellent course for anyone looking to gain a strong foundational understanding of Chinese history and politics. The course was well organized for student learning and the great was not difficult, which made it not at all stressful.",
                "Yes, absolutely!",
                "Absolutely. I took this class for its relevance, and stayed for the fabulous professor and TF team. I absolutely loved this class, where if you do the readings and are engaged in the content, you will do great.",
                "Absolutely, this was one of my favorite courses at Yale. If you want a crash course in Chinese history and politics, you won't find a better way to get it than this course.",
                "I definitely would. I think Chinese politics is a topic not well understood and taught very well throughout this class. The workload is also manageable.",
                "Course was excellent - definitely would consider it a must-take during your time here at Yale",
                "absolutely!! take this course. learn about china in a fun, non-stressful and creative way",
                "Yes.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Both the lecture material and readings were usually pretty interesting, and the course covers so many aspects of China that anyone will be able to find something that is interesting to them. It is not a lot of work while also being enjoyable.",

                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely. Whatever your major, this course is amazing in learning about China and its rise to power. This is one of my favorite classes I have ever taken at Yale. There are also a variety of assignments, including a crisis simulation as the final exam rather than a typical essay, which I thought was more enjoyable than writing a lengthy paper.",
                "Yes the class content was very interesting and the papers as well as the simulation at the end, was helpful in the process of sorting through all of the information presented to us.",
                "Definitely!! Professor Mattingly is an amazing professor and lecture is so interesting.",
                "Great class for someone interested in China that doesn't want to be overburdened with work!",
                "Yes! China is such an important region to learn about, and this course provides a great survey framework to do so. The course is not too challenging and allows students to really enjoy learning about China.",
                "Yes take this class. This class is awesome. Prof Mattingly is one of the best lecturers at yale. There wasn't a single day where I felt bored. Everything was super interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course to all majors at Yale. China is a really important country to be learning about at the moment, and we are lucky to have the chance to learn about it from such a great professor in a really approachable format. I am not a history/poli sci/global major, but I still gleaned a ton of knowledge from the class without having to put in much work.",
                "If you have any interest in Chinese politics or Chinese political history, I would ABSOLUTELY recommend you take this course. Even if you already have a solid background in Chinese political studies, this is definitely an interesting course to take and you will learn something. If you know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about Chinese politics, this is still a great class to take: the professor does an amazing job setting up the course in such a way that it is easy to understand and every lesson leads into the next lesson. This is an incredibly interesting class! It's also not particularly difficult, with only a few critical response papers and weekly quizzes in section (which are incredibly easy, and you just need to have done the readings even partly and have gone to lecture).",
                "Yes! Especially if you don't have a strong background in the study of China and its place in the world, this is a wonderful place to start. The lectures give you a good overview of everything and remain topical every week.",
                "Totally! Just be aware that the reading responses require thoughtful analysis.",
                "Absolutely would recommend - it's a great course, you'll learn a ton, and there isn't a ton of work.",
                "Absolutely! Knowing about China is key if you want to be engaged with politics on a global level",
                "Yes!! The course material is super interesting and offers a more nuanced understanding into China and the CCP.",
                "Yes! Fantastic course that provides a comprehensive overview of China's place in the modern world. Professor Mattingly is a compelling lecturer, and the team of TFS were equally lovely to work with.",
                "I would totally recommend this class for any student interested in beginning to develop a deeper understanding of Chinese history, economy, and politics.",

                "Most definitely. Professor Mattingly crushed it.",
                "I would, as I believe Professor Mattingly deconstructed the history and politics of China through lectures extremely well, and each of the readings were also very intellectually stimulating.",
                "Definitely!",
                "Yes. Great teacher and interesting content.",

                "Yes, if you want to learn about China this is an introductory friendly lecture.",
                "Definitely - its hugely important to learn about the rise of china",
                "Yes, the content is unique and the workload is not overwhelming.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student looking for a fun, easy, straight-forward social science credit. I would not recommend it to someone looking to gain some unique perspective on China.",
                "Yes",
                "100%. This course is paramount to understand not only Chinese politics, but also the politics of our own country and the overall political landscape of the world.",
                "Yes! I think it is a really important class since China is a big player in today's politics. I learned a lot about China and what their impact is in today's global power dynamics.",
                "Absolutely. Everyone should take a class on china",
                "Yes! This course was great and Professor Mattinglys lectures are clear and to the point",
                "If you want a genuinely easy and pretty interesting class (assuming you are not already a China expert), then absolutely take this class. In terms of ratio of effort given to knowledge gained to grade received, it is basically impossible to beat this class. Its a very solid course that does not occupy you very much outside of lecture/section time what more is there to like? Also, lots of fun memes about Chinese leaders like Deng, Jiang, and Hu. Take the class with a buddy or two if you can makes the whole experience very fun. Overall, an absolute recommendation from me.",
                "Yes the material was very interesting",
                "yes. very good surgery of china",
                "I would highly highly recommend. I wish Yale had more courses like this on more topics.",

                "Yes, Engaging lecture and sections were quite interesting. Relevant topic and Mattingly kept us up to date in a cool way. Brought in some really interesting speakers.",
                "Yes! I learned a lot and it's an interesting course for someone who has not studied much about China before.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! Prof Mattingly was really engaging and was always willing to talk to his students at office hours, answer last min logistical emails (he was really accommodating when I had to miss a class for a religious holiday), etc. I thought it was a great social science thatif you're good at writing short reading responsesisn't a ton of work. And the final was one of the most interesting/engaging finals I've taken at Yale (it was a 2-hour crisis simulation with your section).",
                "Yes, this is an amazing course that I believe every Yale student should take to further their own understanding of the current world around them. As China's influence on the world stage grows larger and larger, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to its current state and its actions.",
                "A must-take class for anyone interested in politics or China. It's a class with a minimal workload, but you can still learn a lot. The readings are very interesting, and Professor Mattingly is a great professor!",
                "Yes! This was a great class that I felt perfectly balanced being both intellectually stimulating while also being less stressful in terms of workload.",
                "China is the key strategic issue for the West in the 21st century. This class was a great way for anyone - regardless of background - to learn about China. I wish every student at Yale would take this class to have a better understanding of current affairs.",
                "Yes! If youre interested in China and dont know where to start, this is the course for you!",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes. Favorite class at Yale so far",
                "Absolutely. Especially if you want a very broad overview of Chinese history so you can assess current affairs. There's not that much work and you'll learn a lot.",
                "If you are a poli sci major I work definitely recommend this course",
                "1000%! one of the best courses I've ever taken",
                "Yes! This course is interesting without being stressful.",
                "yeah low workload and very fun",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about China.",
                "Absolutely. The topic is something everyone should know about, and the course is easy to follow and not too hard without being too easy.",
                "Hands down yes! I think any Yale student, especially PLSC students, should have a general sense of what's going on in China and how the US is responding to its rise. The knowledge you gain from the class helps contextualize US-China relations. Plus lectures are really engaging and Mattingly is awesome.",
                "Yes, so long as you are interested in the topic area this is almost certainly a good course for you to take. Interesting, fairly easy, and engaging.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, regardless of their prior background on China.",
                "Yes, it's a relatively easy but thought-provoking class, which can be a hard balance to strike at times. The Professor and TAs are extremely helpful, which allows your success to depend on your level of effort alone.",
                "This is a great course for you regardless of if you're a first-semester first-year or a second-semester senior.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! great class and on a subject you absolutely need to Learn about. US china relations are the future and spending time learning about them couldn't be more important.",
                "Yes, very valuable insight into chinese history and politics",
                "Yes! I would recommend this course to any student that is interested in China. Professor Mattingly is an amazing lecturer and incredibly engaging, and the readings for this class were wonderful. There were also a couple really interesting guest lecturers like Rush Doshi.",
                "Yes! Whether you have a background in political science or not, or any background with Chinese history / politics or not, this course is awesome. Great balance of understanding the past to inform our view of the present. I know now that I really didn't have a clear perception as to what politics / life is like in China today, and this course definitely provided me with that.",
                "Yes, I would.",
                "Yes. Yes 100x. No matter what your major is, take this course. Not only do I think that a class on chinese policy / relations should be mandatory for every student, but this class truly stands out as one of the yale gems. Minimal effort is required to excel and get a lot out of the class, so it makes a perfect 5th or 6th classeven for a STEM major. Course organization is crisp and easy to follow. Slides are rich and helpful. Lectures are engaging and crystal clear. Definitely one of my favorite classes Ive taken at yaletake it please!!",
                "Yes, if they are interested in East Asian history, culture, or politics. The class is definitely accessible for those without prior knowledge such as me, and although the initial list of readings may be daunting I think that getting the general impression of each topic was the main focus which I think anyone can achieve. I do think this course is also useful if someone want some practice at social sciences writing and discussion.",
                "Yes and yes. Whatever background you have in Chinese history, there is a place for you to learn and develop political thinking skills. These are transferrable and valuable to any other political science, global, or history class. I have loved this class!",
                "Yes!",
                "Yeah. It's interesting. Not too much work.",
                "yes. great class on Chinese politics.",
                "I would, if you are interested in China at all and looking for a good, pretty broad lecture.",
                "Easily. Great course that covers the history of CHina and its current affairs. Would not have learned so many cool things without this class",
                "Yes, this course is a great introduction to international relations and Chinese politics.",
                "Yes!! This was my favorite class of the semester. I learned a lot and was always engaged. Definitely take this if you want to gain an excellent understanding of Chinese history and politics.",
                "Yes.  I learned so much.",
                "Yes. LOVE Professor Mattingly.",
                "Yes. If you are interested at all in China you will love it. I was engaged in lectures and actually wanted to do the readings the entire semester.",
                "Absolutely. It has changed my perspective on China and its political regime. All material is presented in an impartial matter and it allows you to come to your own conclusions about China. You should take this course if you want to learn more about Chinas political system and history.",
                "This is an absolute must-take. You learn real-world, applicable, relevant things about China, and it's such a fun class. Lectures are quick, clean, and upbeat, assessments are not stressful or overly difficult, and the simulation and sections are lots of fun. Absolutely no complaints here.",
                "Yes, it gives a good intro to understanding China without being too demanding or difficult. A good chance to learn without the pressure of doing badly in the class",
                "Yes! Take it--it's not super demanding but you learn a lot out of it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, if you are interested in Chinese history and Chineses politics. I went into the course not knowing much about the country's history and the course really opened my eyes to this part of the world that plays a very important role in today's politics and economy. The workload is very manageable and as long as you do most of the readings and go to lecture you will do well in the class.",
                "Of course! I think if someone knows nothing about China, this is the perfect course to gain a basic understanding of the nation and politics.",
                "Yes. I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in China or geopolitics generally.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in understanding China better, it's a fantastic course - though sometimes covers basic things that you might already know if you've studied China before",
                "Yes! Professor Mattingly is a great professor and you will learn a lot.",
                "Yes! This course will give you a much more nuanced understanding of Chinese politics. It's also an interesting time to take a course on China. Prof Mattingly did an excellent job incorporating current events into lectures.",
                "Yes if you are generally interested in China.",
                "Yes! Please take this class, regardless of your major/area of study. You will learn a lot."
