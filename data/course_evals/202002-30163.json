   "comments": [
    "Very straightforward course. Quizzes and exams were fair. I definitely gained a lot of knowledge from this course.",
    "I thought it was a great course all around.",
    "Personally, I enjoyed watching recorded lectures because it allowed me to go at my own pace and was just about as interactive as a normal, big lecture. I liked how students were assigned questions in the discussion sections, and I honestly don't think that anything could have improved the experience.",
    "The information that we learned was really interesting and gone over very clearly. Using more than one example was really helpful. It would have been nice if he had a review session available or at least a prerecorded one because of the density of information delivered to us in such a short time. \r\n\r\nI also didn't particularly like the socratic method used during sections because even though I was prepared, I was so on edge that I might have to answer the next question that I had a hard time focusing on what other students were saying.",
    "The course was very organized and made logical sense as you progressed through topics.",
    "Fantastic professor, fantastic TA, super interesting, accessible, and applicable material.",
    "The lectures were engaging and discussion sections were helpful for making sure that I understood everything.  One thing that could be improved would be to clarify how some questions were worded on exams or assignments because they were not always clear.",
    "The material was very engaging and easy to understand but started to seem repetitive.",
    "Strengths: the quality of teaching\r\nWeaknesses: technical difficulties with online schooling can be a challenge"

    "Yes. It is a great way to learn about rational decision making. It might even open up your eyes to some irrationalities that exist in your own life.",
    "Yes, it is an interesting summer course to take.",
    "I think that students who would like to take an introductory psychology class and\/or are trying to meet a distributional requirement will enjoy this class. The material is interesting and Professor Ahn makes it engaging with her great lecturing.",
    "Yes! Definitely! It was such a good class. I learned so many interesting things and it really changed my perspectives on all kinds of different topics related to thinking. I feel like I understand other people and myself on a whole deeper level now!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You learn a lot of interesting material and Professor Ahn is an amazing lecturer and makes the class engaging.",
    "Yes, 100%!",
    "Yes, it was a very fun class with engaging lectures.  I learned a lot and it wasn't too stressful, which was nice.",
