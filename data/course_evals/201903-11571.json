   "comments": [
    "The ability to compare the foreign policies of various Middle Eastern countries and disentangle the media coverage on events in the region.",
    "This course will bring you up-to-date on most affairs in the Middle East. I recommend it for anyone, even without the slightest knowledge of the Middle East. Now news stories make sense!",
    "What international relations was and how it applied and related to the Middle East. Very great overview of the Middle East\/North Africa region's history and current politics. If you are looking for a course that gives you a brief overview with good coverage about MENA, this is the course for you!",
    "I learned international theory, about the history and evolution of Middle Eastern countries, how they developed into what they are now.",
    "I learned a lot about the history (from early 1900s-present) of the countries in the Middle East\/North Africa, as well as the political and economic factors that influence the region and all of the conflicts that are impacting it today, why everything is happening, and what can be done going forward.",
    "I came into the course already knowing most of the IR theories and the introductory Middle East content, and what I found rewarding was that professor Lotito managed to explain very complex interconnected topics really simply but accurately. That will be helpful to me. I also found some of his readings really interesting -- he has some on theories of military-civil relations in the Middle East and those were new to me and I found them very rewarding.",
    "I have a cursory understanding of international dynamics in the Middle East.",
    "I am more aware of issues in the middle east and can better think about and talk about current issues in the Middle East, but my main takeaway is that the Middle East is complicated and confusing. This is no fault of the class, which was well-taught, but a result of the topic being so vast and encompassing many issues that are hard to resolve.",
    "This course gave a very broad, generalized overview of some international relations concepts and case studies of some Middle Eastern countries. There was nothing original offered by this course material compared to other introductory Middle East courses. With the large scope of the class, little depth or insight was offered, leaving most lectures feeling like the first paragraph of Wikipedia pages on the Middle East. The only skills offered in this class were how to continue a long academic tradition of learning very little about the Middle East, yet pretending to be an expert when writing exam essays or a policy memo.",
    "I learned more about the social, political, religious, and economic environments of Middle Eastern countries, both historically and currently.",
    "Learned about basic international relations theory and its applications to case studies of different states in the Middle East. Gained foundational insight on very important current conflicts.",
    "I learned about the past and current affairs in the Middle East.",
    "This course gave a very comprehensive but informative review of the modern and current affairs of the Middle East. I feel that I learned so much about the region in so little time.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of the middle East and the modern State system. Amazing class.",
    "Skills: understanding and applying IR theory to case studies in the middle east, comparing and contrasting patterns of development in different countries, political economy\r\nInsight: understanding full impact of Western intervention, leadership, and oil on ME",
    "This class was supposed to supplement Middle East politics with international relation concepts. It served as an adequate introduction to neither.",
    "Its a survey class of the Middle EastI learned a lot about almost all countries (we did not focus on some countries) but not in-depth.",
    "I learned an overview of politics and international relations in the Middle East.  Insights included the nature and impact of American \/ European involvement and also the future of Middle East economies.",
    "I developed a basic knowledge of Middle Eastern history and its contribution to current policy issues regarding the area. I also learned to critically read source material through its potential bias.",
    "Broad knowledge about different issues that countries in the middle east are dealing with currently.",
    "Fundamental IR concepts, the historical development and current situation of each Middle Eastern and North African country, international relations and foreign policy of these countries.",
    "As a result of this course, I am now able to contextualize the history of the Middle East and North Africa and how it affects the region's current foreign affairs.",
    "I gained a much better understanding of the complexities of the Middle East.",
    "I learned to critically think about the Middle East and its relations with other countries in the region and other nations across the globe",
    "In this course you'll learn the basics of Middle Eastern politics and its modern international system, it offers a comprehensive view of the region and its most important players.",
    "I learned a lot about the recent history of many Middle Eastern countries, as well as their current situations both internally and regarding international relations.",
    "I learned a lot about international relations of the Middle East and historical and political events. I also learned how to read articles of multiple perspectives, and evaluate my own opinions.",
    "History of Middle East, a bit of intro to International Relations, how these concepts applied to the Middle Eastern conflicts of the past and of today.",
    "This course gave me insight into the conflicts and cultural tensions that shape the modern Middle East today. The course was a nice overview of the history of MENA from the Ottoman Empire to individual country conflicts.",
    "Great overview of the recent history of the Middle East and the current state of the region regarding foreign policy issues.",
    "I learned a lot about the Middle East and the conflicts and politics of the region. It made reading the news about the Middle East very interesting.",
    "I thought I got a really good baseline knowledge of the subject being taught."

   "comments": [
    "The lectures are comprehensive and enjoyable and elaborate on the readings in a concrete way. More engagement between students and TA's would be helpful.",
    "One of the strengths is the way in which it is taught. I really liked that we covered important international relations concepts in the first half of the course and then went more in depth about specific countries in the second half. The course was extremely well organized and engaging, as Professor Lotito is a really great lecturer. While I really enjoyed that this was a highly interactive lecture, I felt that at times, questions from students took up too much time from the lecture.",
    "Lotito is an effective lecturer. Dana is an incredible TA.",
    "This course was great! At times the readings were dry but that's to be expected when learning from international relations experts\/political scientists. Professor's lectures were amazing and clear and the TAs were also very helpful.",
    "Strengths - structure of the course, Professor Lotito, the material. Overall a really great class. Only weakness was that there was a lot of reading - sometimes supplemented and helped understand lecture concepts, but it was a lot and not always necessary. I found myself cramming all the readings before the midterm and final (but that's on me).",
    "The professor was a great lecturer and never failed to explain his concepts effectively. I learned a lot in this class about a topic that I did not know much about.",
    "The course was definitely very thorough in explaining concepts, and was incredibly well-taught -- complicated concepts were explained simply, and the lectures and slides were always very helpful. I also liked how there was often a lot of time reserved throughout the lecture for us to ask questions, which made the class a lot more engaging. The format of the class was also very helpful, as we started out with basic history and concepts in the first half of the semester and then moved onto specific case studies in the second half, after we had enough basic knowledge of the concepts to discuss them in a more in-depth level. Sometimes, however, I felt that the class was a little too oversimplified, and we didn't get to delve into the complexities of the region as much as I would've liked because we were spending too much time on basic facts that were likely background knowledge to many in the class.",
    "Strengths:\r\n-everything explained clearly, concisely, and in a highly organized format\r\n-readings were kept brief, but they were useful, supplemented course material, and brought in new ideas and ways of thinking that were very rewarding",
    "It was extremely basic. If you read the news on a regular basis you know the majority of the content of this course.",
    "The slides were helpful, and the lectures were engaging. \r\n\r\nThe class went at such a fast pace it was kind of hard to keep track of stuff since we flipped between countries so fast. \r\n\r\nI think the essay we wrote should be worth a greater proportion of our grade.",
    "This class is quite frankly a waste of a course to be offered. There is simply no way that one of the most dynamic, ancient, and heterogenous regions could possibly be explained through an IR lens within the duration of one semester. While introductory courses are important, it is actually counter-productive to offer such a course that presents so little deep or insightful knowledge or history about the region. There was too much to be covered to where everything missed substantial information. The IR concepts covered were interesting and to the extent that it was meant to at least be an IR class, it did the job on some basic, introductory level. However it does not seem that it was useful to front load the class with all theory, and then present \"case studies\" of classes without really making clear connections to the previously aforementioned theories. There was overall, such little insight or nuance in anything that was presented such that everything seemed one sided or had a clear cut view. It seemed promising at first to have a lecture on Orientalism, however the curriculum of the class simply faded into being complicit with all of the charges that Edward Said makes against the West: making the East something simultaneously obscure and foreign yet also able to be dissected and picked apart, hundreds of years of history compiled into a 12 week semester, making a monolithic beast out of a diverse region.",
    "The strength is its accessibility. I knew nearly nothing about IR of the Middle East until this course, but, still, I learned a tremendous amount and rarely felt out of place.\r\n\r\nThe greatest weakness is the structure. There are several interesting readings, but they are rarely unpacked in class and are certainly unnecessary for the tests. This is compounded by the lack of updated material in the course. This class is more of a history of the Middle East class than IR.",
    "This class should have section. There are too many readings that go undiscussed all semester for there to be any motivation to actually do them. I think students would also benefit from discussing the material in smaller groups and getting to know their TA better throughout the semester because they are responsible for grading literally everything.",
    "Strengths: very welcoming of all backgrounds of IR or Middle East preparation, engaging professor and interesting lectures. Weaknesses: due to its effort to cover a large region with all its happenings, it was naturally a little more surface level than a more focused class would have been. The main paper of the class was a policy memo but we were not expected to write in the form of a memo and therefore did not learn about policy memos and how they are written.",
    "This course was taught in a clear, engaging, and thoughtful manner.",
    "I was looking forward to the readings every week, they were really interesting and gave a great overview of the situation in the region. The structure of the course was also great",
    "The strengths are that the content is really awesome but the lecture was very early and there was not as much in-class participation by students as I would have expected or wanted. Lectures sometimes seemed a little biased.",
    "It was taught very well sometimes the lectures were repetitions of the readings.",
    "Weaknesses: no section, having a section would allow for more robust discussion of the readings",
    "This was an impersonal lecture course with far more weaknesses than strengths. As someone with a fairly sound background in the Middle East, I consider Professor Lotito's teaching to be extremely flawed. He left out key information about the region, framed information with a strong political bias, and chose to actually misrepresent facts when he just didn't know them (e.g. Napoleon decided to invade Egypt in 1798 \"for no reason\"). Students received virtually no feedback throughout the semester and the only writing assignment was a bizarre \"case study memo\" that did very little to help students demonstrate their learning. This class failed entirely in its purpose to provide students with a background of the Middle East.",
    "Strengths: important course that teaches the basics of often considered complicated issues in the Misdle East. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: even though the professor tried to be as unbiased as he could, the course was not free of oriental opinions and biases toward Israel.",
    "You learn about themes that connect different countries in international relations, but dont go too in depth into specific countries.  Probably more a product of international relations than the class.",
    "Strengths: Engaging and informative lectures that covers a vast amount of material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Few opportunities to engage with the information we learn outside of class and synthesize it.",
    "I thought that the TAs were not very helpful in the course. It was odd that there was one TA who was just a grader. It often felt like when you had questions there was not much help in the course. Also, given that there were no sections for the course, it would have been good to have a few review sessions because the readings were relied on a lot for the assessments. In addition, I thought the grading on the assignments was pretty unclear.",
    "The material presented is all very important. Because there's so much relevant information in the area you sort of get a bit of everything.",
    "Professor Lotito is an amazing lecturer. I love the size and pace of the class.  For me, the strength was the first part of the class, which centered around IR concepts when talking about MENA countries. The second part was case studies of each country, which I found less interesting. Tying each lecture of the second part of the course back to the IR concepts would be helpful. In this way, each lecture isn't simply an overview of a country.",
    "The lectures of this course are very dynamic, and I think Professor Lotito effectively employed additional materials (like videos and news articles) when relevant.",
    "I found the content very interesting.",
    "Strengths: great intro course to learning about the history and current status of MENA (Middle East North Africa) nations\r\nWeakness: taught in a VERY western manner so please take more classes concerning the MENA region. The class seems very western in the way they view the consequences of and purposes for revolution and how one views various political and social structures",
    "It is a great introductory course for students who have never studied the Middle East before. I would not recommend it for those who have previously taken courses on the region. The course also includes some foundational IR frameworks that help you analyze the content of the course more thoroughly.",
    "The strengths are that the workload for most of the semester is relatively low, and for the one paper, you have the freedom to write about whatever interests you. One weakness is that the grading differs drastically depending on your grader. On the midterm exam, I lost many more points than another student with more or less the same answers (on the identifications), so I had to change the course to Credit\/D\/Fail. Unfortunately the professors policy of regrading is that you must first give a reason, and then he regrades all parts of the exam and can potentially lower your overall grade.",
    "Overall, this course is extremely well organized and does a very good job in teaching what it is supposed to--IR of the Middle East. The professor covers all the standard points of being a good professor, which unfortunately is very rare to find--all of the material is very well organized into powerpoints and sections, there is a standardized amount of interesting reading to do each week, the professor holds regular office hours and is approachable and available, the classes are interesting and well-taught, and combine lecture, discussion, videos\/media, and critical thinking well, and the exams and grading are fair and standardized\/transparent. Overall, was a very interesting and useful class. \r\n\r\nSome recommendations for improvement--this was an introductory course, but it would have been interesting to have had a once a week, TF-led section to encourage critical thinking and further discussion. Furthermore, we didn't really get feedback on our writing, which makes sense due to the size of the class, but it would have been nice to have more TFs to grade our memo papers and get more detailed feedback, so we're not just writing for the sake of writing, but writing to improve. \r\n\r\nI have one last point to add. Despite my praise of this course, I was also highly critical. International relations taught at an American university is bound to be biased. When doing my own research of IR of the Middle East events, I found that the way we were taught, especially surrounding Palestine, very much emphasized certain aspects and deemphasized others. I believe that in training the next generation of leaders and government officials, it's important to have a social justice-minded and humanitarian curriculum, regardless of the subject. This last comment might be dismissed as an overly liberal opinion that would bias the course--however, in choosing to teach the course centering certain narratives over others, the course is already extremely biased, and shouldn't pretend to be otherwise. Looking at events from an Arab or Middle East perspective would also be useful, instead of encouraging an America-centric mindset, that students of IR should look at the rest of the world as an opportunity to profit and gain. This is also a critique of international relations as a field of study. Students' responses in class sometimes shocked me with their ruthlessness, in seeing other countries as only a means for American political gain (I see that this is the point of IR, but I feel that students should be taught compassion as well). Also, this class is not a critical theory course, and should stay an IR class, but I still feel that it's important for students to know that the Middle East is not just a place of violence and war. In learning IR, we obviously focus on wars and political events, but for students who've had no other experience with the Middle East, I feel that it is critically important to preface the class with the fact that this is only a small segment of what the Middle East and North Africa is really like. This comment box isn't large enough to elaborate, and I know some of these comments are vague, but to give just a brief example, when speaking about Palestine, the statistics for the number of Jewish settlers is a statistic from 1946, I believe, after a time when Jewish settlers had already begun to increase. If a statistic is shown from the late 1800s, before the influx of Jewish settlers, the percentage of Palestinians is greater. This shows a small way that the course can bias students into thinking that colonialism is alright, because in 1946 there were already many Jewish settlers in Palestine, when in reality this was part of a greater plan. Like I said, there are better examples, but I've run out of space.",
    "Strengths: great lectures\r\nWeaknesses: early morning, lots of reading with very little discussions \/ lectures related to the readings",
    "This course is fascinating and well-taught, though the lectures could end up being pretty jam-packed with information. It might be helpful to have a discussion section for this course to go over the material!",
    "The readings are much more engaging than the readings of other classes I've taken. Some of kinda dry (eg the economy readings), but the majority are really interesting. I sometimes felt that the lectures were too surface level and boring, but this is in part because this class was at 9am and I was tired and that there is so much to cover that the class cannot be too in depth. Also, Lotito made a good effort in making the lectures interesting, and I particularly liked when he added a video to the lecture. I really liked that all of the readings and all of the lecture notes are online. Lotito has a no-electronics policy, but I wish I could've written notes on my iPad since its not distracting like a laptop. Lotito office hours are really helpful and Lotito is always happy to answer questions (in office hours or after class), though I wish the office hours slots were more than 15 mins and he had more of them (though I didn't hav much of an issue getting office hours times by booking a day to two in advance). I also think the midterm was graded particularly harshly and the final was graded very very leniently. I also wished I got more feedback on my case study essay because I spent a lot of time on it.",
    "I really liked the lectures and the teachers openness to questions. For an introduction course I really liked it."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Great course to get a sense of the MENA.",
    "Any student interested in Middle East without having prior experience in studying the region would benefit greatly from this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is taught in a very engaging manner and it is extremely interesting overall. While it does help to have background in international relations concepts, Professor Lotito explains all of the necessary concepts very well so it is also perfect as someone's first class in international relations or in the Middle East.",
    "Yep. Great PoliSci course. Even if you know nothing about the Middle East.",
    "YES! Everyone should take at least one course on the Middle East at least once in their career at Yale because the region is so important to American foreign policy and politics. This is a great introductory class.",
    "Absolutely!! Middle Eastern politics can get really confusing - before entering the course I did not really understand what was happening in the region even though it's extremely relevant and important in the world today. I got a great understanding of what's happening on the ground now, how it came to be that way, and historical factors that have altered their trajectory. It was a 9 AM, but I rarely ever complained about it because it was such an outstanding class that I honestly didn't mind.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student for its manageable workload, really great professor, and interesting topics and discussions in the class.",
    "Yes -- this class was very interesting and great for anyone who wants to learn more about the Middle East (especially if you don't know a lot about the region to begin with). One thing to bear in mind is that attendance is taken at pretty much every class (and factored into your grade) so be warned, but in my opinion it was worth it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend both for the person who knows all the topics on the syllabus going in and the student learning for the first time. I fell into the former category, but I found the readings gave a new perspective or discussed new angles and ways of thinking; I could fully appreciate them and their implications because I had an extremely solid foundation going in. For students who are learning from scratch, the professor is incredibly clear, concise, and responsive to questions; you will learn about very complicated material in a very clear and easy way.",
    "Not really. If you read the news you'll be set.",
    "I would recommend this to another student interested in the Middle East, but I probably wouldn't recommend it to just anyone.",
    "Absolutely not. If you are interested in taking a class on the Middle East, shop one with a curriculum that is mindful of its limitations, yet tries to carefully cover important aspects of  the region. If your first class on the Middle East is through an IR\/political science lens, you are doing yourself a disservice and tricking yourself into thinking that such historically imperial and Orientalist techniques provided an unbiased and accurate history of the region. You could learn everything that was taught in this course (and more) by going through a few Wikipedia pages, maybe a news article or two. There are many other classes that would provide a more in-depth analysis. If anything, do not take any introductory\/survey Middle East class in general, there are other ways to go about studying the region that does not need to be at the introductory elve.",
    "I would recommend this class to students interested in the history of the Middle East, or to students that want basic background information. I would not recommend this to students interested in the intricacies of current Middle Eastern crises, like the refugee crisis in Syria.  This class is designed for students that do not know much about the Middle East, so more informed students may not learn much.",
    "Yes- super interesting.",
    "If you are looking for a basic course on the Middle East, this is a good one to take especially if you don't have that much former preparation in the area. If you are into political science and IR or global affairs as a field of study however, definitely take other IR and Middle East classes instead of or in addition to this one because while it was comprehensive the subject matter wasn't treated in very much depth (which is normal, a lot of topics for only one semester)",
    "I highly recommend this course. The subject matter as well as the way in which it is taught combine to create an amazing class.",
    "Would definitely recommend - the readings are great, lectures are engaging, workload is manageable. Take it if you're looking to learn something new, whether it's in any way related to your major or not",
    "I would still definitely recommend this class, it is very informative.",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend this class. Learned an enormous amount.",
    "No! This class provided students with incredibly biased and inaccurate information. From the standpoint of quality of learning, students interacted with material very little except for a handful of bizarre readings that Professor Lotito accumulated that only tangentially related to the course material. This was genuinely a bad class. It failed to teach either about the Middle East or about international relations concepts.",
    "Yes, if youre interested in the Middle East at all but are not sure where to startthis is the course to take!",
    "Definitely, an interesting and informative course on an extremely relevant and important topic.  Deals both with security and social issues that have continuously evolved since the independence of Middle Eastern countries.",
    "Absolutely; this course is an effective whirlwind tour of both political science and the Middle East\/North African areas.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class as it was my first attempt to study topics pertaining to the Middle East and I believe I learned a good amount.",
    "I highly recommend. I learned so much about international relations in the Middle East, or just the MENA region in general in terms of how the countries developed differently, how religion and ethnicity play into politics and foreign policy, and other IR concepts important to the region. If you're interested in the Middle East, take this class. If you're interested in IR, take this class. If you're interested in both, this is the perfect class for you.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a student seeking a general, survey course about the history and politics of the Middle East and North Africa.",
    "I would if you want a survey course and to come away well versed in the subject material.",
    "Yes! HOWEVER PLEASE take more classes (especially seminars) if you want to learn more about the Middle East because this class used a VERY western perspective, so try to take classes taught by professors from the region or know more about the perspective of those living in the Middle East",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking for a comprehensive look into Middle Eastern politics.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in getting a solid background on recent Middle Eastern history and a good foundation of international relations of the Middle East. If you are only interested in a couple of countries, you might be bored most of the time, but Lotito is a pretty good lecturer, and you could find some of the countries you know little about actually very fascinating.",
    "Yes, definitely. See above.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who was interested in the Middle East \/ hopefully rather passionate about the topics covered.",
    "Yes! This course was engaging and well-taught. The subject matter was interesting and relevant. I would highly recommend it!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who doesn't know a ton about middle eastern politics and wants a quality and balanced overview of the region. I'm a STEM major and I really enjoyed the course. This course is also great for people who are naturally curious because they can read in depth on each topic and ask Lotito more in-depth questions than is covered in class.",
    "Yes, if the student was looking for more of an introduction. I thought it was a great general overview."
