                "Strengths are the supportive community. Going to class was just a great way to end each week and it was really nice to be part of such a supportive group. Other strengths were the group discussions we had at the end of some classes. It was a great way to put our experience into words and hear what everyone's journey has been. Also, Professor Burns was very supportive of everyone and made the classroom feel open and safe! One weakness is pace. The first half of the class felt very slow and tedious, but was probably necessary  in order to gain everything we did in the second half of the class. You gotta trust the process.",

It is such a privilege to be taught by someone who not only cares so much about their craft, but cares about educating those who also intend to pursue the craft. I feel like there was much knowledge and wisdom to be gained.",
                "Yes! Taking this course with Professor Burns was a learning experience I didn't know I needed. While I didn't necessarily feel like I was challenged as an actor in this class, I feel like I was able to really settle into who I am as a performer and learn how I bring what I have to the table in every performance. These lessons are just as important to grow as a person and actor, and is something that is definitely lacking in the rest of Yale theater. I feel so much more confident in myself after this course and feel like I gained a mindset that will be extremely helpful as I move forward in my acting career. Take this course!",
                "Most definitely! No matter how much experience you have in theater, this is the class to learn about yourself and performance."
