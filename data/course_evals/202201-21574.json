Truly a gem of the Spanish department.\r\n\r\nThis course's weakness was student engagement. I truly think that a no laptops/iPads and an attendance policy would really improve student interaction. It's not that we don't find the course material interesting, it's that the temptation of screens is really hard to ignore. If it helps justify her decision, included below is a study that verifies the benefits of screen free note-taking for attention and memory.\r\n\r\nThe Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard: Advantages of Longhand Over Laptop Note Taking by Pam A.
