                "This course effectively built on the fundamentals of economics covered in Intro Micro to teach macroeconomic concepts. Not only did I learn the basic ideas and models of macroeconomics, but I was able to see and understand the relevance of those topics to real-world events and headlines.",
                "I learned a lot about overall measurements of a country's economy, as well as where each country stands relative to the others. I also developed a better understanding of correlations, as well as what to consider before establishing a causal relationship.",
                "I learned the basics of macroeconomics, including topics like inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, economic development theories, and aggregate supply and demand. My takeaways are a combination of formulas, theories, and knowledge about where to find quality economic data.",
                "I learned basic macroeconomics: AS-AD model, Solow Model, basics of the U.S. banking system, GDP, labor market, free trade, inflation, and more! More broadly, I learned important context for understanding how the world works; why some countries are rich while others are poor; and about the benefits and drawbacks of certain policies.",
                "My favorite course this semester! I have learned enough of the basics to understand what is how banks work, how and why money is created, why trade is actually better than autarky, how interest rates work, etc.",
                "Basic macroeconomic frameworks for supply/demand and labor/capital/credit market analysis.",
                "I gained insight into conducting macroeconomic analysis. Having taken intro micro beforehand, I was able to combine my knowledge of micro and macro to gain an overall picture of the economic landscape. As an econ major, I will be continuing my studies at the intermediate level.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Hawkins' lectures are very engaging, communicating the content while demonstrating the importance of what we are learning. The in-class discussion element of the class forces you to be actively thinking about the concepts, and the professor is able to address individual questions and concerns through built-in class time. Office hours were also a great resource for answering p-set questions or whenever you want to gain a deeper understanding of some topic covered in class. Weaknesses: the discussion/Q+A periods during the lecture could often get dragged out, and while they were sometimes helpful to everyone, they could cause the class to get behind, leaving some topics to be covered only very briefly.",
                "This class was very organized, provided a broad introduction to macroeconomics, and was taught by a great professor. In terms of weaknesses, it would have been helpful to receive feedback on the problem sets. It also would be nice to have some sort of optional extra worksheet or assignment to make sure you're on track. I felt like I didn't receive a complete understanding of the class material until I completed the practice exams, and it became a bit overwhelming.",
                "The course had clear expectations and made good use of slides and chalkboard graphs. It drew a lot of information from the Federal Reserve Economic Data site. The worksheets were useful to emphasize important points but did not take too long to complete. The problem sets were challenging and usually required clarifications in office hours, but they were great preparation for the midterm and the final. While I did enjoy the project, I would have put it at another point in the class because working on it took away time from studying for the final exam.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hawkins is excellent. He held a review session for us on a Saturday (!) and held two during reading week. He had office hours at multiple convenient times during the week. He always responded quickly to questions on the Ed Discussion Board. I really got the feeling that he cared about teaching. The slideshows were helpful, and I liked the Pset/worksheet setup. I also appreciated that I could look at the solutions after the fact to see where I went wrong. Weaknesses: None come to mind.",
                "I don't think this course has any weaknesses because even if there were any weaknesses, Professor Hawkins would take an effort and improve upon any negative feedback. I think the strongest side of this course is that it is offered in a seminar format -- you get a chance to talk econ to one of the best economists at the university AND you get a chance to get engage with your peers and become good friends with them. I learned a lot during the course, and I always came motivated to learn in each class.",
                "Worksheets were a great accountability metric to see if you understood the material.",
                "Strengths: The small class size allows for frequent opportunities to ask questions during class and engage with the professor. It is also very well structured.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of.",
                "Better summary of the content since it can be very broad",
                "Prof Hawkins is AMAZING. His slides are clear and comprehensive. The worksheets/ psets are very reasonable and office hrs are super helpful. The exams too arent trying to trick you and Hawkins even tells you what questions in prior exams are fair game (which is very helpful for studying).\r\nIf anything I wish he was a little more concise when speaking (but if you concentrate its all helpful)",
                "The psets ensured that I gained more than a surface-level understanding of complex subjects while the worksheets tested basic understanding of simple concepts. It is a new combination for me, but one that was extremely effective and made my learning so much more enjoyable. \r\nI had all of the resources I needed, and Prof. Hawkins is one of the best lecturers in any subject that I have ever taken. \r\nI wish that a bit of political economics was taught. Learning about communism, which has had a huge impact on the economies of countries around the world and throughout history is important and necessary I feel.",

                "I would recommend this class to any student who wants the opportunity to interact directly with the professor and your classmates when learning economics; I found this setup to be much more beneficial than the lecture format of 116.",
                "Yes I would. It is a manageable course that also teaches you so much valuable information about the U.S. and about the world as a whole. I often find myself relating the content we learned in this course to ideas regarding real wages and inflation that I encounter in my day-to-day life. It's definitely a very worthwhile class, and I find myself significantly more interested by macroeconomics than I was prior to taking the course. I would recommend this class to any student, regardless of their major.",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed this class. The concepts were challenging, but between in-class questions and office hours, they always became clear by the end. It is certainly a class that requires more engagement than the lecture, but I feel that it is worth it. As a note, I would recommend starting on the psets earlier whenever possible, since the amount of time they will take on a given week can vary.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Professor Hawkins is an amazing teacher. He's funny and engaging, and I always left class feeling like I learned a lot. He is also extremely accessible for questions, and he always takes the time to give you a thorough answer. I also think the stuff I learned in macroeconomics is directly applicable to the real world. It helps me better understand the news and how the world works. This class helped me decide to major in Econ.",
                "Absolutely. If you actually want to learn econ, the seminar format with Hawkins must be (have not taken the lecture) better than the lecture. Plus, you receive clear feedback and if you have any questions, Hawkins is ready to discuss them with you.",
                "Yes, even if not an econ major.",
                "Yes, for both econ and non-econ majors. The skills and insights one gains in this course are invaluable for understanding the economy at-large and provides an excellent complement to the fine details of microeconomics. The material from this class can be applied to everyday life in one's analysis of the macro-economy and global markets.",
                "Yes i would if they would love to deeply discuss Macroeconomics",
                "Yes! Take it with Hawkins! The slides are clear and comprehensive. The worksheets/ psets really do reinforce the material and office hrs are super helpful. The exams too arent trying to trick you and Hawkins even tells you what questions in prior exams are fair game (which is very helpful for studying).",
                "Yes yes yes! This course gave me a strong foundation in many concepts necessary to understand and be engaged in popular economic discourse and understand the economic policies that affect our everyday lives.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in economics. The material is topical and presented in an engaging way, and it is consistently challenging."
