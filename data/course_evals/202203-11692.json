I learned a lot about formulating a strong argument and understanding the core of a problem.",

I really enjoyed hearing Prof. Jaynes' advice in class on how to write strong assignments and how to think about what exactly the question is asking. It was good that discussions were free and open to take any direction, but I also believe that they could have benefited from a little bit more structure.",

                "Yes, very engaging and stimulating senior seminar with a professor who is individually also a very interesting and kind person."
