    "Strengths: letting people do research for credit is a great idea!\r\nCons: more guidance and feedback on the presentations and final reports would be ideal. Being able to present one's work is very important as a scientist, be the course provides no help for how to go about putting these documents together.",
    "I think this course was ran well as it is.",
    "I wish there had been more clarity in how the grading was going to work or what the final grade distribution would look like. It's obviously tough to grade research projects since it's so subjective.",
    "It's good the way it is",
    "I think it is a fine format, though it may be nice to get a bit more feedback on the first and second papers we turned in."

    "Independent research just depends on the PI you choose and the amount of time you are willing to put into it. Don't expect to accomplish an incredible amount (you will probably only work on it like 8 hours a week), but you can definitely lay the foundation for a larger project.",
    "If you are interested in doing research definitely take this class.",
    "Good course for doing research! Being in 472 will force you to come regularly into lab and work on a stable project. I suggest choosing an advisor who will meet with you regularly, as this helped a lot for me.",
    "The most important part of this course is choosing the right advisor. Make sure you take the time to choose a good advisor at the beginning of the semester",
    "Definitely take this course if you are a Physics major and have a good lab.",
    "This is the course you take to complete the thesis requirement. The course itself isn't hard, but you put 10-15 hrs a week into working on your thesis."
