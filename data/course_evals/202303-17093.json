                "Strengths: Dr. Fan is a treasure and a sweet guy. Not to mention he is on the forefront of the field and taking his class is a privilege. The class is super chill and you get out what you put in. Super interesting/cutting edge content. \r\nWeaknesses: Besides the 2 assignments and coding lectures, there is little to force you to be engaged. Many students were in the class to fulfill a requirement with a low workload class, while only a small handful were deeply engaged with the material. The coding labs could also be more hands on.",
                "Strengths: I enjoyed having the guest speakers. The TAs were extremely helpful. The computational labs were great. The papers were interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very disorganized, it was unclear until the final week of the course exactly how grading works.",

The topics selected were also important, since they are currently hot topics in research. We were able to use many powerful packages and even see one that has not been released for public use yet. Weaknesses: There weren't many assignments, so there were few opportunities to practice what we learned in class. Therefore this course relied on self-motivation to get the most out of the class."

Unlike other classes, there aren't long coding PSETs or assignments to make sure you read the papers. However, if you do, you'll realize how insanely cool some of these techniques are and how much of an evolving frontier this is. Most of the techniques you learn about have either been developed in the last 10 years or, some of the later ones, are being developed as you learn about them. If you're looking for a super easy blow-off class where you learn nothing, this could also be the class for you although that's a bit disrespectful to the professor.",

As someone who does imaging-based spatial biology, this course was very interesting and helpful to me. The teaching team was also very knowledgeable. Just note that you must be self-motivated to learn to get the most of this course, since there are few assignments to hold you accountable.",
