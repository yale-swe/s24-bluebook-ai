                "Strengths: incredibly hands on--much of the semester is spent in the darkroom. Adrian was an amazing TA and super involved with our class. Lisa was also really enthusiastic about the subject matter and was fun to learn from.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we had a ton of guest artist lectures, which were incredible opportunities but pushed back the speed with which we were able to get into the darkroom and feel confident working independently. Wish we had had more time earlier on so it didn't feel so rushed towards the end of the semester",
                "You get a lot of exposure to art photographers and their work while still have class time in the dark room to receive hands on help from the professor, and the class is pretty flexible overall.",
                "Strengths are the courses design. The weekly assignments really taught us how to hone our artistic eye. Weaknesses are the schedule. It was really cool to hear from amazing photographers throughout the semester, but it meant that our crits were weirdly spaced out.",
                "n\/a; perfect course",
                "This course had so many wonderful speakers and I had access to so many incredible resources. One issue is that the student is responsible for purchasing all equipment which can become quite expensive.",
                "We had a lot of guest lecturers! This means you get exposure to high level photography, which you wouldn't get in most intro-level art classes. Very fast-paced. The printing portion of the class was particularly fast-paced."

                "If you're at all interested in film photography, you should 100% take this! It's certainly a time commitment, so don't take it in your busiest semester. But its a level of artistic freedom you're unlikely to get at Yale very often",
                "Absolutely! Its a fun course thats challenging in a different way than PSet or essay classes.",
                "Yes! Fascinating",
                "Yes! Its an amazing class were you learn a wonderful creative new artistic skill. But be warned, its not a gut. You will have to spend hours in the darkroom. Despite the heavy workload, the course was well worth it.",
                "yes, highly highly recommend this course",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to someone else. It helped develop my understanding of photography and also changed my way of seeing the world around me. I learned so much about the technicalities of the developing and printing process.",
                "yes! it was my favorite. intro black and white is such an engaging course and you learn so much from it. it all depends on how much time you are willing to put in",
                "Yes~ If you want to get into photography, this is the class for you. But even though it's a popular class with a long waitlist, only take the class if you know you'll have the time to commit to it. Otherwise, it'll be needlessly stressful."
