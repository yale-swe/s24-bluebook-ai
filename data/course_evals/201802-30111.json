    "Get the opportunity to appreciate modern theater plays\r\nLearn to observe theater arts in a more systematic and organized way",
    "I have developed better skills at close reading and academic writing. Also was able to access some of the most recent texts in the theatre world.",
    "Have a clear mind about the purposes of authors\r\nrecent common topics among theater\r\nrecent novelty forms of dramas",
    "Before I take this course, I merely know nothing about theater, especially contemporary theater. It is by spending one months reading plays and watching their productions that help me to learn the nature of theater, as well as understand how philosophical thinking is important to both creating a play and analyzing it. I really appreciate that Marc can allow us to do lots of reasoning and other philosophical analyzing, because it helps me to practice my skill of expressing and writing.",
    "I have learned how to analyze different types of plays from various perspectives such as the production perspective and the stage design perspective etc. Additionally I have learned how to deeply appreciate those scripts through relating it to culture and politics",
    "I read so many good scripts that the professor recommend, and learned a lot about American culture and improved my writing skills.",
    "I developed the knowledge of appreciating a play from more aspects."

   "comments": [
    "The contents and book lists are well-organized and fascinating!\r\nGreat to have the chance to go to theater in NYC together.",
    "My strength was responding to the texts we read or videos we watched. And my weakness is in writing. It could be improved with a more extensive writing tutor, but I doubt if its accessible in summer.",
    "I think one of the strengths of the course is that the readings load is huge. Only by having enough knowledge of different kinds of plays that we can start to have our own understanding. Also, I really enjoy the discussions we have in class, because it is great to hear how other people think about the play and to learn a new perspective. \r\nI would not say it as a weakness, but I have to say that a pure three hour discussion could make me feel tired and drowsy sometime, because all the discussions are intellectual challenging. (But I still enjoy participating in it anyway. )",
    "It's very good, no weaknesses."

    "Definitely!\r\nProf. Robinson is super nice and patient with all our discussion and ideas. It is an excellent chance to get a glimpse of contemporary American theater and many pieces on the list are so impressive and enlightening!",
    "Yes. I think it is a great chance to see what is being produced at this time in theatre.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to other students. First, if you are interesting in theater and drama, then this would be an excellent opportunity to learn more about contemporary theater, and to be able to get touch with the nature of theater. Second, if you are fond of challenging yourself, than the discussion will be a great chance for you to deepen your thought.",
    "Yesbecause this course will teach students more about analyzing things deeply and how to write strong argument.",
    "Yes, it's a good course, and the professor is really good and helpful.",
    "Yes, especially for students who are interested in theater and play."
