                "This course teaches you the most important techniques and practices to employ in order to become and effective leader. We learn about listening, developing a shared pool of meaning, asking power questions, intellectual and emotional humility, and gratitude. We use each to test their efficacy and refine the skills for us to use in our everyday lives. We learn how to speak more captivatingly, listen more empathetically, and relate more intimately.",
                "A lot of what I learned in this course deals with the very important skill of communication. I learned how to be more conscious of how I communicate. I learned how to listen to understand, rather than reply. I also learned how to SHOW that I'm listening. I learned how to ask good questions that draw out the best in other people. I learned how to navigate the thorniest of conversations while remaining both completely honest AND respectful. I learned how to be a better public speaker. I learned how to be a better writer through adhering to Peter's writing rules. All of these skills don't just help you be a more smooth communicator, but also help you learn from others and be a more empathetic and supportive partner, teammate, friend, and family member. In addition to these communication skills, I also learned just important life skills like how to experience and express gratitude through keeping a gratitude journal and writing a gratitude letter to someone and giving it to them. Through class readings but also through Peter conducting the class, I learned how to create spaces for people to open up and be honest and vulnerable. Peter even taught us very practical skills like how to do a handshake, how to conduct yourself at a networking event, and how to hold a microphone. The best part was that we all got to practice these in class. It's hard to believe that there's even more that this class taught me that I haven't written down. But in sum, this class has not only taught me how to be a better teammate and leader, but a better friend, family member, partner, and human being. It has made me less cynical. I learned that almost everyone has good reasons for doing things and incredible stories to share, if only we're willing to listen.",
                "This reinforced interpersonal skills with a research-based approach to the best ways to interact with other humans.",
                "This was a fantastic class. We all grew extremely close as a class, with Peter and each other, and learn from each other constantly. Specifically, we developed ways to make people feel psychologically safe and comfortable, stage presence (with an added section on zoom interviews), listening to others and letting them voice their thoughts, and being valuable contributors in teams. We also developed more concise writing through a series of writing rules.",
                "What didn't I learn in this course! I learned how to ask power questions, listen, present effectively, write succinctly, and more.",
                "Leadership behaviours and skills that go beyond positional authority. A key area is effective communication (interpersonal and group, written, and oral presentation skills), geared towards building strong relationships and trust. \r\n\r\nInstructor Peter Bensinger chiefly led by example of how to foster a trusting and constructive learning environment.",
                "We learned the practical tools of leadership, from holding crucial conversations to listening empathically. We put these skills into practice through conversations with friends, peers, family members, and colleagues.",
                "This was an incredible course that outlined clear behaviors we can take to be good leaders. It covered how to listen effectively, have crucial conversations, give feedback, speak publically, practice gratitude, and develop countless other skills. The class also gave assignments where we had to practice these skills in the real world, ingraining these leadership behaviors in our daily lives.",
                "Developed active listening skills, storytelling abilities, capacity for gratitude, public speaking skills, emotional intelligence, giving and receiving feedback, and a sense for psychological safety by taking this course.",
                "This course taught me more about myself than any other class at Yale. I built concrete skills like active listening, conflict meditation, and effectively expressing gratitude. My writing also improved tremendously. I have seen the concrete positives impacts of this class in my leadership roles, relationships, and self-image.",
                "Not only did this class teach me how to be a better leader, it helped me become a better person. Not only did we cover the breadth of literature related to leadership, the experiential nature of the class as a workshop allowed the entire cohort to develop close relationships. I learned how to become a better listener, how to handle conflict in personal and professional relationships, and how to hold myself accountable to my own goals. This class encouraged deep reflection which I will carry long beyond college."

            "comments": [
                "Very applicable and experiential. Unlike any other course I've taken at Yale.",
                "The strengths of the course was the range of topics covered and the students in the classroom who employed the topics in their everyday lives and then were vulnerable with the class to share their experiences. The course could be improved by eliminating the busy work from the assignments. The work is already a high stakes endeavor. And you cannot participate in the course if you do not do the assigned readings. But when there are responses that are merely meant to prove whether or not you have done the readings, the reading can easily transition from retaining the information to searching for the answers. This process goes against everything the course stands for.",
                "The course has endless strengths but it can be summed up in one word: Peter. Peter is the best instructor I've ever had. He cares and invests so much in each and every student in the class. He scheduled at least three office hours with each student to get to know us on a deep level, check in with us, and offer support in any way he can. Since we had 20 students in the class, he held at least 60 office hours over the course of the semester! And this isn't even his day job! I've never seen a professor invest so much in a course. After all of the one-on-one time we spent together, Peter was able to teach me things about myself (like my strengths) that I had never even known. He gave us detailed feedback on every one of our assignments (even the weekly reading responses!) because he wanted to help us learn. He organized class so thoughtfully and not a single minute in class or doing work for the class felt wasted. For the first few weeks, he printed us all name tags so that we wouldn't awkwardly forget our classmates' names when it inevitably happened. He assigned us seats randomly for every class so that we wouldn't feel anxious about where we were going to sit and to get to know each other better. While it seems like every class syllabus touts inclusivity, Peter is the only instructor I've ever had to make class feel like a truly safe space. Throughout the semester, I felt like I could be my whole, vulnerable self in front of my classmates and be accepted and celebrated for who I am, even when I made mistakes. I can go on and on; the point is that Peter is the best teacher I've ever had. He not only fostered deep relationships with every one of his students, but was also masterful at creating an environment in which we could foster deep relationships with each other. At the end of the course, I felt like I had made a mentor and friends for life.",
                "The strength is the radically different integrated format of the course. There was a combination of literature review and then practice of the skill. It was like a lecture and lab combined into a seminar environment.  Weakness was the inclusion of readings that were not used in their entirety yet assigned for completion. The course was also more aimed at interpersonal tact rather than actively leading.",
                "I think Peter is a massive strength. He did countless little things which added up to make the whole experience of the course extremely special. The syllabus is available before signing up, so you know about some of the more challenging tasks and know what you're signing up for. But crucially, lots of the work of this class isn't formal academic work, but real life implementation. So you don't just think of someone you're deeply grateful to, but you actively deliver them a letter (or email). This makes the material a lot more valuable and real, and is something you can take beyond the class. \r\nI can't think of any proper weaknesses with the course.",
                "Strengths: Peter!! the people in the class, great readings, engaging assignments, and the class was my favorite part of the week \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "-\tCombination of practical in-class exercises and group discussion, such that we can learn from each other and begin the formation of closer bonds. \r\n-\tThe comradery and friendship fostered between students \r\n-\tTrust and care from the instructor \r\n-\tImmersion in the material and in the class culture; from introducing ourselves most classes to playing our pump-up songs - Ive never looked forward to a class so much \r\n\r\nI cannot think of any ways this course could be improved. My only input from personal experience of getting through the heavier weeks of reading (while writing two theses) is that audiobooks can be helpful!",
                "This course was probably the best I have taken in my time at Yale, and should be a required course for all Yale seniors. This is among the most practical classes I've taken in my time here. The course material is extraordinarily relevant (how to give/get feedback, how to write concisely, how to listen to others). I actually liked the writing rules, though I may be in the minority there. But they helped me become a better writer. Peter is an incredible teacher and leader. He invests so deeply in all of his students and curates a class environment in which everyone feels they can be authentic and vulnerable. He draws out personal stories from each of us, not by pressuring us to share our life stories, but by creating a culture in which sharing is acceptable. Every student in this class feels special, and that's due to Peter. I became close friends with many students in the class because of the environment that Peter created for us. Peter embodies the leadership characteristics he teaches, so we get to see the success of those leadership strategies up front. Happy retirement, Peter!!\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of is that the handouts he gave were sometimes a little disorganized and difficult to follow. But that's a formatting issue more than anything else. Also, it would have been nice to have more regular assessments/discussion of the readings to make sure we understood it all.",
                "This course was phenomenal. Peter went out of his way to make this course as engaging and effective as possible. From little things like mixing up our morning exercise each day to organizing a mid-course feedback session to see how we were doing, Peter curated a class that was truly designed to meet our needs. If it is not clear already, the biggest strength of this course is Peter. He exhibited a steadfast dedication to ALL of his students in a way that I have never seen before at Yale. Moreover, the syllabus of the course is curated to truly help you develop leadership behaviors. I felt like I was able to leave the class with a clear knowledge of how I can be a better leader as well as a better person. This course has changed me for the better. It only has strengths.",
                "Strengths of the course include Peter's care for each of his students and his enthusiasm for the material. Peter practiced what he taught, and this made it easy for all students to engage with the course. Peter also did a great job of giving every student the space to speak in large group discussions, which created an inclusive environment. We all appreciated the laying out of name cards before each class and the warm-up exercises that allowed us to get to know one another well. \r\n\r\nOne suggestion to improve the course is to allow a few minutes for discussions about the readings. I appreciated the one-page responses because they made me focus on the readings, but I think having the space to discuss the readings as a class would be beneficial.",
                "This class pushes you out of your comfort zone in a way that feels scary yet supported. You have to be ready to jump in completely. Sometimes it felt like there were too many assignments but honestly that buy-in to the course helped me get a lot out of it."

It has taught me practical skills that has made me a better leader, teammate, friend, family member, and human being that I will use for the rest of my life. Using the skills the class has taught me has already made my relationships so much richer. I will miss this class, Peter, and my classmates so much, and when I look back on my time at Yale, I know that this class will be one of the experiences I cherish the most.",
                "Yes.  To students that want to learn more about themselves and how to re-evaluate their ability to interact with others in a positive manner. But know it is not exactly a class on how to lead. It is a class on how to behave in a way that is conducive to working with people.",
                "100%, yes, without question yes. It's unlike any other class I've taken at Yale, and every week I looked forward to meeting. Office hours with Peter were amazing and he could not have been more committed to us as a class or more helpful outside of class. The real life implementation of the class (some of which was assigned, some was not) had a profound positive impact on my semester, and I've grown very close with a lot of the class, almost none of whom I knew at the start. Don't be sceptical about whether this is an academic class - honestly it's a life class, and it'll be more valuable than almost anything else you could take.",
                "One hundred and ten percent! This course actually changed my life and was the best course I have ever taken at Yaleby far. Peter really cares about your learning, he assembles an incredible group of people, and you are constantly growing. The assignments push you outside your comfort zone.",
                "Absolutely  I already have. I believe the skills learned in this course are integral to anyone hoping to improve relationships and become a leader. I also believe that this material should be taught to every student at Yale. However, it is Peter Bensingers care for each student that brings the material to life and makes the course as transformative as it is.",
                "If you get into this class, take it. The students are great, Peter is one-of-a-kind, and the skills you gain from this class will serve you far more in life than any other class you might take at Yale. This is an exceptional experience from start to finish, and you will find a real home each week in this class.",
                "YES. When I say this class changed my life, I am not exaggerating. Every week I was forced to get out of my comfort zone and practice being a better leader. Peter is kind, thoughtful, generous with his time, and dedicated to fully teaching this course. It has been my favorite class at Yale, and there is simply no other course like it.",
                "I highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in improving interpersonal skills and developing their leadership skills. This was my favorite course I've taken at Yale because of Peter's instruction, enthusiasm, and support for his students. I got to know my classmates well, which is very rare in a lot of classes. Overall, this was a great experience and I'm so glad I got to be a part of this course.",
                "Absolutely. This is the best class I have taken at Yale. An absolute must.",
                "Yes, absolutely, If you can get in you should take this class. You are guaranteed to walk out with a better understanding of yourself as well as new meaningful relationships with the cohort around you. Also, I would recommend that anyone who gets a chance to get to know Peter take that wonderful opportunity."
