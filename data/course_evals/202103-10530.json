The course focuses mainly on analyzing how writers talk about music, but the skills we learned can be used to analyze any theme.\r\n2. Select evidence and secondary sources to support said thesis.\r\n3. Get a deeper understanding of many ways writers talk or use music in their texts, whether they describe the music, use it as a theme, or a symbol for something else.\r\n4. How to peer review essays and provide valuable feedback.",

I experienced quite a bit of important literature/authors that I had never read before; I also learned an incredible amount of music & literature related information not just from Professor Skorupa, but also from the other students in the course.",
                "The class provides an extensive introduction to the world of music and its interplay with literature across different genres and forms. I got to read, analyze, and discuss classic authors such as Toni Morisson and Proust, while also listening to a variety of different composers. From the writing component of the class, I learnt how to approach three different styles of academic papers pertinent to literature, which I was grateful for as I hadn't been introduced to academic writing in my high-school curriculum. Overall, this class was immensely satisfying for me, as I went in wanting to explore both music and literature in detail, and Professor Skorupa's discussions accomplished that very well."

                "The strengths of this course were the professor, the exposure to literature and space to talk about it in a comparative way, and the small class size with lots of field trips.  If I were to mention one weakness about this class, it would probably be the mandatory movie screenings. I LOVED the movie screenings as a concept but many of the films we watched were violent and included depictions of sexual violence, or other potentially upsetting themes, and we weren't given any sort of content warning. My class bonded a lot during these movie screenings, and I loved them as a feature of the class, but if you are worried that you might be made uncomfortable/upset/unsettled, or otherwise disturbed by content relating to those things, you may want to look up information about the movies ahead of time to make sure that you are prepared.",
                "Strengths: very fun course, lots of interesting stories and texts, fun little writing assignments to keep us engaged, great class camaraderie\r\nWeaknesses: The curriculum could use an update. Most of the texts we read about the connection between literature and music were about classical music and French/German (and some other European) literature, and the few texts that we read written by people of color were not the core of the class (\"Sonny's Blues\" was in the \"intro week\"; we didn't discuss \"The Second Bakery Attack\" in class at all because we spent all of the class talking about the other readings for the week, Thomas Mann's \"Tristan\" as well as a very long letter Baudelaire wrote to Richard Wagner; Toni Morrison's Jazz was during the final week of classes, which was fun but meant we didn't have the option of writing any of our essays about it, so it felt like a token/bonus text). I wish we read a more diverse range of texts (same with the weekly movies)",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The weekly reader's responses are engaging and progressively help you improve your close reading skills.\r\n- The professor is flexible when it comes to office hours and is always willing to help out with the essays or assignments\r\n- I found the material we read very interesting, making it easier to go through it even on hectic weeks.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The workload can vary week to week, especially when an essay is due. There were weeks where we had to revise a paper, read and annotate a book, and write one or two weekly responses, while there were weeks where we only had to write one reader's response. It made it a bit hard to plan too much in advance how much time to dedicate to the class.\r\n- The time it sometimes took the professor to grade the papers made it hard to know what we had to improve before handing in the next essay.",
                "The course was taught and organized really well and Professor Skorupa is great. Sometimes I felt overwhelmed by the workload, though, and the amount of reading I had to do didn't seem that necessary.",
                "This course does have interesting units and the class usually fosters good discussions. This class also naturally had a tight bond, which made some of the difficulty in the work and reading worth doing. I would say, however, that I didn't look clearly in the syllabus, and I slowly came to realize that the movies, readings, musicians, and most of the work we read in class were heavily European. I do appreciate learning about this part of the musical canon, but I would have appreciated more than only about two authors of color in the curriculum, both at the beginning and end. However, there were many delightful strengths that gave the class life, such as a big trip to New York and the trips to museums and Yale resources.",
                "The strength of the class were certainly the discussions with my classmates shepherded by Professor Skorupa. I had an amazing, amazing set of classmates in the seminar, equipped with differing varieties of backgrounds and experience with music to fuel debate and discussion about the texts we discussed. The range of texts we read was quite nice, covering a wide swathe of well-known authors. I would, however, add that a large number of the authors we read were French, German, or American, but that \"bias\" was actually a result of Professor Skorupa being a polyglot who was able to analyze those texts in much greater detail. We watched a movie every few weeks on a specified movie night, and these were some of my favorite parts of the class--not solely because of the films, but also because we got to interact with each other outside of class. Likewise, the class involved engaging with multiple different forms of art (music, sculptures/paintings at the YUAG and the Met, opera at the Met Opera, and of course, literature)\r\n\r\nTwo semi-weaknesses of the class might be the heavy workload and Professor Skorupa's strict grading rubric: there were occasionally upwards of 20-30 pages of reading due between classes (within the same week) so it did get a tiny bit hectic if you tried to analyze every text/poem (whilst also attending the weekly movie nights.)"

                "YES YES YES TAKE IT PLEASE! This course is incredible for so many reasons. If you are at all interested in classical music, this is a perfect class for you to take as a writing credit and as a first seminar. It is really engaging to be able to talk with people about things that you are passionate about. Prof. S is also amazing at giving feedback and very understanding. She has high expectations, but it's fine because she helps you meet them. My class had so many inside jokes and fun experinces- you get to take a trip to New York to see the Met! You also get exposure to some amazing works of literature and get to look at them from an interesting perspective. First-year seminars are amazing because of community, and everyone should take one, but this one was a particularly amazing introduction to Yale.",
                "Yes, it's a very interesting and fun course, and I learned a lot especially about writing. The professor gives great, detailed feedback. The workload is higher than my other courses but usually manageable, except sometimes when we have a lot of reading assigned Monday, due Wednesday, and we also have a Tuesday night movie (usually takes two hours). Course is also pretty Eurocentric.",
                "If you enjoy writing about literature and are involved in anything related to music or the arts, I would highly recommend this class. The material we read is exciting, and the professor complements it with movie nights, visits to the YUAG, visits to the library, not to mention the trip to the MET Opera at the end of the semester. Don't let the writing credit intimidate you. The class doesn't have as many papers as other classes, and the professor gives extensive feedback for the first version of an essay so you can improve it as much as possible for the second version.",
                "The course content was interesting and the professor teaches well and is really nice. It might be really hard for you if you're not interested in reading and writing or not that good at it, since this is a very demanding course and you'll have to spend a lot of time outside of class on it.",
                "I would, but not without telling the student about the curriculum and difficulty. It's a great class, but the payoff of working hard in it probably won't be greater than the difficulty if they are not exclusively interested in classical music.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! This was a class that I was excited to attend every Monday and Wednesday: the students were genuinely absorbed in the course material, our discussions and debates were fantastic and thought provoking, and the rapport that Professor Skorupa has with her students has not been met by any of my other professors. The field trips we took (especially to the Met) were exciting and fun, and I think many of the students will continue to be friends after the course has ended.",
                "I would recommend this class to any student interested in learning more about music or literature, regardless of whether they have a lot of prior experience in either of the two fields. It is possible to succeed in the class and to learn a lot, whilst improving your writing, without being a virtuoso musician, or without being an amazing writer, or not being a musician at all. You do need to commit to the workload of the class and put in effort, which Professor Skorupa does recognize."
