                "I learned to engage with different historical and contemporary sources and corroborate their information to examine change and continuity over time in topics relating to the senses. The final research paper is a good introduction to writing a college research paper, and familiarizes you with Yale's library system. However, I did not feel like I learned very much content that I will take with me after the course.",
                "This course gave me the skills to look at science from a historical perspective rather than a purely scientific one. I also learned how to apply my understanding of readings to everyday life and discussions, as well as synthesize complex arguments.",
                "A new perspective into the subjective sensory world, and gained cool experiences from the weekly class field trips",
                "The course covered a comprehensive history of the senses with a focus on their impact on scientific discovery. More specifically, this seminar investigated the body's role in gathering and understanding knowledge.",
                "I learned how to engage effectively in a group discussion, not just to showcase my own opinions but to gain insight from my peers. I also learned a lot about how to navigate the research process and stay accountable on large-scale, long-term projects.",
                "I gained a greater insight in how history is written and analyzed. This class showed me many ways in which how we view history may be a little misguided because of voices that were silenced through our own senses."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths- Most weeks, you spend one class period on a field trip or sensory exploration. We went to the Yale Farm, visited an anechoic chamber, and had a cheese tasting. That was the biggest highlight of the course. Professor Ramalingam is also really nice. I really appreciated her attitude in every class session. Weaknesses- The readings are dense and not super interesting. We read a lot of long, scholarly articles which were boring and just hard to get through. They took a lot of time on the weekends. However, you only had to do readings for Monday's class, because Wednesdays were field trip days.",
                "Strengths: Professor Ramalingam was very receptive of the feedback from her students, often adjusting the reading assignments to make them more manageable. She also provides very good feedback on your writing, even though there are few writing assignments overall.\r\nWeaknesses: The content is not the most interesting unless you want to learn about the social and cultural perceptions of the senses. The title of the course is a little deceiving because we do not explore very much science, but talk about how science has changed.",
                "This courses main strength was its format. Rather than just reading and discussing work there were many hands on opportunities to explore topics which is very rare for a humanities course. I feel as this made the course very engaging. One weakness is that sometimes some of the readings assigned were long and repetitive or it was hard to understand in relation to the overall guiding questions of the week.",
                "Readings could have been on more engaging topics that inspired deeper discussion",
                "The course would take weekly field trips to different spots around campus. These were always super fun and engaging. Our discussions always left me excited for the next class. This course was really wonderful.",
                "I really liked how we got to really see the topics of our discussion in person through all of the field trips. It was a lot of reading to get adjusted to in the beginning, but as the class progressed I felt like I was getting more and more out of them.",
                "The biggest strength of the course was definitely the professor. Super understanding, really warm and welcoming on the first day, and generally provided a great working environment. The weakness has to be the amount of readings we got. I don't think I digested it all as well as I would have liked if I had a smaller amount and I felt that, though the information is necessary, the readings ruined my experience."

                "I would recommend this course, especially to STEM and pre-med students looking for a humanities course that at least recognizes their scientific interests. Also, the one day discussing readings and one day outside the classroom made my weekday workload much lighter because I didn't have to do readings in the middle of the week. I appreciated that, so yes, I would recommend the course.",
                "If you are looking for a humanities/writing distributional requirement, the workload and few writing assignments may justify taking the course. However, you may feel a little bored and unsatisfied with the readings and content throughout the semester.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. The professor is amazing and it was a great way to get introduced to Yale in general. It is rare to have the opportunity to explore so many parts of campus through a class and have hands on experiences related to class content.",
                "Unless you are very interested in exploring the history of the human senses (not really the science) then yes, otherwise know that this is a history heavy class",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class. It offered a really wonderful perspective on science and research, but more importantly it really changed my perspective of the body's role in understanding the world around me. It has really altered the way I view discovery and learning.",
                "I would recommend it. It's a nice introduction in to the seminar/discussion-style class -- we were expected to think at a high level but it didn't feel like a high-pressure environment. Plus, all the field trips make it more fun/engaging than some other seminars.",
                "I would! I would recommend this class to people who don't like writing. I went into it thinking this was going to be some class where we just wrote essays and read, but we explored the buildings around Yale and got to meet so many people in our Wednesday trips. Not only that, I got to know the city and university better."
