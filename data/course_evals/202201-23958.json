The discussions we had also helped in better understanding the texts since each student contributed their own perspective on the texts. We also learned how to have meaningful discussions about these texts and the characters within them, and how many behaviors these characters show can be seen in real life.",

                "I developed my close reading skills, as well as my approach to reading literature for self-improvement. I've always been taught to read into deeper meanings in novels or poetry,  but this course taught me to approach each classic work like a collection of lessons on lived-experience for me to pick and choose from. Now when I read, I ask myself what specific things (not only abstract or idealized wisdom) I can understand about the human condition from the text.",

Over the course of DS, I have learned much about the significance of beginnings, endings, time, and other elements of literature. To put it briefly, I learned why a literary work has significance beyond the plot. There are many other factors at play beyond the story itself, and DS will teach you how to work with those factors."

            "comments": [
                "The strength of this course lies in the rich discussions one can have for each reading. There is an emphasis placed on understanding the texts and what the author was trying to say about human behaviors and relationships. Many of the topics we spoke on we connected to our present day lives, and saw many of the aspects of humanity these authors spoke of in our own lives. This course was enriching and I found no weaknesses in it.",
                "Starting with the troubadours and ending in the late 20th century, the Literature track of DS is exceptional for its scope and breadth. We cover an immense period of time in a way that feels deliberate and productive. The texts taught in the curriculum come from many different epochs and regions of the world but link seamlessly with one another because they address similar ideas but in drastically different ways. The only way I would improve the class would be with the final book. Omeros felt like a weak conclusion to the semester and many students agreed that it was probably only chosen because of its attempt to throw in so many classical references and relate to the first semester. It felt separated from the rest of the semester and there are many other well-known books that would have made for better substitutes.",
                "professor was amazing, and the classes were engaging",
                "I appreciated learning about the traditions each author followed/adopted as their own, and I would have liked to learn more specifically which authors they were heavily influenced by to guide my future reading. Authorial influence came up naturally in some of our seminars, but beginning each new text with a list of related texts/writers would've been helpful, too.",
                "This course felt very fast, but the lectures, readings, and class discussions were all very interesting. Seeing the progression of different themes over the span of so many texts that stretched across so many centuries was very rewarding. I think Don Quixote could have been shortened to one week's worth of selections from Parts 1 and 2 (for example, scenes like the scene with Marcella, the Tale of the Man Who Was Recklessly Curious, Don Quixote's death scene, etc), leaving two weeks for Omeros at the end of the semester. Omeros is such a great capstone text for the entire year, and it would be great to spend two full weeks on it, especially since in the fall the Iliad and the Odyssey got two weeks.",
                "The discussions could have been more engaging.",
                "Strength: you read some of the best works of modern literature, and there are 100+ other students who are doing the same thing. Sections are awesome because you get to learn from your peers. Plus you get feedback directly from professors, which is something few other classes can boast. There really aren't any significant weaknesses. If you like reading well written works, you should take this course."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Our discussions around the texts we read were invigorating and the readings themselves taught us a lot about human psychology. Furthermore, the Professor gave us context about the authors we read, helping us better understand how that influenced the authors writing. The texts themselves were enriching, and the discussions even more so.",
                "If the student is prepared to undertake a significant amount of reading and share their thoughts with classmates in a seminar setting, there is no reason why they should not take the class. The texts offer valuable lessons that any Yale student can learn from.",
                "yes--the literature from the syllabus is life-changing and the class really shapes you as a person",
                "For a new appreciation of how modern writing evolved from the ancient classics, and for modern works in general, I'd recommend this course.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course, which was one of my favorites this semester. The books are interesting and Professor Bloch is an amazing instructor. He returned essays very promptly, was always available for office hours, and led class discussions very well, often giving profound advice about literature and life without stifling student contribution. By reading these texts in the course I could see how the texts built on and reacted to each other in a way that I wouldn't have understood if I'd just read the books on my own.",
                "Yes, the reading list for the spring is really good. I didn't read all of the books because I didn't have time, but I'm planning on finishing the reading list this summer!",
                "Yes - everything you cover here is carefully thought out, and there is simply no filler content anywhere on the curriculum. All throughout, it's time well spent."
