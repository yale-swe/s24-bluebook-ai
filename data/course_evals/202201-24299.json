                "a",
                "This was the first film class I have taken, and it taught me a lot about how to approach film as an art medium  compositionally, in terms of the intersection of sound, color and moving image  but also practically, in terms of production, distribution, and audience. Through the films we watched and the stories of their production, this course also taught me a lot about what Blackness means in America, and about the implications of that meaning for the related frameworks of gender and class in this country.",
                "This class exposed me to a million new ideas every day, it felt. I engaged with directors and watched movies that I probably never would have without this course, and was really introduced to a whole rich film tradition. The readings were difficult, for sure, but so interesting and really supplemented our viewings of the film and made our in-class discussions richer. My writing didn't improve as much as I had hoped, since most of the writing in the course were informal blog posts. However, the material was genuinely so interesting.",
                "As someone who had never formally studied film, this class opened my eyes to the political and artistic significance of film. I learned how to critically analyze films' messaging, political power and narrative form. My expectations and understanding of film were subverted by many of the experimental films we watched. I feel like I now approach film with a completely different understanding of what it can be. I also now know how to write about film in a more technical and nuanced way that I hadn't had the opportunity to develop before.\r\n\r\nThis class is about Black film. As such, our readings focus on Black liberation and political aspirations of Black people and Black directors. I felt that we discussed an important political history through media representation that I hadn't learned about before. Professor Forster is impressively knowledgeable and does an excellent job of situating the films we watched within history.",
                "Learned about the artistic and political strategies used by Black experimental and independent filmmakers in their work all throughout Black film history, the many different aspects of filmmaking and film production and how some of those roles become blurred and resisted in interesting ways in the experimental and independent space. Learned about multiple new lenses to view and analyze film through, including Afropessimism and sociological analysis. Deep analysis of short films that was fun and challenging."

            "comments": [
                "The course gives equal weight to the story of each film's production (i.e. asking \"how is Black art made in America?\") as it does to an actual formal analysis of the films themselves, which I really enjoyed. Professor Forster made an effort to introduce some creative activities in the second half of the term (e.g. making two-minute short films during class)  it would have been helpful to have those sprinkled throughout, especially earlier on, when we were watching newer \"experimental\" works by artists like Arthur Jaffa and Keisha Rae Witherspoon.",
                "It is an incredibly well-organized course. The readings + films are paired really well, and the thematic organization is clear. I do think the readings can be a lot sometimes, but I suppose that is expected of a junior seminar. Prof. Forster really does a good job of introducing us to ideas and themes as much as we just discuss movies. I feel like I left with a much deeper understanding of Black politics + movements. I appreciate the concept of blog posts an informal, low-stakes way for students to synthesize their ideas and learn from one another. However, I'm not sure that they quite do that in practice.",
                "Strengths of this class included the selection of films (which were all excellent and impactful), the selected readings (all were relevant and enlightening in some way) and the blog post assignments (which gave us creative room and an opportunity to improve throughout the semester). Strengths of this class also include the visits from Black directors -- it was incredible to be able to speak with them after seeing their work.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of this class was often the discussion aspect. I felt like Professor Forster could have provided a little more direction or commentary to our discussion particularly when the discussion fell flat, when students were quiet or when students went off on tangents with little relevance. That being said, when our discussions were strong, they were very strong.",
                "Amazing syllabus selection spanning a wide array of time periods, genres, films, and kinds of work that engage with each of the films. The course includes lots of casual and low-stakes writing such as the pre-class worksheets and blog posts, providing many opportunities for students to engage in conversation with the films and each other without much pressure. Class this semester included a variety of collaborative and creative small projects/assignments, which were very fun and illuminating as we had to create our own short films. Class had a strong emphasis on the various kinds of labor involved in the production and distribution of film, and not just from the director, which is an inside perspective that doesn't seem to get discussed enough elsewhere. Class discussions were always fun, engaging, and well-facilitated."

                "a",
                "Definitely. I came to this course as neither a film studies major nor an AFAM studies major, and Professor Forster built a classroom discussion environment where I was able to keep up with the big ideas and engage in the conversation.",
                "Absolutely! I honestly feel so much smarter after taking this course, which is always really satisfying. I also know a lot about what it is like to produce and direct and finance a movie, which is cool. I'm grateful that this was the first film course I've ever taken, because it truly taught me a new and unique way to think about film.",
                "Yes! I think this film is an excellent way to study Black history through a lens less often discussed -- media representation, the power of film and the impact of artistic creativity. The films and their characters were deeply moving. This class is rare in that it demands you to exercise your emotive skills as well as your intellectual skills. It stood out from my other classes in that it challenged my creative side in additional to my academic side. It is an excellent class to take even just to have the opportunity to watch some of these movies!",
                "Yes! This course is super interesting and touches on themes of CRT, afropessimism, and international civil rights movement. The class functions as a seminar and Professor Forster gives his students ample room to participate, debate ideas, and engage in discourse. I genuinely learned a lot and enjoyed coming to class every day.",
                "Absolutely! For students with a casual or a deep interest in the content of the course, it's deeply rewarding and you'll come out of it having learned a lot, not just about films but also about ways to reflect on the media you consume generally, and how so much of it can relate to broader theories of living, being, and creating."
