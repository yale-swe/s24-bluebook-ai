    "Absolutely none. Worst course I've taken at Yale.",
    "Mainly looked at the theory behind randomized experiments and how one can actually conduct one (the final project).",
    "You learn about what it means to imply impact in a study. We learned how to evaluate a study and see if it really was able to determine a causal impact of a treatment. We also learned how to design studies that can result in accurate claims. You also do a decent amount of work in R, so you learn some R skills around hypothesis testing. You definitely don't learn R from scratch though, so you should be well versed in it before taking the class.",
    "How to properly design a field experiment, then analyze and interpret the results. Learned a significant amount of R. Refined statistical fluency to speak about statistics in a more succinct way.",
    "I learned to be critical of statistical findings and about various data analysis methods for field experiments",
    "I learned about the process of field experimentation, as well as developed skills in R regarding statistics.",
    "I developed skills in statistical experimental design (how is optimal to divide subjects in control and treatment groups, how can we minimize error, etc.)",
    "This class provided me with knowledge related to field experiments, data analysis in R, and different factors related to experimental design. Identifying a good question of impact and designing an effective way to measure that impact. Skills useful for interpreting scientific findings and critically evaluating their study design.",
    "Gained a much better understanding of how to appropriately conduct surveys as well as analyze the outcomes obtained from surveys. Learned a lot in selection bias, survey attrition, statistical power, covariate analysis, and etc. Great way to improve on your statistical knowledge overall.",
    "A thorough understanding of experimental design & field experiments, including concepts such as randomization, blocking, clustering, meta-analysis, statistical inference, etc.",
    "experiment design",
    "I learned to think about experimental design more rigorously, and how to properly analyze experimental results.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course could be improved if it were cancelled.",
    "There was only one midterm early on, and since there was no final, there was really no need to study or go to lecture after the midterm since most of the problem sets came down to copying what was written in the textbook. I would advise Kalla to either give another midterm or have a final the next time this is taught to keep people more engaged. Also, change the problem sets so that they do not involve mindlessly copying whatever is in the textbook.",
    "Overall, I think the content of this course is great, and this kind of elective is exactly what the S&DS department needs. There are so few non-CS prerequisite or math prerequisite heavy electives in the major, so this was the perfect course to add. Professor Kalla was clearly very knowledgeable about the topic, and was very keen on having students participate in class. Overall, it was a solid class that needs some minor organizational changes to be a great class. This was the first year that the course was offered, so it had some issues with organization. There were 5 psets, an essay, a midterm, and a final project. There was one week where a pset, the essay, and the midterm all occurred, and it was within the first month of class. This was 1) way too much work for one week and 2) not the best in terms of incentives for the rest of the semester. Knowing that you weren't going to be tested again on the material, and knowing that the psets are primarily based on information that can be found in the textbook (the questions come from the book), there was little incentive to pay attention during class. I would say either having questions that don't come from the textbook or introducing a second midterm would be a good way to incentivize attendance and participation. Don't add a final, because that takes away from the final project. I think it would also make sense to allow students to pick the groups they want to work with for the final project, and let them figure out their topic with you on a group by group basis. The assignment of groups made the dynamics  strange within them. I know of many groups where one or two people did almost the entire project because nobody was holding each other accountable the way that you would classmates you already know. Additionally, students weren't super keen on the topics chosen by the TAs from the homeworks, so many groups had to switch from their original idea anyway. I think allowing the process of finding a group and a topic to be more organic would be nice. Additionally, finding some sort of funding for the projects would also be helpful, as some of the projects would have been elevated by financial support for a study, and also there were some groups who did feel financially burdened.",
    "The strengths were that the material was interesting and very real-world. The weakness was that sometimes the psets were a bit of a disconnect from the lecture material, but that's kinda every class, so really wasnt that bad.",
    "Strengths: it was cool, applied, had real-world implications, and a fun variety of tasks (writing, reading, coding in R, project)\r\nWeakness: class was not very engaging sometimes, I think because classes were like an hour 45 min long. I think the professor had wanted the class to be a seminar, and then instead it became more of a lecture, so personally it was hard to participate because there wasn't really in class groupwork and I was kind of too nervous to participate in lecture.",
    "I honestly loved this class. I thought it was structured very well (p-set focused, only one midterm, and final group project focused). It is really a niche class, as it focuses on applications of research of field testing, but it's super interesting and honestly cool to take a more application-based class! The final project is also really great, and it's really good that he keeps us accountable for progress on the final project throughout the semester through work sessions and checkpoints on psets. I thought the midterm test was the only frustrating part of the class. The material tested on the midterm was really not that close to what we'd been learning in class or in Gerber and Green.",
    "This would probably be one of my least memorable Yale courses. The material wasn't something extremely interesting and I feel like that the material covered in the lectures wasn't something that could just be read off from the book. I didn't like how extremely harsh was the grading for the first couple of assignments. Also, there was no reason for the midterm being this exceptionally hard. Probably the most interesting part of the course was the final project. I was lucky to be in a very good team and I feel like that I learnt more from my peers than the rest of the course.",
    "Strengths: relevant course material that could be generalized to a wide variety of fields; relevant statistical skills with great explanation along the way to encourage understanding; professor was very engaged; assignments and labs aided in understanding \r\nWeaknesses: Lack of group work other than final project",
    "The final project was great. Hopefully Professor Kalla will have new TAs next time he teaches this course I would rate them *very* weak.",
    "Lectures were always enjoyable, and 'lab' classes were quite useful. The problem sets involved challenging yet fun and rewarding textbook problems. Most importantly, the final project was a great way to get some hands-on experience with field research.",
    "The problem set material was barely covered in class, and each topic could be covered for several sessions rather than just one lecture.",
    "Helpful textbook, learned a lot in lectures and psets. Wish that we had covered more content.",
    "This class was pretty disorganized and the psets did not line up with class content for the most part.",
    "I really liked the course overall! I think it complements S&DS 314 well as an experimental counterpart and covers a wide and interesting array of topics. Professor Kalla was great and made the course really engaging by bringing in lots of intriguing examples and including interactive labs. I also greatly enjoyed the opportunity to implement our own field experiment which, while challenging, was an engaging final project. I have a few suggestions for improvements--1) I personally didn't like the textbook that much. I felt as if it presented a lot of formulas but with little justification or intuition. I felt like there was a disconnect between the content in class and in the textbook readings\/hws (with the second covering many things that weren't touched on in class). I think improving the two to be better aligned and\/or presenting more statistical theory in class would be helpful and 2) It would be useful if a small amount of funding per group (maybe $20 or $25) could be procured for the final projects in the future. I think that would be helpful in enabling groups to better run their field experiments.",
    "The topic was very interesting. I didnt like all the theory.",
    "I think the course could be more rigorous on the statistics when presented in class, particularly the book covers a lot more than what was covered in the lecture. I liked how we talked about a lot of real-world examples which made the material more tangible.",
    "strength: hands-on learning experience with both theory and coding, fun design-your-own final project\r\nweakness: sometimes the contents can be a bit intuitive and easy",
    "Strengths: I learned invaluable skills and think the lessons were sequenced in a logical format that was easy to follow. I also enjoyed the guest lecturer to show the real-world applications of the work done in the class.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The book, and especially the formulas, are often not entirely intuitive. As a result, because the class did not do an overview of the lessons in the book, it was often hard to fully grasp all of the concepts and keep them straight. The textbook was not entirely reader-friendly and was often not clear in the lesson it wanted to impress on the reader. An overview or recap for each class would be helpful, especially when working on the problem sets.",
    "Strengths: Kalla puts a lot of time and care into his lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: poor TF quality with extremely harsh and inconsistent grading. Kalla himself is actually rather unapproachable -- although I acknowledge he tried to make up for it in the 2nd half of the semester. The final project was interesting but honestly poorly designed in that no one could choose their groups or their topics.",
    "The course was a bit front-loaded as the midterm exam was quite early in the term. That being said, it was nice being able to focus on the final project at the end of the semester once the final problem set was due. \r\n\r\nLooking back I think the short paper held too much weight.",
    "In the future I'd like to see Prof Kalla make the course more unified. As of now, all the psets (due every other week) are strictly derived from the textbook which only loosely relates to the lectures. Entirely possible to do them without going to lectures...so why even have the lectures if this is how the class is set up, I could just read the textbook on my own if I really wanted to learn about field experiments. Lectures are more focused on things like case studies and examples of techniques covered in the textbook, but Kalla assumes knowledge (and in some cases, pretty advanced knowledge) of these new concepts in order to really understand fast paced lectures. The problem with this is that people often haven't had time to read the textbook before class so they really have no idea what's going on. Kalla likes to ask questions during lectures which results in a lot of awkward silences. I also felt that the grading was fairly arbitrary and not consistent for the psets. Another thing is \"Lab\" days where we do our own example in R and use whatever concept we're learning (such as blocking) on a data set to gain better understanding of it. The problem with these is that he gives us way more to complete for these than is feasibly possible: the number of things to do should be cut in half so that we have time to understand exactly what it is we're doing in R instead of just copying from slides.",
    "I think weekly problem sets would be better, and keep the students more engaged on a weekly basis. Sometimes, I learned so much more beyond the class through the textbook, and I wish we had covered more of the textbook material in depth in class.",
    "The strengths of the course was the material involved -- the subject of field experiments in fascinating, and involves many facets of statistical analysis and interpretation. I was impressed by the subjects in which field experiments could be applied to, as well as what situations it fails in modern research. The weaknesses of the course is likely in the mode of evaluation and support given to students.",
    "Overall, the instructors' enthusiasm for the course could be felt. They were passionate about the subject matter. However, a fundamental weakness of this course was most likely attributable to the fact that the course was new. Despite having a clear class structure, the manner in which the subject matter was taught was less than desirable. The slides used by Prof Kalla acted more as a presentation aid rather than a presentation slide that could be used effectively during revision. I.e., the slides contained more questions that were not answered or even if they were answered during class, the content wasn't unpacked well enough. This led the students to turn to the textbook to self-learn so as to do the PSETs. Next, the textbook was disappointing. It was the first textbook that I have read that did not effectively define key terms. It was painful trying to read this textbook. It explains concepts with multiple examples with no overarching topic sentence. Moving forward, I suggest that the class slides can be more informative  more content fleshed out  and have other textbooks to supplement the only assigned class textbook.",
    "Strengths: I think this is the only class that teaches statistics from a social science perspective focusing so much on experiments. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The way the project was structured was not good. I heard that in several groups (including mine), that only the student whose project was chosen put in any effort to the project, while the rest of the group did next to nothing. Students should be able to choose their groups; and if not (if the groups are to be assigned) the whole group should come up with an idea together.",
    "It is a very interesting idea, and it is conceptually very consistentwe learn how to run and analyze randomized experiments for measuring impact. That being said, the biggest weakness of the course was that it kind of didn't seem to know who it was addressing. Sometimes it would be too statistically technical for my social science-background friends to follow, and sometimes it would be too social science-philosophical for me to get completely. Finding a better marriage of these for people who don't necessarily have deep knowledge of both (the vast majority of the class() would be helpful.",
    "Very cool material with obvious real-world applications. No weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: final project. Weaknesses: arbitrary grading, rude professor.",
    "Strengths: Interesting material and we get to apply the ideas we learned to a field experiment we conduct. We did labs in class where we applied the techniques we learned to analyze real datasets with R. These sessions were quite helpful actually. Weaknesses: (1) The course material was not taught in an order that made sense. We went back and forth between learning about field experiments and learning about statistical methods like regression analysis, hypothesis testing, etc.. I think if we had learned all of the methods first and then learned about field experiments and why applying methods to experimental data (as opposed to observational data) yields causal estimates, and then learn about accounting for things like noncompliance, attrition, etc., that would have made more sense. (2) The textbook (Field Experiments: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation) was horrendous. It read like a rambling narrative instead of a technical book. Yes, it gave many pertinent examples of experiments and design considerations, but the presentation was not good. For example, important definitions are buried in large paragraphs (some terms are not even defined). (3) The grading was quite harsh at the beginning of the course and one of the TAs graded more harshly than the other, and some people got the same TA for most of the problem sets. There would be a lot of points taken off for small mistakes or if you (correctly) explained definitions in your own words instead of copying them from the textbook. (4) The project: I think the project was actually a great way to apply a lot of what we learned in class and learn how to balance different experimental design considerations. I think the project should be worth more than 20% of our grade considering the amount of work\/coordination that goes into in (especially if you consider the fact that almost every group had to completely change their project due to experimental design considerations at least once)."

   "comments": [
    "AVOID THIS COURSE! AVOID PROF KALLA! He is mean, rude, and incredibly nonsympathetic to students. His way of teaching is asking questions and waiting in silence until someone gives the wrong answer, then mocking them.",
    "Pretty low-workload, easy S&DS elective.",
    "If you're an S&DS major looking for an elective that is interesting but not all consuming in terms of workload, this is the perfect class. There isn't a ton of work (although you shouldn't leave the psets until the last day, they maybe take 5 hours max), but it is graded pretty strictly  you can't get away with much on the psets, and the grades reflect that (they're 45% of the grade, and the averages were usually 85-90, so it does actually impact your overall grade). Try to get a group for your final project that is willing to put in work. Also, if you don't think the experiment you get is plausible, ask to switch it earlier on. Kalla is pretty open about what he's looking for (in the essay, psets, project, etc.), so take advantage of his office hours.",
    "Yes I would. For people who have taken lots of statistics classes, it is extremely applicable and much less theoretical and hand-wavy than some other courses.",
    "I would if they have a very strong interest in field experiments or working with political campaigns in a statistics way.",
    "Not unless you have a solid foundation and interest in study design.",
    "I definitely would! It's a really interesting class, and a great practice for learning regression and using R. Definitely better for political science majors than S&DS majors, but I had a lot of fun with the class! Professor Kalla brings great real world examples and studies into the class, which is super cool.",
    "If you are really interested in designing statistical experiments then yes. There is something definitely something to be learnt. For everyone else there isn't much to be gained from attending lecture. I did not find the discussions to be really engaging either.",
    "Yes - I would definitely recommend this course to another student at Yale regardless of major. The subject matter is very generalizable and the topics discussed are societally important. Great combination of theory, discussion, current events, and statistics.",
    "The course is interesting from a poly-sci perspective, but for a 300-level S&DS class there is very little computational work. Don't go into this expecting anything beyond regressions.",
    "Sure...",
    "Yeah I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking to improve their statistical skills, especially in surveys and field experiments. I honestly learned a lot in this class.",
    "Yes - if you're at all interested in field experiments or experimental design more generally, take this class!! The 'potential outcomes' framework of experimental design is a bit confusing at first, but really helps you understand the ins and outs of how experiments work in theory.",
    "Probably not, unless the structure of the course drastically changes or his teaching improves.",
    "If you're interested in experimental design, this course is definitely worth it, but it was hard to directly apply the concepts we learned in real life despite the focus of the course being the final project.",
    "Yes! Helps you understand why randomized field experiments are the gold standard.",
    "Not really. I didn't learn much since it expected too much statistics background but was also very introductory. However, it was an easy class to fulfill a stats requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course! I think it's helpful to learn the principles of field experiments and to think through some of the major issues and challenges involved.",
    "Yes",
    "If interested in the more political science side of statistics then yes.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Great s&ds credit with not too intense workload, and really hands-on experience. The final project is really fun to do. Sometimes the class content seems a bit too easy and intuitive.",
    "I'm happy to have taken this course Cr\/D. Even though I probably would have done fine, the grading seemed really capricious and inconsistent. You learn a lot, but it often feels like you have to deal with a lot of ego on the teaching side. I think it's still worth shopping because if Kalla does take into account our critiques, the class def has potential. Be warned the midterm is profoundly difficult, even if it counts little toward your grade.",
    "yes! useful and interesting material and a class that is engaging and not too overwhelming",
    "Only if you are interested.",
    "The material is interesting (esp in the S&DS major where a lot of the courses can be pretty dry), so the course has high potential if Professor Kalla refines it and makes it better. In its current state I would not take again. Give it a year or two.",
    "If you are interested in field experiments and would like an interesting elective that applies basic statistical concepts, then this is course for you.",
    "If the course instructors do not drastically change the manner in which the course was taught and provide additional materials to supplement the textbook, then I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would recommend this course if the final project were structured differently.",
    "Yes, it was a useful course, especially if you are looking to go into real social sciency or quantitive political stuff.",
    "Take GLBL 195\/PLSC 341, which uses the same textbook, if you can. Overall, this class definitely did not live up to my expectations, although I recognize that it was in its first semester and I'm sure it'll improve in the future.",
    "Not the way it is currently designed. This was the first year this course was offered, and I think a lot will change, and while other courses cover the same material, this class has a unique take because it focuses on field experiments."
