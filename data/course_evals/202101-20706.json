I enjoyed classes the most when Professor Horn would play a song to show exhaustivity in action, or even when he made some of our studies relevant to current social-political discussions.\r\nI also wonder if lessening weekly readings or being really explicit about what to read, would help make assignments more meaningful. I found myself more lost when I had to strategically skim-read 4 papers, as opposed to thoroughly reading 2."
