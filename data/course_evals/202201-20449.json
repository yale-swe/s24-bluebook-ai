Also gained knowledge about issues in Latin America both in the present day and in history. Also learned how to write a good essay in Spanish and develop my thoughts in an unfamiliar language.",

I really enjoyed how this class focused on subject areas that went beyond what I have typically studied in a Spanish class.  I learned many things in this class apart from Spanish knowledge that I was able to meaningfully connect to other classes at Yale.  I also became more confident in my conversational and written use of the subjunctive tense and other more difficult grammatical structures in this class.",

                "I think that a big strength of this course is the uniqueness of the topics we covered, and the diversity of mediums we used to learn. I really likes the unit on Fake News especially, as it is very relevant to the present day unfortunately. However, this course certainly would have been better in a harkness table format rather than in individual desks facing the board. I did not feel very engaged in conversation in this manner.",
                "The course was designed in a very interesting way. I appreciated learning about Spanish culture from beyond just a study of grammar. The lessons were engaging and clearly well thought-out.",
                "There is a lot of engagement with new material involving reading and analysis but not much in terms of improving grammar usage and speaking.",
                "The strengths of the course was that I improved in my Spanish comprehension. The increase in workload was significant from Spanish 3 to Spanish 4, so I think the workload could be lowered to make it more manageable and enjoyable.",
                "strengths: I liked the different units that were covered because i have never gone in-depth on these kinds of topics in a Spanish class\r\nweakness: I do wish we had some structure for note-taking because I struggle with grammar and would have benefitted from notes other than Jamboard activities",
                "I really enjoyed the content that this course covered and I definitely improved my Spanish speaking ability.  At times the course felt a bit disorganized\/disjointed and instructions for assignments were a bit unclear.  Some assignments felt less focused on improving our Spanish abilities and more focused on art\/visual abilities that were not supposed to be the focus of this class.  I think more clarity on expectations for assignments as well as providing a clearer roadmap of the goals of the course would be helpful in the future.",
                "Strength- I thought it was really intriguing that we got to learn about the Spanish culture in addition to learning the actual language",
                "The course oversimplified complex issues of environmentalism, colonial expansion, and current geopolitics to \"the West is wrong and everyone else is right.\"  It was embarrassing to move from SPAN 130 which caused a massive jump in my Spanish speaking skills because it focused mainly on grammar and engaged us with challenging readings, to this which attempted to tackle big issues but only succeeded in peddling propaganda.  \r\n\r\nFor environmentalism, let us debate in spanish the pros and cons of modern energy production.  Perhaps let us try to understand why people turn to slash and burn agriculture or use mercury to mine for gold in La Pampa.  We can condemn them, but a class focused about Spanish culture might offer some insight into this phenomenon rather than a watered down sermon on how burning fossil fuels hurts mother nature.  \r\n \r\nFor colonialism, let us watch El Abrazo del Serpiente and contrast it with depictions laid out by the Spanish monks during the conquest.  Again, we may not agree with them, but we could at least understand why they did what they did.  The old spanish would be a challenge that would require growth from the class.\r\n\r\nEvery issue should have a day where students can use Spanish to debate the topic.  The one day where the class was fully engaged was a brief debate on the social effects of video games.  It was an obvious shift from the general lethargy to a sense of energy because we were not being lectured at, we had a chance to create and defend our opinions on relevant issues.  \r\n\r\nIt was a fine way to phone out of Spanish and take an easy class, but I would much rather have more time speaking in spanish and learning to defend my case.",
                "Asynchronous days were improved from Span 130. However, the course content was much more unorganized. I felt the three units did not connect very well and the last unit was shoved at the end. Presentations felt rushed and feedback on all assessments came very late, to the point when the feedback came, it wasn't very useful. Jamboards guided the class well I think and I was glad the syllabus was updated timely. The professor communicated with us fairly well and was easy to contact for any clarifications needed. Grammar wasn't reviewed too much and I wish it was reviewed more because I just used present tense the whole time when I knew subjunctive was needed in certain situations. I wish there was more Span 130 review. Please tell us you are phasing out the textbook so I didn't have to pay $150+ for a full year subscription :("

In addition, her research directly applies to some of the material we cover in this class and you can tell she is very passioante. This course will not teach you grammar and vocab, though, so be prepared to speak good spanish every day.",

                "Yes, this course is low-stake and inclusive and encourages you to think beyond your own confinements to understand the history of latin American culture and subjugation. It is an interesting course and I loved my professor.",
                "Yes!  This class focused on topics that moved far beyond what I've studied in Spanish classes before and helped me improve my abilities to write about more complex topics and ideas in Spanish.  It was an enjoyable step in the Spanish sequence and inspired me to take L5 courses.",
                "Yes",
                "No.  I would encourage them to skip to L5 which may offer them a chance at improvement if they are interested, or stop at L3 if possible.",
                "Yes if you need the language credit. It is manageable and the material is interesting. Movies are good and you look at some primary sources. You get to know the groups you do projects with pretty well."
