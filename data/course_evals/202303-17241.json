                "The class is what you make of it. I have few complaints other than that the synchronous class talks were not that useful.",
                "Strengths: I appreciate how they tried to give us more feedback. I liked all the opportunities to present in front of our peers and the flexible attendance requirement was nice. A great opportunity to do some research in a topic of interest. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I honestly didn't get that much out of the non-presentation in person attendance classes.",
                "My advisor was not the most available and I felt like the extra tasks and deadlines for the class added unnecessary stress. However, doing the project was interesting and rewarding. I appreciated that there was flexibility to pivot the project within the class. The actual 'lectures' are completely useless (good time for working on things for other classes), though watching others present their work was interesting.",
                "I actually really appreciated the fact that we had assignments to complete for this course (i.e., proposal, presentations, poster, report). It established necessary checkpoints in a semester-long project, and also allowed me to connect with other people in the Computer Science community and to learn about their work in a way I have never done before at Yale, but that is really important. However, a significant weakness was that, although the instructor tried to make the requirements clear, the variety of them and the frequency of announcements made keeping track of class attendance and the material to submit quite difficult. Students in the class were constantly having to ask each other what we had to do, how to do it, and exactly what was required by when. I would HIGHLY recommend creating a course website for this class, as there is a lot of important material (ex: lecture schedule, required assignments, important registration information) that gets confusing on Canvas.",
                "great course!",
                "your experience can vary completely depending on your project and advisor. many students don't pay or don't want to pay attention to the student presentations, proposal or midterm, and the general sentiment is that we are forced to sit through them to meet our attendance requirements. the class also feels like it's just 99% your research project and the remaining 1% we have to meet attendance requirements for some miscellaneous topics. overall not very engaging and also there were certain points where the instructions/requirements for what we had to submit were not very clear and needed clarification.",
                "The course is advertised as a way to create community and because of that they expect mandatory attendance to a certain number of lectures (some of which are incredibly dry). I think it would be nice to have more of the guest speaker lectures, to hear experts on the topics. And if we want community, to have more events throughout. Maybe even hackathons where students can sit together and work on their projects?",
                "I think the presentations and assignments to get your advisor's approval/feedback were really good at keeping people on top of their work. \r\n\r\nI think the proposals for thesis should be due by the end of the previous semester that way if someone needs to learn a new technology or language, they have time over the break to start learning it.  A lot of my time was spent learning how to use Blender which made it take longer to actually make the things needed for my project. \r\n\r\nI wish my advisor was a little more on my ass about deadlines so I wouldn't have fallen behind but honestly, I think that's my fault.  My advice: know how best you work under longterm projects and communicate with your advisor about that so they can support you that way.  Do you need someone who is on your ass or does a laissez-faire approach work for you?  I think taking a bit of time in the first class to discuss this could help students a lot. \r\n\r\nAlso I think more TFs would be helpful so we would decrease the amount of class sessions dedicated to presentations. I heard other majors have a weekly small group session to keep them accountable for their theses.  I think more TFs leading sessions like these would be a big help!  More TFs can also help take the administrative burden off of one person because a small group of students will have a specific point of contact.",
                "Was very focused on the research itself which is important for a senior thesis course like this.",
                "Instructions and due dates could be made more clear.",
                "Strengths: forgiving and understanding professor and TA, unstressful attendance policy, opportunities to hear about other students' work (but not a lot of student engagement and exchange of feedback)\r\nWeakness: final submission instructions were unclear. Many students had trouble submitting particularly on the Zoo. More specific steps like what commands to run would be helpful.",
                "As far as a senior project course goes, CS 490 is organized quite well. I was initially skeptical about the presentations throughout the semester, but they are helpful in keeping you on track and accountable (and also cool to see what your peers are doing!)",
                "Strengths: check-ins to make sure we were reasonably on track, opportunities to give/receive feedback from peers. Weaknesses: not too many. Maybe the course could add another check and request a partial draft/outline of the paper before/after Thanksgiving break? It took a surprisingly long time to write even the introduction, and I think forcing myself to outline the paper/think about its written structure would have been helpful for writing the final draft later on.",
                "Good for building independence in computer science.",
                "Well-structured. I'm glad there were milestone deadlines.",
                "I have mixed feelings about the course. On the one hand, it helps CS majors learn about the cool things everyone else is working on. That probably won't be possible without having the project proposal presentations and the poster fair at the end. It's also nice to have deliverables to stay on track with the senior project--I'm sure people, including me, would slack without those deadlines. I enjoyed the poster fair at the end--seeing other people's work was great and so was the food!\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't think the class should have the minimum attendance requirement. I did not learn much from the in-class sessions (the non presentations one). Even though some speakers were great, being made to sit there with the hanging threat of getting your grade docked for not attending the class on a Friday wasn't enjoyable. I also thought the requirement for writing comments on others' project proposals and midterm presentations was redundant. I understand it's a way to make sure people stay engaged, but most people did not have much to say, and it felt tedious. I also thought asking us to present the midterm progress didn't have a point--could have just been done with the presentation submission to the advisor.",
                "The strengths were all from my advisor and the grad student i worked with. Both were super response. They helped a lot setting me up, were always there to answer questions, provide context, or help debug, and were really encouraging throughout the entire semester. I felt really supported by them both and was really lucky to have such a great team. I had weekly meetings with them, and set aside a lot of time so I feel like I was able to contribute a lot. However, all the strengths came from my own work to make this a meaningful experience.\r\n\r\nThe weakness were the additional requirements imposed by 490. I understand and agree with the need for a proposal and final report, they were both very helpful exercises. A lot of the other requirements I found a frustrating waste of time. I had to produce a midpoint report which my advisor did not need, I met with them every week so they knew where I was, and then present it, which wasted 10 hours when I could have been working on my project. These presentations were supposed to give me feedback from my peers, but no one wanted to be there and cared about the feedback, so no one got good feedback and it was unhelpful. The in person requirement was also pretty unnecessary. I enjoyed hearing about other projects, especilaly the proposal and final poster presentation, but attending random lectures was not helpful. It was a waste of time when again, I could have been working on my project. I understand that these can be useful checkpoints for people doing more independent work and to ensure people stay on track, but for people working closely with an advisor, they are a waste of time. An advisor should be able to waive some additional 490 requirements if they see fit. Additionally, the purpose of the in person classes and student presentations need to be rethought. If its to teach material, make it more useful, not just how to read a paper. If it is to get feedback, have smaller groups and discussions, and longer presentations that can actually yield useful discussions. Right now, it feels like a waste of time that doesn't know what it wants to be. The in person time could be a helpful moment to discuss with your peers, but it is not that. I think it should either be removed, or made into smaller, more targetted discussions where maybe 5 people present and then discuss questions and can get feedback in conversation. That is a much more useful skill, how to discuss your and others work critically.",
                "The purpose of this class is to help us start our projects early and make good progress throughout the semester, and I appreciate the project proposal report and proposal presentation. However, the fact that the midterm presentation has dates spanning a month throws things off a bit, and some students need to worry about presenting despite only having worked on their project for a little time. It sort of hinders the momentum of the project, but I can see how it can be motivating.",
                "Well structured courses, some of the required lectures could be a little more helpful",
                "The lectures felt totally unrelated to the course (they were unrelated basically) and yet they were required. Felt like they were out to get you on attendance stuffbesides that the actual class is 100% dependent on your relationship w your advisor",
                "I loved the final showcase and getting to see my friends' amazing projects. Even after every midpoint presentation, I would leave super excited about how everyone was working on such different but interesting things. It was a great culmination of the past three years, and fun to celebrate how cool your friends are :)",
                "I think Sohee is a kind and caring instructor, and she did her best to make this course as unintrusive and useful as possible. Everything about 490 which was under Sohee's jurisdiction was run well. I think she gets a lot of flack for things that are beyond her control. I think the real issue with this course is the wide variety of advisors, each with their own (wildly varying) approaches and amount of effort put into mentoring. Most people I talked to felt that their advisors saw them as a nuisance/burden rather than a mentee. In addition, most profs/advisors are so busy that they don't have the time or energy to actually get their students up-to-speed on their projects, so a lot of kids fell behind and ended up getting very little guidance. Not to mention that any project of reasonable scope is not very doable in the ~7-8 weeks of actual work time we get (since we spend weeks finding an advisor, writing a proposal, creating a midterm progress report, and writing the final report + poster), especially alongside 3-4 other courses. Realistically, there needs to be a session in the PRIOR semester where profs who are actually DEDICATED to mentoring can present project ideas and match up with students. And imo projects should be year-long, but this is probably hard logistically. For a more practical change, we need more expansive feedback from advisors around midterm time, NOT just an S/NS grade, which tells us very little. Even a 2-3 paragraph written blurb or a required 20-30 minute meeting would be great. If the goal of the course is to actually get these seniors some mentoring, then more feedback is NECESSARY.",
                "strengths: really fun & interesting to see what other students are working on with their proposals/progress reports, some weekly class topics like lit review writing were super helpful, attendance policy is relatively flexible weaknesses: super advisor-dependent, some advisors meet weekly with their students and help them a ton whereas others are very hands-off",
                "The strength of this course resided in its freedom. This allowed me to work on a project I was interested in, making it easier and more enjoyable",
                "Stop making attendance required outside of presentations, and be more lenient with/get rid of deadlines. It doesn't make sense to put additional pressure on students if they are conducting independent research with a faculty member and have established a working timeline with them. \r\n\r\nEspecially for Computing and the Arts students who are taking it as the first half of a year long thesis, this course is not really well designed and the various checkpoints/deliverables don't really make much sense. It focuses students on having a finished product that more resembles and academic paper than an independent creative project, which I found kind of distressing bc I felt like I was doing something wrong the entire time. \r\n\r\nGroup presentations/feedback would have been more helpful if it were done in small groups of 5-7 instead of in front of half the class, as students could have more chance to get face to face feedback from people and answer questions.",
