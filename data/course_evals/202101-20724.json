                "The class taught me a lot about Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger and improved my Latin ability as well. The two authors have different styles and I learned to read both well. We also got some good context about the authors' contemporaries and the Roman political scene throughout their lifetimes.",
                "Just a lot about the Plinys as authors, as well as the historical\/cultural context surrounding their works. Also a lot of Latin analytical skills from a more literature\/civilization standpoint!",
                "This course was perfect practice to translate prose; up tot his point, I had mostly translated poetry or read prose in translation.",
                "This course improved my Latin-reading abilities to some extent, but I believe that the most important skill I learned was to understand how to bring different sources from the ancient world into conversation with each other. Previous Latin courses that I had taken only focused on single works or authors, and the level of historical and literary depth in the Plinies was new to me."

                "Strengths: translation in class was not mandatory, which I thought was a strength overall. Class discussions were usually very lively and engaging. The professor and TA were both very knowledgeable. The selected readings and selected articles were quite engaging. Weaknesses: workload was sometimes on the heavy side, but that is overall dependent on the person.",
                "Strengths: just very knowledgeable and engaging professor and teaching assistant, great selection of readings and supporting scholarship, very cool final paper\/presentations, enriching discussion\r\nWeaknesses: at times workload was a little high, but good for challenging me and pushing me to improve translation skills! Readings always made sense together under distinct themes and had a progression, but yes - maybe slightly less readings."

                "It's definitely an interesting course and gives you a lot of insight into Roman politics in the first century. The Plinies are difficult, especially Pliny the Elder, but you will learn a lot. I would probably not recommend this to a student coming out of L3\/L4 or a bridge course unless they are particularly advanced, but other than that, I think it's a great option.",
                "Absolutely! The Plinys are essential parts of Roman literature and it's a great way to enrich your understanding not just of Latin, but also of Roman civilization.",
                "Yes, but only if you are confident in ability to handle lugubrious passages of sometimes difficult prose.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is seriously interested in engaging with the ancient world on its own terms. As opposed to courses that simply deal with mechanics of language or solitary literary works, this course forced the students to become immersed in a variety of cultural attitudes about an astonishing number of subjects - really the joy of classics itself in my opinion."
