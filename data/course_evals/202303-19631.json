Professor Lim is very caring, a wonderful instructor, and my favorite professor at Yale so far. The only thing I can think about is maybe incorporating more writing activities, but I also felt like we had a decent amount and I personally just enjoy writing more than the average student might."

The many videos we watch and passages we read are a great way to compare our culture with Korea's.",
