                "Fundamentals on theory and history related to global empires.",
                "This course is very useful for understanding the contradictions that fuel capitalism, colonialism, and imperialism and being able to utilize those contradictions to critically and thoroughly analyze past and current events. One of the most valuable things was the critical approach the course took that challenged you to think beyond your understandings of terms frequently used in discourse; I think this helped develop my ability to independently develop thoughts on these issues rather than rely solely on texts."

                "The readings were quite dense and definitely took a bit of time to work through, but they were worth it. I really appreciated how flexible Prof Okihiro was and how he took the time to ask us for our opinion on the syllabus and what readings we enjoyed and what we wished we could focus on more. The discussions were a little too open-ended and it was sometimes difficult to know where to start, but Prof Okihiro would pose a question for us to discuss and allowed the conversation to take different directions.",
                "Entirely strengths! Professor Okihiro is amazing; I truly think everyone should take a class with him before graduating. The class is low pressure  he creates an environment in which you are doing the work because you want to, rather than because you feel obligated to in order to get a good grade, etc. The readings and syllabus are well thought out, and class discussions are wonderful.",
                "There was a nice balance between dense theoretical and historical texts as well as current events/ figures that were relevant, which made for a very engaging classroom discussion. One weakness is that our TF was removed from our class halfway into the semester which I thought was unnecessary as they were very helpful and complemented our discussions well. But overall it was clear professor Okihiro really cared about the subject matter and was interested in hearing the different ways we were interested in it as well.",
                "Professor Okihiro is a huge strength. He is a wonderful person and beyond that a wonderful professor and scholar. Learning with him is an amazing opportunity. The readings  I think  are also a big strength as they are a good mix of foundational texts but also more contemporary texts; all readings evoke many questions and prompt a good discussion.",
                "Strengths- Prof Okihiro is incredible, and so well-versed in these subjects. He takes a creative and flexible approach to designing the course, which really benefits students. Readings were really interesting, although at times a bit challenging to complete and understand in full with denser texts."

                "Yes! Prof Okihiro is so thought-provoking and has a wealth of knowledge that he is willing to share. The readings that he chose for us were so interesting and diverse, spanning from economics to more individually rooted narratives. The community that arises from the class is also so special and full of appreciation for each person's insights - you end up learning so much from Professor Okihiro, the readings, and your class.",
                "10000%! Take this course. One of my favorite at Yale. I know I will take this material with me for the rest of my life.",
                "Yes! It is challenging in terms of workload and some of the readings can be difficult, but you learn a lot and Professor Okihiro is really passionate about your learning in this class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they majoring in ER&M or environmental studies. It is a great course, with interesting readings, great discussions, and tends to build a great class chemistry. Foundational course for better understanding capitalism, colonialism, and imperialism. Also, professor Okihiro is amazing and you should take the opportunity to learn from and with him!",
                "Yes, Professor Okihiro is so knowledgeable and puts together an interesting and varied reading list. His brief lectures at the beginning of class really help to contextualize the material before discussing the readings as a group. The open-ended nature of the final project helps students pursue creative mediums and topics.",
                "Absolutely! Dont pass up the chance to take a class with Prof Okihiro, and especially on this topic which is so pertinent to the limitations and possibilities of how we imagine ourselves in ethical relationships with the world around us. This course provides foundational information on and context for historical plant relationships."
