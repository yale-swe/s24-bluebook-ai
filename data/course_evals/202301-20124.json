                "You'll learn a whole lot of French. It's oriented more toward written than spoken French.",
                "The course provides a rigorous and dynamic background that is essential to further study and learn French. The topics are all presented in a solid grammatical and cultural context and follow clear steps, patterns that facilitate the learning and understanding processes.",
                "I learned French grammar through daily exercise and literature. The class advanced by knowledge of advanced French grammar skills and comprehension.",
                "Better conversational and grammar skills",
                "I greatly improved my capabilities in written French and in reading comprehension through the books and short stories in the class. I also had the opportunity to speak with others about higher-level topics in French. Grammar was a main focus of the class, so I also saw improvements in that realm."

            "comments": [
                "This course does an excellent job exposing students to the globalization of French culture while also exploring the history of French culture. I like how the grammar slowly tapered off, allowing us to dedicate more time to the content of movies and books. I wish there had been more opportunities for informal discussion in the class, though the presentations were a great addition.",
                "The course has many strengths. The instructors are great. They ask a lot of you while caring deeply for you. The department offers quite a few ways for students to improve beyond the classroom, like French-language tables in select dining halls on select days, a cinema club, peer tutors, and so onalthough by the time you've sat through your daily French lecture and done your homework, you may not have the stamina for more French.\r\n\r\nA notable weakness of this course is the distribution of homework, which was quite uneven. On some days, we actually were not given any homework. But on one day in particular, we were given a movie to watch, a long passage to read, questions to answer about that passage, some audio-guided worksheets, and many more additional worksheets. That was a lot of work for a class that meets every day. I reckon that they could work on distributing the homework more evenly by date.\r\n\r\nThe rather antiquated Course Packet would sometimes feature content that differed from what the accompanying audio recordings featured. Moreover, the quality on some of the audio recordings was lacking in a few specific cases (I'm not sure if this was a tactic to improve oral comprehension with background noise or if it's something they should work on straightening out). The instructor's copy of the Course Packet appeared to differ at times from the students' copies, causing confusion at times.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the assessment software that they used, LingCo, seemed to be glitchy and perhaps caused too many problems to justify the few benefits that it offered.",
                "The course is very well organized and I received help or guidance every day! At the end of the semester, I felt that I learned so much and had a great time engaging with the discussed topics. We had many sessions that may further help the students review once again, more in detail, the concepts discussed during the lectures, or work in teams on ideas for the exercises on the assignments.",
                "The strengths of this class is the professor. Professor Bedoui was an incredible professor who genuinely cared for each student. She was always available to meet for office hours and took the time to explain concepts in depth. The course could be improved to allow for more speaking time in-class.",
                "books are too advanced for this level, it takes too long to read the assignments and its not productive for improving reading comprehension skills\r\npeople are not conversationally fluent because they are not allowed to have extended conversations with each other in french about topics other than the assigned novels",
                "This course is very intense. The workload for all French classes is significantly higher than that of most other language classes. I think that busy work could be limited by adjusting the Course Packet material, especially because it is pretty outdated.",
                "The course was very intensive and thus was quite effective. Overall, I believe that it achieved what it was trying to. I think that it may be improved if the answers to the workbook were occasionally posted online or handed out in class in order to allow for more discussion time rather than just reading off one's homework. Additionally, I found that I had a lot of trouble improving my speech production because the students that sat next to me did not want to talk during discussions. I think that changing the \"partners\" for discussion time to make sure that everyone was occasionally paired with someone who really valued speech improvement may be helpful.",

The instructors are incredibly good, dedicated, and accessible.",

It was extremely challenging and, while it was rewarding, at times the workload felt excessive. However, if one is committed to learning French, the department is very well-organized and intellectually challenging."
