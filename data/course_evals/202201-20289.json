                "Strengths: content of this course was cool. Professors Hyder and Rothman are very nice, knowledgable, and experts in the field. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class is entirely taught by other students after the first lecture, which I felt severely detracted from the educational value. I feel like the point of taking a class with experts in the field is to learn from these expertsnot be required to learn the entirety of the content through student presentations (which varied greatly in quality and were extremely inconsistent). Moreover, the grading for the two papers felt very arbitrary. The midterm paper had no instructions beyond basically \"write a 10 page paper based on the fundamentals we covered in class\" (with no guidance on tone, style, etc.), and we did not receive feedback on this paper until a month later. The feedback was only a few sentences giving general adviceno specific comments were made on the document.",
                "strengths: interactive class\r\nweaknesses: a lot of overlap between lectures, student-taught so teaching quality changed based on who was teaching the class",
                "The strengths of this course are that you learn a lot of information in an accessible way since it's taught by students. It's a great way to practice public speaking on a scientific topic. You also learn how to write about neuroimaging in a concise and precise way. There was not as much feedback on the midterm or final papers as I would expect from a WR course, but there was a lot of feedback on the weekly synopsis.",
                "Staff was very knowledgeable and the student presentation format was very interesting.",
                "The students basically teach the class - wish there was more lessons on the practical aspects of MRI",
                "A strength of this course is being able to develop and write our own assessment of the weekly material (through the synopsis) and receiving feedback about how our writing could be improved. I also appreciated how Professor Hyder helped us refine our group presentations before we disseminated the information to the class. \r\n\r\nA weakness of the course is the lack of writing guidance given to us before we turned in our midterm and final paper. While we did receive comments on our papers after they were submitted, it would have been equally as helpful to receive robust pointers for writing papers before we started, as it is a writing style that not everyone is accustomed to. The synopsis comments did help in general, but since these papers were more involved, it would have been better to be given advice catered specifically to them.  The teaching fellows could have also been more utilized in this class by allowing them to hold informal office hours to help students with writing."

This course might be slightly more challenging for those who haven't taken fundamental neuroscience, biochemistry, or physics classes already, as many of the lectures cover these topics.",
