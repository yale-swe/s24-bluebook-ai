   "comments": [
    "I learned an immense amount of current affairs from past to present in data governance. I was also introduced to a whole new field of study that was up and coming and fascinating. I learned more about writing policies and the effect the data life cycle can have on individuals.",
    "I developed a strong understanding of what data is, how it is being used, and what political and ethical challenges surround its use. This course utilized a variety of interdisciplinary teaching media and techniquesincluding current events, theory of international affairs\/dynamics, policy white papers, and academic papers. I really appreciated the diversity of material. I feel like I came out of this class with a super strong understanding of ways that tech companies need to reevaluate their practices and what policy solutions we could apply to these issues. I feel like I now have the ability to explain and have opinions about something that is really prevalent and important in current events, so I am really glad I took this course.",
    "I learned a lot about data governance: the policy behind it, the current climate around policymaking, major ethical questions, etc.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about data governance today and its historical origins. Additionally, I developed my essay writing skills.",
    "The course began with laying out the historical context of key issues\/debates in data governance\/privacy. We then shifted to applying the frameworks\/terminology gained to ongoing debates\/new issues in the field today. The most useful skill was learning how to read papers, policies, legal documents, and company privacy policies regarding data issues. Taking this class gave me the frameworks and terminology so that I wouldn't get lost doing this.",
    "learned how to think about data in many different ways!",
    "This course was eye-opening for me. In terms of current affairs, data governance is probably the most important and imperative thing we, as informed citizens, should know about.",
    "This course gave me a much greater understanding of the historical context to issues surrounding data governance and privacy. It also touched on a number of current issues and policy, but we could only go so deep for each topic (truly, we covered a \/lot\/ of different ground). I feel that I'm leaving with a method of thinking critically about such issueswhere possible harms to others may lie, what we can do to address them. More generally, this course has left me with the realization that \"data governance\" is something that we (the world, humanity) need a lot lot more of than we currently have.",
    "A thorough introduction to all things data and technology!",
    "I learned an immense amount about data, data governance, and the ethical approach to understanding the current state of privacy and data collection.  This class not only pointed out contemporary problems and rising issues, but also helped lay out a groundwork to understand them with, drawing on medical data ethics and conceptions of privacy. I learned, in essence, to formulate a coherent personal idea of data protection, and an understanding of what it means to have privacy and be observed in the real world.",
    "This course completely changed what I want to do for my career. Professor Raymond not only emphasized why data governance was important, but also posed it as an existential threat to humankind. By integrating his own experience and viewpoints with current news articles and events as well as both international and national legal texts, I came away from the course with a detailed understanding of the stakeholders at play in the conversation about data governance and with a newfound appreciation for the work being done to improve our current political and technical situation regarding these issues.",
    "A deep understanding of current status (and weaknesses) of tech laws and data collection laws, ability to explain harms done by absence of laws, ability to propose new legislation",
    "This is a really relevant course I feel like every class, something we were studying would be in the news. Professor Raymond is really cool, quirky and you can tell he is extremely passionate about his field. Additionally, the readings were really really interesting and I found myself finishing entire books when he would assign chapters. I really enjoyed it.",
    "The data governance course focused on a pertinent modern issue; how to we regulate our personal information in a system where technology runs ahead of legislation? The course was divided into two parts. The first half of the semester focused on the history of personal information, beginning with Nuremberg as a framework for the protections of a data subject and ending with the development of GDPR and personal data protections in Europe and the United States. The second half of the semester applied the ideas learned in the previous semester to individual case studies. At the end of the course, I was left with a good solid understanding of the strengths and failures of data governance, the importance of defining the individual, and the implications of an unregulated industry.",
    "tons of unwritten things about the future of data and governance and human rights",
    "I learned a lot! Great course.",
    "This course was eye opening. I was introduced to many concepts surrounding data and human rights that I had never considered before. Left every class more excited abt the material",
    "By taking this course, I learned how to critically evaluate data policies of all industries. I am now very familiar with important texts and policies including the Nuremberg Code, the General Data Protection Regime, FERPA, FCRA, and the Privacy Act of 1974. I also learned the historical context which has led to the current data policy status quo in both the United States and internationally. In addition, I learned the stages of the data life cycle and technical\/governance issues that can occur at each step. The best part was that I was able to use all of the knowledge I acquired throughout the course and was able to apply it in my assignments to real world issues, such as lacking data policies, and I was also able to propose my own suggestions grounded in evidence and legal precedent.",
    "You gain essential skills in how to analyze and create data governance regulations through the inspection of the history of data governance and cases of the recent past.",
    "Theoretical frameworks for thinking about data privacy, and the historical precedents that exist and aren't often talked about. Lots of discussion about present-day issues in tech policy, governance, and regulation.",
    "I gained a much deeper and nuanced understanding of the current governance approaches to data in the United States as well as in Europe, and more generally, I gained a new perspective towards the extreme significance and extent of issues revolving around data across the globe. I learned about the history of how data governance and regulation began, different varieties\/categories of data, how information is \"cycled\" throughout tech industries. I now have a better understanding of the massive influence that technology companies hold in social issues across the globe, and I realized many of the responsibilities that these companies (should but not always) hold.",
    "I learned about the origin of data rights from the Nuremberg Trials to Brandeis\/Warren to concerns over data rights today. I also learned about the different legislation covering privacy rights and court cases that have challenged the ethics of Section 230. Finally, we had the chance to identify harms produced by poor governance and address those issues by articulating our policy framework."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: \r\n1. The readings were very interesting and relevant. \r\n2. Professor Raymond is not only at the top of his field but also excels at teaching, something that is hard to find in a professor. He could be completely disengaged and focused on his book, projects, talking to the UN, but he instead does all those things while still making time to meet with students and genuinely care about his class.\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n1. The readings were sent out a little late each week, but honestly, with all he does I completely understand",
    "This is a one-of-a-kind course, in that pedagogy in tech policy and tech ethics is still being developed around the world, but Prof. Raymond has developed a very strong teaching technique that starts with historical\/ethical\/legal precedents and builds into the present. That is the primary strength of this course. Readings were super interesting and engaging as well. More than anything, Professor Raymond's ability to build and execute a lesson flawlessly over the course of 1hr and 15 min is amazing. I come out of lectures feeling so full of new knowledge. I wish this course were still a seminar because I want to engage with the material so, so deeply, and I credit this course for being so fantastically built that it makes me want to do MORE work for it. I'd happily do weekly reading responses, more projects, and more essays for this class if I could because of how well it was structured and taught.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses were that readings were sometimes excessively long (mostly at the beginning of the course, when we would be assigned 100-200+ pages for a week of lectures). I also think that readings would sometimes not be assigned until the last minute, which impeded on ability to do them effectively. Sometimes, I felt that we used a lot of time in class explaining assignments, and this could have been done through putting an in-depth explanation on Canvas (which was already up there, we just used time to explain the assignments in class anyway). Often, after going through the assignment in class, I actually found myself a bit more confused about the assignment than I would have been just reading the assignment instructions on Canvas. We could have more efficiently spent that time talking about material in class.\r\n\r\nMore than anything, I also think this class demonstrated how intimately connected issues of race, queerness, class, and gender are to data. Despite this, the Global Affairs major still critically lacks proper instruction in understanding these subjects and identities, which means that discussions on these subjects fall flat quickly in class and section. Global Affairs majors want to solve issues in foreign relations without having any requirement to understand foreign cultures or even cultures that surround them here in the U.S. I don't put any blame on Professor Raymond for thisin fact, I praise him for bringing those issues to the forefront of discussions at times. But I fault the Global Affairs major and the Jackson Institute for continuously failing on this part. I actually wish this class were a Political Science one instead, because issues of identity and power structures receive MUCH more respect and consideration in the PLSC department. To faculty and administrators of the Global Affairs department reading this review: do better. You are failing ethnic  and gender studies as disciplines that should be part of your curriculum, and students who want to reimagine rather than reify current power structures in international relations. This problem is not only relevant to this course, but also a microcosm of larger issues in the Global Affairs major. Until this changes, I think the Global Affairs major and its courses will lack important credibility on this campus and beyond.",
    "Strengths: Professor Raymond is an excellent lecturer. My TA was also excellent. The class was well-structured, and progressed from foundational information to more real-world application. I do wish there was less deciphering of the GDPR and more analysis of real-life case studies, though.\r\nWeaknesses: The readings were long and often dry. But I do understand how reading them is essential to understanding data governance. Prof Raymond would also occasionally drop data governance jargon and not explain what they meant.",
    "The one weakness of this course was that it was sometimes unorganized. Feedback and information about assignments was sometimes late.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Raymond is one of the gems of the Global Affairs department. His experiences and ability to draw insights from them is remarkable. In addition, as he's still a pioneer in his field, you have the rare opportunity to take a class with someone who not only thoroughly understands the past of data governance but is actively paving the future of it. \r\nWeaknesses: 1 of the TF's made a point of inserting their political opinions in the class. Regarding the final paper, they said they would automatically lower your grade by a full mark - without even reading it - if your paper only included references by \"old white men\". Even if there is truth in the merits of drawing from a diverse set of authors and opinions, I thought it was ridiculous that a TF would openly declare such a grading standard.",
    "Strengths: Professor Raymond, readings were super interesting, lectures were engaging, assignments, essays, and exams were VERY FAIR. \r\nWeaknesses: my TF and discussion section - it was agreed upon by pretty much everyone that discussion sections were wasted time (it seemed for our TF too).",
    "As for strengths, Professor Raymond is both an engaging lecturer and an expert in this area. He is good at telling stories, and I always looked forward to lecture\/leminar. He was able to make the material feel imminently relevant and interesting. The TFs are also gems and worked hard to offer help\/assistance with papers, midterm, etc. For weaknesses, I'd say the class could sometimes feel disorganized. Reading assignments often came in late, as did some specifications on writing assignments, as did some grades, ... etc. Additionally, although lecture was nearly always \"engaging,\" sometimes it could be hard to follow the detailed dialogue of concepts that Prof Raymond would bring up. Especially in the second half of the semester, I felt that some concepts began to be presented in a more disparately-connected and not super-well-defined fashion, and new readings also dried up near the end of the semester. This said, NR and the TFs were always willing to clarify. As this was just the 2nd time the class was taught (and the first time in a larger setting), I would only expect it to become more organized. (If you're thinking of taking this, don't let the cons get you down - shop this course!)",
    "This course is excellently organized to facilitate student learning. Professor and TFs go out of their way to ensure student growth. Assignments are very well structured to facilitate material comprehension and test knowledge fairly.",
    "This course did a great job of conveying an understanding of data protection and what it would entail, in terms of political will, costs of action, and the fundamental underlying ethics of them.  \r\n\r\nIt's weaknesses were minimal",
    "Strengths: very engaging lectures, great structure (the course starts with the building blocks of experimentation and consent then leads up to contemporary issues), interesting readings\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes disorganized material",
    "Professor Raymond was the main strength of this course. His lectures were incredibly engaging. Every class I would leave with a new perspective on an issue of data governance or with a new idea for how a solution could be fixed. The essay assignments were fascinating and well-thought-out, and the readings were always relevant. Rarely do I read every page assigned for a course, but for this class I always made sure to allot the necessary time to make sure I fully understood everything since I knew how critical the material was to our current political and ethical state.\r\n\r\nThat said, one weakness of the course was that there were many classes with no readings because they were not assigned early enough. There was a great deal of material on the syllabus that I was incredibly excited to read, but due to lack of organization ended up being removed from the syllabus. If specific chapters and articles were posted at the beginning of the semester rather than on a week-by-week basis, I feel that we would have learned even more than we already did.\r\n\r\nOne major critique of this course I have is with the discussion section. I found it to be extremely unhelpful for thinking about the course material, especially since our class was already small enough to allow for discussion during class itself. Thus the discussion section was primarily just a review of lecture which was incredibly unnecessary considering that the material was taught incredibly clearly in lecture. There was also a lack of clarity about whether discussion sections were optional (per the syllabus). If they were simply going to be review sections, they should be optional. However if they are going to be required, they should be actually discussion-based.",
    "Strengths: Very engaging topics, great professor and teaching fellows, course assignments are fun and interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Can be disorganized (for students that like to get ahead, final paper prompt was posted near end of reading week)",
    "Strengths: the content and Professor Raymond. Professor Raymond took so much time to meet individually with students to go over their papers and concerns. You can tell he was extremely busy himself, but he always made time for one-on-one meetings. He was extremely dedicated to helping in anyway he could. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Since it was the first semester as a lecture class, the syllabus was a work in progress. I think it will be more set in stone the next time around but we often got the readings last minute.",
    "Professor Raymond's lectures were intriguing and engaging, although he tangent quite a bit into other topics. This was not necessarily a bad thing for the learning experience, since I was exposed to some intriguing real-world case studies. However, it was difficult to study for certain exams and to boil down the essential learning objectives for the course because of the tangential examples. Additionally, I felt like the discussion sections were not helpful in deciphering the readings, but was more of a reflection on the lecture. The readings were interesting and well-thought out, but since there was never any evaluative implications, there was rarely an incentive to do them.",
    "lectures were a little disorganized but the material was FASCINATING.",
    "Professor Raymond is the man. Brilliant, knowledgeable, and cares about his students. Also a great topic!",
    "Thought the course was set up really well. My only critique would be to send out the readings earlier because theyre substantial and its hard to complete if only given 2 days",
    "Strengths: interesting and topical\r\nWeaknesses: personally felt that Prof Raymond could be pretty reductive w\/ regard to complex issues, and the focus on how data governance applies to humanitarian aid seemed to unnecessarily limit the scope of the class. But its fine to take a class where you dont agree with everything the prof says, so if anything it is a strength that this course makes you think. Also disorganized and inconsistent grading.",
    "Professor Raymond is an excellent lecturer and he made class both enjoyable and extremely great for learning. He consistently connected topics to real world issues that are transpiring, and he would always take the time to explain concepts again if needed or take questions frequently during class. Also, the discussion sections were very useful and the personalized attention that was available upon request was great.",
    "This course has only strengths. Professor Raymond is an absolute expert in his field, and he knows how to shed light on the most dubious businesses of the tech companies. His knowledge, his ability to communicate it to the students as well as the importance and topicality of the discussed themes and cases will make you walk out of class astonished but also often shocked.",
    "The course material was very interesting and the assignment made sense. However, there was a lack of organization and communication often came later than promised. It would have been nice to have a more detailed written prompt for the final paper.",
    "Strengths: discussion of present-day events, breadth of topics, Professor Raymond's experience and background in the area. Weaknesses: lack of depth on any one topic. Unclear direction and guidelines for many assignments, and grading sometimes felt arbitrary. Midterm was pure memorization, which I don't believe fits the overall purpose of the course. Course team was disorganized at times (though I recognize that this is the first time the course is being offered as a lecture).",
    "One of the main strengths of this course were the fascinating lectures. I was never disengaged as there was never a dull day in class -- I was always learning surprising new things in an energetic and fun class atmosphere. The lack of weekly assignments gave me a chance to truly delve into the readings and forced me to put much more effort into the papers. I loved this class, definitely one of the best I've taken at Yale. Can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "I loved the leminar format. Professor Raymond somehow knew every student's name and often called on students who had asked a question related to the material or had some experience with the subject. His style was casual, but captivating. He frequently shared his experiences working on the front lines of humanitarian conflicts as evidence of the real-world consequences. He often incorporated current events and the second half of the semester was spent discussing recent controversies such as the 2016 election and Facebook's role in the genocide in Myanmar. No real weaknesses! This class was the highlight of my semester!"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to any student who wants to learn more about data governance and the effect data collection and retention has on individuals, whether its a person in America or a family in a refugee camp. Professor Raymond is also such a cool person who has such power in his profession, yet appears very humble.",
    "I would absolutely recommend! This class taught me so much. Global Affairs so often struggles with teaching students valuable practitioner lessons because they lack theoretical grounding, but Raymond balances practice and theory so perfectly in this class. This is a gem of not only Global Affairs, but Yale social science education in general. Everyoneespecially CS majorsshould take this class. To be honest, I think everyone, like the whole world, should take a class like this in some form. This class is basically intro tech policy education\/digital literacy when that still pedagogy still doesn't fully exist.",
    "Yes! Everyone needs to learn about the complete lack of data governance existing in the world today. This affects all of us, even if you don't realize it!",
    "I would really recommend this course to other students. The topic of data governance is very relevant, and class discussions often included current events. The inclusion of historic material really allowed me to understand the origins of data governance. There is a lot of freedom of topic choice for the final essay. I think anyone interested in the intersection of data and science and politics would enjoy this course.",
    "GLBL 395 is hands-down the best course I've taken at Yale and I would absolutely recommend it to any student, not just Global Affairs majors. \r\nFirstly, it helps students develop skills that are actually useful. For example, one of our essays focused on evaluating the privacy policy of an app\/company we know. Taking this class and working on the essay helped me develop confidence and ease in reading these obscure documents, which I previously avoided because they sounded cryptic and intimidating. But now, they make sense, and I can tell what kind of trade-offs I'm making when I use different apps.        \r\nThis class isn't particularly challenging grade-wise if you put in the work. For example, the TF's prepared a Study guide on all the topics related to the midterm, and Prof Raymond held several review sessions. If you attended at least one of the review sessions, you probably performed very well on the exam; the class average was relatively high. But overall, I would especially recommend this class if you have a strong pre-existing interest in data related issues or humanitarian affairs. Prof. Raymond actively tries to make himself accessible to students, and he has a wealth of stories to share that have extremely interesting insights. You will only make the most of this opportunity if you're willing to invest in doing most of the readings and setting out time to schedule meetings with him to discuss class stuff or his experiences.",
    "Yes. If you have the chance to take a class with Professor Raymond, please do. After taking this class, I feel much more armed with the proper tools to navigate our current data\/privacy environment.",
    "Yes! This course offers a critical look into social issues surrounding data and privacy in a way that people (\/we as a society) do not consider nearly enough. Whether this is an area you'd like to really work in or just become more informed about, I'd recommend it to anyone interested. Shop this course!",
    "Absolutely! If you are remotely interested in technology you must take this course!!!!!!!!!!",
    "I would highly recommend for Professor Raymond alone, who is quite a presence and commands a wealth of knowledge both on data protection and development.",
    "100%. You'll learn a ton",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to every student at Yale. I think that it does an excellent job of introducing the issues surrounding data governance in a way that is accessible both to global affairs students, computer science students, and others who are just interested in why there are so many congressional hearings with Mark Zuckerberg. I especially think all computer science students should take this course since I think it would force them to understand why the organizations they plan to work for after graduation are in many cases evil and maybe encourage them to work instead on improving or regulating these organizations and the technical field.",
    "Absolutely. It is crucial to understand the current landscape of data governance, especially for students planning on going into law or tech.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It is interesting and SO relevant to the way the world is unfolding in the 21st century. This course helped me figure out what I want to do with my life and Professor Raymond is a gem.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is intrigued by the way data informs the world we live in. I initially took this course out of a surface level interest, but left with a deep understanding about the complications of regulating data-based industries and with more questions that I entered - a good indication of deep learning.",
    "yes! just be prepared for disorganized lectures.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes 1000% take this course",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Regardless of what your major\/interests are, this course is so relevant to major events that are occurring in the real world. In the world we live in, large tech companies dominate much of what occurs online, and this class has helped me understand better how data is used and shared throughout society. Also, this class increases awareness for being literate about how your own personally identifiable information may be used. We learned about many of the different stakeholders that are involved in data governance, and this was really important in understanding the data industry (which I had never learned much about before).",
    "Yes, absolutely. This was the best class I've taken at Yale so far. Every student, regardless of being a CS student or a poli-sci student, should take this class if one is slightly interested in technology and how tech companies use our personal data. In my opinion, knowledge and awareness about data governance will be absolutely essential for the future.",
    "Yes, because even though I found this course to be dry and frustrating at times, its merits outweigh its negatives. It's sadly one of the few courses Yale offers in this area, and it's an exceedingly important area to be aware of as we discuss the role of technology, privacy, and data in society. Professor Raymond is great, has a witty sense of humor, and can easily find you opportunities in this space if that's what you're looking for.",
    "Take this class. Best class I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I really got a lot out of it. If you are interested somewhat in the dynamics of how technology is influencing our species, what actors are responsible for invoking change, and fundamentally what is so important about online data, TAKE THIS CLASS! Its a phenomenal class that really gives you historical, sociological, and global perspectives towards data.",
    "Avoid this class by any means necessary. Nathaniel Raymond is an entertaining lecturer, but has no idea how to develop coherent lectures. He managed to teach a class on data governance without talking about Cambridge Analytica how is this possible?! NR focused WAY too much on humanitarian issues, and could not seem to answer questions that were asked during class. The Yale administration should investigate his teaching methods, which are utterly impractical to the modern student. Even if you love data, or want to find out more about current issues in data policy, know that this class will not be the best conduit to explore your interests. I seriously regret taking this course.",
    "I would recommend this class in a second! An extremely relevant topic and necessary to know. Data and privacy rights will define the future of society and the idea of democracy. This class is universally applicable and accessible. Fair workload, incredible instructor, and fascinating material. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale."
