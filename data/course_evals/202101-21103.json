                "I think the strength is the small class format, allows for more interaction between the students and the teacher. I think the only weakness to this course, is it covers subjects a bit too fast. The book is 10 chapters, and I honestly think that as a student, I would learn more, and have a higher quality understanding if we went a bit slower in class, and only covered 7 or 8 chapters.",
                "Great job engaging students with methods used and the textbook was interesting with the dialogue",
                "The only criticism I have is that the professors do not cover any new vocabulary outside of the textbook or cultural aspects that are relevant today. I know that they have a strict curriculum that is already difficult to fit into one semester, but I think they could easily incorporate more common colloquial phrases into each chapter or show us more examples of Chinese food, transportation, shopping malls, etc during those units. Not to be tested on, but just to give us a better understanding of how we can practically use the language if we were to visit.",
                "The course is very well structured. Every homework assignment has a combination of reading, listening, and writing exercises, which help develop the three main skill areas in foreign language. Although the course proceeds at a fast pace, the material is explained clearly and efficiently, so that you never feel lost. Also, the small class size fosters a tight-knit learning environment."

                "I found the teaching style very effective, even over zoom. The worst part about online class was that I had no incentive to practice my writing. Since the tests and homework mostly required us to type the characters, it was easy to get away with not having to practice writing every day. I also wish there was more opportunity to get to know our classmates, perhaps by giving us more time in breakout rooms.",
                "All students were required to have their camera on during the lessons. This contributed to a tighter sense of community in the class, in spite of our being on Zoom. Sometimes, we would be assigned to breakout rooms to practice speaking with other students in our class. The breakout rooms, too, helped me get to know people in the class. However, the rooms were sometimes kept open for more time than we needed to complete the assigned activities. As a result, we would sometimes hang around without anything specific to do in the breakout room, which might not be the best use of class time."

I found the one-on-one sessions with the professor every Wednesday very helpful and the weekly tutorial sessions were great for practicing my reading and speaking skills.",
