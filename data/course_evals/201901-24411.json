   "comments": [
    "how to write a paper with a problem, claim, evidence, etc.",
    "I learned how to synthesize multiple works together into one coherent essay. I also learned that it is important to focus on incorporating my own opinion and points into the essay instead of just talking about the works cited.",
    "Writing skills for a variety of different types of pieces; participating in group",
    "Improved the way in which I write and revise papers. Taught me how to research a topic, come up with a claim, and write a research paper.",
    "The best course to take as an incoming freshman if you have not written extensively before.\r\n\r\nThis course really developed my writing.",
    "I learned how to structure and write an academic essay, especially with regard to the self.",
    "how to write a research paper. how to write in a concise and effective way.",
    "I learned that there are many different perspectives and ways to examine the self: using freewill, transhumanism, AI, etc. Different philosophers also have different opinions on what the self is. I realized how difficult it is to define the self because it is constantly changing. This class also helped me improve my writing abilities. Prior to this class, I never really focused much on the revision process but English 114 really taught me the importance of editing my works.",
    "This was a great class that provided a lot of multi-disciplinary skill development. We spent time learning to read critically,  analyze artwork, parse through complex philosophy, and most importantly, write well. English 114 offers students the time to really dive into their writing pieces, and then also plenty of time to revise. There is a lot of emphasis on learning to revise based on teacher feedback, which is super helpful for all Yale students."

   "comments": [
    "papers were very close together. felt like just moving from one to another very quickly",
    "This is a really great intro writing course with interesting material, thoughtfully chosen readings, and engaging essay prompts. The 114 approach to the essay is structured enough to guide but not so much that it stifles creativity and personal style. Craig is an exceptional professor who cares about each student and gives very constructive feedback for improvement between drafts and papers. Sometimes the class felt a bit rushed so, while definitely understanding that this is the nature of fast-paced college courses, maybe cutting a reading or group project would allow for full analysis of fewer writing samples rather than touching upon a larger number.",
    "I really enjoyed this course--the topics were all incredibly interesting to read and think about. Additionally, I thought the course was structured in a way that really enabled us to improve as writers (ie. by letting us do multiple drafts). The only improvement I would make would be to allow for more discussion about the readings.",
    "Extremely well taught",
    "The professor is fantastic, and the class was always engaging and the readings and papers manageable. Perhaps it should cut down on some of the content and focus on it a bit more - often we wouldn't do a subject justice.",
    "Overall, I really enjoyed the structure of the course. It was really organized and the topics flowed really nicely. I liked that we had a movie in the middle and that we were able to read so many different types of writing. The essays were paced out in a nice way and there was enough time to do everything. \r\n\r\nSometimes however, I felt there was a lack of discussion among the students compared to the seminar class I took last semester (but this can just be because these two are different). I expected more discussion about the pieces we read",
    "I really liked the material that was covered, but it was just too much material to really be able to dive in. I loved looking into philosophy of the self (that section got the most air-time). And while I was so interested in the AI unit, the identity unit, the transhumanism unit, the religion unit, we really  were only able to spend like a week on each."

   "comments": [
    "no it was kinda boring and i'm sure there are better writing credits that are more interesting and fun",
    "Yes. I would first recommend that every student take a small seminar-style course, and this one is especially strong. There is a great mix of philosophical and scientific analyses of the self, which allows students to each display their strengths and focus on a topic that they are truly passionate about for the research paper. The topic not too niche that it limits the educational experience; it is essentially about the human experience, so most students will find some part of it that they really identify with.",
    "Yes, I very much enjoyed this course. It pushed my thinking in a number of areas while also pushing my writing ability, yet offered me enough support and structure so that the work was never overwhelming.",
    "Yes, as a first year this course was filled with interesting ideas and useful skills.",
    "yes. Professor Eklund made this class interesting and exciting.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student especially someone who wants to improve their writing. This class has helped tremendously in improving my writing ability and idea synthesis.",
    "Yes! I think it was a wonderful seminar experience -- not too much work, really  interesting topic, and a great space to develop your writing."
