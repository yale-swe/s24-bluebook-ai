Academically speaking, I learned about how to construct arguments in a wholistic manner, addressing the counterarguments while ensuring that they weren't just straw man examples.",

These included the notion that death is the end (there is no afterlife), immortality is undesirable, and suicide can in some circumstances make sense. I found myself instantly and intuitively agreeing with all of these, but over the course of the semester, I gained a more robust philosophical justification for these beliefs, as well as being challenged to think more deeply about related concepts like personal identity and temporality.",

What does it mean to live forever, and do we even want to? This course was a great exploration of these questions, and many more. It also helped with developing the ability to formulate philosophical arguments about deeply confusing topics.",

                "The course was fascinating, however, it may have been better as a seminar or if Prof. Kagan had invited some other philosophy professors or even the TAs to engage in a little argumentation - this would have made the lecture a little less one-sided. Of course, Prof. Kagan is a fantastic lecturer and the class really forces you to think about life's harder questions.",
                "Shelly is an amazingly engaging professor and lectures are very interesting. Class is graded very harshly.",
                "Prof Kagan remains one of Yale's best lecturers, but the content could at times get a bit repetitive, especially for those with experience in the department - it is definitely an introductory class. Also, unlike Intro Ethics, Prof Kagan does not play his cards close to the chest and tells you upfront what he believes to be true about Death - this does take some fun out of it, occasionally shifting the dynamic from us being informed to us being convinced. FWIW, the grading is not remotely as bad as prior reviews might have you believe.",
                "ITS SO HARD\r\nDO NOT TAKE THIS AS UR FIRST PHILOSOPHY CLASS\r\nPEOPLE ARE GOING TO TELL YOU TO TAKE IT AND CREDIT D FAIL IT BECAUSE IT IS A FAMOUS CLASS BUT DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM",

                "strengths: you get to learn about a lot of topics in philosophy because death is a good fodder for branching out into various subjects \r\nweaknesses: the papers are graded way too harshly and often you can write them without needing to know what happened in class. it would be nice if assignments were more related to class discussion\/material.",
                "Strengths are his knowledge and lecturing style. No weaknesses.",
                "The strengths of this course were definitely Professor Kagan and the format of the class itself. The weakness was how much Professor Kagan scared people about grades throughout the semester. I also feel like I didn't necessarily get good feedback on how my writing or discussion participation could be improved.",
                "loved the lectures and the level of readings.",
                "It could definitely be improved due to the harsh grading system and the lack of feedback from the TF about how we can improve our writing and discussion participation. However, it is definitely an interesting topic and was a great lecture overall.",
                "I can't praise the course enough. Possibly having short video summaries of the lectures, or lecture notes to accompany the lecture would be nice so I could spend more time focusing on the material.",
                "Strengths - cool lecture ideas, low workload, fun sections where you debate about different topics of death",
                "It felt like an intro course, often to the detriment of the material being discussed. Lectures really didn't feel all that necessary, and some of them spent time on trivial examples that didn't need to be discussed.",
                "Strengths of the course are the vast range of arguments we explored and the interesting readings we were assigned. The sections were also a strength.",

Sections are student-led and there are ample opportunities to talk about what interests you. Low workload - only three five-page papers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Grading on papers is harsh - I wouldn't have taken this course without Credit\/D\/Fail. No motivation to perform readings as they are only very tangentially related to in-class material, especially in the latter half of the course.",
                "Good lectures presented in an interesting\/passionate way. Can get slightly repetitive but that is not necessarily bad.",
                "Shelly Kagan is incredible -- lectures make this course one of the best courses at Yale. Your section is very TF-dependent, however, and so you can end up having a terrible section and not enjoying the course as much.",
                "The strengths of this course are that the content generally accepts varying perspectives, welcoming and acknowledging objections and rebuttals while also providing insightful counterarguments to facilitate deeper understanding. The weaknesses of the course center around the lack of organization and presentation of lectures, which could easily allow for students to get lost in the professor's logic or lose their focus in lecture. Getting straightforward answers was a challenge.",
                "Overall good course. The grading very tough but good, as for it forces growth.",
                "There almost seems to never be enough time in section to flush out ideas.",
                "Strengths are the style of the course, with most information coming from Shelly himself to evaluate in front of an audience. Since philosophy can be very confusing and revolves around the entertainment of objections, Shelly's handling of questions was an excellent feature of class. Not only did it make Shelly more convincing, but it also ensured that students felt heard and involved in a class with 250+ students. Another huge strength of the class was the general feel. There was a very casual feel to the class and the work wasn't particularly high-intensity, all of the emphasis was placed on the ideological content that we were covering and all your effort was meant to go to understanding the concepts explored and evaluating them on your own. That was a huge strength of the class that facilitated much learning and individual exploration of philosophical concepts.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course may be the lack of standardized instruction on how to write philosophy papers before the paper prompts come out. Philosophy writing is very difficult and different depending on the kind of philosophy being practiced, so it;'s not really a subject to take to peer tutors or the Poorvu center to get help on. My education on philosophical writing was dependent upon my TF, who happened to be very helpful but that wasn't the case for all TF's.",
                "Strengths: Prof Kagan lectures even though they are available online if you don't wanna come. But he has a magnetic energy. I also liked that there were only three papers that was good as well.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Harsh grading. But just take pass\/fail to avoid this.",
                "Strengths: Content. Shelly. Everyone should take this course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: TAs and Discussions. TAs and Discussions are both really hit or miss and stressful because of grading. I understand the need to grade harshly, but there should be more rewrite opportunities.",
                "grading is overly strict, discouraged any real effort\/taking the course for a grade",
                "Strengths: The course gets your mind working on how to coherently think about questions surrounding personhood and death. Also, the fact that Shelley presents his own opinions in the class makes the course more interesting, since it feels that something is at stake. Weaknesses: Yet, because Shelley uses the class to make his own arguments it often feels like he strawmans opposing arguments, or dismisses them too quickly. For example, after spending about a month on the question of whether or not souls exist, he concludes that they do not exist without presenting any positive arguments in favor of this position. He justifies this by arguing something like, \"you can't prove the nonexistence of anything,\" and then just moves on. This argument seems extremely questionable at best, and I would have liked for Shelley to have been less hasty at such a critical point in the course's development.",
                "While I understand that this is an introductory philosophy course, I found the content of the beginning of the course to be relatively basic, although that might just be because I personally have no interest in the question of souls. While I found the latter half of the course much more interesting, I still think the pacing was a little slow, although that did ensure we covered each topic in depth.",
                "Dr. Kagan is a very engaging lecturer, making a class of 200 feel personal and intimate. He did a great job of covering very complicated topics in an easy to understand way, with lots of examples and real life applications. My only complaint about the course was that it felt that a lot of topics were brought up and then brushed past, but this seems inevitable when trying to cover so many things in just a semester.",
                "This course is a pretty good introductory course in philosophy, and the discussion sections are helpful for going over the material Shelly covers in lecture. And most of the readings were pretty interesting.",
                "Worst grading of any course at yale and he prides himself on it.",
                "well structured and lecture was super interesting. sometimes we spend a bit too long on some topics and too little time on others, but thats fine. grading is not too harsh on the upper end of the range, very harsh on the lower end. i mean its just as hard to get an A\/A- as in any other course, but where other courses sort of bottom out at B-, shelly will use the whole range all the way down. So if u write a paper that would be a B\/B- in another class, it could be a C- in this.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kagan is a great lecturer, the material is super interesting. Readings are well chosen and blessedly short.\r\nWeaknesses: grading can be a little harsh, especially if you're not prepared for that",
                "I don't love Shelly's lecture style, it feels to me that he doesn't make an effort to argue against what is clearly his own points. What he does believe, however, he supports with rock solid logic.",
                "strengths: readings and discussions were meaningful\/changed my perspective\r\n\r\nweaknesses: not a lot of help with the papers. feedback was good, but impossible to get an a with",
                "Strengths - amazing class that really challenges your thinking and perspectives on death, sections were a source for great discussion because participation was a large part of your grade (and they grade participation strictly), papers were fun to write and challenging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - some of the readings were quite dense and long and little guidance was given on how to actually write a philosophy paper. Also some of the lectures were quite repetitive, with the same topics emphasized over and over again.",
                "strength: so fascinating \r\nweakness: i wish the lectures and readings married better together! sometimes i had the feeling that one could very well get away with not doing the readings, as the material was not always touched on in lecture, or expanded upon",
                "I appreciated the style of lecture, which involved opportunities for student engagement. The content was also very interesting. However, at times I felt we spent too much time per topic. That being said, a lot of the content is interconnected, so this may be hard to change.",
                "The strengths of this course come from the discussion sections, which were very helpful for discussing the ideas of the course and for practicing philosophical conversations. The weaknesses of the course stem from the grading system. The course is known to be difficult for grading, but I believe the grading system used in this course is too harsh for an intro philosophy course",
                "It is a hard class with difficult grading on the papers. I wish I had known the standards excepted of students who were looking to gain an introduction to philosophy. Unfortunately, philosophy is a serious and rigorous department which requires a solid foundation and understanding to succeed.",
                "The strength of this course are that it is a very interesting and important subject presented in an engaging professor. A potential weakness is that there is a not a direct way in which the course readings are necessary, which means students may choose not to do all, or any, or the readings.",
                "strength: Shelly is definitely engaging and have fun examples in the lecture content; the content is very thought provoking\r\nweaknesses: sometime he has too strong personal styles and may be biased on some arguments; also his grade is strict",
                "Strengths: Kagan is an excellent lecturer, the content is very interesting and at some points relevant to life. The course is also a very good introduction to philosophy in that there is more focus on intuition and logic than on knowing famous philosophers or works, which makes the content accessible. The workload is fairly light, and the papers are graded seriously. Professor Kagan is approachable and happy to talk with students.\r\nWeaknesses\/improvements: discussion section could at times be a little disorganized - it felt at times that there were a few too many people for a real conversation to take place. The focus on intuition was nice for accessibility, but at times made discussions difficult since different people had different ideas about what terms meant.",
                "Strengths  very interesting\r\nWeaknesses  harsh grading",
                "The strengths are the lectures and discussion sections. I found them very fruitful, engaging, and interesting. A weakness is how grading is done. It feels like there is a quota on how many people can do well.",
                "nothing to change",
                "I loved this course. The grading isn't easy, but it's not as hard as I anticipated\/heard about. I enjoyed the paper prompts as well.",
                "Very interesting and practical topics to assess death. Grading is rough and should be taken credit\/D\/fail but still worthwile"

                "Yes, it is a fantastic intro philosophy course and a really good change of pace from STEM and other humanities classes.",
                "yes - Shelly is an amazing lecturer but take it credit\/d. The grading is unnecessarily hard but the class is worth taking for the material.",
                "Yes, especially if you have not taken a class with Shelly before.",
                "i would not recommend because it was unnecessarily hard and felt like a waste of my time",
                "Yes. People say the grading is hard but it's really not. No need to Cr\/D.",
                "yes! but credit\/d it.",
                "Yes, take a class with Shelly to learn about philosophy and how to think differently.",
                "Definitely, but only if you are going to take it Credit\/D\/Fail. It makes the class 20x more enjoyable that way.",
                "100%. Kagan is brilliant",
                "I would not simply because of the harsh grading curve and the competitiveness of the discussion section. I was always on edge during section and felt like I was dying for my grade.",
                "As much as I possibly could. This was the best course I've taken at Yale. It made me remember why I wanted to be here and fully delivered as a course that taught me how to think, reason, and ponder at a deep level.",
                "If you want an interesting and low workload class then yes.",
                "not sure",
                "I would recommend this course to another students who is after an intellectual challenge. The student must keep in mind that the class is graded on a difficult scale and they might not expect similar grades to what they are used to in other classes.",
                "Yes. Choose credit d fail and this is a wonderful class",
                "Yes if you take it pass fail",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. However, given the introductory nature of this philosophy course, I would make sure they understand that without prior experience in philosophy they should not expect to get a good grade.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in a relatively low-workload course that allows you to explore difficult topics and exercise philosophic reasoning skills.",
                "Yes! Take this course if you are interested in the topic and willing to adapt your writing style to what Kagan wants. Changes the way you approach thinking about death and arguments in general.",
                "YES -- but take it Credit\/D\/Fail if you are not a philosophy major and care about your GPA. This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, and it only comes up once every couple of years so do not pass up on it. The 3 essays are quite easy to write, but you will be graded harshly.",
                "Yes, I found it very insightful and thought-provoking. I often found myself discussing the arguments of the course outside of the classroom, or at least thinking about them myself. I will admit, however, that some of the argumentative strategies inherent in a philosophy class can be frustrating, due to the nature of a class rooted in arguments without proof.",
                "Yes, A very interesting class however you may be better off getting it from Yale open courses.",
                "Yes!",
                "Definitely. Fascinating content with amazing faculty, constantly interesting and engaging lectures, an amazing experience and extremely helpful for those that struggle with facing mortality or in the grieving process. Absolutely had therapeutic aspects that greatly helped me and revolutionized the way I understand the philosophical concepts explored. Very low stress, work, and intensity while having extremely interesting and engaging content.",
                "Would recommend this course for sure, there are a lot of really interesting topics (mind-body dualism, personal identity), and by thinking more about these topics, we might realize that many of our commonsense notions might be unjustified (and likely wrong). This class definitely changed\/sharpened my views about some fundamental problems, like what makes a person the same over time.",
                "Yes, I would recommend taking this class pass\/fail. It was very interesting and fun course!",
                "Very interesting perspectives on Death, definitely not what you are expecting but still very interesting",
                "YES! Credit D Fail it but you will not regret taking this course. If anything, it might be one of the only courses I still remember on my death bed.",
                "only as a credit\/d",
                "If you just want to practice some mental\/philosophical gymnastics than yes, I recommend this course. If you are actually looking for metaphysical truths about life, the human person, and death, you will likely not find it in this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to people who have never taken a philosophy course before and want to try it out but would likely recommend a different course to those with experience taking philosophy.",
                "Yes - Shelly is a great lecturer. It was a great and intellectually rewarding experience writing the three papers.",
                "Yes - the questions discussed throughout the course are ones that everyone asks themselves at one point or another. This course offers a chance to think about the assumptions and implications surrounding death in a structured way. The content will feel relevant to everyone, and the methods of thinking about it will be useful for similar questions we are all bound to have throughout our lives.",
                "I would recommend this to someone who wants to take a pretty chill intro philosophy class. The only thing you should be aware about is Shellys infamous hard grading (which isnt too bad if you pay attention to class, do some readings and dont write your papers last minute).",
                "Anyone remotely interested in this class should sit in for at least a lecture, which I believe would convince them to take the class. However, if they really dislike the main form of assignment for the class (papers) and are taking the class for a grade, it may not be for them.",
                "Eh you can find all of the material online. Dont waste a yale credit on it.",
                "Yes! Shellys a good lecturer and the course is very little work. grading is not too bad, and, relativized to the low workload, its a bargain.",
                "Yes! I loved this class. Shelly is great. Everyone should take a class with him. And don't get scared off by his reputation as a hard greater - you can always credit\/D this class if you need to.",
                "Be ready to not do well in this class as it is graded harshly, but be ready to learn. If you came to Yale for grades, avoid. If you came to learn, take it.",
                "yes, again, you learn to ask why you believe something and reflect on it",
                "Yes, if you want to be intellectually challenged and take a dive into philosophy, especially if you are interested in exploring what it actually means to die. this course definitely changed my perspective on death and challenged me to think in ways that I never had before!",
                "Definitely! Great way to get exposure to philosophy, Shelly is a fantastically engaging lecturer.",
                "absolutely, especially if they are afraid of death",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the material and the topic of death are very interesting to focus on for an entire semester. I would, however, caution any student taking the course that the grading will be unreasonably harsh.",
                "Not really. I struggled in this course and didn't gain the fruitful experience I was looking to attain by enrolling in the class. I thought the class structure wasn't meant for my learning type.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student because death is something that is relevant to the lives of all people, and this class is a great way to explore and learn about a very interesting subject. It is also a good class for students to take if they want to see what a philosophy course is like.",
                "Recommend as a Credit D course if you want to have a lot of thought experiments with Shelly and enjoy his interesting lecture! (His grading criteria is strict, though, and he has some biases in his arguments) There's a lot of interesting material and the workload is not that much, but be prepared of hard papers and intensive discussion sections :)\r\nAlso, very different from typical philosophy courses!",
                "Yes, absolutely",
                "I would recommend this course to other students, especially if you havent taken another philosophy class before; I felt it printed me to think in a way that I hadnt had to for most classes before.",
                "Yes! Lectures were always interesting and even fun, and discussions generally were as well. The course works as an introduction to philosophy and will teach you how to structure an argument, and there's no previous experience required to get a lot out of the class.",
                "Yes  it's a good introduction to philosophy, but beware of taking it for a letter grade.",
                "I would. I thought this course was really interesting and I really learned how to think deeply and I think I improved my writing as well.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. Philosophy is incredibly enjoyable, and this course is a great introduction to the subject. At the very least, a student will leave with worthwhile perspectives on life, death, and identity, if not a passion for a new area of study.",
                "yes",
                "Yes! It's super interesting, the lectures were enjoyable, and especially the sections were a ton of fun and I learned a lot from my TA.",
                "Yes !! It was honestly such a fun unique course that is applicable much more than the generous fear we have about death and beyond. I also enjoyed how much I learned about forming philosophical arguments"
