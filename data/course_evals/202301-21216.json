                "This course expects a lot of outside involvement, which to me, I view as a major positive. I don't always get the best view of the Deaf community through an early class. However, by going outside of the classroom, we can interact with the Deaf and signing community in beautiful ways. I feel like this class has lots of built-in review which lends itself well to learning. I would say a weakness of this course would be the online signing workbook. The class can feel disjointed with this attachment because often, there are signs used in the homework that we don't talk about in class, which can dock your homework grade. Other than that, phenomenal class!",

                "Absolutely. ASL is the best language and community to be a part of here at Yale. The teachers clearly care about the students and their learning. I find myself incorporating sign language into so many parts of my day. Accessibility is critical, and this class is a great way for students to get involved in making the world more friendly through accessibility.",
