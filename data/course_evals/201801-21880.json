    "Valuable life skills and work experience. I learned how to conduct myself in a work office environment, psychobehavioral treatment methods, mood assessments, etc.",

    "independent research rocks!",
    "Very helpful in preparation for research on a thesis or in the future.",
    "This course allows you to work closely with a mentor who has experience and knowledge of the the field you're interested in. It's great exposure to how research works and allows you to experience it firsthand. It allowed me to develop a great professional relationship with a grad student with whom I feel comfortable going to for academic advice. He also offered me constant feedback on my work (such as my writing), which was very helpful in several of my other classes as well. It can seem like a lot of work some weeks and not enough others; you have to be able to structure your time well.",
    "Professor Clark always made time to meet with me. She helped direct me in the best ways of researching information.",
    "Professor Baskin-Sommers is an excellent researcher and PI.",
    "I found this course to be great. I think it is very important that the course requirements are determined between the lab advisor and the student, as this helped me be in constant communication with my advisor as to what I should be doing. I found this course to be very helpful for future planning regarding my senior thesis."

    "I would recommend this course to any motivated student interested in research. You get out of the course what you put into it, so if you're willing to put a lot of effort and work in, you'll definitely get a lot of this course.",
    "Yes. It was a great way to put knowledge learned in my other courses into actual practice.",
