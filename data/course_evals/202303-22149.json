                "By taking DS Philosophy, I became a far stronger writer, annotator, critical thinker, and speaker. I gained a much better understanding of historical events in the Western canon, compromising Greek and Latin culture. Taking DS was a big event for me, stepping out of my comfort zone. Although DS advertised itself as a program that was welcoming to students with no experience in the humanities, as I was, I was still scared of the learning curve I had to surmount in the face of many students who were well-versed in these texts. I learned how to manage my time better and, with encouragement from Professor Inwood, approach each text with curiosity and a spirit to learn something new rather than a sense of just \"getting through it.\" I truly learned the importance of these texts and the significance of learning them. As a lover and writer of historical fiction, I feel that my worldview and perspective on the past have grown exponentially. I also learned how to think and extract political meanings from texts and treatises. We faced a variety of perspectives and opinions throughout the different writers we read, and learning to dissect their arguments and understand where they are coming from based on circumstance, environment, and upbringing is something I feel will benefit me as I prepare to major in Global Affairs or Ethics, Politics, and Economics. Overall, the new knowledge, skills, and insights I gained and developed during this course were invaluable.",
                "Lots of in-depth knowledge of the first thousand years or so of Western philosophy. Also developed strong writing skills--particularly the balance of precision and readability that's important in philosophical writing. Finally, we got good practice outlining and analyzing arguments.",
                "This course helped me develop my analytical faculties. It enhanced my ability to dissect arguments and think critically. Moreover, the course introduced me to many great thinkers and schools of thought."

                "The course is magnificent.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Great selection of philosophical works that enabled me to appreciate how Western philosophy developed over time\r\n- The lectures were consistently strong, and helped me much better understand the philosopher we were studying\r\n- Prof. Inwood's seminars gave mean effective introduction to the construction and analysis of philosophical arguments\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Prof. Inwood's feedback on essays sometimes was meager, especially compared to my other two first semester DS professors\r\n- Sometimes our class discussions strayed away from the texts, so we didn't get through all the material we read",
                "The strengths of DS Philosophy lay in the syllabus of works, the discussion-based format, the intimate classroom sizes, the professors, the guest lectures, and the essays. The syllabus of works is far-reaching, expansive, thoughtful, masterfully curated, significant, and enjoyable. Each reading built off the last in some way, and my class was always making connections between books we had read prior. The discussion-based format, in my opinion, was the best way for the class to function. The professor started by asking an open-ended question, usually on the context of the writing or author, and our answers would guide the discussion. Our classroom sizes were about fifteen students each. This was really great. Not only did I make some really amazing friends in my sections, but I also felt it gave everyone an equal chance to speak and share their opinions. The professors were amazing and nothing but helpful. This extends into our guest lectures. All were enthusiastic and filled with amazing information, allowing me to conceptualize our readings better. The essays were also a really great part of the course. Professor Inwood and my other DS professors would give us essay topics about two weeks before they were due, allowing us ample time to plan, outline, and write. The essay topics were expansive and thought-provoking, and we were also allowed to propose our own topics. Overall, I do not have any weaknesses on the part of the course that I consider. I think the classes would benefit from being longer. At the moment, they are one hour and fifteen minutes long. Sometimes, our discussions would be so interesting, but we would need more time to go deeper or address a certain topic. This is just a nitpick, however. I have no cons about the course.",
                "As in all DS courses, the strengths and weaknesses all tend to stem from the amount of content covered in a short time. The total page count for philosophy is probably a good bit shorter than in the other tracks, but the readings are a lot denser and require closer reading (sometimes even to understand what's going on at all). The course offers a very solid foundation in philosophical reasoning and a strong overview of the early developments in philosophy. Compared to the other DS courses, you feel like you are getting a more holistic understanding of everything you read (granted we skip a ton of important texts). Nonetheless, the main weakness is that you feel like you lose some detail with the sheer amount of information covered. Many of the late Hellenistic philosopher started to blend together just because we moved through them so fast (studying for the final helps you straighten things out in your head).",
                "The strength of the course can be found in its teacher. Professor Inwood has the keenest intellect of any person I have met in my life. His powers of analysis and rhetoric greatly enhanced the learning experience. In terms of feedback, I think the class would have benefited from greater student participation in the discussions. I would attribute the lack of class-wide participation to the difficulty of some of the material. Perhaps, by beginning discussion on complex topics with a brief summary of important points, student participation could be enhanced."

                "YES",
                "Yes. Of course, if you're taking DS, you'll have to take DS philosophy, and if you're not taking DS, you can't take it. But for what it's worth, this class provided me with a really solid introduction to the foundational ideas of classical Western philosophy. If you are taking DS, you do have some degree of choice about which professor you'll get. With that said, on the whole, I thought Prof. Inwood was a pretty effective instructor. He's incredibly knowledgeable about ancient philosophy, which is his area of expertise, and always provided satisfying answers to any questions I had, both in and outside of class. During some seminars, though, I think Prof. Inwood could have done a better job at managing class discussions. We didn't always get through all the readings, dwelling on some ideas at the expense of others. Especially during our Aristotle unit, seminars comprised Prof. Inwood lecturing for most of the class, with some Q&A tacked on. His explanations were very helpful and informative, to be sure, but the more lecture-heavy style of classes didn't always make for the most engaging seminar experience.",
                "Yes, I recommend DS Philosophy and Directed Studies in general to another student. The attitude on campus toward DS is that it is a massive undertaking that many do not enjoy. However, I disagree entirely. Through DS, I've met the most interesting professors and the most amazing students and learned so many amazing things. These are books and stories that most people intend to read during their lives but never get the chance or never find the time. The fact that I was able to experience all of these great works at eighteen years old and do it in an intellectually stimulating and supportive environment was amazing. It is a lot of work and a lot of reading. You'll have to think outside the box sometimes, and your essays may not always hit the mark you were wishing for, but overall, DS is a growing and learning experience. DS taught me so much about myself and others, about how I work and how I handle challenges. The self-reflection I gained from doing DS was amazing. I would most definitely recommend DS to another student. It's been an experience of a lifetime.",
                "I would strongly recommend. Brad Inwood is a great professor, very engaged and engaging, and he knows the texts for the first 2/3 of the semester incredibly well (you'll notice he's the translator/editor for a few of our books).\r\nAs for the DS philosophy curriculum in general, this is a really solid foundation in both the methods and the critical history of Western philosophy, whether you're a humanities major or not.",
                "I would recommend this course! I learned so much and am grateful to have had the opportunity to take this class."
