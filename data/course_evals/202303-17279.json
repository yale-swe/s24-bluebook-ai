                "This course provided me with an understanding of the technical knowledge and background necessary to understand what led to the GFC. I learned about the role of financial institutions in our broader economy and why safeguards are important in preventing economic turmoil. Each module provided a new piece of information for understanding what contributed to the GFC. We also learned about the regulatory aftermath and what to keep in mind to prevent future crises. Most importantly, I left this course with the skills to critically analyze the crisis and understand literature, academic papers, and research pertaining to the GFC.",
                "Research skills, various terms and concepts concerning finance, writing about finance, interpreting data",
                "This course allowed me to analyze the causes and components of the 2008 financial crisis. It also helped me become more familiar with financial terminology that I had not been well-exposed to through my previous economics classes.",
                "This course gives a very informative view into the different pieces of the financial system, how they fit together, and how its inherent fragilities can lead to financial crises.  Prof Metrick jokes that taking this course doesnt develop any real skills (following that the only thing we learned is that there is no such thing as a pure liquidity crisis) but the structure of the weekly memo assignments gave me lots of practice reading and analyzing economics literature, an exercise missing from many of the economics courses at Yale.",
                "Extensive knowledge on the 2008 financial crisis causes and opinions.",
                "I acquired a special understanding of financial economics and economics policymaking. I also learnt more about writing memos.",
                "I learned a lot about the financial crisis in this course. I came in with a narrative in my head of how the crisis unfolded. I found that while I did have certain aspects correct, I was wildly off on other points.",

This course is built really well for anyone to understand so even if youve never taken a finance or economics course you will come out feeling like you understand both the GFC and the US banking system in general. We also had to write a lot of memos which I found really helpful because that is the type of writing that is probably applicable to future jobs. They helped me develop my research skills and to be able to take a slew of information and succinctly put it into a response to a question.",

                "This course arguably taught me more than any other course I have taken at Yale so far. In addition to learning about the causes and responses to the GFC, I learned about how the U.S. financial sector functions. This class increased my financial literacy, and I now have the context necessary to pick up the Wall Street journal and understand current events in the financial world in a way I didnt before. I also developed skills for economics research and succinct writing through the memo exercises and gained more exposure for how to read and understand literature in economics.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the content and access to Professor Geithner. Professor Metrick's expertise in the subject. The amount of topics you cover in a short period of time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of the course was effectively taught online.",
                "Strengths: Professor Metrick is amazing and super engaging. The course is extremely well organized, the modules were interesting and informative. It is important to keep in mind that this course is a flipped classroom format, so you do have the responsibility of absorbing the more technical information before showing up the class and learning more about the application in the Q&A. Memos and papers allowed us to engage with academic papers, literature, and research which heavily contributed to my learning in this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Flipped classroom could be a weakness if that's not a format you prefer. I think I would appreciate more in-class learning toward the beginning of the semester, and perhaps a greater emphasis on the Q&A structure toward the end rather than jumping straight into Q&A. I definitely got more from the Q&A's as the semester progressed.",
                "Strengths: huge amounts of information, involvement of someone with first-hand experience in the GFC\r\nWeakness: lectures tend to be repetitive of modules",
                "The focus on written assignments for this class really forces you to understand what you are writing about, instead of just using memorization. At the same time though, some of the paper topics were not super relevant to the class material, making it difficult to master information for both.",
                "I think the coursera modules are very interesting and the memo topics are great. I wish class itself was a little more engaging. I felt that often the questions seemed someone tertiary to the primary focus of the course or rudimentary. Perhaps some of class could be spent more directly exploring the memo topics.",
                "This course was awesome and great for undergrads who want to take an SOM course with a medium workload and very great instructors. I would probably cut down on the amount of students allowed to enroll for a more personal experience.",
                "I believe that more content should be covered in class instead of answering questions on the Coursera modules.",
                "I just wish that the Coursera modules we watched as homework were what the class itself was actually about. It felt like I was taking an online course that also happened to meet in person. I was not very engaged in class because I felt like I wasn't actually learning anything. By the end of the semester, there was probably only 50% attendance.",
                "Strengths: Awesome professor, interesting material, interesting assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough structure in class, assignments given too often.",
                "Strengths: Metrick is an excellent lecturer. The course covers a very complicated topic quite well. Loved the movies at the end!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I really did not enjoy the flipped classroom. The modules themselves were good, but I just would've preferred to have them in class. I came into the class with no finance knowledge and found it hard to keep up, especially since it's much harder to ask clarification/understanding questions on the discussion threads since (a) it's sort of embarrassing lol (b) we didn't get credit for them since they were \"Google-able\" and (3) they often didn't get selected when they were asked. I also found it extremely hard to ask questions in class, as class discussion was dominated by ~5 men who were on a first name basis with the professor. It wasn't that I felt hostility when asking questions, but the barrier felt pretty high given the level of the class. I ended up feeling quite left behind. I also thought the class was probably too work intensive (4 memos instead of 6 would've made a big difference), but it's a grad class so I can't complain. I wish there was higher quality feedback on the memos, although I know it's hard in such a big class. I wish there were regular office hours, especially at the beginning of the semester when learning how to write the memos.",
                "Prof. Metrick is amazing! Every class is a joy. Sec. Geithner is a very smart individual, but his lectures were quite boring. \r\n\r\nGrading is a mess. Could never tell the difference between a memo I got an 8 on compared to a 6. \r\n\r\nThe class takes a lot of effort. The flipped classroom adds a lot of time to the class. The memos take at least 4 hours to complete. Quizzes take time too. The reading response and final paper take years!",
                "The course had a great lectures and interesting content, though the papers were graded too harshly in my opinion",
                "I don't think the reverse lecture style works well.",
                "Too much writing not to be a writing credit",
                "Not be asynchronous. Takes away from the engagement. The best lectures were not the ones following an online module.",
                "Weaknesses are the flipped classroom in my opinion",
                "The weekly memos and two papers do in fact add up to be a significant amount of work due to the topics attempting to be GPT-proof. The prompts are much more complex than what we would discuss and learn in class. The memos are often difficult to do well in because grading is quite strict and you are left to do the research (academic and news) on your own without much guidance from the class. However, if self research and learning is your jam, then you will leave this class having learned an impressive amount.",
                "The flipped class style Im usually not a fan of but here it worked incredibly well. The modules were effective and then coming into class to have a Q and A from prof metrick was amazing. He and Geithner are both fun to have in class so its overall very engaging. I found the memos to be hard work but an overall strength because they feel applicable to real life. The one small con I have is that all the grades for memos and essays are out of 8 points which makes it so you cant get an A- grade on any one assignment. If you dont write one of the better memos you basically get a B+ which is what about 50% of the class gets it seems on memos. Luckily you can make up for it on other generous grading portions of the final grades like the quizzes and community contributions. I also found that sometimes the feedback wasnt all that helpful, for example I got a 7/8 on a memo and the feedback written was well written memo while I appreciated the compliment I wanted to know what about it made it a B+. Anyways this is a small con and in my experience if you put in the effort you can get a few 8s and it will round it out.",
                "The memos and questions definitely are a great form of assignment - committing an opinion to words demands actually understanding the topic. I am not a huge fan of the flipped classroom style, but it worked alright for this class.",
                "Strengths: Metrick is a phenomenal lecturer. Class was always incredibly engaging, and I enjoyed the pace of the class. The memo exercises were also very helpful to my learning.\r\nWeaknesses: Instead of only Q+A in class, I would have preferred having more of a traditional lecture with some questions at the end. I think the coursera videos were super helpful and think they should remain a part of the course. However, it would have been nice to have a recap/summary/deeper discussion of the content in class that was in a lecture style instead of Q+A. Additionally, as an undergraduate who did not have much prior knowledge on the GFC, I believed the early memo prompts were far too difficult. Particularly the China prompt coming so early in the course was tricky for someone who didnt know as much about the crisis. The difficultly level of the prompts got much better later in the course, and I had more context to answer.",
                "Strengths of this course are the video modules where there was a lot of good and important information. Weakness of the course I felt were the lectures. There was some help in answering questions in the lectures and as one of the few students who attended all of the lectures, as a whole I did not find them particularly engaging. Having different TAs grade the memos every week also meant that sometimes the feedback on memos was inconsistent if not contradictory.",
                "Strengths: The course requires the examination of data and academic literature to make economic arguments. This course was super interesting. It was just above my skill level.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would like to have taken a preliminary course in finance that would have taught me the different financial tools and concepts relevant to the course. Ultimately I want to be able to read academic literature on economics at a high level and to formulate opinions from there. I am not sure that Yale has good economics courses for that, but I would like to seek out those courses and take them.",
                "Professor Metrick and Mr. Geithner are huge assets of the course! Professor Metrick's deep knowledge of the financial crisis, his engaging teaching, and the opportunity to discuss with Mr. Geithner made the course very rewarding! Although the workload was of considerable amount, it contributed to my understanding of the topics discussed in class and my ability to apply them in the modern context.  The only weakness is that I thought the TAs could sometimes provide more extensive feedback on the memos rather than just a two-word comment.",
                "Strengths: Prof Metrick is great and very personable, he's super knowledgeable and passionate about this material, and he does make an effort to get to know his students;  getting to ask questions directly to Secretary Geithner is a very unique only-at-Yale opportunity, though he's only there for like four lectures and a lot of the questions students would ask were kinda shallow (since asking questions was a required part of the grade, a lot of questions being asked were just to get credit and not a genuine interest in receiving a nuanced clarification about something GFC related); you learn a lot from doing the weekly essay assignments, and if you put in the effort they are not hard to do well on || Weaknesses: that being said, the weekly memos, combined with the midterm and final paper, was an unexpectedly high amount of work on a weekly basis (each memo took usually about 4 to 6 hours to write); also, grading essays on a point scale out of 8 seemed kind of silly/arbitrary, and having a more granular point breakdown (say grading out of 10 or 15 points) might better allow the teaching staff to differentiate between weak, average, strong, and really strong papers; I wasn't a huge fan of the flipped classroom environment, since most of the questions people asked were not particularly interesting and it seemed like at times a lot of people were disengaged from lectures; I would much rather Professor Metrick just lecture like normal about the GFC during class time and allow students to use the Coursera modules as review tools (or maybe make students watch the Coursera modules and take the quizzes before each lecture, and then lecture about that topic for an hour and maybe save twenty minutes at the end of each section for Q&A); also, I understand the desire to prevent essays from being Chat-GPTable, but I think I would have solidified my understanding about the GFC quicker in the semester if weekly memo topics had more to actually do with the GFC. Oftentimes, memo assignments tasked us to extrapolate GFC concepts to speculate on current world trends and problems, which was certainly cool, but tbh I didn't really feel like I knew what was going on in the class until the book analysis essay assignment --> that was the first time the class really forced me to sit down and read and write about something that directly related to the GFC, and it was only after that assignment that I had the necessary understanding to get more out of subsequent lecture Q&As. Therefore, I think the class would work better if such assignments related directly to GFC understanding were given more in the first half of the class so that we learn enough for later memo/essay prompts to force us to apply those ideas to modern day problems"

                "I would not. The information is interesting if you study finance, but if not, it can be a little challenging to keep up. Additionally, a lot of learning takes place watching videos online which was not my preferred style of learning.",
                "Yes, certainly! This course is definitely accessible to those who know nothing about the crisis, but if so, there is a steep learning curve at the beginning (in terms of technical knowledge). However, by the time our first paper was due, I felt that I had a solid understanding of the technical knowledge you need to understand the crisis. I learned so much, and it has been one of my favorite courses at Yale. Professor Metrick is a gem! The skills I gained from this course provided me a great foundation to critically analyze the crisis and understand financial markets / the role of financial institutions.",
                "Yes, if the student is self-motivated and interested in gaining a fresh perspective on the GFC!",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who plans to work in the world of finance or economics because it allows to deeply analyze the underlying currents of the 2008 crisis. Understanding them is crucial to being prepared for future financial downturns.",
                "This is perhaps the best economics course I have taken at Yale. I learned a tremendous amount about the financial system and Metrick consistently demonstrates his skill as a lecturer, explaining extremely complex financial instruments and jargon in a way that is easy to understand and digest. The course is somewhat writing intensive compared to many math focused econ courseswith weekly evidence based 3 page writing assignments, a book review, and final paperbut if you have the space I would highly recommend taking it.",
                "Yes, absolutely take it if you need an econ elective and want to explore the cool SOM world.",
                "This is a fantastic course for students in interested in economics and finance, particularly those who want to have a unique perspective that is different from the way economics is usually taught at an undergraduate level.",
                "I would recommend it, just be aware of what I said above.",
                "Yes I would, however would recommend it if they already have some base economics knowledge or even better some base GFC knowledge. It is an interesting class, but doesn't have much structure in the classes and relies a lot on student questions. That lends itself more toward people who already have some understanding.",
                "Yes, if you're willing to put in the work and are interested in finance + the global financial crisis. Otherwise, it's not worth it.",
                "Yes - its a very interesting course that talks about really cool topics that are applicable in todays world",
                "As I said before take this class if you want to learn more about the GFC but are too lazy to watch the Coursera course on your own time. It will basically just force you to watch the course. There is no point to ever going to lecture as he just answers prewritten and randomly ordered questions--a total waste of time. There's a lot of essays though.",
                "Yes if taught by Professor Metrick",
                "Yes if youre someone who is self driven and willing to put in the time to research and learn about non-class related topics for the memos and papers. Its a wonderful way to connect topical news and policies and think about them under a framework of financial crises that you will develop in class.",
                "Absolutely. This course not only teaches you about the GFC but you also find you learn a ton about the banking and financial system in the US as a whole which is really important to know about. The memo assignments were pretty engaging I thought too but they were challenging at times. They took some of the things mentioned in the course and would have you assess them in relation to todays current affairs. Overall professor metrick is a great teacher too and he is really good at explaining concepts in an understandable way. It was also always fun when Geithner would come in as he was so deeply involved in fighting the crisis. Overall my favorite economics course Ive taken at Yale",
                "Yes! Cool to learn about a topic which you hear so widely referenced in popular media and business, with an insightful professor and guest who lived through it.",
                "Yes! This course is bit challenging and has a substantial workload compared to other undergrad economics classes, but it is a super rewarding class. Metrick is an incredible professor to get to learn from, and I always looked forward to class. Also, I learned so much about the GFC and substantially improved my financial literacy by taking this course. I feel like I gained a familiarity with economics literature and writing that will be incredibly helpful in my future coursework.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student with a strong background in finance and can easily read the academic literature. I did not have such a background, which was why I could not engage with the material well, but I would like to find ways to bridge my knowledge gap and to review this courses' material so as to understand it.",
                "I would! The work itself was not too hard, but the amount was difficult to deal with at times because all of the lectures have to be watched ahead of time and it takes some time if you really want to engage with the material. I thought the course was really interesting, professor Metrick is really knowledgable and a great speaker so it's a nice class to just go to and listen since most of the note-taking happens when you're watching the lectures beforehand. It was one of my favorite classes during the semester. I would say that it's pretty exciting if you're interested in the subject matter, but it's not something I would take if it's really not your area of interest.",
                "Yes. I really enjoyed Professor Metrick's interesting insights. He's really committed to students. I appreciate Christian McNamara - he was my grader for one of my essays and was really invested in my essay. I appreciate this class a lot!",
                "YES! very useful and interesting content for any major. Whoever takes the course should have an interest in the economy and financial markets and some background in that would also be helpful.",
                "Yes! One of the few finance classes offered to undergrads, and its well-taught. his class is one of those classes at Yale where after taking it, you realize just how small all of us are compared to the daunting complexities of real-world problems, and also how trivial it can be to try and come up with simple policymaking solutions to very hard moral questions with lots of moving pieces/stakeholders in the real world (and in this case specifically, the financial world). But you'll still receive a very valuable toolkit of knowledge, and you will realize that most of the existing information out there about the crisis is either incomplete or dead wrong and how much of a miracle it was that the US government was able to dig the country out of a massive economic hole between 2008 and 2010 all the while having very little institutional memory or blueprints to guide them. Take this class esp if ur an econ or history or global major, or even if you're not an econ major and just want to have literacy about one of the most important events of the 21st century. There's also lots of valuable lessons here for anyone interested in policymaking."
