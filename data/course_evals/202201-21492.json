                "A stronger understanding of the poetess genre and the different poetesses who complicated and subverted the genre (ie Eliot, Landon, Rossetti, Browning, Naidu, etc).",
                "This course had a tremendously interesting objective and final \"thesis\" of sorts that I absolutely loved exploring. If you want to read some incredible authors who have been excluded from the literary canon (the reasons for this are complex and plentiful, and the course spends a great deal of time unpacking them), this is a must-take course. Our thinking as a class evolved and deepened so substantially that by the end, come the final paper (~20-25 pages), I knew exactly what I wanted to argue and how to go about arguing it. Interestingly, as an English major, this paper has taken me the least amount of time to write out of all the papers I have written, even much shorter ones. This is a testament to the incredible work the class and readings themselves do in terms of preparing you for the final: it ended up being an incredibly fun culminating act where you really got to use everything you had learned and discuss up until this point. I also got to explore alternative frames of literary analysis, specifically Historical Poetics, alongside the New Criticism methodologies of reading poetry. The course really broader my horizon in terms of how we read and evaluate literature, how canons are made, and how authors rise and fall.",
                "primary source analysis, poetry analysis",
                "This course filled the gender gap in my studies of English literature. The field is dominated by the study of male writers like Wordsworth and Shelley, and ENGL 342 was an exceptional survey of the contributions and struggles of women writers in the Victorian Age. Above all, this course has taught me that the existence of the woman poet or writer was an act of political rebellion. Women poets challenged the strict gender binary that forced women away from the mainstream and into the domestic circle. At the same time, these women poets also contended with their own gender identities and how they fit within the larger literary canon. The woman poet was all things at once: a politician, an activist, a mother, a genius, a muse. This course helped me to grapple with what this meant for the study of literature and for the way society remembers the major poets."

                "I really liked the diversity of the syllabus and that each week was kinda self-contained. The reading load was kinda heavy sometimes and sometimes the discussions felt a bit redundant.",
                "Prof. Levine is a great discussion leader! Can't think of any real weaknesses, though I wish we met more than once a week.",
                "Strengths: Professor Levine has fantastic insights and effectively facilitates the conversation to highlight important aspects of the poetess genre and of the poetess we are studying that week. The workload is very manageable, and the essays are interesting to write. Weaknesses: I think having a little less text to read each week would allow students to focus more on the reading and be more engaged with the content -- it often felt like everyone would selectively do a few of the required readings each week which created disconnect in the conversation. Other than that, I absolutely love the class!",
                "The biggest strengths of this course were Professor Levine herself and the extremely well-curated and ambitious syllabus. Each week, the readings and discussions complicated and augmented the previous week's. You could tell Professor Levine put so much time and care into selecting which authors and texts comprised the syllabus. By the end, the connections across the different authors we had read were so very clear. The course also had a midterm project of a reception study instead of a traditional literary analysis paper: this was an amazing assignment and fit so perfectly with one of the main threads of the course, reception and how authors rise and fall. Professor Levine is also a brilliant seminar leader and so passionate and knowledgable about the subject material; each class was a real treat. There was a perfect balance between Professor Levine's commentary and guidance and student contribution. One element of the course that I feel could have been improved upon was utilizing the Canvas discussion posts more, perhaps evenly a short (~100 words) weekly assignment and seriously capping it at a word limit to make it a low-intensity thing. The texts we were reading are so complex and multivalent that it is impossible to really get to everything in class, and I found myself having things I found interesting that we did not get to during class. Having Canvas as a low-pressure, concurrent platform for discussion would have been useful to hear more thoughts about the readings. Overall, this was a stellar course. Professor Levine is a caring, brilliant, and wonderful professor: you will learn a ton if you put in the work!",
                "The syllabus is very well curated, but I believe discussions should have taken a more intersectional approach. There were times when the discourse sounded eerily white feminist. I wish we would have more critically examined race, gender, sexuality, and ability in the authors we read. Maybe including some modern day readings on CRT, queer theory, and disability rights would help? (to provide some background to students who haven't been exposed to this scholarship in other classes)",
                "The course readings and class discussions fostered by Professor Levine were the major strengths of this course. For many of us, the women we read and studied were new voices and Professor Levine's guidance allowed us to fully grasp their impact and understand their influences."

Not too hard, good discussion, interesting authors/poets on the syllabus that aren't normally taught in the English department. Not the most riveting ever, but can be interesting if you are interested.",
                "Yes, for sure! It is a fantastic class, and you get to read beautiful poetry and prose that is not often taught.",
                "Yes! The poetess genre is under-studied and has a fascinating history. I learned so much about different poetesses in the class, which enriches my understanding of other English texts and the Victorian time period. Professor Levine is also fantastic, and the class discussions are interesting!",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student if it is offered again. This course is an amazing opportunity to read some incredible authors who have been, for far too long, excluded and erased from literary history and the literary canon. The course is just so different from any other course I have taken and probably will continue to take in its objectives and readings. We explored questions of gender, sentimentality, reception, and the canon in terms of nineteenth-century women poets and writers. The workload was also really manageable, though some weeks did have heavier reading loads than others, but you really have time to breathe and just enjoy the texts without having to worry about papers throughout the term. There were only two assignments: a 5-page reception study and a 20-25 page final paper. By the end, you will have developed a great sense of understanding of the readings, so the final paper should be a very fun, low-intensity assignment if you have kept up with the readings and have been thinking about the various questions the course generates. Overall, a must-take course!",
                "To an English major, yes. To a non-English major with limited English experience at Yale, no.",
                "I strongly recommend this course to other English majors, especially because it allows students to explore writers who may be left out of the syllabi of other English courses. For example, this course features many women writers of the Victorian and early Edwardian Periods, which I believe have been cast aside in favor of studying the major male poets of the same time periods. If anything, this course challenges the definition of poet and demands that students think deeply about the use of poetry as a means of social liberation and ultimately reconsider what it means to be a woman poet. It is an intensive course, but one that I believe is necessary for a well-rounded English education."
