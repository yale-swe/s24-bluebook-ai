                "This class was A LOT of work, maybe that's the case for all summer language classes, but there was so much homework. Sometimes taking up to 7 hours to complete the work for the next day. Another weakness was that we started watching videos and asking questions in the dialect and there was little support for students who did not speak that dialect at home and only learned MSA prior to this class. The main strength was definitely the heavier focus on speaking and listening, I feel as though I built more vocabulary in this class than in L1 and L2."
