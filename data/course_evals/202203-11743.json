This made studying incredibly stressful because I didn't know whether I could trust the slides. The class was so useless that even our professor said it was optional for people to show up to class. He would have a fifteen minute break in the middle of class which is excessively long especially for a morning class. All of the slides were copy and pasted from our text book--which made it even more confusing how there were so many mistakes in the slides.",

It allows you to go at your own pace and explore the topics further as you do not feel pressured or weighed down by too many assignments or heavily weighted exams. The weaknesses of this course is that it could feel a bit unorganized, the schedule would sometimes need changing and instructions weren't clear sometimes, but personally, the strengths outweighed the weaknesses completely.",
                "The course covered interesting topics and made statistics very approachable. It could be improved by being better organized.",
                "Flexibility of class attendance was helpful. Computer lab was also beneficial, and it was nice to have so much extra help\/office hours availability around due dates and exams.",
