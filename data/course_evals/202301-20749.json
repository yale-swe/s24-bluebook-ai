                "- I learnt a wide range of book binding techniques, and page layouts\r\n- I got to speak to a diverse range of graphic designers, who gave their own stories about graphic design and provided different viewpoints to that of doug's\r\n- I got to make a substantial, finalised project: a final book about a graphic designer of my choice\r\n- through the lectures, I learnt a lot about many aspects of graphic design history",
                "I developed a large pantheon of knowledge regard graphic design, its history and the eras and movements at play. The writing/design project allowed for a great level  of agency and self exploration within a project that I greatly enjoyed. The class both expanded my view of what can be considered graphic design but it also reignited my passion and interested for many elements inn design.",
                "Greater understanding of graphic design history and the book design process",
                "I feel that I have a much more well-rounded background knowledge of design and art after taking this course.",
                "I was able to gain some new bookmaking skills through the main assignment for this course. The lectures provided an overview of graphic design history and art history movements that influenced design.",
                "the history or graphic design! it was really fun to learn about how graphic design and certain movements came to be, the meaning behind its usage, and more. it was really solidified my graphic design foundation and exposed me to more things to include in my work. everything learned was really monumental to my understanding of graphic design",
                "An incredible critical opinion and expertise regarding graphic design history, references and the profession as a whole. I also acquired book making skills and font expertise."

                "I believe that a strength of the course was having such a wide variety of students. Everyone had different levels of experience in design which meant that everyone's work was very inspiring and creative to me. I also enjoyed having one long research project and book for the entire course. It allowed me to really adapt and change my project throughout the course as I learned more and create a very finished and fully-realized final project.",
                "Doug has an amazing wealth of knowledge. He is able to talk about many facets of design history. I also appreciated the guest lecturers scheduled throughout the semester to add their voices to the class. \r\n\r\nIt's very hard to engage with lectures that are taped. I would have preferred if we had spent some more in-class time on lectures and discussing material, and used office hours or another part of class time to discuss the project. The way the class is currently organized, there is not a lot of organized discussion of the material we are supposed to be engaging with. I also think the class would have benefited from some \"required reading,\" or a specialized reading list. This is another great way to include different perspectives in the course.",
                "it's very history-based, as the class is named. lots of fun information thrown at you. if you're a graphic design nerd and love to learn the quirky things behind how some things came to be, this is wonderful to you! if you're looking for hardcore practice and feedback on your work, maybe look for another class.",

The process of creating a new prototype every week towards the end was super useful as well.",
                "Yes I would! Probably the best possible crash course on graphic design and the concentration of design as a whole. If you have the slightest interest this class will certainly expand it.",
                "100% Great historical/studio course",
                "absolutely, this course really showed me the diverse and multicultural perspectives surrounding graphic design history as well as the unique experiences of practicing designers in the field. Prof Scott allowed us to learn with our hands and brought new materials and tactile examples to class each week, which made each class a delightful exploration. the book project was also a great learning experience, we were able to research a designer of our choice and produce a book that we conceptualized and bound ourselves. this is one of those classes that give you the ability to gain exposure in a way that inspires you to seek things that interest you (rather than a slide lecture of history to memorize). Our prof is also just a really down-to-earth and interesting guy, making this semester really fun. take this class for exposure and inspiration as well as hands-on learning experiences that you can develop as you see fit",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone that would like to improve their knowledge and understanding of design history, be inspired by other students and the professor, and create a very intentional and. fully-realized final project.",
                "I think graphic design history is important, and Doug is really experienced at sharing what he knows about it. Because of the loose structure of the course, you have to take a lot of initiative to make sure you're doing the right research, following up on what you hear in the recorded lectures, etc. I would recommend this to students with a strong interest in design history who also have a very disciplined work ethic. I would not recommend it to students with a more casual interest, or students who need very clear goals, assignments, or a more rigid structure to stay focused.",
                "if you love graphic design and are passionate about it, go for it!",
                "Absolutely , particularly to thesis students in architecture who often create books as final deliverables."
