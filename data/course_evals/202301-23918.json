                "The strengths are that the course is extremely engaging, fun, and well organized, as well as a very low workload.  The weakness is that the assigned reading for the course is literally hundreds of pages per week, but we are not tested on them during the midterms (hint: don't do them).  Another weakness is that the grading on the midterms is relatively harsh, and it is a bit annoying that the midterms purely test memorization.",
                "I think this course is very well organized, has manageable tests and very few assignments. I found Dr. Latham to be an interesting but followable lecturer, and I think the TFs had good ways of connecting the content. I can't think of any way the course could be improved.",
                "The teaching fellow I got assigned to was fantastic in that she was very efficient about summarizing the main points we needed to know for each week's lecture. Professor Latham was also a very knowledgeable professor and you could tell that he was truly passionate about the topics he lectured on.",
                "strengths -- Professor Latham and the syllabus! he's awesome, and I feel like I learned so so much from this class",
                "Strengths: super interesting material, weakness: grade only revolves around three exams",
                "Strengths: Very interesting subject matter and fun discussions not only to engage in during section but with friends and family outside of class as well\r\nWeaknesses: Information could have been presented in a more streamlined fashion",
                "Strengths: timely and relevant, especially with pandemic and recent advances in CRISPR gene editing\r\nWeaknesses: exams require a ridiculous amount of memorization. If you missed even one detail/court case in a three page essay, they marked you down a whole grade.",
                "Strengths -- Prof Latham is amazing. The subject material is fascinating and organized very well. The reading is relevant and maps well onto the readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - none!",
                "I loved how this course was taught. The issues are personalized and the level of understanding that professor latham has of the material is very cool. I appreciated the level of understanding he had of the topic and how he wove his personal experiences into the material. The TA system needs to be streamlined, however. The TAs were crazy.",
                "The course is very engaging. The sections were helpful.",
                "The course was great overall, with incredibly engaging lecturer and fair tests. My one note is that section attendance and reading responses gave no credit, and could instead only remove from your final grade if you missed too many. This felt of punitive and not useful, and changing this to being 10% or 20% of the grade instead would feel more fair.",
                "Strengths: fascinating topics, Professor Latham's lecture style\r\nWeaknesses: some discussion sections may be less engaging their others since TAs have the freedom to discuss what it is they want from lecture. This also amounted in different sections having more or less knowledge on specific cases that would make their way into exams / exam reviews.",
                "The strength of the course is Professor Latham's understandable lecture style and how the different topics were interconnected. I wish that one of the exams was replaced with an essay that allows students to pull in their own interests and more current news events\r\n\r\nI will say that a different classroom than Davies would be better for a 9 am M-W bioethics lecture...",

                "Strengths: Professor Latham's lectures are incredible. During lecture you always feel engaged and leave the lecture hall with a ton of new information and insights. Additionally, the readings are not egregious, and the course has a fair amount of work. I thought the topics were well arranged as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",

                "Strengths: Prof Latham is quite engaging. He has no slides or other material, just him speaking for an hour and 15 minutes which surprisingly kept me engaged. \r\nWeaknesses: you have two midterms, each worth 25%, and a final worth 50% of your grade. The grade distribution is outrageous, in addition to mandatory discussion questions and section attendance.",
                "Strengths: incredibly interesting subject matter (this is the reason to take the class). Also, Professor Latham is a great and engaging lecturer.\r\nWeaknesses: there is only so much one can do to make a 9 AM lecture fun, and the fact that Professor Latham never uses slides does not help matters when you're fighting to stay awake. Also, grading on midterms can be very arbitrary, and small mistakes can lead to a big drop in your grade.",

The material is very accessible, and there is not too much of a workload for this class. I also feel like the class was really well-organized (except for the final room change on the day of the exam).

                "This course was very engaging. Lectures and section were very interesting, so it made paying attention in class easy. I cannot think of any improvements to this course.",
                "The course covers a lot of really interesting content and Professor Latham is a strong lecturer. The only weakness of the course is probably the exam structure, as sometimes the questions require answers and information from the class that don't seem to be that relevant or important. Some of the last lectures also lacked structure, and it felt like Latham went off on several tangents or was repeating information.",
                "The material was so interesting and felt so relevant. However, lectures were hard to follow without any slides or main points to keep track of.\r\nBut the TAs did a great job at review sessions making sure we knew what we had to study for the exams.",
                "Reading was too dense/long\r\n\r\nLectures were very engaging.",
                "The strengths was how fascinating the course material was. I also thought Professor Latham was a terrific lecturerthe way he could express information concisely and in an organized fashion was truly admirable and inspiring. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this course that I can think of is the manner in which you are tested. There are two midterms and one finalthat is all that is factored into your grade. Further, these tests are less about critical thinking and more about the capacity to regurgitate information. I wish we had more opportunities to discuss the legal issues outside of merely what happened. In other words, there really isn't much room to formulate your own arguments regarding bioethical issues throughout the duration of the course.",
                "Strengths were lectures and the speed it was taught. Very easy to follow and build memory for",
                "Strengths were the discussion sections.",
                "Strengths: Well-organized, very interesting course content, and Prof. Latham is amazing! Weaknesses: none",
                "strengths: comprehensive overviews provided, as well as granular pieces about specific court cases and verdicts and such. Everything mentioned throughout lecture was supported with case evidence or backed by the law which helped with my learning of the course material.",
                "Strengths: great lectures, interesting content, moved at the best pace\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The section on Dobbs was a little confusing, but since this topic is so new, Im really glad the course covered it. Its awesome that Professor Latham tries to cover both the history and the most recent developments from this semester.",
                "strength: latham is an amazing professor, great TAs as well, exams very fair and prof latham makes the content super super interesting\r\nno weaknesses",
                "I really like how this class was structured. Latham's  lectures are very interesting and understandable and the weekly sections were helpful as well.",
                "The course is really great about telling you what you need to know. There are a lot of court cases that can be confusing, but the lectures and discussion sections are amazing at reinforcing the necessary information.",
                "Strengths - recordings online, interesting lectures",
                "Very good course as a whole not very many weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Professor Latham is an incredible lecturer and is able to keep a huge class engaged with a lecture without any visual aids at 9 in the morning, which is remarkable. He presents the information in a very digestible and organized way that makes studying for the exams much easier. Weaknesses: Some of the wording on the exams was unclear, which ended up impacting our grades for that midterm a lot. The final being worth 50% of the overall grade is a bit tough.",
                "As someone whose course of study leads to a finals schedule filled with papers, I really appreciated the exam and participation based structure of the course. The course is inherently incredibly interesting, and the topics covered each week are relevant and thought-provoking. Professor Latham has the gift of being able to be a captivating lecturer at 9am. However, contrary to previous experiences I've heard about in this course, this year's iteration was at times incredibly and frustratingly disorganized, increasingly so as the semester went on. The first half of the course seemed to follow a well thought out and formulated structure, but the lectures grew a tad lackluster after midterm. In fairness, this may be a byproduct of the recent upsets in bioethics related law- much is fresh and still playing out- I suspect this concern will correct itself with time. The other concern of note was inconsistency and disorganization amongst TF's. To say nothing of the schedule-changing confusion at the beginning of the semester, some TF's seemed incredibly knowledgeable and invested in teaching, while others, not so much. Contradicting information was supplied in an exam review session, even covering matters that had absolutely no relevance to the course, the readings, or the lectures. It seems that people had greatly varying experiencing based on who their TF was.",
                "One of the strengths of this course is the lecture format and Professor Latham's lecturing style.\r\n\r\nOne the weaknesses of this course is its grading format, which can be a bit too specific about term usage.",
                "Professor Latham is the best lecturer I've had at Yale. The course is so interesting, and the readings are well-assigned. The exams were very fair, and I feel like I learned A TON just from attending lectures and discussion sections. The lectures were engaging and super interesting, and I thought the course material was very well thought-out and very relevant. I can't think of any weaknesses to this class.",
                "Strengths: engaging lecture, well organized, informative, and not terribly stressful\r\nWeaknesses: none really -- it's relatively chill, and I'm glad it is",
                "The strengths of this course were that the material was always very interesting, and the discussion section was really helpful as a quick overview of the main ideas from class that week. I also think the review sessions and practice questions before the midterms and final were very helpful.",
                "Great course. Highly enjoyable.",
                "The sections complemented the lectures very well; one of the biggest strengths was the way that all of the material was presented---a lot to learn, but manageable through the course",
                "This is an excellent course. Admittedly, there is a sizable (but entirely manageable) amount of reading but everything is connected and expands well on the lecture material. This is a great class if given the time it deserves and I really wouldn't make any changes or identify any weaknesses worth mentioning.",
                "The strength is that you do not have to do the weekly readings, and you just have to show up for lecture or watch the recorded lectures. I think the main weakness is that you are only graded on the midterm and the final, which can be very stressful. I think section participation should account for at least 15% of the grade.",
                "Incredible professor",
                "This course was honestly taught very well, and the TA were very well trained.",
                "Great lecture format and fair assessments, section could be improved as it was often pretty irrelevant / not useful but I think that depends on the specific TF.",
                "No weaknesses this course is so great. Strengths are Latham-- he is a great lecturer and this class is just so interesting",
                "Strengths: the lectures were well organized, and easy to understand. The discussions were thought provoking. The tests were fair.",
                "this is a great course, but sometimes the information felt repetitive.",
                "The content was incredibly interesting, and Professor Latham was an amazing teacher. Even though he stood and spoke for the entire hour and fifteen minutes every lecture, there was never a dull moment. Professor Latham knew what he was talking about and answered students questions with care. One weakness of the course was that Professor Latham never used lecture slides, so sometimes he was hard to follow, especially when sitting at the back. Another weakness was how heavily weighted the midterms and final exam were. I wouldve liked to see the weekly discussion posts and discussion attendance count for a portion of the grade as opposed to being things that could simply lower a students grade. I also think some of the readings could be omitted in the future as not all were directly relevant to the lectures.",
                "Such awesome content, lectures were very informative, I actually appreciated having two midterms instead of just 1.",
                "Interesting lectures and material",
                "strengths: engaging, relevant, organized, interesting",
                "Strengths: accessibly delivered material, great breadth and depth of coverage, high engagement",
                "This course was amazing as an introductory course to the field of bioethics and is very engaging and involved with many current day relevant topics.",
                "Engaging lectures and straightforward exams",
                "I felt that the course content was interesting but were not as engaging.",
                "strengths: organized very well, great TAs, great review system for midterms and final exam \r\n\r\nweaknesses: professor does not provide power points so it makes it hard to organize information from the get-go"

I thought there was a good mix of pre-meds, pre-laws, and just people interested in the course, and this variety made the discussions more fruitful. The course grade is made up entirely of tests, and the test are very fair, so if you pay attention and go to class, you should do well in this class.",

                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. Professor Latham is one of the best lecturers I have had at Yale--engaging, funny, and incredibly knowledgeable about the course material. The subject material is also super timely and interesting.",

                "Yes, very interesting material and exams are easy as long as you go to class. TA's are also very helpful, but this course is very TA dependent.",
                "yes! incredibly interesting especially in regards to more contemporary issues like Dobbs and Covid",
                "Best course Ive taken at Yale so far. Professor Latham is fun and an absolute expertthe course is also not too challenging or too much work, and could be a great fifth class. Highly, highly recommend.",

                "Yes",
                "Overall, yesthis was one of my favorite classes this semester, primarily due to the very interesting subject material. Just keep in mind that this class is not necessarily as much of a \"guaranteed A\" as other reviews make it out to be. Grading is often incredibly arbitrarymost TA's grade exams like a checklist, so if you don't mention one of the cases they were looking for, your grade will go down. Grading also can vary pretty dramatically between sections. Overall, though, the class is pretty low workload (you can do well just by showing up to lectures/sections) and the material is very interesting, so I'd recommend the class on that basis alone.",
                "Yes, Professor Latham is an engaging lecturer, the workload of this is course is very manageable, and the content is very interesting. It was a great course!",
                "10000%! This was my favourite course at Yale and I could not recommend it more. The lectures were engaging, the readings so interesting and the knowledge you gain is so applicable to your daily personal life and for general knowledge! Its also a great introduction to law and justice!! Take this class!!!",
                "Definitely. I think if you are at all interested in medicine, ethics, etc, then you will find this course very interesting. Lecture and discussion are both enjoyable, and you will learn a lot!",
                "Yes, 100%. Not much work, GREAT professor who is incredibly intellectually engaging, and exams thats are very fair.",
                "Yes, especially if you're not necessarily studying something related to this field. The content is so important to know and Professor Latham makes it easy to approach and understand.",
                "Yes! You learn about lots of really cool and interesting bioethics issues.",
                "Yes, the content is so interesting and Professor Latham is my favorite professor at Yale. You learn so much about bioethics and a lot of it is super new with Dobbs and covid mandates. Definitely take this class if you can.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in a survey course on bioethics.",
                "Yes - one of the few classes I've taken where the workload is low, but the material is interesting.",
                "Absolutely. Probably my favorite class at Yale.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student because the class was very exciting. I gained a better understanding of the world around me, especially when it comes to bioethics issues, so I would highly recommend this course to another student.",
                "Yes! I think it's just really important to learn and be aware of all the issues discussed throughout the course. It really is eye-opening to know more about legal decision-making as well as what medical rights we have, especially as we leave Yale.",
                "Yes! So interesting. The professor is really knowledgeable and the TAs were great. Its not much work besides the 3 exams which are essay questions. I enjoyed the material a lot and studying for the exam was interesting. Even as a psychology major I really liked this class",
                "YES YES YES YES. Please take this course no matter what you want to major in. It is so interesting and you learn things that will stick in your mind for year to come.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes, take this course if you can!",
                "Yes! The course is very interesting and the teaching team is very supportive. PLSC 257 teaches you how to think about bioethical problems and what the current laws about these issues are, which is important to everyone because all people receive medical care, but especially so for people in medicine and law.",
                "Yes,  especially for students who want to engage with the law or want a more generalized approach to understanding our current legal framework and how biomedical technologies have paved the way and altered the meaning of certain laws. Very easy to understand the material and was interesting enough that I actually enjoyed reading the textbook readings.",
                "Yes! It doesn't have a very high workload but it's still super interesting and will make you think a lot about bioethics and healthcare. The topics and lectures are very interesting and I found myself discussing what I learned with friends. Great class for people looking for a Social Science credit or for Political Science majors looking for a lecture class in American Government.",
                "Yes definitely. Every kind of student has something to gain by listening to Professor Latham talk about the topics in his field. Super interesting stuff and would definitely recommend, especially to stem people.",

                "Yes!! Very interesting course esp if you like memorizing court cases",
                "Yes because it was not overly taxing and I really enjoyed learning and attending class as a whole.",
                "Yes!! This is such an important course to take for any major to understand the landscape of American healthcare and different bioethics issues that are pressing and important to know. It was well organized with weekly reading responses that kept you accountable to learn the material as the course went on rather than cramming right before exams. The TFs were very helpful and organized review sessions that were productive and helped synthesize the material well.",
                "Yes",
                "Absolutely! Great understanding of the American health system and legal/ethical questions that continue to dominate our discourse today. Very happy I took PLSC 257!",
                "Yes, enjoyed going to class for this course.",
                "Yes, I would! I love the lecture format of this course and Professor Latham is a very engaging lecturer.",
                "Yes, whether you are pre-med, pre-law, or anything else, I think this course is fascinating.",
                "Yes! It's a great way to learn about some fascinating stuff without destroying yourself in the process. My TA was also FIRE, and I think that impacts people's experience of the class quite a lot.",
                "I would recommend this course because it is interesting, well-taught, and helpful for those who may want a career in law or healthcare.",
                "Yes, great if you are interested in medicine and law.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Professor Latham is an amazing lecturer and knows how to keep students engaged with the material. I also appreciated how a lot of the topics were connected and he updated the course material with recent cases.",
                "Yes definitely, the course was very enjoyable and I learned a lot!",
                "Absolutely, one hundred percent, this is one of my favorite classes at Yale. It does a really good job of giving comprehensive consideration to many bioethical and legal questions and consistently inspired me to pursue some kind of hybrid career in medicine and law. It really. pushed me to think in new ways about issues that are so close and intimate to people's lives and I think it's an excellent class to take regardless of what you're thinking about doing.",
                "Yes. Although it is not technically a gut, you just have to go to lecture and take the 2 midterms and the final. The bioethics topics are also very interesting tot learn about, and Professor Latham is a great lecturer.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes! My favorite class I've taken so far.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes I would",
                "I absolutely would! It was really interesting and I thought it was very well taught. Learned a lot.",
                "Yes! It's super interesting and not a lot of work",
                "Yes it is a great class and interesting",
                "Yes absolutely Dr Latham is an amazing professor and the TFs are amazing",
                "Yes! Very interesting especially if you are not pre-med and are just taking it out of genuine curiosity.",
                "Yes yes yes!! It was an incredible course and you learn so much without having to do excessive assignments. Its not a gut, but its incredibly doable and rewarding. If you are a prospective doctor or lawyer its a great coarse to have to build up your knowledge.",
                "Yes. The course is enriching for both students interested in entering the medical field and those interested in practicing law. Beyond that, Professor Latham is an incredible instructor and I would strongly encourage students to take a class with him, whether it's this one or another one.",
                "Absolutely, Latham is one of the best professors and the class is so interesting.",
                "I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TAKING THIS COURSE! The workload isnt bad, and the grading isnt harsh. Moreover, the content is super interesting and provides a solid introduction to the law for any pre-law students out there.",
                "Yes, a really good introduction to interesting topics ... makes you think critically more than most introductory classes.",
                "Yes, interesting material and format",
                "yes one of my favorite classes in terms of content and teaching",
                "Absolutely. Great course for understanding the legislative and social aspects of health care, public health and biotechnology, their role in our lives, and the way in which it is going to be evolving.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to everyone, regardless of their focus of study. The issues discussed in this class are not just pertinent to the medical or legal fields, but also are deeply important social issues that everyone should be informed on. Latham presents a clear, concise representation of the facts, allowing for students to form their own opinions regarding the issues discussed.",
                "Yes, this has been one of my favorite courses I have taken so far, as it is both interesting and engaging.",
                "YES",
                "I would recommend the course to other students since it doesnt require any prior knowledge of politics or law and can be interesting for anyone.",
                "Yes! This a class every Yalie should take. Not only does it have practical value, it also is very interesting and informative.",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in health law"
