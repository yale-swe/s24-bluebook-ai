Unfortunately, this class can be very disorganized since we do not use Canvas at all. Deadlines are often confusing and grades are generally a mystery. You don't really know your grade until the end of the semester.",

Thay Quang effectively brings in his own cultural anecdotes to supplement the textbook, enriching the course greatly.\r\n\r\nSome units were covered more in-depth than others. Sometimes assignments were not returned with corrections or comments, which made it frustrating. I think that Thay Quang could improve this by setting a clear schedule for the semester."
