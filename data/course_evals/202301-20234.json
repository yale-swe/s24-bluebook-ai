                "I learned how socialist thought on the African continent evolved from the 1960s to the 1990s and how such thinking affected specific African nations.",
                "This course was definitely challenging, but I honestly think I learned how to better approach research and writing historical research papers. I think Professor Machava does a really good job of utilizing Yale's archival resources and equipping students to do research with unique perspectives.",
                "An introduction to African socialist history and its ideology",
                "I learned about African socialist history from decolonization to the eventual abandonment of socialism. I knew very little about the subject going in, and I walked away with a really robust understanding of the ideologies of different African socialist, African Marxist, and other Marxist-inspired movements across the continent.",
                "Research project with primary sources was a great way to develop my independent reading abilities as a history major.",

                "I learned how to intensively discuss a plethora of complicated political documents or perspectives on political narrative. \r\nI learned how to effectively convey summaries and analysis of said documents weekly. \r\nI learned how to write my first research paper under the tutelage of the professor as well as other classmates.",

                "Weakness: The readings were killer. I also believe students taking this course need A LOT more knowledge of the basics of EUROPEAN socialism and communism. As someone not as well-versed, I inadvertently sat quiet for a while because of my lack of basis in socialism/communist theory period.",
                "We focused on traditionalism in African culture for a little too long",
                "Strengths: Fascinating content, Professor Machava is brilliant and a very engaging seminar leader, readings are all on Canvas (super helpful!), class full of students with a wide array of interests; Weaknesses: it would have been great to learn more about each other's final papers -- the ones I heard about sounded super interesting. Otherwise, no weaknesses.",
                "Strength: Strong readings, discussion culture, and professor. Larger research project assignment was well scaffolded and professor provided a lot of support to students throughout.\r\n\r\nWeakness: This is an unusually broad topic for an undergraduate history seminar. I would recommend either limited the course to a smaller slice of the larger topic of socialism in Africa  eg first-wave African Socialism, or socialism in North Africa, etc. Alternatively, the reading load could be increased substantially to better cover the whole topic.",
                "The level of discussion was one of the highest Ive had at Yale. Readings were fascinating and Machava is an excellent professor.",
                "Strengths:\r\nOpen forum setting\r\nSmaller class size \r\nPre-class questions \r\nEngaging material \r\nVideos or movies to discuss and watch \r\nClear explanations and broad picture discussions \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSometimes the material would go over my proverbial head and I would not understand until class",
                "The weekly write-ups were slightly tedious, but they also made sure I kept up to date",
                "Strong, well-led discussion of readings and broader concepts.",
                "Professor Machava was an excellent instructor who was good at facilitating student engagement through small-group discussions. The course would have benefitted from more primary sources and case studies of individual regimes, as many of the readings were thematically-organized secondary articles that made for a somewhat disorienting experience."

                "Yes yes yes, a great course on a topic oftentimes under-looked in Africa. As challenging as this course was, I enjoyed being able to learn about a topic in a context I'd never learned about before.",
                "Yes. Great look into socialist experiments in post colonial governments",
                "Yes! A fantastic course with an engaging professor who is a leading expert in the field. I knew very little about the subject going in, and the seminar did a great job of meeting every student where they were, whether entering with a robust knowledge base or very little experience in the subject. One of the best history seminars I've taken at Yale.",
                "Definitely, because Professor Machava is such a great resource, but be aware that the subject is far larger than what's usually tackled in an undergraduate seminar. You might not get the general overview of the topic  which really is almost half of 20th-century African history  which you're used to getting from seminar courses.",
                "Yes!! One of the best classes Ive taken at Yale. Definitely take this class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The course effectively described and taught the history of a continent within a semester. Additionally, professor Machava is a highly engaging and personable individual who looks to increase both the knowledge and the skills of his students. Finally, the materials you read are far more interesting than the average African Studies history course.",
                "Yes. It is a perfect class on the topic",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in post-colonial African history. The course provides a really excellent introduction to Marxism and Leninism, as well as African Nationalism and Afro-Marxism.",
                "This course helped me understand currents of political ideology in post-independence Africa, something I hadn't learned about at Yale or anywhere else. I would recommend the course for Machava's depth of knowledge and strong classroom presence.",
                "Especially if you are interested in international security or economics but have had no prior exposure to Africa in the 20th century. A phenomenal course that will make you rethink the international system."
