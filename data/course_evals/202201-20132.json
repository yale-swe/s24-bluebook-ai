                "I improved my listening and research skills.",
                "I learned about French culture, government, and other areas of the French experience. I also learned vocabulary and phrases to express myself with more nuance.",
                "I learned about French society, politics, and culture while improving my written and oral French.",
                "I learned about the francopone world and various aspects of Fremnch life, such as work, politics, and family. I expanded my vocabulary in such a way that I can talk at ease about various topics that might arise in normal, everyday conversation. I also improved at speaking and writing through presentations, frequent compositions, class discussions, and written and oral exams.",
                "Unlike my previous French courses, FREN 160 challenged me to think beyond basic grammar and language comprehension to thoughtfully construct my own ideas on modern-day events and issues and in the francophone world. The course required me to contextualize my preconceived notions about French culture by evaluating its historical and philosophical precedents, therefore reversing my own stereotypes and leading me to understand the interdisciplinary lens through language-learning must be approached. FREN 160 emphasized the importance of critical observation in coming to understand another culture, and also made clear the idea that empathy is a fundamental practice in engaging with and respecting the ways in which French culture and its component parts operate."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: I very much enjoyed the guests brought in, as well as the films (when I had time to watch them). The weekly writings are rather low-stress and you can increase your grade by submitting corrections which is very nice. I also thought the discussion in the class was nice although it often felt too micromanaged by the professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: First and most prevalent, the reading. FREN 150 had a quite formidable amount of reading combined with learning grammar, but the reading was of creative works like short stories, novels and plays. In this course, the workload of the grammar has been removed and replaced with more reading, but instead of creative works, all the reading is now incredibly tedious articles, surveys, infographics, interviews, or worst of all, textbook chapters. The fact that you are required to buy such a boring textbook for around a hundred dollars is practically a crime. You can teach about current events without forcing the class to only read articles, and I think there are plenty of short stories or more creative essays that give the same information but make the homework feel less like trudging through a swamp.",
                "The biggest strength was the many forms of assessments. Our French ability was tested in many ways, and we received lots of feedback after each assessment.",
                "Since the class focuses on sociological studies and social commentaries, the material can be dry at times. Some unit has more films, stories, and activities than others. I think the readings and videos can be arranged in a way that is more engaging throughout the whole semester.",
                "I think that there were too many readings per class because the turn around time was so short between classes. I did like that the class is discussion based so I don't need to necessarily need to read every readins.",
                "This course gives a very good overview on French society and the topics covered are interesting. The readings and movies for the class were interesting as well.",
                "The content of the course was very interesting, and I enjoyed discussing current events with classmates. I think we tried to cover too much material, however, so it felt like we were rushing through the second half of the syllabus. The reading load was pretty high, especially for a class that is meant to focus on speaking. Also, there was a large focus on vocabulary, which was useful, but some of the exams felt too tied to vocab, and more like tests of our memorization skills than our writing. I thought the course would have been better if it was a little smaller, since it is hard to have a meaningful discussion with too many people in the room.",
                "Strengths: this course pushed me out of my comfort zone and enabled me to improve at a speaking and writing. This course provided me with a lot of useful vocabulary. The content, particularly the films, was very interesting. Weaknesses: Sometimes the readings could take quite long.",
                "The course requires equal participation from every student in order to establish successful conversations. Some students are naturally quieter, so I wonder if students would benefit from doing independent research outside of class so that they would have a more personal starting point from which to share their findings and opinions. The class did, however, help me develop my flexibility, receptiveness to new ideas, and quick thinking, all of which are crucial in language learning and cultural appreciation."

            "comments": [
                "No, unless you need it as a prerequisite. This course claims to be a discussion-based class about french culture, but the readings are so bad that no one does them - rendering the discussion practically impossible. The movies and documentaries were the only real glimpse into french culture, whereas most of the other \"media\" was mind-numbing law and date summaries, or articles about those laws and dates.",
                "Yes, especially if you ever want to live in France or another French-speaking area.",
                "Yes absolutely! 160 is both a great challenge and a great opportunity to improve one's ability to talk about social issues in French.",
                "Yes, it is a great higher level language course. It's very easy to do well in this course.",
                "Yes, if they would like to improve their proficiency, then this is definitely the course to take.",
                "Yes! This was a great course to build my confidence in speaking in French. I also feel very prepared to study abroad this summer, since I have a much better understanding of French culture and society. This is a very France-centric class, so it might not be the best for someone interested in Francophone culture at large.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning more about French life and the francophone world or who wants to improve at speaking and writing.",
                "FREN 160 prompts its students to use their knowledge of the French culture and language to critically evaluate the ways by which the French state has arrived at its sociopolitical climate. The course examines concepts and ideas, requiring a sense of empathy in order to acknowledge cultural differences and their relevance in shaping current events. I would recommend this course to students looking to continue developing their competence in speaking, a skill that I came to realize is heavily dependent on listening, absorbing, and appreciating rather than immediately inserting personal stakes and opinions into the course material."
