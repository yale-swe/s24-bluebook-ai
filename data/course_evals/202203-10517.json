The classes themselves were quite fun and interactive. Weakness: needed more homework assignments for students to actually retain and understand the information. There was practically no hw after a few weeks in",
                "I would've liked to have learned more boring music theory to be honest, but I enjoyed the course more this way. Making us sing is both a strength and a weakness in my opinion.",
                "i feel liek we needed more quizzes in the class to check our learning, but other than that it was easy going and fun.",
                "Weaknesses: Posed as a music theory class, most sessions were solely centered around singing. \r\nStrengths: A fun class that always keeps you on your toes! From singing to dancing to learning theory about popular songs.",
                "It felt like a very Mr. Miyagi style of teaching because for the first half of the course we basically just sat there and clapped and hummed in a group. But then the second half of the course it was like, surprise youve been learning these things all along! It was cool. I think this was a strength but it also made the class feel rushed at the end and it made the class feel less organized.",
                "love the prof!!",
                "This course is very engaging and fun which involves a lot of singing in class, but I feel like our ability to transcribe melody and sightread could be emphasized more.",

                "Yes! Take this class to balance your schedule, it truly teaches you the fundamentals about music while acting as a de-stressing course",
                "This is a nice course for people who want to learn how to read music (and we did a lot of singing). Id recommend it for people who enjoy listening to music (because we also analyzed songs) and singing. The way the course is taught will likely depend on the professor.",
                "Yes. This class is super fun, I always looked forward to going every week. I originally took it as a 5th class to fill my schedule that looked like a gut, but I ended up loving it and am taking more music classes in the spring (maybe even major in music? Well see). Its fascinating stuff. And its no workload whatsoever snd Professor Quinn is an awesome professor so if you have the chance you should 100% take this class.",
                "yes!! pair it with lessons!",
                "Yes. It is an excellent course that introduces studnets to the music theory realm.",
