    "I learned to speak italian in a literary context!",
    "Literary analysis, landscape of modern Italian literature, grammatical instruction",
    "This course introduced students to their first works of Italian literature, while strengthening speaking skills.",
    "I took Italian in high school and felt like I was losing it in college. This class helped me recuperate my Italian while also giving me a brief introduction to some important authors in Italy in the last century or so. I also got a brief introduction to translation work and some of the specific challenges faced by translators from Italian to English.",
    "We developed our ability to analyze readings in Italian, our writing skills, and our translating skills. We were also given insights into the  historical and political themes surrounding our readings",
    "Really good discussion and literary analysis skills in Italian.  We enhanced oral skills every class through both fun speaking and creative writing exercises and through discussing the readings.  Also a wonderful translation workshop at the end opened the door for more skills in translating literature."

   "comments": [
    "I liked this course a lot. Megan was so kind and was really interesting to listen to when she spoke about the semantics of language (she's a nerd in the best possible way!).",
    "Strengths: quality and length of the texts are perfect for discussion, making entire works accessible (rather than only reading excerpts); size of the class; interdisciplinary nature of the lectures and readings; openness of the instructor to student interests; mixed media (songs, pieces, performances, plays, videos, etc.)\r\nWeaknesses: none?",
    "The course was extremely well designed and the texts were well chosen for readers levels and to accommodate the variety of levels in the class. Teaching was very strong, feedback was clear, direct and helpful, and class was consistently enjoyable.",
    "The course was great-I felt intellectually engaged by the readings, discussions, and translation project, which were accessible to everyone, regardless of their major. There isn't a ton of work in this course, which makes it a great fifth class to take.",
    "Honestly, it was pretty great.  The workload was perfect, always just enough to keep engaged and on track but not too much to be overwhelming.  The small seminar was a fun group to be with and the style of class was perfect for improving our speaking and writing skills while learning about the great 20th century Italian writers. No complaints."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! If you're looking for a low stress course and a way to improve your italian, this is it!",
    "Yes, this is an excellent class to make the jump from intermediate to advanced given the texts and discussion structure",
    "Definitely  Megan is great, the texts are really interesting and well-chosen for readers just starting off with Italian literature, and the coursework is well-paced and not overly demanding.",
    "This is a great class to take as a fifth class. It is intellectually engaging and doesn't require too much work. The low workload actually produced better class discussions than more intensive reading classes that I've taken. Your Italian will improve a lot, especially your literary and descriptive vocabulary.",
    "Absolutely. It was incredibly engaging and well taught.",
    "Absolutely! It's exactly the class to take if you want to continue your study of Italian in a relaxed but engaging environment, and study and talk about a bunch of really cool literature."
