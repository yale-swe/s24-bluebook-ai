                "The format of this course is great: group discussion with the occasional lectures on aspects of storytelling (i.e outlines). It develops community really well within the classroom and I thought it was very helpful and informative each time. There are two minor aspects I was less keen on. One aspect that could be improved is the use of index cards for the outlines - they seemed logistically difficult to use in the large class setting. The other is that students should volunteer for when they'll present their work, as then it is easier to organize around your individual schedule.",
                "Strength is that its very seminar style where we just get to openly talk about everyones material. The weakness is that there isnt much structure in terms of how we talk about the scripts so the conversation can get scattered.",
                "Strengths were the peer feedback. Weaknesses were the time of the course (it was way too late in the evening) and most of the class was checked out. I would have preferred to do more writing exercises rather than spend a ton of time on bits of each persons script. Or, if we were going to focus on each script, I wish the feedback had been more specific.",
                "Professor Andrews very helpfully guides students in turning their ideas into a coherent engaging storyline through assignments like character profiles and scene outlines. The structure of this class is useful in tackling the rigorous task of brainstorming a feature length film."

                "I would recommend if this is your senior project, but then it would be a requirement so it wouldnt matter. I wouldnt say its the best for people not already deep in the screenwriting track. Its not super friendly if youre coming with informal knowledge.",
                "Yes if youre a film major who wants to write a script as their thesis. This year was just weird because of Prof. Lapadulas death. Im sure that in the future, the course will go back to its original level of enjoyment.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who is passionate about screenwriting not only because the class facilitates the process, but also because it provides students with a cohort to serve as a sounding board and support system. It's a wonderful experience to come into class to talk about the ideas everyone is excited about and how those ideas can be best transformed into an engaging story."
