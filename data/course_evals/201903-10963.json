    "You really learn how to revise your own poetry and, dare I say, become your own worst critic (in the best way possible).",
    "I've always loved poetry, but before taking this class had a hard time talking about it intelligently. I feel like this class taught me how to understand poetry better. I gained a lot of familiarity with contemporary poetry, and I learned how to think about the way poems work!",
    "I learned how to read and write better poetry more quickly.",
    "I read a lot of great poetry collections that made me try new forms and explore new concepts for poems, on the way, learning that in order to improve my work I have to read great work!",
    "This course helped me broaden my horizon and sharpen my skills in the art of poetry writing, and improved my ability to identify strengths and weaknesses in my peers work and make suggestions for revision. Most importantly, it made me a far better reviser of my own work!"

    "This class is wonderful at teaching poetic analysis, and poetry writing. Louise is brilliant, of course, and will look at your poetry with utter objectivity. The only thing I think could be improved is the communication--it's a little hard to get ahold of Louise, since she doesn't use email much.",
    "The syllabus should be posted ahead of time so people know what the workload is like, especially because this is a course you apply to so a general idea of assignments should be provided beforehand.",
    "The seminar format of this course was invaluable to my learning. Each week, we would discuss three poems that had been submitted the previous week. When my poem was one of these, I obtained helpful suggestions from both Louise and my classmates for revision, and when we were workshopping a peers poem, I learned just as much about my own future writing by discussing someone elses. The only thing I wish were different was the amount of office hourssince Louise is only in town two days a week, our class often had to compete for time to spend discussing our work with her. However, when I did get to meet with Louise, she was an immense help, illuminating both strong tendencies in my writing and the bad habits I couldnt recognize myself."

    "Yes. Take it.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Absolutely! This is a wonderful opportunity to engage with an experienced poet and other students. Louise is wonderful and wise. You should know that she'll tear your poems apart, and you'll wonder if you've ever written anything of value. That's normal. It means that Louise takes you and your work seriously, and that she wants you to be the best poet you can possibly be. It's a form of love, so don't be discouraged. You'll learn a lot about how to write poetry, and you'll learn a lot about how to talk about it intelligently in classroom settings.",
    "Like any class at Yale, the more you put into this class, the more you will get out. Nevertheless, this class is NOT a gut. If you are a poet at Yale and\/or want to improve the quality of your poetry, you must take this class. She is unlike any other English professor you will have during your time at Yale. She is undeniably brilliant and extremely blunt. She has the sharpest eye for authenticity and the most specific taste. She will tell you when your work is bad, clich, or useless, in these words. This is more often than you expect. No one in her class is spared, despite how it may appear. However, she will also tell you when your work is really good, even if it takes a lot to earn it. It becomes easy to receive her criticism once you abandon all expectations you have of yourself. For this reason, I took this class Credit\/D\/fail (even though no one does poorly in her class). \r\n\r\nThis class is far from perfect. Louise's harshness can feel really defeating sometimes. It is especially hard when you are putting a lot of energy into your work and opening yourself up to someone like her. Again, though, as long as one comes in fully prepared for this level of scrutiny and criticism, the class feels more rewarding and challenging in a fun way. Louise sets extremely high expectations for everybody's work: she treats you like an adult.",
    "If you are NOT an aspiring poet and look to engage in a class that will improve your work constructively, this might not be the best class to do so. Poems are expected to be near perfection and feedback is often vague\/not as helpful as you may want.",
    "Yes!! Youll receive some tough criticism of your work, but it will always be helpful. If you want to become a better poet, you shouldnt miss the chance to take class with amazing classmates and an accomplished, thoughtful, highly intelligent professor."
