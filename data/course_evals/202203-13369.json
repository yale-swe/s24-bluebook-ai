                "I got to read some critically underread Black literature published since the millenium. What I learned, both from the books and from my peers, is the way that the genre of Black literature is continually evolving with the contemporary moment. Even as books tell stories from the past, those narratives are touched by the salient topics of the present day. I also expanded my notion of what counts as literature, as the course included poetry and children's books. I learned to critically evaluate my own relationship to race and the tension between racial identity as something produced\/constructed vs racial identity as a very real force which shapes our day-to-day social interactions and reactions.",
                "Analyzing text and thinking, talking, and writing about it- great course to learn how to communicate about a text outside of the traditional essay",
                "I learned a lot about close reading, and literary analysis. We also discussed the process of knowledge-making in general, and many other topics since student presentations were a major part of the course.",
                "more insight into perceptions of contemporary Black literature, and learned a lot from the student presentations every week",
                "Perhaps the most effective element of ENGL 266 was the variety of genres on the syllabus: even looking only at literature from the past 23 years, we tackled and formed through-lines between memoir, children's literature, novels, poetry and poetic memoir, and cultural criticism. The ENGL 266 supplied breadth without sacrificing depth, and what was perhaps most valuable was that my personal feelings about each week's readings never impacted my excitement for the class conversation to come. Even those readings I wouldn't personally return to for matters of individual taste were granted serious, full-bodied, and layered discussions in class."

                "The syllabus is amazing. Pretty much every book will blow your mind and sometimes bring you to tears. The format of the course, long discussions in a small seminar, is the perfect way to dissect the book. You never know where the conversation will take you. I would have perhaps appreciated more conversations from student to student, sometimes it felt like all discussion was filtered through the professor, but of course this is challenging to do when there are certain points that need to be touched on.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Engaging readings with a decently manageable workload that gets easier toward the end of the semester\r\n- Interesting and collaborative discussions in class\r\n\r\nSuggestions: \r\n- A more unified theme would help the tone\/analysis of the class\r\n- More time or perhaps two separate class times per week",
                "The greatest strength is Sarah Mahurin- best professor I have had at Yale. She cares about students and texts, the reading list is fantastic (including Lemonade!), the class community is strong. I only wish we had more time to talk about the reading (and I think that's more indicative of the class environment than a real weakness)",
                "Strengths - Dean Mahurin, the student presentations, opportunities for a creative assignments, the reading list \r\nWeakness - I wish we had a chance to see everyone's projects at the end of the semester, but otherwise no notes!",
                "strengths: strong reading list, amazing professor, individualized student presentations; only suggestion for improvement is that some weeks, our discussions could have struck a better balance between being anecdotal vs. rooted in the text. Some part of me also wanted class twice a week to get to be in that space and engage with the text\/my peers more often, but a once a week seminar also has its own benefits",
                "This semester was the inaugural offering of ENGL 266, and it goes without saying that the syllabus could easily have a hundred other iterations: there is no one way to wholly encapsulate 21st-century black literature over the course of fourteen weeks. That said, I thought this semester's syllabus was wonderfully varied, rich, and effective for generating discussion (and, just as importantly, overall a delight to read). As is often the case in seminars with syllabi this good, students this committed, and professors as enthusiastic as Prof. Mahurin, I left most class sessions wishing there'd been more time for discussion. As such, I can see a course like ENGL 266 benefitting from twice-a-week scheduling, but beyond that I have no major qualms or suggestions for improvement."

You will learn so much from the books, the professor, and your peers. Any class with Dean Mahurin is a gem and if you do it right, I guarantee it will be one of your favorite courses at Yale.",

                "yes! this was also only the first semester it was taught and Professor Mahurin is pretty responsive to feedback, so I think it'll keep getting better",
                "It's hard to think of anyone for whom a course like ENGL 266 wouldn't be of value. Black literature is, of course, also just literature, and students need not be English or AfAm majors to find excitement in a syllabus so compelling and so varied. The course's temporal focus means that each text, even if not set in the present day, is hugely relevant to the very world through which we move and in which we operate each day, and Prof. Mahurin deftly combines serious textual analysis with the sheer joy of engaging with formidable literature."
