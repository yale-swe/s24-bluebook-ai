                "Every class was so engaging and I looked forward to getting to sign everyday. I enjoyed all of the assignments, activities, and the service project. The only improvement would be to mix up the seating arrangement more so that people have the opportunity to sign with new classmates and get used to different signing \"accents\".",
                "love this course, finally got into it on my second go around of trying to after they added more sections. the only aspect of this class that could be improved is the community service project. there's little to no structure, and it is up to students to figure out how to go about it. it's also a big-time ask for community involvement hours distribution to give to students. Julia didn't monitor how many hours we specifically spent where which was nice because I never kept track, I just went to the events that I was available for. And that wasn't the majority of them, but still a good amount. \r\n\r\nASL students and ASL users at Yale have such a cool integrated community that other language communities don't have. it's something really unique to the ASL community that I really love.",
                "Strengths: Everything about the class, especially having Fridays be asynchronous days.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is not so much a weakness, as it is an understanding that this was a pilot program, but an improvement in clarity of how the service projects are supposed to function would be beneficial.",
                "Strengths: Very engaging, taught in a clear manner, adapts to the day-the-day needs of students and encourages a learning environment. Professor is very nice. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Did not have a running list of signs learned throughout the semester. I think having this (even if its small) would help quantify progress.",
                "I feel that this class had a teacher that took their time with students to make sure that they learned and were able to stay engaged during class time and also provided ample opportunity to learn outside of class time."

                "Yes absolutely! It's very engaging and a great way to learn more about the Deaf community!",
                "Absolutely! This class will make you aware of Deaf culture, which is so fascinating! And, it will make you want to go all the way to L5 in ASL because of how supportive the ASL program. I believe the support found in the instruction of ASL at Yale is truly unparalleled in the other languages offered.",

Dr. Julia is a great professor to help facilitate learning and she is very encouraging and engaging every day. I think anyone would benefit from this class because you learn the foundations of ASL, learn more about a different culture, and have a ton of fun.",
