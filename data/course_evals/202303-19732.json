            "comments": [
                "The course content was fun, and almost all the lectures were enjoyable. I wish the thqs were graded faster, but the TAs had a lot of work on their plates with such a big class.",
                "I think that a fair number of the lectures were very engaging, and I thought it was very neat to learn from experts about different topics in genetics. \r\n\r\nThe primary weakness of this class was not receiving feedback on graded assignments. It took so long to receive grades on certain assignments that it was difficult to know how one was doing in the course and thus there was no means of knowing whether to improve or change any approaches to working through problem sets or writing paper summaries for discussion.",
                "strengths: able to understand basics of molecular genetics, and how to plan and conduct genetic basic science experiments. I really enjoyed discussions of articles - theses sessions were very interactive, in smaller groups, and helped me learn how to read genetic papers with deeper understanding and reasonable criticism. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: many classes were difficult to follow, many concepts were presented in a chaotic way. Many homework's questions were not clearly expressed and vague; homework was difficult and time consuming. Most of the homework was graded weeks after students' submission, so we could not get the feedback about the homework in a timely manner. The class was large which did not allow more individualized learning.",
                "The discussions were definitely more engaging than the lectures. I really appreciated the discussion led by Monkol Lek, as we got to think beyond the experiments and data, but also about the global implications of this area of research (such as thinking about socioeconomic disparities) and why certain findings might actually be incorrect. More discussions should aim to focus on these aspects, and not just the hard science. As for the lectures, they didn't always feel very engaging, and sometimes the take home questions did not feel like a good reflection of what we learned in class.",
                "I liked learning about the pros and cons of each approach/technique",
                "Strengths: the lectures are great! I really appreciated the structure of a teaching team, with each lecturer delivering 2(ish) lectures. It allowed for each lecturer to focus on their area of research and I felt that we had super enthusiastic lecturers because of this set-up. I also appreciated how the take home questions were thorough and connected classroom instruction to real world practice. I also loved the papers that were selected for discussions. Many of them were foundational papers in genetic analysis, and it was honestly beautiful seeing how researchers in the 70s and 80s used such clever experimental design to answer their questions when today we do a lot of that work computationally. \r\n\r\n \r\nWeaknesses: Many of the take home questions (THQs) had questions that were unclear and/or poorly written. This made it very difficult to understand what a question was asking and led to many clarifications delivered through announcements on Canvas as students approached different members of the teaching team in confusion. It also often led to class-wide extensions so students had enough time to complete the assignments with a full understanding of what the question was asking. \r\n\r\nI would also have appreciated receiving feedback more consistently throughout the semester--I received most of my grades in the last 2 weeks of the term and after the term ended. There were comments on assignments that would have been helpful to know as the semester progressed. However, while it would have been nice to have these comments, they didn't significantly impede my work on other assignments \r\n\r\nBoth of these are comments on course organization, and while occasionally frustrating, neither disrupted my learning experience on the whole.",
                "The discussions and lectures could be more involved and participatory. The lecture room is huge and very impersonal so it could be more benefical to be in a different space to make everyone feel more welcome and be more involved. The problem sets were difficult and many lecturers didn't teach the skills necessary to complete their questions.",
                "Interactive learning with all classmates",
                "Uploading lecture material before the lecture starts can help.",
                "One of the biggest weaknesses is that it was inconsistent from professor to professor. Some had very stringent grading and expectations while others did not. I felt also that many of the professors taught specifics that are being researched in their lab and not the fundamentals or basics of the area they are teaching about. This is especially problematic because many of the students taking the class have never taken a genetics course before and needed basic concepts before diving in to the specific research of a particular lab.",
                "strength: applying the concepts learnt in class through problem sets was very helpful for my learning. I also appreciated that some of the problems were returned with good feedback. Reading discussion papers was also good to engage us in class. \r\nweakness: the classroom was too big for the class size. Wish some of the lecturers could spend more time explaining specific applications/problems like how we were asked to do the problem sets, instead of talking about the big picture in broad terms."

                "Depends on the expectations, probably the course would be ok for people who plan to do research related to genetics. Not good for people interested more in transitional or clinical research. Overall many classes were difficult to follow and many concepts were presented in a chaotic way.",
                "yes",
                "Yes! It was an amazing course! The format of it worked really well for me--there are two types of assignments discussion essays and take home questions and that's all you turn in over the course of the semester. Both assignment types were open everything (open note, open internet, and you could collaborate with friends) which was invaluable. I learned so much by going through scientific research papers and talking with classmates. This also reduced my stress--I didn't have to worry about a final exam or a final project as all the assignments were finished and submitted about 3-4 weeks before the end of the semester. \r\n\r\nIt's a graduate level course and the vast majority of the students are graduate students, but I think I benefitted from taking it as an undergraduate. The undergrads get our own section, so when we met for discussion section (which took the place of a regular lecture when they happened--they didn't happen in addition to the regular 2 lectures a week) it was maybe 6 or 7 of us. This was perfect, we could go through things at our own pace and I quickly made friends to study with. It also meant that the different TAs who led section knew us and they were a great help over email and before and after class to answer any questions we had about the take-home questions. \r\n\r\nThere are different lecturers every couple of classes, but I found that lectures still connected clearly and I was able to build a comprehensive understanding. That is, the different lecturers built to a greater understanding rather than a disjointed and confusing picture of genetic analysis. \r\nMy last piece of advice is that the assignments take FOREVER at the beginning of the semester, but towards the end I could finish an assignment we had 2 weeks for within 4-5 hours.",
