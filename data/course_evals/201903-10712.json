   "comments": [
    "I was able to learn the insights of Ancient and Medieval Western Literature, ranging from Homer to Dante. Given the extensive and often richly packed reading required, I very quickly developed my close-reading skills. Class discussions and three weeklong essay assignments further improved my argumentation skills. Overall, I leave the course with a strong grounding in said literature and having developed my critical reading skills.",
    "I learned how to close read a text at a level that I had never been exposed to before. That single new skill has been instrumental in changing the way I view the world.",
    "This course was a wonderful\r\nIntroduction to classic literature texts. I further developed my close reading skills, and learned more about effective literature writing.",
    "Learnt a lot about cornerstones of western literature",
    "I learned how to fit close reading into the context of a larger work. We spent a lot of time looking at details in certain excerpts in class and then the lectures gave a broader picture of the texts.",
    "Close-reading",
    "I read several of the classic works of western literature.",
    "I developed my close reading essay writing skills",
    "I learned how to write a literary analysis paper that meets college standards, and I gained a much more comprehensive understanding of the development of the Western literary canon.",
    "We went over the classic works of literature from Homer to Dante. It made understanding works in their historical context and making literary comparisons easy. As with most survey courses, deeply engaging with texts was harder but we managed to do so surprisingly well. I felt that after this course I especially improved my ability to structure essays.",
    "reading, writing, deep literary analysis"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Besides the fast paced nature of DS in general, I have no complaints about this course. Getting to really dive into sections of the books we read in lit was definitely a strength.",
    "Very structured, appealing lectures, seminars can be more directed and focused, readings can be extracted",
    "I though that sometimes the feedback on our essays was a little unclear. Sometimes he would provide comments advising a broader focus, and then the next paper would say something about being more specific. By the end of the semester, I think I understood where he was coming from, but I would have appreciated more consistent advice.",
    "Nothing I would change, great class",
    "It is a great syllabus. Sometimes it moves too fast and the works aren't given their proper due.",
    "The strengths of this course were the quality of the discussions and the implementation of student-led questioning.\r\nThe weaknesses of this course were the fast pace, and the fact that there were few office hours.",
    "You get a fantastic sense of the breadth of Western Literature, and cover the [several] books in surprising depth. That being said it is a survey course, and of western literature, so you will not be able to give any of the texts the individual attention they deserve nor will you gain a sense of non-western literature.",
    "I feel that some of the books we read deserved longer than one class. Also, I found some of the lectures difficult to engage with.",
    "loved the works we read \r\n\r\nwish it was made clearer what the point of reading Romans was"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it to any student with a strong sense of discipline, a genuine interest in the humanities, and an open-minded curiosity. However, because the course calls for a significant commitment, especially if one wants to take full advantage of it, I would not recommend it to anyone who does not see these traits in themselves.",
    "I would, but they have to be the kind of person who is prepared to change their mindset and have their ideas challenged. I did not enjoy the feeling of being constantly judged in the seminar, and I feel that this course and its instructor sometimes contribute to that environment.",
    "Definitely. Of the three DS courses, this was my favorite.",
    "DS is amazing and exposes me to works of literature that I will otherwise never read",
    "Yes, the DS literature track is an amazing opportunity to create a foundation for every literature course, writing assignment, and dinner party conversation for the rest of our lives.",
    "Yes, good if you like to read",
    "Yes, I  thought especially for a prospective literature major it would be very useful to get a taste of the major works.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but only if I knew they were ready to handle the amount of reading and essaywriting.",
    "I highly recommend this course to individuals who ENJOY reading. None of the texts are easy, but their language is accessible and the reading load is manageable if you are strategic. Do NOT take this course for the prestige of the DS program or for personal pride at having \"conquered\" the great texts of western literature. If you do not actually enjoy the reading, the course will be a chore, not a privilege.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Like I said in response to the first question, Directed Studies as a whole really emphasizes the way that different texts build upon and communicate with each other. This knowledge transforms the way the works are read, and makes them more interesting to read in my opinion.",
    "yes, amazing course, learned so much and grew as a reader, writer, and student greatly"
