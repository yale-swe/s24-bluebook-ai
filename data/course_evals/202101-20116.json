                "The course was well-organized for asynchronous learning. One weakness is that given the labs sometimes took longer than the allotted time to complete. In an in-person lab, there would have been a hard cutoff at the end of lab.",
                "This course provided a good overview of the evolutionary history and morphology of various vertebrate organ systems, and information which was densely packed in its initial presentation was often reinforced by requiring larger conclusions to be drawn. However, in many other cases no larger goal seemed to be in mind, and the sole purpose of the class seemed to be acquiring densely packed information for its own sake, an impression not helped by the hourslong silences in Zoom, only interrupted by requests for help with a single narrow factual question.",
                "The strengths of this class are that the lab handouts are very detailed and working through the material yourself is completely self-paced. The weakness of this course is that there is quite a lot of work each week and the exams can be difficult.",
                "The strengths are that we were able to compare the anatomies of different organisms every week. I also appreciated that the lab reports were short. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "Professor Evans clearly enjoyed her work and was very engaging! A good variety of virtual resources were provided for each lab, oftentimes we could choose which model/video/simulation we felt we could learn best from. Sometimes I felt not enough identification/background resources were provided, or the resources provided did not explain in enough detail. However, this guided me to do research on my own, which I felt was very helpful in its own way. In a similar vein, sometimes I felt I did not get enough feedback on my lab reports, i.e. when I included hypotheses about how certain anatomical features were developed, and never found out whether my intuition was right. I probably could have asked the professor directly though had I really REALLY wantedto know the answer. These are very small critiques though. Overall this course was incredibly fun and engaging!",
                "For a virtual lab course, this class did a great job of orienting students to key anatomical features and online resources. However, I sometimes felt that labs were more identification-based, whereas lab report questions and exams focused more on explaining the development of structures through evolutionary times/the lifespan of an organism--a subject that we weren't given as many resources to help study for.",
                "The lab is great. Dr. Evans made an effort to make this interactive. Overall def top of my Yale lab experience even though it's online. \r\n\r\nI just have one major complaint, which is the course scheduling. The class ended one week early, on April 29/30 instead of the week of May 7th, so we couldn't cover any of the internal organs or the urogenital system, which I thought was a HUGE LOSS. Although I was secretly happy that I didn't have to do more work, this is not something I'd look back on and be satisfied with. I feel like the course is incomplete in this manner. \r\n\r\nUrogenital systems and knowledge about the reproductive organs are SO IMPORTANT! Arguably they are the most important things in life (if life history theory and Richard Dawkins say so). Yet we often put them at a very low priority, which infuriates me. It's important to learn about them, for men to learn about female counterparts and vice versa, to develop an appreciation for life. I think this was completely neglected in the course."

                "The virtual lectures at the beginning of each lab were information rich and delivered effectively, though in some cases the information contained in them was only useful after some progress had been made on the lab activities. The use of a microscope simulator and manipulatable 3D Unity models, which allowed for students to generate their own images, was also an effective way to communicate anatomical features. However, the emphasis on still images or videos, and sketching the structures therein, often felt arbitrary, as students had no role in generating the images, and the images existed in complete form already, so sketches could only ever be a pale facsimile with less detail.",
                "I liked that we had online office hours each week to ask questions about our lab reports, and that we had lab hours to work through our labs by ourselves with the professor present in case we needed clarification on things.",
                "I really appreciated that students could work on the lab reports on their own time, but that there was dedicated time during class to work on the report as well. It was also great that although the lecture was live, it was also recorded for students who couldn't make that time or who just wanted to view the lecture later to review what they learned or missed when watching the lecture live.",
                "The lab resources were incredibly well adapted for the pandemic. I like the setup that we all worked individually on the zoom call. This also gave me a lot of flexibility to work on lab at a pace that was right for me. I might get a bit overwhelmed with all the examples, but then I could take a break and come back later.",
                "A more organized collection of online dissection resources would have been helpful, instead of simpling pasting various links throughout the lab handouts. Other than that, I though the instructors did a great job of accomodating the virtual learning conditions!",
                "The recorded videos could be a bit more clear in terms of the position of the specimen, for example, by indicating which is the anterior / posterior side, what are we looking at. Otherwise it's not bad. \r\n\r\nI'd much prefer doing this lab online over in person. My family has 6 cats, and I just cannot imagine myself dissecting a cat. I'd probably throw up and cry nonstop."

The lab handouts give you enough space to ask questions and formulate your own hypotheses. For covid times, the course uses a combination of lab simulations, 3D models, virtual dissection, dissection videos, etc. so you can generally choose your best way to learn, though towards the end it is mostly dissection videos.
