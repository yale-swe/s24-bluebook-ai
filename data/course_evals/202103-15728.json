                "I was forced to think much more critically in this course than other courses I took during the semester. I learned how to make connections between the texts we read during the semester as opposed to just reading texts and then passively carrying the knowledge I gained from them. I was exposed to authors and ideas I had never heard of before and really deepened my understanding of the world as a whole.",
                "I learned how to critically think about racial inequalities in various aspects of media from theoretical, historical, and current viewpoints. In class, I strengthened my skills of being able to engage in meaningful discourse about race."

                "Strengths: class discussion \r\nWeaknesses: the reading assignments were often vague and hard to tie into class content",
                "The strengths are the extremely engaging readings and the use of Perussal which allows students to comment and reply to their classmates, leading to great conversations and learning new perspectives. The content in general was quite compelling. Fatima El-Tayeb has great insight and is a great seminar professor. Sometimes assignments and due dates weren't very clear as we steered away from the syllabus a little.",
                "This was discussed in class but the fact that we had to do the readings for the class about 2-3 days before we met for the class made it difficult to retain information until the class. And while it would've been helpful to review the night before class, I think that most of us had a lot of other work to do for other classes and we just did what we could. A strength of the course was how often our Professor asked for our feedback. She was always checking to see how we were with the workload and was willing to adjust as needed which was really great.",
                "Great course!",
                "A strength of the class is that the weekly readings are very engaging and highly interesting, and it is very helpful to see other students' comments on Perusall. Another strength is the use of outside media, such as the Willie Horton ad, Caroline Conway livestream, the gendered ad mixer, etc. These outside sources were very helpful in providing visuals to better our understandings in the topics covered in the weekly readings. There aren't any weaknesses that come to mind."

                "This is a level 300 seminar and as a first-year with no knowledge of the subject, I was definitely in a bit overhead. That's not to say that I didn't adjust or come to enjoy the class but it can be a lot to take in. I would recommend it as a spring semester first-year class if it is taught then or as a sophomore and above class.",
                "Yes, I would recommend.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. This class allowed me to learn about racial inequalities in areas I was totally unaware of. I think this class teaches the spectacularization of race in a meaningful and insightful way that more students need to learn about."
