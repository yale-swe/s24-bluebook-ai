    "Improved Spanish grammar. Learned so many new tenses like past perfect, imperfect subjunctive, pluscuamperfecto, etc.",
    "I learned a great deal of both vocabulary and grammatical structure.  For the latter, many tenses including the pluscuamperfecto, pluscuamperfecto de subjuntivo, pretrito perfecto, prterito perfecto de subjuntivo and condicional, among others.  Si clauses and their functionality, prepositions, the passive voice, indirect style, and uses of se, among many other grammatical themes were learned.  The biggest thing I learned in this course was getting better at speaking Spanish.  The constant in class practice and weekly conversations really helped me to improve my previously almost non-existent speaking skills.",
    "I learned more about the spanish culture and more complex grammar structures.",
    "Advanced level of grammar, greatly developed speaking skills, deeper comprehension of hard literature texts",
    "I greatly improved my Spanish oral speaking skills as well as my grammar."

   "comments": [
    "More practice speaking is needed.",
    "L4 gives a lot more opportunities to write daily and speak in small groups. I really enjoyed the conversations outside the classes that helped practice our speaking skills.",
    "It might be not a weakness, but it is too intense, even if thinking that the program can be spread out for the whole semester (not one month). In my opinion, some of the grammar topics should be introduced in L3, leaving less of them for completion in L4. Definitely a huge step between L3 and L4: harder texts, more writing.",
    "They did a very good job of adapting to online learning. Material was taught quite quickly but understandable for a summer course.",
    "Everything was over Zoom, so obviously it was a little bit more difficult to have class discussions, but I thought the professors did a great job of organizing the course so that we maximized speaking and one on one time."
