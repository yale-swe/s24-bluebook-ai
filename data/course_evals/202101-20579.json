                "At times it felt a little disorganized, but not in a 'classes and the material felt scattered and incoherent. For example, the date for the midterm was not known until the work before(if I recall correctly), but I somehow ended up not being bothered by that. The class notes were amazing and I really enjoyed Professor Chang's teaching style. He really tried to make complex and abstract topics accessible to students. The psets were challenging but rewarding.",
                "Professor is great, as are the course notes. It was a shame it was virtual - it's hard to pay good attention on Zoom. I think the Professor could be slightly more responsive to emails.",
                "Thought it might be better to have this course involve a more proof-based approach (measure theory based), although that is probably not what most of the students are looking for. Maybe it could be good to have two versions of the this class, with one more focused on rigorous proofs.",
                "Overall I thought the course was very interesting and I learned a lot from it. I thought that the combination of the live lectures and the full lecture notes were very helpful to reference. I learned a lot from doing the psets. I thought Professor Chang did a great job with the course and I thought he explained the content well in class and did a good job answering student questions. \r\n\r\nI think my biggest grievances with the course were how some of the ULA office hours were run. I recognize it was difficult for them this year since most of them had taken the class with a different professor, so it mostly wasn't really their fault and would probably improve in future years. However, in the first couple office hours I went to it seemed like the ULA didn't understand the homework question or my questions about it, and they even gave me a couple suggestions that ultimately led me astray and turned out incorrect. Towards the end of the semester I started going to ULA office hours again, this time to Eduardo's office hours, and those were frustrating in a different way because he would essentially just write out most of the answers to the pset questions for everyone. It seemed like he was often generally writing directly from the answer key, albeit usually not writing the entire solution, but generally not particularly challenging students to think for themselves. There were also some comments he made that felt a bit like mild put downs like \"I hope everyone took the 8th grade,\" \"everyone should understand MCMC by now\" (before realizing the confusing parts about it that he late struggled to explain), and \"you should know what this converges to, don't plot it\" (before then later realizing that he didn't know what it converges to and having to plot it himself). These weren't awful instances or anything but I guess it just didn't feel like the most welcoming learning environment, more just like someone was sharing answers and less to explain concepts and meet students where they were at. I recognize it is a difficult balance to strike between giving sufficient versus too much help, but it was frustrating to on the one hand early in the semester not be able to have my questions answered or have them answered in a misleading way and then at the end of the semester feel like everyone was just being given pset answers without helping us to understand concepts or challenging us to think for ourselves so much. This is just one perspective though and I think other people enjoyed the later office hours, so my perspective of course should be taken with a grain of salt.",
                "The only strength of this class was the textbook. The weaknesses of the class include the unclear and boring lectures based on a better textbook, the unreasonably long and hard assignments and exams, and ridiculousness of the optional final project. Never have I seen a professor decide to make people inevitably cry when taking a final exam, given its absurd difficulty.",
                "The course material itself was interesting, and highly relevant to a lot of fields. However, the lectures and overall course structure were highly disorganized. There was little clarity as to the overall course direction and several of the smaller topics/applications felt unmotivated. In particular, the second half of the course was really scattered, and we did not delve into any of the concepts in detail. Students were given little direction as to what would be on the final.",
                "Not too many strengths. The topics have potential to be interesting\r\nThe course itself was taught very poorly, and the problem sets  though interesting and somewhat inspiring  seemed to deviate from the material a bit too much. The exams were amazingly difficult and made us feel somewhat defeated by the end of the semester. Perhaps if you are a genius or find these topics very inspiring, you could do well, but for most of us, I dont think that was the case.",
                "Strength: I love Professor Chang's written notebook and his genuine care for students. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I don't think there was an obvious one.",
                "Class was rather disorganized, some material went by way too fast, while others were way too slow. Not exactly sure who the intended audience was - math majors with lots of proficiency with proofs, or people who are more inclined to computation.",
                "I think the second half of the course was rushed compared to the first half. It wouldve been nice to go at a slower pace in the second half of the course.",
                "Strength: Joe Chang is a pretty good lecturer and most lectures were pretty intuitive and engaging, weekly psets weren't too bad with office hours, overall pretty good class\r\n\r\nWeakness: when we got to hard/unintuitive topics in class (e.g. differential equations) things weren't explained very well, exams were pretty difficult."

It's a large lecture but there weren't many teaching staff, and communication with them was kind of slow. The lectures themselves were hard to follow some times, and the weekly psets took a while as well. The exams, especially the final, were pretty difficult.",

The lectures were disorganized and it was hard to see the big picture of everything until the course was finally finished. The problem sets were difficult, and the topics had little motivation, so the class seemed really boring in general. I would recommend socially distancing yourself from this class and take something more interesting and rigorous, such as advanced probability or real analysis. The class is even worse when you have students in the class who ask irrelevant questions, and with a professor whos really nice and has the willingness to respond to these questions in detail, the class basically became a daily session of pulling teeth.",
                "Yes. Stochastic is very important in multiple areas in natural and social sciences. If you can, take it with Professor Chang.",
