I learned about various nations and peoples (Parthians, Kushans, Yuezhi, Sogdians, etc.) and studied objects from these cultures.

                "The topic of this course was fascinating as it presented the Silk Roads as a network of cultural and artistic exchange instead of just economic. The course was also structured relatively loosely so as to prioritize lecture and student engagement over strenuous assignments (there were still assignments but they were not incredibly stressful, but still worthwhile and didactic).\r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course was that it perhaps had too much breadth. As someone who had never taken an art history course before, I found it a bit overwhelming and found myself wondering whether I had accidentally signed up for an advanced art history course. I wonder if the instructor could narrow the scope of the course a bit and focus more on introducing students to the discipline of art history and select regions of the Silk Roads.",
                "Strengths: recorded lectures, interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were a bit long for me since I have ADHD.",
                "The class is very good overall.",
                "Strengths: The course material is fascinating. We focused on a variety of objects and civilizations I had never even heard of before. \r\nWeaknesses: The readings were a bit dense at times. It was also difficult to map (temporally and spatially) the art \/ civilizations we looked at, in relation to one another.",
                "Strengths: Mimi's passion and energy for the class! She was also incredibly understanding of the taxing semester, and was extremely willing to work with students to allow us to succeed.",
                "I liked that in each lecture we explored some puzzling aspect of the art studied in that section. It was a bit difficult to track down all the different resources we needed for each class, especially since many of them had very large file sizes.",
                "I really appreciated how much content was covered over the course of the semester, and how thorough the curriculum was in exposing us to a huge variety of cultures and forms of art. Only thing I might alter would be the density of the readings, which were often extensive for each class.",
                "Strengths: Mimi's lectures are key strength of this course. She not only clearly knowledgeable about the many peoples, places, and things this course covers but also passionate about the things she teaches. The 30 minute section for this course was a very nice addition--it served as a great environment to sharpen observation and discussion skills. Another feature I loved about the course was the crosscurrents section. It was very cool to re-examine patterns we may or may not have missed throughout the many weeks of lectures in the final few classes! \r\nAlso, I really appreciate that there is not too much stress about grades in this course. This freed me to be creative and to just focus on learning the things I enjoyed learning. As such, this course is one of a handful of courses where you can learn for the sake of learning, and as far as your motivation pushes you--and there's no shortage of materials to work with. \r\nWeaknesses: I think this course could have benefited from dedicating a portion of the live lecture to intentional student and teacher\/TA discussion. I understand that this may not be ideal, as not everyone can log on to participate, but perhaps it could be made clear that these discussions are not mandatory but rather for our own enrichment. I realized from section that I learn a LOT from my classmates too--if there was just a bit more of what I experienced in section in lecture as well, that would be great!",
                "All course materials, from lecture PowerPoints to readings, being available on Canvas was very helpful for review. Assignments are not heavy nor stressful. Called brief notes, they are a way to explore and engage with the material without having to do a lot of essay-writing and research. The final project is flexible so students can engage with the material in a way that is fun and interesting.\r\nProfessor Mimi really cares about her students' wellbeing. She is really passionate about the subject and good at explaining it in an organized way, so her lectures are engaging. Also, she is patient and open-minded towards students' questions and comments. For example, she allows creative flexibility for the final project (it is by default a 10-page paper but one can discuss with her to do something else). This semester, in light of the pandemic and other unfortunate events, she was very considerate of students' mental health, extending assignment deadlines and lightening the workload.\r\nThis course could improve by making it a bit clearer to students what resources are available. Perhaps tell students at the beginning of the course what is going to be posted on Canvas."

I appreciate that she did not force students to participate given the more difficult circumstances this year, and I also appreciate the plethora of different ways (live lecture, section, recorded lecture, powerpoint slides, readings, etc.) to engage with this course, and the flexibility students have in making use of these options or not. One major point is that the lack of timed assessments (i.e. tests) in this course made learning much more palatable and relaxed. \r\nI do still think some intentional live discussions could have been very enriching, although if this is implemented, this should not be a mandatory requirement. Section was a fantastic addition to the course and Emily Cox (TA) did an amazing job helping us study objects in finer detail, leading discussions with interesting questions and engaging students' questions with enthusiasm and curiosity.",

                "Yes--it is a fascinating subject, and Mimi is a great professor. This course will expose you to a lot of art that isn't usually highlighted in art history courses, although it should be. The workload is not heavy, which gives you the chance to really enjoy the material. The \"brief notes\" assignments are a great way to practice visual analysis, and the final project has so much room for creativity. It is an excellent survey class for art history majors, and it is also a must-take class for anyone interested in Eurasian art and history.",
