                "I'm not sure if this is due to zoom, but it was a seminar of 10 students and there was no interaction ever. Even the first day there wasn't the typical, \"let's go around and introduce ourselves\". It was straight into lecture and that never changed.",
                "The class is unique in that it is one of the few classes which focus solely on ArcGIS, so having the opportunity to learn about the platform from a professor who knows a great deal about the platform is quite valuable. Professor Tomlin does a great job of keeping the lessons straightforward and does a great deal of work to make sure the supporting materials for each lecture are clear and helpful. If there is a weakness to the class it is probably the pace of learning, I would have preferred to learn and work with more advanced operations or aspects of the program at the latter portion of the semester, but felt that the later portions of the curriculum did not challenge us sufficiently.",
                "Weaknesses: There are no grades / no feedback on the assignments throughout the semester. \r\nStrengths: If students ask for feedback, Professor Tomlin will be incredibly responsive and provide very helpful support and feedback for the final project.",
                "The class is focused on PSETs that provide a lot of good, hands-on experience with ArcGIS Pro. This culminates in a final project, which lets you go in-depth with a topic that interests you. Because the PSETs are such a focus, you can feel pretty distant from the class and the instructors.",
                "Weaknesses - grades only based on the final project, don't get feedback on weekly homeworks, final projects are based on ranking among students. Extremely difficult to stay engaged.",
                "It kind of blows to not have any feedback all semester...homework is for completion and it doesnt feel like he looks at it for how well done it is. Also, no guidelines for the final project, or instructions.",
                "Strengths: The class was effective in teaching the basics of GIS. The materials in the tutorials was especially helpful. Extra material made available to the class generally was really great.\r\nWeaknesses: the lecture format is not very engaging, and isn't very helpful overall. Even though all the information is there, the way it is posed just wasn't effective for me. Technical issues also posed an issue- unavoidable, but made it more challenging to take anything from lectures. A cut-down, prerecorded lecture would have been better, probably. As it was, the tutorials and other written material were more than enough to aid me in understanding GIS.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness was not receiving any feedback on any of the weekly homework assignments. It made it difficult to know how I was progressing, and felt like my effort and time wasn't being valued. There was little guidance given on the specifics of the term project, and the class syllabus wasn't helpful in this regard. The class also didn't use the Canvas page, and all material was distributed and received through a shared Google Drive. This was fine, but inconvenient at times, especially when trying to join a Zoom lecture (had to use a link sent from the professor's non-Yale email the first week of class).",
                "The grading scheme is the obvious downside, with your entire grade being determined by your final project even though there is still other homework. Also, Professor Tomlin isn't always the most engaging lecturer, and he doesn't give much feedback at all. However, he really knows his stuff (he's a giant in the field!) and is super helpful in office hours and over email. Also, his weekly tutorials are well-designed and very helpful. And, the homeworks help you build up to your project in a good way."

It's not like we haven't had any work, we've had weekly assignments, but of these assignments, I have yet to receive a single grade or ounce of feedback as to whether my work is meeting expectations. Extremely frustrating and unusual.",

Otherwise, this might not be a great use of your time if you both think you'll never use ArcGIS and are heavily considering other classes.",

                "No. It wasn't engaging. Maybe this is because of COVID and zoom classes but it was not engaging, and the grade only comprising of the final project in which students are ranked against each other is highly stressful.",
                "I would recommend this course since it is effective at teaching GIS, with the caveat that self-directed learning with material provided will probably be the best way to approach the class.",
