    "I learnt so much about how to write well through this course. Going in my style of writing was completely different to what it is now. I can write more directly, with more purpose, and more effectively. I am a much better and confident writer because of this course. I have also learnt how to read better, i.e. identify the techniques writers use and why and how they come to be effective.",
    "I learned how to effectively express myself and turn experiences into engaging narratives. Super useful!!!",
    "I learned more about creative non-fiction writing and about how to tell a better story through writing.",
    "I learned a lot about the fundamentals of writing and I developed my writing much further from where I was in high school. I also developed a skill for editing essays.",
    "A good bit of practice (five ~1,200 word essays, with rough drafts and final copies) at writing non-fiction essays, through which I gained a deeper understanding of narrative structure (i.e. setting up themes and tensions for subsequent emotional pay-offs, circular structures).",
    "I think I became a much better writer through this course. I learned how to simplify, make my writing more immediate, and build a structure. I feel much more confident now than I did at the beginning of the term."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course has many strengths, the biggest one is that you will be a better writer by the time you complete this course. Because of the draft system in each one of the units, you will be forced to think about and edit your work until it is significantly better than what you submitted the first time. The workshops structure also helps to build an encouraging and comfortable class environment. It allows for you to become more confident in your work, and at the same time makes you better at giving feedback and also at analyzing other's writing. \r\n\r\nThe one thing that I think can be improved about this course is how to get the readings to directly impact your own writing. We read a lot and had through discussion about our readings in class, but I was never quite sure about how to use them to create a marked improvement in my work.",
    "I loved the layout of the course and the diverse topics we wrote about. Don't have any suggestions for improvements.",
    "We read a lot of different styles of essays in this course, which provided many different perspectives for writing. This was very good. I think it also helped the course to read other students' papers; it allowed for an opportunity to edit, which is very important. I think that the course could be improved by having better discussions about the readings.",
    "The readings were mostly fantastic, and the frequent writing feedback was very helpful. \r\nThough the latter part of the course was meant to emphasize line-by-line prose, I felt we could have delved more into sentence mechanics, as well as received more detailed feedback on that in our essays. For example, we practiced principles of varying sentence lengths, but rarely got into the weeds of altering the grammatical structures and diction of individual sentences.",
    "I think the focus on writing, even when engaging in literary analysis, was very helpful. The feedback on essays was also really great. I think that class times could have been structured a bit better, and maybe interspersed with more in-class exercises to break up the long reading breakdowns."

    "Yes, I would. This is a brilliant course for anyone who likes writing or wants to be a better writer. It gives who a lot of freedom on what you want to write about. Since you pick your topics, you are deeply invested in them. The class format (drafts and workshops) are conducive to improvement and enjoyment.",
    "Yes. Extremely useful!!!",
    "I would recommend this course. I felt like my writing really improved through it.",
    "Of course  excellent course and Prof. Green is amazing.",
    "Yes. It's integral to learn how to write, no matter what field you end up in. This course prepares you really well for writing in the rest of your life.",
    "Yes, this course is a nice formal introduction to a sort of writing useful in everything from journalism to scientific research. The readings are fantastic, the frequent feedback is enormously helpful, and Prof Green is enthusiastic about the work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was very fun, challenging and immensely helpful."
