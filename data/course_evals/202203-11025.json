Is this structure/protein/thing necessary or sufficient and how can we prove that?'",

            "comments": [
                "I generally really liked this course. Quiz assessments were very clear and good for grade-boosters. However, the class moves extremely fast. We would often not cover much detail in lecture due to time constraints, and then would be tested on those details in our psets later that week. I think there is just too much material to cover in that short amount of time. That being said, lectures were enjoyable, discussion sections were manageable, and grading felt fair and accurate.",
                "The course focused a little too much on experimental methods, especially at first, and didn't cover cells in as much detail as I would've hoped.",
                "Weaknesses are that the course covers a lot of harder material very fast. You must keep up with the work or you will fall behind. Once you fall behind, it is hard to catch back up. That being said though, there are a lot of opportunities for extra support and help such as peer tutor hours and enrichment. Enrichment is great and should be offered to more students. Peer tutor hours were helpful but I wish there was more time devoted to peer tutoring.",
                "Strengths: it's a fair course, despite what other students might say. Put in the work, rewatch the lectures, and you'll get a decent grade. The Ed discussion is really great! Psets are fair as well. Enrichment is the best part of the course in my opinion. \r\n\r\nWeakness: lectures were either too long or too short or we didn't cover the intended content to the extent we expected. The long quizzes were a little brutal. Discussion section is absolutely useless. No one knows what is happening in the papers and they don't foster any kind of growth because we don't have the skill sets to read them. Choose better papers or model discussion section after enrichment. As mean as it might sound, this is an intro level course. I really don't care about anything except for what is going to be on the exam.",
                "i think the intro bio sequence is super well-organized thanks to the size of the teaching team  the expectations for psets, grades, and weekly assignments were super clear. that being said; the lectures were sometimes difficult to follow along with, and the topics we touched on (translocons? actin treadmilling? ran gtp?) sometimes felt too niche for an intro cell bio course",
                "wish they gave more study guides, practice questions, study material for post-lecture. Lecture has way too much content, so need help breaking it down afterwards",
                "The slides were really hard to follow and often confusing to read. Furthermore, the material often moved very quickly and the test would ask about something mentioned only for a second during the lecture.  \r\nOne of the strengths would definitely be the discussion sections and office hours.",
                "The strengths of this class include the organization of the learning materials and the way this class was taught. It was very interesting to see how dynamic the things we learn in this class are. Sometimes the class felt overwhelming as there was a heavy load of new information all at once. Slides were being cut from the learning plan as there was not enough time to go over them in lecture. I feel as if the specific knowledge the students should know should be approximately the same every year.",
                "lecture style did not promote learning",
                "Strength: I do think the content is interesting and I think they struck the right balance with the papers we read for section in that I felt like we learned something from each of them but they weren't over-emphasized. I also thought the peer tutoring system was pretty robust and really helpful. I also felt like the PSETs were helpful for my learning and doing them felt useful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think there's a ton of content to cover in a short amount of time so lecture moves pretty fast which can make it hard to keep up sometimes. I also feel like the exams and quizzes could have been less emphasized, I know there were earlier iterations of this class that had no exams and I think replacing the exam or at least a portion of it with a project could be helpful especially since there's a lot to learn in a little bit of time.",
                "Professor was very communicative and flexible \r\nLectures were engaging \r\nSometimes it felt a little disorganized but that was just when things came up \r\nDefinitely kind to students",
                "Strengths: gets through a lot of information that does a good job in connecting all of the concepts, meaning as you learn more all of the content begins to make more sense. \r\nWeaknesses: It's a lot of content taught and tested in a manner that relies heavily on memorization. The PSETs were really challenging and grading was very much subject to who the TA was, so the grading for homework was overall not very fair across students.",
                "The strength of this course is the discussion sections every week. This ability to apply the knowledge learned in class to a real scientific paper was helpful in learning the material. The weaknesses of the course are the preparing for the exams, I would've preferred a practice exam to know what the final will look like.",
                "Strengths: Lots of opportunities provided to practice key concepts and elevate grade (as long as you put in the work)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture often seemed to glaze over important material that was then referenced on the quizzes and problem sets",
                "Strengths: The TAs and PTs were awesome, and the structure of quizzes and p-sets was also good for timing this course with other obligations\r\nWeaknesses: Some lecture themes and ideas were sometimes glossed over when they were actually kinda important for the course material",
                "Things that could be improved:\r\n- Psets and quizzes and answer keys released too late\r\n- Quiz questions reduced greatly because not enough material was covered in class. It would probably be better if we just covered all the material in lecture instead.\r\n- Practice test released too late, answer key provided way too late\r\n- Review session for midterm was way too close to exam\r\nHandouts:\r\n    - Could be more organized. Especially since we do not have assigned textbooks for the course, we have even more need for a definitive handout.\r\n    - do not reflect actual material taught in class (some concepts are on the handout but werent taught in class and vice versa)\r\n    - It would be better if they were provided at least half a week before lecture so we could preview them\r\nSlides:\r\n    - Not enough material was covered in lecture, then the slides were just modified/deleted to match our lecture pace. That doesnt seem right.\r\n    - Some slides are skimmed over\r\n    - Many slides are repeated they could be cleaned up. The structure of the lectures could be improved / more organized. For example, ER translocation is split over unit 3 and part of unit 4.\r\n- Discussion section: I suppose this is harder to improve because it greatly depends on the other classmates, but many do not read the assigned papers, making it a bit difficult to engage in meaningful discussions about them. On the other hand, one gets practice from explaining the concepts to others, but it would probably be more stimulating if we all read the papers and tried to understand them before coming to class. The discussion section papers could also be released earlier. Also, one of the papers was not annotated, which perhaps disincentivizes people from reading it.\r\n- Typos in psets, quizzes, handouts, slides, and exams",
                "This course has a lot of support; there are many people you can reach out to for help. The professor this term also explained concepts very well, but the order in which some things were presented was confusing (sometimes it felt a little scattered)",
                "Strengths: weekly topics were organized well, discussion sections reviewed topics covered in class, homework assignments were engaging but not overly challenging or time-consuming, didnt require too much memorization, and lectures included participation activities and practice problems. Weaknesses: the pacing of lectures at the start of the term was not ideal, the topics covered felt pretty niche and separate rather than being an overview of cell biology, the exams were a little long (but still fair)",
                "strengths: very interesting content and straightforward p-sets! The grade distribution is fair and Professor Harrington/Professor Hartman are definitely a strength as they are both very passionate about the material and do their best to help students out. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes a lot of content was cut out from some of the units so calibrating how much content should be taught in the future is a good starting point",
                "Strengths:\r\n- I appreciated that the lectures were recorded.\r\n- The psets, quizzes, and exams felt fair.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The lectures were very difficult to follow (eg. important concepts were skimmed over very quickly, we often flip-flopped between topics, and we often ran out of time to complete the whole lecture).\r\n- The class seemed to focus on four very hyperspecific elements of the cell. I feel like we skipped more broad topics that are typically covered in an intro cell bio class (maybe using a textbook would be a good idea).\r\n- The lectures could've included better formatting and visuals.\r\n- I wish peer tutoring had been offered during the week, not just on the weekends.\r\n- It felt bizarre learning about all the experimental techniques without actually ever performing them. There should be a lab component to this course.",
                "This class was not facilitated for student learning. Professor Hartman is a good professor but the way she conveyed information wasn't the most concise. The slides were usually very repetitive and didn't highlight the important information which became difficult when you wanted to look over them to review the lecture. Unless you listened to the lecture, the slides were practically useless because it didn't contain any keypoints or such that was expected of you to remember. Cell bio in general is just a content heavy class and requires a lot of memorization so I wish the information in class had been better summated so we could understand and memorize the contents.",
                "I believe a strength of this course is how much biology material is taught. For students who think they are interested in biology, this is a great course to take to see if you truly are. One of the weaknesses is how packed the lectures are, because it forces a lot of time outside of the classroom dedicated to learning the material on your own.",
                "Strength: You learn alot\r\n\r\nWeakness: So. Much. Content. It often becomes unmanageable.",
                "Strengths: very well taught; well-organized; professor ensured to keep class engaged during lectures through activities; grading was fair; assignments and exams were reasonable \r\nWeaknesses: none to be honest",
                "The lectures could be more straightforward. There are connections that you have to make in your own time but unlike 101, these connections are actually crucial to learning objectives but is not as effectively discussed as it could be.",
                "There needs to be less information on the slides because it is hard to follow. Also, if possible, the course content in lecture needs to be condensed.",
                "I think that the amount of material we had to cover was way too high for the amount of lecture time we had. Professor Hartman had to rush over some concepts that should have been better explained just due to time issues. I think students would be better off if the material was cut down.",
                "The course curriculum could be better designed.",
                "The material was fast paced, so even though I attended the lectures, I often did not understand them until after I rewatched them several times. Once I got there, the material was easy to comprehend. I think more peer tutoring or office hours would be helpful in addition to the weekend hours. Also, the lecturer would prepare more content than she could cover which moved around due dates and assignments and made everything  more confusing. I would suggest that the class try to properly estimate the amount of material that can be covered from each class. I did appreciate how the lecturer didnt have a textbook and only required the students to know the material she taught instead of teaching some material and expecting us to know other things. Another suggestion I have is that the in-lecture questions could be moved to the end of lecture instead of in the middle. That way, if we run out of time we still had the lecture content covered but we can still review the content comprehension questions on our own time. Also, the homework assignments took a really long time to grade/to give us a key, so we couldnt review our incorrect answers. I also didnt like how we were expected to read very dense and hard to understand academic papers for discussion section",
                "The content is extremely dense so there is a lot of information to process after each lecture. It would be more helpful if the content taught could be more concise. It would also be helpful if, instead of reading a scientific paper for section, we could instead simply discuss what we learned this week so that we could all gain a better understanding of it instead of being introduced to more material.",
                "The strengths was the organization and structure of the class but the weakness was the somewhat unorganized slides",
                "The course covered a lot of really important fundamentals in a short time, which certainly entails some memorization of new vocabulary terms and pushing through topics that are less interesting than others. However, I know I would have benefitted greatly from taking a moment at some point within each topic to explore their current and future implications, why the scientists that made the discovery found it compelling, and relate one topic to another in the course. \r\nAdditionally, for my learning preferences, it is challenging to have the very large lecture hall be made into an interactive classroom experience, and so I did not find that aspect to be helpful. There are so many opportunities to interact and engage in discussion sections and office hours, and I felt that the lecture hall interactions were not useful to enough people given the location, and it took away time from the lecture itself.",
                "Breaks were helpful to stay engaged during class.",
                "There are a lot of opportunities for support in this course such as peer tutor office hours and enrichment; enrichment was very helpful to me in particular. This course is forced to cover a lot of information in a few very short weeks. This made the pacing of lecture a bit difficult to follow at times.",
                "I thought the lectures went far too in depth with examples and did not really teach the general concepts well.",
                "Strengths include good, helpful Psets. They were difficult but reinforced lecture topics well. The peer tutors were also a strength as they helped with these Psets. The lecture PowerPoints were also well-made. As for weaknesses, the course often felt hectic and unorganized at times. A lot of time was devoted to very specific concepts, and there are some cell biology topics I feel weren't touched on. I felt many of the quiz questions were not part of our lecture discussion, and so they were unfair.",
                "I would say a strength of this course is the ability connect lots of different complex biology ideas together to make them more comprehendible. A weakness would be the speed of the course and it's lack of ability to best prepare it's students for the examinations such as the midterm. For example, I felt very overwhelmed before the examination and saw that the only review session for the exam was late at night the night before, not leaving any available time to ask questions before the midterm. There was also not a practice exam for the final which was very challenging to study for.",
                "Strength: Lectures were in person + recorded. Weekly journal analysis sessions really helped me get more comfortable with reading scientific paper\r\n\r\nWeakness: -There was no clear syllabus. There were weekly 'handouts' which became increasingly detailed over time, however they were always released late so there wasn't time to print them and they were extremely wordy, containing information that was not explained sufficiently in the slides. \r\n-The reference for all of our content was the weekly powerpoint slides. These were very difficult to understand during and after lecture for several reasons. 1) they were incredibly repetitive. Slides were copied and pasted from week to week and then skipped through very briefly so the content order was confusing. 2) there were very many diagrams and images on each slide so that it was imposisble to know what was important 3) the structure was bad. Highlighting/bold/italics was used intersperdedly without explanation which was confusing and it was difficult to know where in the course we were\r\n-A lot of the course content was cut because the professor mistimed the lectures. This was not conveyed immedeately and it was therefore very difficult to understand what we need to know\r\n-Almost all of the quiz questions were copied from the internet!",
                "The professor made the lectures very engaging. I found the pace of the class very fast.",
                "It was very unclear what information we needed to know and was important in this course. The lectures were very fast paced and often confusing. The course also felt very disorganized as grades were handed back later than promised and we only got a practice test 2 days before the midterm.",
                "I believe that this class was a bit too fast-paced. I understand that the instructor was new to the course and for it having been her first time, I feel she did a good job. However, for the students a lot of the small problems that popped up along the way were hard to navigate, what with running out of time during lectures and having to race through material. Another qualm I have with the course in general is that a the general flow of the class does not seem to relate to previous material. I felt like each slide was introducing a new and unrelated topic. I feel that if the class had a bit more of a structure to it in the sense that each concept built off and related to one another in some way with a natural flow, it would have helped me and many other students better understand the content of the class.",
                "Strengths: very manageable workload\r\nWeakness: lectures go very fast and you definitely need to spend time outside of class to go over course content more",
                "The lecture material was very specific and felt disconnected at times. Otherwise it was a very well organized class.",
                "It was too hard, there was to much content",
                "I think it was really unnecessary for us to learn millions of lab techniques. I'm sure that a lot of students in the class do not want a career working in a biology lab, and as a matter of fact, this course has made me definitely NOT want to work in a bio lab. The lectures are way too long. The information in slides is presented and then not talked about for another 15 minutes, which made it hard to take good notes. There was not adequate enough time before the midterm to study as we didn't even have our graded problem sets back to study. I'm glad that by the end we learned some interesting stuff about cell biology, but for the most part I was extremely unhappy with this class.",
                "I liked how this course was in person. However, little effort was made to provide practice tests for the final exam.",
                "I believe the discussion sections might be better used to review information from class.",
                "Material sometimes was not organized very well. Hard to jump around (topics) during lecture when youre learning things for the very first time.",
                "Cons: Way too much information and unorganized. There was no practices for the final so it's hard to study.",
                "Strengths: opportunities to get Pset regraded, enrichment section was amazing!!! Review sessions before midterm and finals. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Transition from online lectures (101) to in person lectures can be hard, lots of material to cover and it can be confusing the extent to which you should know things. Not enough opportunities to meet with the lecturer and discuss the course.",
                "This course did a good job introducing us to new areas of bio. However, often there would be to much detail that was difficult to orient around as the basic foundations were rarely discussed.",
                "Peer tutoring hours need to be added during the week; having the peer tutoring hours on the weekend encourages procrastination on the pset and therefore floods the tutoring hours with only pset questions. There was never time to ask quesitons about content. Additionally, BIOL 102 needs some sort of textbook structure, whether that just be some assigned readings or articles. Often times I felt that this course was taught for people with a high level of biology background.",
                "The class covered a lot of content and I learned about a lot of experimental techniques. I think that the level of detail about the experimental techniques and other concepts in general that we covered was sometimes a bit too much for an intro course. Maybe requiring an intro biology lab to accompany the course would be beneficial to truly help students understand how those experiments work since the exams went in-depth and required a deep understanding of the techniques and how to interpret their results.",
                "One strength of this course is that connections are drawn between related concepts in different units, such that a greater understanding can be built. At some points the pace was very quick so all the information could be fit into the semester, but it was helpful having the lecture videos so I could review information I didn't understand.",
                "The course was organized terrible.",
                "A weakness of this course is the lecture style. The material is presented in a very uninteresting manner. A strength of this course are the discussion sections. They are very useful and helpful for understanding of the material and the week's paper.",
                "The powerpoint slides used in class were often edited right up until the start of our class. If they were ready for us a little before, personally, it would've been helpful to look through them before the start of class.",
                "The strengths of this course is the progression of topics from microscopy to cell signaling pathways. The topics build upon each other well. A weakness of this course is a lack of basic cell biology at the beginning of the course. Also it would be helpful to more explicitly connect the topics by laying them out in connection to each other at the beginning of the course. The discussion sections could also be improved to cover the content described in class in addition to the academic papers. This would allow students to clarify the topics covered in class. While peer tutoring is a strength of the class, I think it would also be helpful if TAs offered office hours.",
                "It felt a bit rushed but overall felt I learned a lot and enjoyed the content.",
                "Perhaps structuring lecture slides into more digestible material; I know this isnt easy as there is a lot of material to cover, but maybe providing resources (textbook, website, visuals, etc) that are helpful for absorbing material in an effective manner",
                "I think these class needs some more structure that connects the relevance of each unit to the theme of Bio 102.",
                "Strength: very accessible to students who didn't have a good biology background in high school. Office hours were extremely helpful and offered at good times. If something wasn't covered in lecture. you weren't expected to learn it on your own outside of lecture, which I have seen in other STEM courses.\r\nWeakness: Lecture slides were a bit confusing because the topics seemed to jump around too much",
                "Bad lectures",
                "At times, the course seemed disorganized as deadlines were frequently changed and lecture content was often cut out. I also think that the course would benefit from a more cohesive theme rather than being a variety of selective topics in cell biology. Both professors are very knowledgeable about course content and both are excellent instructors.",
                "Strengths were the recorded lectures, as it allowed us to go back and review content well. Another strength was that there was a lot of understanding when it came to deadlines. Weaknesses were ambiguity with the midterm and final, as even during the final changes were being made to the questions while we were taking it.",
                "The strengths are the type of content it covers. The weaknesses are the lack of organisation of this content.",
                "I think that one of the strengths of this course is that it is very experimental in nature, which is great when it comes to having to apply your knowledge to new scenarios and design an experiment to address a new scenario. I think that one of the weaknesses of this course is that it can be challenging to learn all these experimental techniques in a lecture setting. It would be great if the course included some hands-on work with these experimental techniques, but I think that the only feasible way to do that with so many students taking the course would be to have a lab that goes along with the course like the introductory chemistry courses.",
                "The material makes sense and is well taught, but I felt like the stuff I was learning was not helpful to what I want to do or learn about and it made me question why it is mandatory to take cell biology in order to take BIOL 103-104.",
                "Professor Hartman is a great lecturer and I especially appreciated how open she was to suggestions from students throughout the course although I do wish the exams were out of more points so that more partial credit could be awarded and each deduction on, for example, a multiple choice question, would factor less into the grades on exams.",
                "Fix method of lecture so that it isnt just reading off of a slide and information can be absorbed better",
                "Professor was reading off the slides and was not really engaging in material. This is probably because there is a lot of content. It can be improved by providing slides and resources/videos ahead of the lecture in order to prepare. Everything was last minute.",
                "A strength is that the slides are in depth and the papers we analyze in discussion sections help immensely in our understanding of the material. The course is extremely unorganized. We had to take the midterm and final without many of our assignments returned so there was no way to study the most recent material because we had no clue what we did well on and what we needed to review again.",
                "A strength is that Prof. Harrington and Prof. Hartman were always there to help: class resources were posted on time and questions on Ed Discussion were addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nI believe that a big weakness is the lack of hands-on learning. It is tough to learn about microscopy without physically experimenting and tinkering with one, especially for a student like me who never got to use a microscope because my Biology class in high school was impacted by the pandemic. Thus, learning about techniques became a matter of memorizing and not really knowing the core basics of how they work and operate.",
                "Professor Hartman is a great professor, although she can be a little confusing at times watching the lectures online makes it very very easy to follow and understand. The teaching staff is truly dedicated to making the class a good learning experience. Having collaborative quizzes and psets was also very helpful to elevate my understanding of the content. I think the main improvement is having more structure in the lectures, they can be hard to follow at times, making coming to lecture feel like a waste of time when I have to watch the recordings again anyways.",
                "The content can be dense at times, so it is difficult sometimes to keep up. The course is good at making sure students have the resources they need to succeed.",
                "There was so much course material it was difficult to discern what was important vs what was trivial detail",
                "The courses pace was a little shaky and inconsistent at times, but mostly because it was being taught for the first time under a new style and lecturer, so things like this are to be expected. I think a big strength of this course was the discussion sections that really solidified the material learned prior: however, I think that the nature of the scheduling means that discussion sections help different amounts depending on how close it is to the lectures placement (i.e. if a discussion section is on the Monday, it may have a different function and efficacy compared to those set on Thursday).",
                "I appreciated that this course did not try to discourage students with grading and I felt that the grading was very fair. I thought the instructors were very encouraging.",
                "The timings of the lectures could be improved (there were often slides that we had to skip because we ran out of time). The peer tutoring hours were very helpful, along with Enrichment sessions.",
                "Weaknesses were that PSETs were very difficult and stressful to do.",
                "The strengths of this course were the teachers and how much care they showed about our grades. They made it clear that this class was not meant to just scare people away and focused on teaching us rather than looking to take points away. No weaknesses.",
                "The course is well taught; however, the mateiral was too rushed in the beginning. Also virtually no office hours.",
                "An asynchronous course, like the first Bio class, seemed to work better for the group.",
                "Its just a little difficult to transition from 101 to 102 in the middle of the semester because you start becoming used to your schedule for 101 and then it suddenly shifts and you have to plan around it. I think there is a lot of strength to the course though because a lot of support is provided in order to promote student growth such as enrichment and access to many TFs.",
                "My strengths were studying and relearning the information for this course. My weaknesses were definitely not understanding the lecture and having to reteach myself everything after each lecture.",
                "The slides were very well done. However, I feel like the general pacing could've been improved. I also know that since it was Professor Hartman's first time teaching this course, there would be inevitable difficulties",
                "Strengths: Flexible, thoughtful professor; interesting course content\r\nWeaknesses: Felt like a lot of rote memorization, and the depth to which we needed to understand that information for exams was unclear. Study resources, especially for the final, were limitedwe were given a set of lecture slides to memorize, and it was unclear how to synthesize that content for questions that tested cumulative knowledge. Discussion sections also didn't feel particularly helpful to understand content; the \"journal clubs\" didn't particularly improve my understanding of the systems taught. Quizzes also felt redundantly long sometimes and tested ability to look through slides rather than understand content.",
                "The strengths were the lecture recordings and the office hours offered before psets were de. It could be improved if notes to the discussion section and key points from the papers were posted and if more office hours were held throughout the week.",
                "The strength of this course was that I was able to learn a lot of material in a short period of time.\r\nThe weakness of this course was that sometimes the pacing of the lectures were a bit off; on important points it was a little too quick while on more straightforward ideas it took a little too long",
                "Strengths: great professors\r\n- good office hours\r\n- engaging\r\n- support through enrichment\r\n\r\nWeakness: you have to apply for enrichment. I think anyone should be able to go to enrichment"

                "I think so because its necessary for a bunch of science major pre-reqs. However, if someone does not need it for their major, I would not recommend the course as it is more busy work than engaging material.",
                "Yes, this course is a great introduction into the core foundations of cell biology, which are intrinsic to anyone looking for biology-related work.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you absolutely have to take it. It is not a course that is easy or a gut by any means.",
                "Take this course if you want a sci credit that isn't hard but still very interesting (or you're a stem student and have to)",
                "Only if you need it. It requires a lot of work and intellectual energy. It is not nearly as terrible as what other kids might make it seem. I haven't taken bio for five years and never took AP bio and did really well in the course.",
                "yes and no? definitely helps you with learning and applying experimental design, which i personally found to be the most fun (and challenging) aspect. on the other hand, i dont think this course overviewed cell biology as holistically as i wouldve thought  we didnt talk about cellular respiration, for instance, but we did go into nauseating detail about how the signal polypeptide is cleaved co-translationally.",
                "yes, good but lots of content. would take only if required",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they plan on pursuing something related to biology in the future. Much of the knowledge you learn is applicable to future classes. However, I will say that the information you learn can be a bit boring at times.",
                "I would recommend this course because it provides the basic foundation of cell biology for future biological sciences courses.",
                "only if a major requirement",
                "I think that almost everyone who was taking this course was only there because it was a prerequisite, but nonetheless I found the content decently engaging.",
                "I would recommend it if it's required for your major or if you're interested. It's definitely too much work if you just need the science credit but if it's related to your field I would recommend it. There's a lot of support systems built in and the content is pretty interesting.",
                "Yes",
                "If for a requirement then you gotta do what you gotta do! Otherwise, I would not recommend this class. I think Bio 101 is a good class to give somebody insight into biology but Bio 102 gets much more complicated and is less applicable to everyday life, so only take it if you need it for your major.",
                "Yes, but only if they were trying to learn more about biology. This isn't a \"for fun\" class and isn't meant for people who aren't seriously taking it.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who needs the class as a prerequisite and is ready to put in the hours of studying and completing quizzes and PSETs that this class requires.",
                "Yes, gives a good understanding for later bio stuff",
                "If they need it for their major then they of course have to take it.",
                "Sure. The class sometimes has a reputation for being really bad, but it was honestly okay. People who take this course typically must because of major or pre-med requirements, and there usually isnt an alternative anyway. The topics get covered in lectures pretty quickly, but the quizzes, psets, and discussion sections provide a lot of opportunities for review. I wouldnt be afraid of this class or dread it too much, and Professor Hartman is good at adjusting the homework to where the class is at content-wise.",
                "Yes if it's a requirement or they're willing to put the work in to learn cell biology",
                "I would recommend it required of major",
                "I would only recommend it if it's required for their major.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is trying to decide whether they are truly interested in biology or not. If you enjoy this course and all the work that goes into it, then you definitely enjoy biology and possibly a career with it.",
                "Yes, because it's a pre-requisite for a bunch of majors. Don't take this class just for fun.",
                "Absolutely - necessary for many majors and tracks.",
                "I would if you are pre-med. If not, I would not take the class.",
                "Better than bio 101. Would not recommend to anyone who doesnt need this class, unless you are genuinely interested, in which case take it cr/d/f.",
                "No. Personally, the concepts were ill explained and there was little to no extra resources provided to help understand the topics. I felt that this course was extremely difficult and it felt as though prior biology experience was needed as every topic felt like we were just reviewing it instead of learning it.",
                "Yes, the material isn t super complicated, though the class is fast paced. And the grading is supposed to be generous if you put in the work.",
                "Only if they are interested in biology or if it is required. Otherwise, it is a big time commitment and challenging if it is not a requisite for your major.",
                "Yes, its likely a requirement but still an interesting and important course",
                "Yes. Even if a student is not taking the class for a science major prerequisite, fundamental biology is one of the best courses to take as a science credit. Even though the course is very challenging, most of what we learned are the very basics of our human biological systems and the background knowledge necessary to engage with current science in mass media and scientific journals.",
                "I would. The course is a prerequisite for a lot of majors, but I definitely think its one that you would enjoy. The professor, Dr. Hartman, and course coordinator, Dr. Harrington, are both very approachable and considerate. There are also a lot of resources like peer tutoring and enrichment. I often attended peer tutoring and the tutors were great.",
                "Yes, engaging and i learned a lot of material!",
                "Yes. It's pretty neat how much you learn about cell biology in a few short weeks, although I strongly recommend attending Enrichment and peer tutor office hours to review material from lecture.",
                "If they absolutely need this course for a major, then yes. But otherwise, I would not recommend this course.",
                "Yes. The course contains many difficult concepts, but I do feel my overall understanding of cells has greatly improved. Much of the content is fascinating and engaging. The class was interesting and the exams were fair.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in learning about complex cell biology, however, if a student merely wishes to learn about the topic as a whole this is not the class for them.",
                "Yes but only because it was required. The content itself was not too hard, but due to the bad organisation, wiriting PSETS and studying for exams was frenzic because so much time was spent deciphering the slides",
                "Yes",
                "No. I found it very hard to understand the content that was taught. The lectures felt like a waste of time because I ended up having to relearn everything on my own.",

                "Only if they have to take it",
                "No.",
                "Yes, this is a good course to get a foundation in biology.",
                "Yes. Interesting course and relevant to modern day and everyday life.",
                "No",
                "Yes. It provides a good foundation.",
                "I would not recommend this course to anyone that does not have a strong AP biology background. Additionally, because this course focuses mainly on the experimental techniques, it is often abstract and difficult to understand if you have no wet lab experience.",
                "Yes because it taught me a lot of concepts or details that I had never even heard of in my high school biology courses.",
                "I would recommend this course because it goes beyond facts and encourages us to understand different biology methods, so we can plan our own experiments.",
                "I cant say that I enjoyed this course, but since its a part of the bio sequence, I would recommend.",
                "No. It's a pretty boring course. If you need it for the major or for pre med, then you should take it.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in developing a foundation of cell biology. While the course is challenging, it effectively provides students with a strong background of cell biology.",
                "Yes, this course does a good job at teaching fundamental concepts of cell biology.",
                "Yes; especially if they have in interest in the biological sciences. This course covers a breadth of material and knowledge that is truly beyond something you can find in a classroom; it extends to lab-based and real life scenarios that people encounter and work with in their daily lifes work.",
                "Yes",
                "YES! Don't shy away from trying out a STEM major because the classes are intimidating -- you can always ask for and receive extra help!",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, a variety of niche topics in cell biology are explored.",
                "I would recommend it if a prerequisite.",
                "If they really enjoy biology and are willing to put in the work, then yes. However not if they are just looking to take a science course for fun.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student but I would warn them that this course is more difficult than BIOL 101 and that at times BIOL 102 can be quite challenging in a lecture setting. The course moves at a pretty fast pace and the material presented is fairly advanced. I would advise students that if they want to do well in this course they are really going to have to make an effort to go back and re-watch the lectures to make sure that they understand everything because in all likelihood you are not going to understand everything the first time.",
                "I would tell them it's not as hard as people say it is, it's very doable if you keep up with the work and go to office hours, and that if you have to take it then take it.",
                "Yes, although I think most people just take it because they're premed or plan to become biology majors.",
                "Yes, it is very relevant to wet lab work and will help you understand how the field of biology is studied in labs.",
                "Yes, if you have to take it but the content itself was pretty interesting.",
                "It was alright. If you have to take it for your major, it's manageable but it's frustrating how unorganized it is. If you go into it expecting that then it will be a better experience.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student ONLY if they are interested in the sciences. There are lots to remember, and the student must be able to pull all of what theyve learned in Biology to fully get the most out of this class.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students interested in learning more about biology. For people who aren't sure if they are interested in the content, it may not be the best fit, as the course can be hard to follow without interest in understanding the material. The assignments aren't terribly difficult, and the exams are fair.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course because it teaches important fundamental biology topics.",
                "I would definitely recommend this to students curious about biology or chemistry. It has a wide range of things covered while also going very deep into them and I think that this would make for an engaging atmosphere. The synchronous classes are nice and make sure that everyone is given the opportunity to review the material at least once.",
                "I would recommend this course because it sets up a good background on biology that is necessary for future courses. However, it was not the most intellectually fascinating or engaging course I have ever taken. That may just be a product of the giant lecture format.",
                "You learn a lot during this course and this course is a prerequisite for a lot of majors, however, it was much more difficult than I expected.",
                "I would recommend this course. All of the teachers and assistants are great and they material is presented to you in a way where you are in control of your own learning.",
                "Yes, it is a good course to take to fulfill a science distributional requirement.",
                "Yes, only because it is required to go into most STEM fields. Other than that, not really just because it was not as engaging and enjoyable.",
                "I think the Biol sequence is great for any student to take part in, and so if youre in the sciences I would thus recommend this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in biology, not only because they have to take it, but because of the valuable papers that you read and skills you gain for future reference.",
                "If you're premed or an MCDB/MBB major, this course is mandatory, and as far as prerequisites go, it teaches interesting content with an understanding and engaging professor.",
                "Yes. This course was overall well organized and set up and I learned about the cell in biology in a short amount of time.",
                "I would recommend it to anyone with a general interest in biology because I do believe it provides a good foundational overview to the biological sciences.",
                "Yes, and not just for pre med students. Being able to talk to other biology students about such complex topics such as dynamic instability is so rewarding."
