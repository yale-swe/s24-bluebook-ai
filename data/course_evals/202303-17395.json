                "I learned about some overarching topics (Justice Theory, Civil Contract) and schools of thought (utilitarianism, Kantian ethics, etc.) in ethics and how they apply to environmental problems.",
                "I gained a broad overview of the basis of various environmental ethics standpoints, a brief history of basic philosophy that supports them, and an understanding of arguments framing the environmental ethics debates today. Lots of relevance to some current technologies, but some discussion of topics which did not seem pertinent today.",
                "Learned about some ethical questions on animal rights, wilderness preservation, obligations to future generations, climate change, and bioengineering. Learned how to structure what I learned in class to write a good response on tests",
                "Through this class I gained a basic foundation in Western ethical philosophies and how they apply to environmental issues such as hunting, geo engineering, bioengineering, and climate change. I also learned how to read and write basic moral arguments.",
                "I developed a great sense of questions of morality in environmental spheres, as well as an overall understanding of how ethical/moral theories apply to these situations. I became much more comfortable entering conversations of environmental justice.",
                "A greater understanding of philosophical frameworks to use in tackling complex issues. A deeper understanding of the complexities of environmental issues which we face now and we will face in the future. Learning this content from this perspective was very interesting and refreshing.",
                "I learned philosophical concepts and how to apply them to environmental issues of land management, animal rights, climate change, and env justice. I will take these insights with me going forward, very applicable information as an EVST major.",
                "This course primarily equipped me with the philosophical arguments to defend certain views of environmental ethics. I would say I got more arguments than concrete answers out of this course, but that seems to have been Professor Latham's intention.",
                "I learned a lot in this course. It definitely changed the way I look at many things in my daily life.",
                "I learned a lot about a broad variety of ethical frameworks used to discuss environmental issues and gained a good understanding of influential philosophers in this field."

            "comments": [
                "strengths: Interesting and applicable readings, interesting lectures from a knowledgeable professor, exams were reflective of class material\r\n\r\nweaknesses: Direct feedback from the professor would have been valuable.",
                "The lessons are engaging and the readings are interesting, but the professor struggles to address topics outside of his personal experiences (native issues, feminism, socio-economic struggles). It is great that he is conscious of his privilege in these realms, and thus does not want to overstep in his explanations,  but I think he could benefit from guest lecturers to help explain these topics.",
                "The course as a lecture is tricky. Latham is a great lecturer and it is worth trying to pay attention to him as much as possible, but the large nature of the class makes engagement difficult when he asks for comments on any ideas he proposes. I think as a smaller, more engagement-focused class, this might be a stronger course. The depth of the content is great, though some of the readings selections for various topics are a little strange and narrow.",
                "I really like the style of teaching because Latham just lectures the whole class without any slides. I really liked the way he taught after taking his bioethics class which made me want to take this class. Very glad i did.",
                "One strength of this course is that it provides a lot of room for student questions and discussion, and the ethical questions explored are very relevant to real life issues that students can take action on.",
                "There could be more concrete assignments/discussion per class meeting, as it could feel difficult to grasp everything that was going on at times. There could also be more lecture notes/material provided for more accessible learning.",
                "Strengths were a professor who was engaging and who complex topics in a way that everyone could understand.",
                "Strengths: great readings; interesting, relevant information was taught; good balance between different environmental topics\r\nWeaknesses: the only weakness was the lectures. some of them were really engaging, in others it felt like Prof. Latham ran out of things to say. I like that he does not use slides, but a little more organization would be very helpful. For example, a brief list of key takeaways for each class or week would be  ground the course.",
                "Strengths: Interesting, approachable material and relevant course topics. I loved learning about bioengineering and surveying arguments for/against moral vegetarianism. This course basically walks through about 10 controversial topics in environmental ethics, and Professor Latham discusses how we may go about arguing for/against them. The exams tested our ability to form these arguments and use course material to back up our views.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I will say that this course is only engaging if you're committed to learning and appreciating all of the material. The course grade consists of only 3 exam grades, despite mandatory section. Lecture is not required. That being the case, it's easy to take this class and not attend lecture or fall behind on the readings because there is very little accountability. To prevent this affecting class engagement, I would recommend including lecture slides (to make the material a bit more concrete) and - don't hate me - implementing strategies to increase lecture attendance, e.g., attendance forms, etc.",
                "I wish there were slides to follow along to during lectures.",
                "It was a fascinating course and the discussion-style lectures helped me to stay engaged, I also liked the breadth. The in-class essay exams were helpful for reinforcing my understanding of the material but I would have liked a little more guidance on how to write a philosophical paper. I also think the lack of slides was tough sometimes as I am a visual learner so staying focused was a challenge at times."

It will expand your imagination and ideas around how we might be able to (or not) tackle sensitive issues about the environment.",

                "Yes!! Environmental issues are important regardless of your major, and Prof. Latham makes this class accessible to anyone regardless of their experience. That being said, I found it helpful to have some philosophical background coming into the course. It was satisfying to learn how to ground my intuitive attitude toward environmental issues in ethics and philosophy. The readings are interesting, relevant, and not very difficult. Exams are straightforward if you know the material.",

                "Yes, I think I felt I left the class with a stronger understanding of environmental ethics issues, and I feel like it is a good class to take as an environmental studies student to enhance your learning.",
