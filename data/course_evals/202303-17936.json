Learned how to more critically read empirical papers and especially how to interpret the figures.\r\n\r\nThe final paper was a 20 page literature review and I learned a LOT about how to research / write etc from that as well as extensive practice with reading papers during the semester.",

                "Course was well organized and I appreciate that the whole syllabus (all readings and assignments) were posted early.\r\nThe seminar format was fine but not as. much discussion from students as I had hoped. Mostly Prof Chang would describe the papers, students take notes, and occasionally interpret figures or answer questions. I would have appreciated more discussion, maybe in small groups.\r\nI also did not love the animal literature in general, would have appreciated at least one human paper per week to compare with animal models.\r\n\r\nI am not sure why the final paper is 20 pages for all students including those who are not writing their thesis for the class. Seems like a final paper could be 10-15 and accomplish similar goals without being long for no real reason.",
                "The paper and subjects are interesting, but class discussion often fell short of what could havebeen interesting. The class operates like a journal club and it seemed most of us were not reading or not willing to talk about the papers. I am unsure of ways to make it more engaging.",
                "Strengths: I enjoyed reading different papers every week and discussing them because this is something I wanted more experience with.\r\nWeaknesses: It was the same routine every week and less opportunities to talk about anything besides the readings.",
                "Strengths: The open, discussion format allows you to easily bring up questions or topics related to the papers for the week.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish there was more emphasis on neuroscience techniques in general. The focus was primarily on the figures of the paper, and more background would have been good.",
                "Great",
                "I think 2 papers a week is much more reasonable than 3, because ultimately most students ended up reading only one or two of the three every week for the writeup and course participation."

                "Was a great senior seminar and built nicely on previous Psych credits. Not worth taking as a junior, the most important skills learned were practice reading papers and how to interpret them. Would probably be a good course for Psych BA senior essay.",
