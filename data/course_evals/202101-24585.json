From class discussions and guest speakers, I learned about the music industry and where I might fit in if I were to pursue it as a career. Lastly, I learned how to co-write and work with my peers on music. It felt like a real window into the industry.",

                "I think the most valuable part of the course was sharing and critiquing each others work, but the readings and external materials could have been incorporated more if the class were to align exactly with its description. However, I think a lot of the readings stand alone well and the class was extremely informative on its own.",
                "Incredible prof.",
                "Mike has an electric personality and consistently engages with students in a matter that is both casual but informative",
                "The strength has to be the people. Professor Errico assembled the most impressive group of musical students at Yale. It was amazing to work with and constantly be surrounded by such talented peers, who definitely inspired and pushed me to complete my best work. Prof. Errico also brought in great guest speakers who offered expertise in many different parts of the industry.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this class was probably its size. Because there is so much great work to discuss and listen to, the class doesn't always workshop your song each week. If you really want to be featured, you can make it happen, but otherwise, for people like me who were a little less confident, you won't necessarily get too much-individualized attention.",
                "good course, i think enrollment could be more selective so that the average music quality is higher and each student gets a little more focus.",
                "The class was truly phenomenal all around. In the beginning of the semester we were visited by several guests who are in the songwriting/entertainment industry who has some very valuable experiences and insights to share. The one downside was that there was less time for us to listen to each other's songs and give each other feedback, but we did have more time for this later in the semester!",
                "One major strength of this course is Professor Errico himselfhe's so generous with his time, and is incredibly supportive of his students. His feedback was attentive, generative, and kind, and I appreciate that while this class may be geared toward a particular kind of songwriter, he was willing to encourage and make space for differing approaches to writing, artistry, and sound. \r\n\r\nAnother major strength of this course is the resources and connections it provides. Professor Errico brought in a number of speakers who were both wise and willing to be of help in the future, and always encouraged us to reach out to them (and to him) for guidance. This kind of connection means a lot in an industry that can feel really tough to crack, and I'll certainly be keeping those resources in mind. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I sometimes felt that class time could be more intentionally structured / organized.",

But if you aren't willing to be creation-oriented, maybe look elsewhereit's a lot of creating to do on an academic timeline, which can be difficult!"
