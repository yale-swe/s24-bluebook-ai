As both an HSHM and a CLCV course, it's a great example of interdisciplinary education because it ties STEM concepts and humanities, bridging medicine and disease to their social contexts and implications.",

The highlight of the class was our final presentation, where we did our own research on ancient medical cultures. This is when I realized that weve gained skills to study ancient materials.",
                "I learned about what medicine was like in ancient times such as Rome, Egypt, Greece, and more. I also learned to evaluate ancient medicine from a more sociological lens than I had originally expected. For example, looking at the role of gender in the case of the wandering womb."

Often many points were taken off for small mistakes on writing assignments, presentations, or exams (particularly losing points for grammar on a timed in-class essay).",
                "This course was great at encouraging direct engagement with the material and involving Yale's vast resources to further those conversations. That being said, more could have been done to engage with the material we were reading about rather than just reading and discussing, such as hands on practicals.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is how in-depth and immersive it is, especially regarding Hippocratic Medicine. It would benefit from more instruction on the writing assignments, and from more exploration into the social contexts of the time outside of medicine.",
                "strengths: interesting readings for the most part, engaging professor \r\nweaknesses: long-winded class sessions, most classes I felt like there was not much to talk about, boring readings sometimes,",
                "Very reading heavy, grading was all left to TF who was very unhelpful at times",
                "It was a super fun classProf. Lamont and Chris are amazing teachers, and the materials were interesting. It would have been better as a lecture course, though, since we had little in-class discussion. It was mostly prof. Lamont who talked (analyzed texts).",
                "The course provided a very insightful survey on ancient medicine and was especially adept at highlighting voices of individuals and groups who have been historically marginalized. The discussions could have benefitted from a bit more focus and direction (perhaps with direct questions, or assignments to supplement the readings in advance of class) in order to motivate increased levels of student engagement in the seminar. Overall, though, I got a clear and comprehensive view of the medicinal procedures, advancements, and ideas that characterized the ancient world.",

For humanities majors, the course offers a glimpse into how the humanities and sciences overlap and revolve around each other.",
