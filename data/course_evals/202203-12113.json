I mean it wasn't until this class that I actually took the time to really learn about sedimentary rocks and the carbon cycle. So many concepts learned that stick with me such as the trade winds, the coriolus effect, and plate tectonics.",
                "developed physics knowledge, natural disasters, gave a great overview of how the Earth works",

                "I loved the course and it was perfect in every way. The instructor was the highlight of the course, she truly explains concepts well and cares for the students. The workload is not very stressful, and there were plenty of ways to get help.",
                "Honestly this class was just an \"A\" like a 94\/100. Good organization, challenging, good breath and depth of knowledge. I do feel like this class is missing a bit of a \"wow\" factor that could come from a little more emphasis on the far reaching impacts of these disasters\/disaster relief considering this class is mostly taken by non stem majors. Still it was very doable.",
                "I loved this course. I wouldn't change anything.",
                "Very informative. Lots of physics in the homework but the mid-terms are solely based on the concepts of each natural disaster. A perfect combination.",
                "strengths: in depth lectures were extremely helpful; difficult content presented in digestible way \r\n\r\nweakness: the psets didn't really align with what we learned in class and made it difficult to complete if you didn't go to office hours (which isn't great for students with really busy schedules)",
                "This course was extremely engaging. The professors and the TFs were very good at explaining concepts and were all willing to take the extra time to facilitate student learning.",
                "The class was fantastic. I enjoyed the lecture style with the optional office hours with teaching assistants throughout the week. I liked how tests were conceptual while psets were quantitative reasoning, allowing us to practice two different sets of skills and really understand the amount of energy behind something of dangerous matter.",
                "I really liked how everything was broken up into units and that Maureen gave us key concepts to know. The homework assignments were helpful for our learning and they weren't impossible or anything. I did need to go to office hours every week to understand the quantitative questions, though. The physics stuff we learned wasn't impossible to grasp though.",
                "Very strong course: interesting subject, great lecturer, enjoyable to be a part of as a whole.",
                "Strengths: very doable weekly workload, sections are not mandated (which is wonderful) but were extremely helpful during weeks I needed to attend! Midterms aren't math heavy but instead focus on concepts (which was great for me since solving math with a shot clock tends to be a little stressful). There was math on the PSETS but wasn't beyond what was reasonable.",
                "The professor is very engaging and passionate about the things she teaches. You take this class for Prof Long. The problem sets are a lot tougher than they have a right to be.",
                "Excellent professor. I think it would be better to have 2 large exams instead of 2 midterms and a final.",
                "Professor is amazing, and the content is super interesting. The psets were pretty difficult because they were math\/physics based but the midterms and final were all concept based which was very nice.",
                "A strength is how Professor Long emphasizes the key points of each lecture which allows me to stay focused on what is important.",
                "Strengths: easy to comprehend, lots of material learned, and skills in QR were also gained\r\nWeaknesses: quantitative problem sets could often feel slightly disjointed from understanding the conceptual material",
                "Strengths: Prof. Long is incredible. She cares so deeply about every student and she genuinely seems to love teaching this material, even though it's such an introductory level class. I honestly wouldn't have stayed with this course if she wasn't teaching it. \r\nWeaknesses: not sure if this is a weakness, but it's a lot of content! Lots of memorization, slides, and workmore than you might anticipate from a course targeted towards non-STEM majors.",
                "This course was extremely strong and informative. The lectures were engaging and interesting. The sections and TAs were very helpful as well. My one critique is that I wish the grades were returned slightly quicker, so I could apply the feedback received to the next problem sets."

Through this course, the student would learn a lot more about the Earth and the causes of natural disasters. It is not a very stressful course and would fit into any schedule.",
                "This class is slept on by geo majors trying to fulfill their intro geo credits. Most people go for dynamic earth because of the lab, but honestly this class is also a great introduction although you miss some key information on mineral and rock types. If you aren't a geo major I would say that if you feel like you remember how to excel in a high school science class, then you will here too. Long wants you to succeed.\r\n.",
                "Yes! It is not a gut, but the workload is super manageable, and the content is so interesting.",

                "Absolutely! It's just a fun course. And these subjects are so pertinent to today's conversation about anthropogenic climate change.",
                "As a non-STEM major, 100% recommend this course, was very easy to follow and the concepts were interesting. Weekly problem sets can sometimes be a challenge but reach out to TFs and the prof with questions and you will definitely do well in the course.",
                "I would. It gives a good introduction to how the Earth functions, climate change and other important parts of the Earth. I learned a lot.",

                "Yes. Anyone interested in the science behind earths processes should definitely take this course because it is informative and engaging.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone and everyone without hesitation. It is evident Professor Long cares about both her students and work, and this passion was present every step of the way during this course. She did in-depth lectures that help me visualize concepts that had been explained scientifically in earlier lectures. There were TA office hours and in class walkthroughs of problems. Professor Long provided uploaded her slides and lectures and set up the course to be flexible with dropped PSETS in case there were weeks students were feeling overwhelmed. She made me want to care about what she was teaching. As a person who isn't in the sciences, I found this course both accessible and engaging. \"Easy\" isn't the word I would assign to the class, and neither is \"hard. Rather, the course was reasonable and sensibly taught. If you need a science credit, take this class! If you want to learn some really cool content about the science that underpins our world, take this class! If you want to learn from a funny and brilliant professor, take this class!",
                "Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed the topics as someone with no previous inclination toward EPS.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone familiar with physics. In the first week of class, Professor Long mentioned that we would be \"learning a little bit of physics,\" which sounded manageable, but the PSETs were actually slightly challenging, and I think the students who already were familiar with the content definitely had a very strong advantage. This class is not a gut, the PSETs are graded strictly and a large amount of content requires memorization before each midterm.",
                "Yes! Great way to get a science credit for non-stem people. Maureen is fantastic and the topics are very interesting!",
                "Yes, it is important or interesting for us to know how the world we live in works and how to avoid or be smart in natural dangers.",
                "Highly recommend: the class was highly interesting, low stress, and filled with lots of material to learn",
                "Yes, but only if you know what the workload is like going in. Obviously, it's not a very high workload relative to classes you might take in your major; but it's a high workload for a class that you're taking to fulfill the science distributional requirement, especially when there are so many other classes that require significantly less time. Otherwise, Prof. Long is great, the content is actually pretty relevant and interesting, and, even though the psets were sometimes tedious, they were also quite cool as they would let you solve seemingly complex problems using elementary physics\/algebra. Also the in-depth lectures that Prof. Long would do were super educational!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I learned so much valuable information and had a really good time in the class.",
                "yes, not exactly a gut because you do have to be relatively committed to do well but it's a really interesting science course that isn't too difficult at all. all the assignments are interesting and relevant and Prof. Long is a great teacher who knows so much about this topic."
