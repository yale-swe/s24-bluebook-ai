                "In this course we discussed justice in both the process and the outcome of the justice system. We engaged in high stakes arguments about policing, punishment, and the death penalty. We learned to argue in a legal fashion both in written form and spoken form.",
                "This course was a timely introduction to what the criminal legal system really looks like. Karen's experience in the field representing all parts of criminal proceedings makes her extremely knowledgeable and eager to supplement course readings and discussions with personal anecdotes. We focused substantially on discussions regarding the death penalty, but also touched on interesting issues like jury selection, processional discretion, unreasonable search and seizure and privacy doctrine. the ethics side of things was mostly just personal opinion, we didn't study formal ethical theories but instead discussed our normative perspectives on the cases at hand.",
                "I learned how to read cases in this course, which is not something I have got to do with other courses and loved. I learned about all the different ways the justice system is riddled with bias, and was able to discuss this thoroughly with my peers.",
                "As someone who knew very little about the law before this class, I learned a broad background of how the constitution is interpreted, how court cases work and are decided, and some in-depth discussion of certain issues related to the constitution.",
                "I learned how to engage with various types of legal writing, as well as how to combine legal and ethical analyses.",
                "The course covered a wide variety of topics regarding ethics and the law, including concepts like the death penalty, due process, and policing.",

                "not many weaknesses, though the reading load was quite heavy. Karen's relaxed approach to teaching and learning is definitely a strength, she makes everyone feel comfortable and welcome voicing their opinions  (even unpopular ones) and genuinely cares about what we think.",
                "I loved this course. Strengths are definitely the course material and the way we would discuss it in class. No weaknesses.",
                "This seminar is a very low-stakes environment and the discussion is always engaging -- it is very fun to hear about Karen's various experiences with the legal issues we discuss! To be clear, this class is NOT a rigorous philosophical class -- in this class, the phrase \"ethics\" means \"do we like a given outcome or practice.\" We do not apply the standard ethical frameworks to legal issues in a methodical way.",
                "I loved everything about this class. If there's one thing I would add it is maybe fewer readings, so that everybody is more engaged with the material, vs. some people having read more than others.",
                "Karen is a gem. She is so engaged and is clearly happy to be in class and discuss these topics with students. The topics themselves were also timely and she did a great job adjusting the syllabus to allow us to talk about current events (police reform, etc) in meaningful ways. There are no weaknesses to the course.",
                "Karen is this course's greatest asset. The reading and course material is really interesting in its own right, but Karen's experience and perspective as a legal practitioner and high court judge is beyond compare. Class is always fun and engaging and the assignments are manageable, worthwhile, and often open-ended enough for you to write about what interests you in particular about a certain issue."

Karen is a kind and engaging professor who makes the seminar feel like a fun after-dinner conversation rather than a college class. I would especially recommend this class to someone who hasn't had much experience talking about the law before -- it is a very accessible introduction. But be warned that the level of academic rigor around the \"ethics\" component is not high -- for the sake of this class, \"ethics\" means \"do we like a given practice or outcome,\" and there is no discussion of the typical frameworks of ethical theory.",

                "Yes! If you're interested in the law at all, take this class. Karen is an amazing professor and your time at Yale is wasted without taking one of her classes!"
