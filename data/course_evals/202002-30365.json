   "comments": [
    "Weakness: sometimes the work was extensive\r\nStrenghts: Well structured, a lot of feedback, the professor is always willing to help and explain  things, focuses on cultural understanding, develops both speaking and writing",
    "Strengths \r\n- Truly helps hone speaking and writing skills\r\n- Covers a diverse selection of German-speaking cultures (Eg. Austria, Switzerland)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- Some of the homework feels more like busy work that actual teaching material\r\n- The course structure becomes somewhat monotonous",
    "It was a bit experimental of course, since it was an unexpected format, but the course really engaged the students nonetheless. Talk Abroad really helped with conversational practice; I began to feel like I was really becoming used to the language rather than just studying it. I also enjoyed that the course taught a bit about the cultures and nuances of German speaking countries, rather than just the language itself. The use of enticing media (i.e Babylon Berlin) as listening and comprehension practice further made the student feel interested and involved beyond just study, which in turn improved listening. The Quia assignments in this course seemed much better than in GMAN 130 as well."

    "Yes, definitely to anybody interested in learning German. Do take into consideration the time you would need to allocate, though.",
    "Sure, if you want to improve your German speaking and writing skills, or if you want to take higher level German classes.",
    "Yes if you want to improve your German",
    "Yes! It is a great course if one wants to continue after the three required courses to increase fluency. It continues to review difficult areas of the language, while still introducing plenty of new material.",
    "Yes, Frau Sippel is, just like Frau Schenker, an amazing teacher, and I learned a great deal from her."
