Lacks structure in how your ultimate grade in the class is determined by her interpretation of your grasp on the language rather than following the exact rubric of each categories' weights in the syllabus that she provided at the beginning, and the grades you got during the semester.",

If you are not naturally good at language, then the rules of this one are not easy to grasp and will be hard for you. Only take this course if you are sure you want to take it, as for obvious reasons it will not be as useful outside of class as other languages. Also, make sure to treat it seriously, because it can be hard to recover if you don't understand some of the building blocks. The main benefit of this course comes in the form of the teacher. While she can be harsh at times she also tries her hardest to make the class fun because the content can definitely be monotonous at times.",
