I couldnt have asked for a better environment to learn photography.\r\nWeakness: It wouldve been nice to have more instruction on the technicals of photo making instead of crits and artist talks for the majority of classes. In this way the class is slightly less beginner friendly",

                "I feel like its strengths were in its people and supportive environment. I liked how we had different prompts for Crit, but how we could make Crit what we wanted it to be. I feel like it couldve been a bit more organized  as often times some people would get more time for crit than others or we would go on unproductive tangents.",
                "Strength: Welcoming to new photographers, variety in experience of peers",
                "Strengths: amazing and passionate professor and TF, as well as a supportive network of students and staff in general. Could be improved with more material resources from the university: there was a constant restriction in the tech I could rent due to low availability of cameras, lighting, and other equipment from CCAM. And I was surprised that printing paper wasn't abundantly provided by the university. Now that I'm thinking of that, I'm actually quite disappointed in the lack of material support from the administration, and the limits that places on what our professor and us students can do. Hm.",
