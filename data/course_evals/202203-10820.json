                "This course taught me how to better visualize and understand calculus of multiple variables, particularly with respect to the implementation of several famous theorems (Stokes' Theorem, the Divergence Theorem, etc.) It also served to improve my mathematical dexterity involving calculations of extended duration, which are only going to become more common later in my college career.",

            "comments": [
                "The structure of the pre-class quiz discouraged me from attending class, since it felt like a review session of the material I had already had to learn to take the quiz.",
                "The course's strength primarily lies in its focus on the connection between intuition and implementation. MATH 120 did an excellent job of teaching us a) how to use mathematical tools such as vectors, parameterization, changes of variables, the aforementioned theorems, etc. in the first place and b) when those tools are actually useful.\r\n\r\nI feel like the course could have been made more engaging by demonstrating how multivariable calculus can be used to solve practical problems, or perhaps by focusing more on why the various theorems work the way they do (at least at the introductory level, given that the formal details are the subject of an entirely different course). In other words, sometimes it felt like a component of relevancy was missing.",
                "The main strength of this course is that it is an introductory course, and therefore there are tons of online, textbook, and peers with which to learn the material. I found the delivery of course material extremely weak. Having to watch videos before class on the same material being learned in class was redundant and for me, so much of a waste of time that I stopped attending class and just watched the videos and consulted the textbook for my studying (I do recommend this particular textbook, and I am such a nerd that I have started a collection of various calculus textbooks). Delivery of material would not be hindered if there were no videos, and would be improved if class was more engaging via students working together on problems, demonstrating problems on the board, and closer attention to proofs of some of the more complicated theorems and ideas (which are abundantly provided in the textbook in a clear manner).",
                "Well organized course with videos and short quizzes for each new topic, weekly p-set, and three substantial exams. It would be preferable if placement was considered more carefully since there was at least a strong plurality of individuals who had already taken some version of multivariable calculus before.",
                "The course feels very DIY because of the reversed classroom method which might suit some people better than others, but it is something to be kept in mind.",
                "Strengths: The course was well organized and it did have a nice pace to it overall. I never felt burdened by the stress of the course and we were always on top of all of the \"course objectives.\" The videos also provided for good, easy ways to review material. The problem sets were manageable as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The overall reliance upon the videos for teaching varied from professor to professor. I know that mine only focused on problem solving and effectively left me to learn most of the content solely through the videos -- which most of the time were incredibly in depth, but in the times they were lackluster it showed in me being simply unable to do some of the problems.",
                "The course was designed to offer minimal office hour help; also the section was mainly flipped classroom.",
                "Strengths: Video lessons, textbook pages, and quizzes assigned before class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: My professor did practice problems in class instead of reteaching the material. I find that reteaching reinforces my confidence. PSETS, Ximera, and practice exams make for sufficient practice",
                "A strength of this course is that the concepts are very important. The class and material itself is good to learn as it helps teach logical thinking.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of this course is that it isn't very engaging. The teacher teaches the concepts well and gives examples that you will need on the homework later, but doesn't always try their best to keep the entire class focused. It gets boring.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Anderson is a phenomenal teacher. She explains things extremely well, and the course is very well run, organized, and fair\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes could be a lot of hw per week with pre class videos and psets the week of midterms",
                "Quite a fast turnaround for problem application. I feel as if the problem sets did not accurately reflect the styles of questions that individuals would see on tests and that the expectation for students to develop on their own was placed to be very difficult.",
                "I believe strengths were the problems-based approach the course took.",
                "I feel the course doesn't really emphasize the connections between the material learned, making it more difficult to gain a big picture of what we were actually doing, or how it connects to past concepts.",
                "This course was strong in that there was supplemental material available such as the videos and Ximera. However, I wish there was a way to access more example problems with worked solutions as we progressed through the material in this class.",
                "I don't see any strengths in this course. Having taken Math 115 and Math 120, I became so disappointed with the math department at Yale. Both courses were so poorly organized, making it hard for many people to keep up with the material. The course is extremely intensive, and we definitely did not spend enough time on each topic to practice problems. It feels like the math 120 course is stuck somewhere in the past and has not been improved since then. We get to watch tutorial videos from the fall 2020, go to classes, and read the book (if you have it and perhaps, more than half of the class, did not have it). I had the book, and it was probably the most helpful resource, along with YouTube tutorials, in the course -- neither classes nor John Hall's videos were that helpful. Because the course was so poorly organized, we had to resort to our peer tutors, who did a much better job explaining topics than our professors did. On the other hand, many of us were heavily dependent on them because we could not do any of the psets without them. I spent so much time studying multivariable calculus this semester, and I know that I could have saved so much time if only the course was more interactive and engaging. At the end of the day, this is multivariable calculus -- almost every topic was in 3D, and we had to visualize vectors, planes, and spaces to understand how things worked. Why don't the course directors make some effort and prepare interactive graphs for us to play with? There is a cool platform called GeoGebra, where you could model those 3D planes for us to be able to see and understand how things really worked. For example, I could not understand conceptually what a curl was until I watched a video on YouTube explaining, using a 3D graph, how it worked. I came here loving math, but having done it for one year here, I now dread it, and I am so frustrated about this. Math 120 is stuck in the past. Changes need to be made every year, and not once in every decade or so. At least, please update the psets, and do not reuse the same psets for the 10th year in a row. We were not even given pset and exam solutions after we received grades on them. How are we supposed to learn then? I wanted to know where I made the mistakes, see a detailed explanation of how to solve problems, and not just some two lines of comments in gradescope. I don't see a point of doing math 120 here unless you have already done it in high school. I haven't, so I thought I would learn a lot in this course. I did not.",
                "In all, this class is well taught, with a vast network of instructors, TAs, and graders to help you through it. That said, I wish the course was a bit less redundant in its teaching, with students asked to learn things well once instead of poorly three times (with the textbook, online videos, and recitation).",
                "I believe that the actual main section of theory could be taught better in class rather than before class",
                "This course was the least engaging in all of the courses I've taken. It's just a lot of sitting and taking notes as the professor lectures. I find math enjoyable, so I found the course relatively enjoyable, but the class just has no energy. Maybe it's just because I took a 9 AM."

                "Oh hear ye CourseTable user, reading my review, I know you have to take the class. You don't care if I recommend it or not. Everybody takes MATH 120; it's like death and taxes. Take the class. It's great material, and it's not very difficult.",
                "I would, but primarily as a vehicle for developing the mathematical foundation needed for other courses. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to someone looking to gain a deeper appreciation of mathematics itself (but that's why there's a separate track for math majors anyhow).",
                "Unless this course is required for your major, do not take this course. I made the mistake of taking this course instead of ENAS 151 as one of those \"just in case I decide to not take engineering\" type of scenarios and now know that was a mistake. I will not be making this mistake again and will be taking ENAS 194 next semester. I felt it was less frustrating to just teach myself the material we were supposed to learn with not so bad of a result what with the personal issues I dealt with this semester. If you do have to take this course, pick a section at your best \"time\" for motivation and consult with peers on problem sets. Another thing I found frustrating is that PSETS were due on Thursday nights, which facilitated a lot more stress throughout the week with a heavy course load compared to if it had been due on Friday nights or Mondays after a weekend. Also, having PSETS due the Monday of a test back to back after having a different PSET the past week was incredibly stress-inducing and detracts from the actual ability to study for the exam. The material needs to be better distributed.",
                "If you are willing to take the time to learn the material, absolutely take it. It's interesting and valuable even despite the likely chance that you will never use a large chunk of the content. I would strongly advise that you take, and do decently in, 115 or equivalent before jumping in. For a metric, this was harder than 115, but not exponentially harder. If you did well in 115, you'll put in slightly more work and do well in this course.",
                "I would recommend it if you need to take it for your major but I wouldn't if you're just looking for a QR credit - there's definitely some more fun options out there.",
                "I would recommend this course but out of caution. It does unequivocally give a strong overview of multivariable calculus and you will walk away from it knowing how to approach most multivariable problems. Some of the professors were absolutely phenomenal at explaining their content, and this would lead to an unfair advantage on the tests. If you get some of these professors, you will be intellectually engaged as I was. If not, best of luck.",
                "If a student were in my shoes, taking this class to feel better prepared for Econ 121, this course would be overkill. I would recommend he check out Math 118 to learn what he needed to learn for the class.",
                "No. The concept of logical reasoning, which I believe to be the most important thing gained from this class, can be gotten from other classes that do a much better job of keeping the learner interested in what they are learning.",
                "Yes, I enjoyed the course and feel that it gave me a very good understanding of complex topics",
                "Only to students who really really want to do challenging math, otherwise I would recommend ENAS 151",
                "Yes I believe this is a very important fundamental course in math.",
                "Yes, it's an important class that develops a different sort of thinking and visualizing than previous math courses. I found the material very interesting and not too difficult to grasp.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in math. Engaging with the problem sets in this class was challenging, but it was the work I found most enjoyable this semester out of all my courses.",
                "No for the reasons mentioned above.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wishes (or perhaps needs) to learn more math. It isn't a \"must-take\" course, but it's one that I am certainly glad that I took.",
                "It is a needed course to learn important math, so yes.",
                "I would recommend this course. I feel like the skills I picked up which allowed to me succeed are going to be incredibly helpful through the rest of my STEM journey at Yale. I just feel like the course could've been executed better, that's all."
