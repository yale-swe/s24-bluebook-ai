                "I learned Asian American History. I did not know anything about Asian American history and now I know so much! It has definitely broadened my worldview and help me conceptualize Asians and other minorities within American society.",
                "Asian American history from 1800 to the present.",
                "I gained a valuable and comprehensive overview of Asian American history.",
                "I gained an in-depth overview of important themes and events in Asian American history.",
                "I learned about different topics in Asian American history ranging from the Chinese Exclusion Act, Japanese internment, annexation of the Philippines, Vietnam War, 1965 Immigration Act, Asian American activism, etc. The course content focuses primarily on a few ethnic groups, their migrations to the U.S., and their experiences in the U.S.",
                "I developed a greater understanding of diasporic Asian American history that was also interactive and interdisciplinary---the lectures of Professor Lui tackled literature, film, documentaries, and social movements in order to understand the different dimensions of Asian American history.",
                "Analyzing history through lens of certain group's experiences, agency of Asian American community, synthesizing experiences of different groups",
                "As someone with little background on Asian American history, this was a great course. I feel as though it covered a lot of history that I had never heard of and\/or vaguely learned in regular history classes. Because of the oral history project, I also got to develop writing and interviewing skills which was pretty cool.",
                "An understanding of Asian American history from initial migration (plantation laborers, etc) to the modern day, and a clearer conceptualization of the rich historical context that surrounds the issues Asian Americans face today."

                "Strengths: lectures and everything were good. I had a good TF. Mary Lui is great lecturer. Weaknesses: Lots of readings but they are interesting",
                "Strengths: my TF (Minh) was literally amazing, brilliant, kind, etc.; the readings were very well-curated and pretty interesting\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could be a little dry; I don't think the Oral History paper is the most conducive vehicle for us to learn the skills it purports to teach us; a midterm exam, midterm paper, final paper, and final exam are too much!",
                "Strengths: Professor Lui is a very engaging lecturer and her lectures were well-organized and easy to pay attention to. The lecture handouts also made studying for the exams relatively easy. The readings were generally interesting and not overwhelming like I expected from previous year reviews.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The sections were not the most engaging and felt like a waste of time many weeks.",
                "The lectures were interesting and informative, but it would have been helpful for clearer goals fulfilled in section in connection with the week's material.",
                "While the lectures were great, I appreciated that the sections gave us an opportunity to go into the readings and discuss them with a group. I really enjoyed Professor Lui's lecturing style  it kept me engaged during the 50 minutes, and it helped me see history as a constantly evolving and shifting narrative. In the future, I think it would be helpful for the lecture slides or some sort of summary of the lecture to be sent out to students. There was one week that I was exposed to COVID-19 and didn't feel safe coming to class, so I had to rely on notes from classmates, which might not be possible for everyone.",
                "The course content was very interesting and I learned a lot of new information about American history and the role of Asians within this broader history. If you are taking this course to get an understanding of pan-Asian American history, you will be disappointed. It mainly focuses on East and Southeast Asians even though the syllabus also mentions South Asians. Also, the workload was excessive. We had a midterm paper + midterm exam, and a final paper + a final exam. There were also very long readings (some weeks we were assigned entire books).",
                "Some strengths of the course is that there is extreme structure---lecture notes are always provided and lectures generally follow a steady theme. A weakness of the course, albeit really small, is that the ratio of lecture to section is especially large that leaves a lot of material undiscussed.",
                "A weakness was the occasional messy flow of the lecture. While it was engaging and important to have narratives integrated into the broader historical context of the class, it felt too narrow and unclear at times. The content of the class was nonetheless very interesting.",
                "Strengths: engaging, places Asian American community in position of agency, connects history to 21st century\r\nWeaknesses: n\/a",
                "The course is pretty well organized and the TFs are amazing. I will say, it is a bit of a demanding class since for both the midterm and final season you have a paper and an exam.",
                "Strengths: Lots of interesting material (from both readings and lectures), and I loved the way Professor Lui dives into all these subjects with her intersectional approach. Also enjoyed the oral history project as the final paper as opposed to a typical research paper you might find in other history classes.\r\nWeakness: Assigned readings a bit heavy for some weeks, would have been helpful if there were some highlighted sections\/key terms to focus on while reading.",
                "The strength of the course is the wide coverage of topics we covered without sacrificing depth. Discussing where Asian American history really began helped frame many of the themes necessary to understanding the history itself. The lectures were highly informative and engaging."

                "Yes I would. Asian American History is often forgotten (or not learned at all) and it is a shame. The workload is not that tough even though everyone says that. You learn a lot.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially to Asian students! I think it's really important history for Asian Americans to solidly know Asian American history, and I learned a lot that I didn't previously know about even as an Asian American history major. I don't think it's an absolute must-take class at Yale, but I do think it's a decent one.",
                "I would recommend this course for anyone already interested in the material. As my first humanities course, it was definitely an adjustment from pset classes, but I think it was the perfect level of challenging. As someone who doesn't consider themselves a leftist, I did feel that the course at times pandered to leftists and could feel a bit like it was pushing an agenda, but that's probably hard to avoid in certain classes at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in learning about Asian American history, regardless of whatever prior knowledge they already have on the subject.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they're interesting in learning more about Asian American history. By taking this course, I realized that my own understanding of my background was pretty basic and rudimentary. During each lecture, I learned something new, and it helped me put into context my feelings and knowledge of my identity and events happening today.",
                "I would recommend if you're interested in learning about Asian American history. The lectures were very interesting and engaging, but be forewarned that there is a lot of work, A LOT of content to memorize, and the grading can be a bit harsh. Grading is very TA-dependent.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are passionate about migratory histories and are studying within the cross listed departments of this course. For students who don't have a predisposed academic interest in this course (or belong to the in-group of Asian Americans), I think it may be difficult to wholly invest yourself on a personal level to the demands of the course.",
                "Yes! It provides another facet of American history that you would not be able to learn otherwise.",
                "Yes, one of the best classes I've taken. I was excited to see a class that focused on Asian Americans and really enjoyed the class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because Professor Lui is an amazing lecturer and made the class incredibly engaging. I feel as though I learned a lot of history and such little time and the oral history project was quite fun. I would advise though for students to consider the workload of other classes as this class has a heavy workload during exam periods.",
                "Yes, if you're looking for a greater understanding of Asian Amerian history. There are no recordings (and lecture slides don't really have notes on them) so I would only recommend if you feel confident showing up to almost all of the in-person lectures.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Typically those I've met who have taken this course or took it this past semester wanted to learn more about their Asian American heritage and have been satisfied with the content learned. I did not feel that the class is not geared towards Asian American students, and appeals as a great history lecture course. The coursework is significant but very do-able if time is managed well (deadlines are made known well in advance and the extension policy is very fair)."
