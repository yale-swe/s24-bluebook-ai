                "This course offered the space to learn Arabic in your own style. The course exposes you to news articles and news videos, and simply requests writing samples of ~200 words in Arabic. So you can incorporate any new words you learned, any new grammar things you want to try, or pretty much anything. The instructor only graded these homework for completion. Afterwards, the exams really were just demonstrating that we could produce roughly 200 word essay in basic-level Arabic on a topic. I appreciate the grading being lenient on the exams, so I was not afraid to take some risks in my writing and perhaps use grammar structures, words, or spelling that I did not know how to use for certain.",
                "You do a lot of practice with understanding spoken MSA via videos and a lot of writing. We covered different aspects of Arab culture and society through articles, news videos etc. Much of our writing assignments were in infographic form, which I found to be silly, tiresome and unproductive. We got almost no feedback or guidance on our writing or how to make it sound more natural and professional.",

                "The course's strengths include its flexibility in learning style, practical exposure to real-world Arabic through news articles and videos, and a focus on practical application in writing. Encouraging experimentation without penalizing mistakes helps build confidence. \r\nHowever, a weakness is the narrow focus primarily on writing skills. To improve, the course could include diverse activities to enhance speaking. Perhaps having the option to submit a 1-2 minute audio memo instead of writing an infographic.",
                "Strengths: Sarab is lovely, kind and accommodating.\r\nWeaknesses: this class doesn't really have a curriculum. There's no progression; instead, you do the same thing every week but with a new topic. So each week you read and article, make an infographic, and write a paragraph. But you don't work on reviewing and expanding vocabulary or developing/practicing specific skills.",
                "Strengths: while I felt that the speed of videos went from excruciatingly slow to extremely fast almost immediately from L3 to L4, practicing listening to the language trains the mind to process the words that they hear without having to think."

                "YES!! If it is with Sarab, then absolutely! Definitely manageable as a fifth class. Just be prepared to write 200 word essays. Don't worry about it being perfect--in fact, I think Sarab is happy to see mistakes. I appreciated that the grading was so lenient, I never felt afraid to try new things in my writing. If you are trying to connect deeper with Arab/Muslim identity, I highly recommend that you keep learning Arabic. Arabic is a language of deep precision. Reading texts in the original Arabic will unveil multitudes of meaning.",
                "Sadly, this course did not deliver what I was looking for as an Arabic student. It is poorly organized, intellectually unstimulating, and repetitive. Take this if you need to for your language requirement, and definitely keep studying Arabic, but maybe find other, more effective ways of doing so.",
                "Yes. If one wants consistent practice in Arabic, this course will provide an impetus to do so."
