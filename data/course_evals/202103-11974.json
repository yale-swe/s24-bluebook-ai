                "The course is very strong as it is. Perhaps the literature section could move to the end, as it was by far the most challenge aspect of the course",
                "The main strength of this course was its emphasis on Arabic conversation. The chance to meet three times a week and engage with my classmates completely in Arabic made my language skills improve in a way unprecedented during the rest of my time studying Arabic at Yale. Professor Elbousty worked to curate a class environment where mistakes were understood and encouraged, which made me feel comfortable participating in conversation. Other strengths of the course included the reading material (I really enjoyed the short stories we read at the beginning of the semester, and the news articles we read for the rest of the semester sparked interesting conversations in class) and, of course, Professor Elbousty himself. He is a generous teacher.\r\nThis course could be improved with a bit more clear communication of the course schedule from the outset. We sometimes were a bit confused with what we had to do and when we had to do it (though Professor Elbousty was responsive to our questions and ended up making a very helpful assignment schedule for everyone). I also think it could be helpful to have the same TA grade our reading responses as teaches us on Fridays. Some of my classmates and I had questions about our reading response grades but, since we never saw the TA that graded them, were unable to have them answered. (The TA that taught us on Fridays was absolutely wonderful, though.)",
                "Professor Elbousty is a great strength of the course. I liked his division of literary and media Arabic with many interesting units. I think it would help to ease students into the class by starting with media Arabic, since literature was a little overwhelming at first. I valued the small class size and the ability to practice Arabic by just discussing the readings. Lastly, I had a lot of fun with the literary translation aspect of the course -- the speakers we had were really cool!\r\n\r\nI would have appreciated more opportunities for grammar study -- I think there are some concepts I've missed or forgotten, or just things that I haven't learned yet, that would be nice to refresh. If there was time outside of class to ask grammar questions, or a writing workshop for our weekly reflections or something like that, it would have helped me improve my Arabic even more. The other thing that could be improved is more clear guidelines and schedules for assignments, since sometimes that was unclear or last-minute.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-very relevant topics covered (migration, Islam and democracy, etc.)\r\n-good balance of work-- enough outside of class to continue improving but not overwhelming\r\n-well-facilitated class discussion\r\n\r\nImprove:\r\n-might be helpful to have vocabulary tests to ensure students are retaining new words\r\n-many schedule changes throughout the semester",
                "Strengths: very comfortable class environment",
                "Professor Elbousty needs to grade and look at the writing the students hand in. This is ridiculous. In a language class in any other school or program it would be unheard for a professor to not give constant feedback to the students writing: this is part of language learning."
