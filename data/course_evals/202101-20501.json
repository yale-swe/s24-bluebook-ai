I think the course was a bit unorganized (ie all canvas homework slots were blank so I never really knew which places to put my homework), and the workload on a day to day basis seemed uneven. I think some times I wasnt quite sure what we were learning. In general, however the course was great and I learned a lot",

All assignments were carefully graded to learn from mistakes. There could be better review of work after we submit it in class  some mistakes were difficult to understand until discussed further.",

A weakness in this course is perhaps the pace, there were some grammar topics that flew past me, but honestly, I was always able to communicate difficulties and the professors knew how to level with students because it is a heritage speakers course and it is inevitable that not everyone will have the same comfort with all topics"

I would have never learnt so much in other russian class. this class is perfect for people with slavic backgrpunds. it just makes learing russian so much easier. the teacher and the ta were amazing - always willing to meet and great at explaing things multiple times and in differnt wys if something wasn't clear. i love the class it wassuper fun, and i get to watch russian movies and read actual books. i love tht we learn from primary sources and not just form a random textbook.",
