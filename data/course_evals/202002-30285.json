    "I improved my close reading skills, learned how to analyze works according to different linguistic elements in depth (phonetic sounds, morphology, etymology, history of words and role, syntax and how sentences function, pragmatic - what else can this phrase be saying other than what it explicitly says?). I also gained greater insights through group discussions in section -- where students bounced ideas off one another and expanded upon them. I learned more about diversity in what constitutes American literature, the role of technology in literature, culture\/history\/politics and effect on writing.",
    "How to read American literature and gained a greater appreciation for poetry",
    "This course made me a more critical reader. I learned to consult outside contexts, including historical sources, literary scholarship, and cross referencing texts.",
    "I gained many skills for digesting literature. Most of these were unique or at a level that I would not have developed on my own.",
    "I was able to understand how to read more deeply. I was able to wrangle this idea of what it means to be American and how to use that in my daily life. I am now able to think more about my actions and how they work. How simply reading something will not enable you to understand it. How constant repetition does make a difference. How no matter how dumb my idea if, it will be valued by someone and my words have meaning.",
    "I learned how to analyze and critically assess poetry, which is something I was not as familiar with before. I also read new texts that I probably would never have come across otherwise.",
    "Learned how to close-read literature, gained insight into the evolution of American literature and the famous writers behind it, along with historical movements that influenced academia and art at the time.",
    "This course offered me a unique opportunity to discuss and work with complex literature and ideas while being forced to stay in my house. This did not necessarily detract from the course, instead pushing much of our discussion under the context of isolation, unprecedented times, and so forth. I also definitely developed a greater understanding of personal time management when there is not much the government permits you to do.",
    "I learned about new questions to ask myself when reading a piece of American literature, as well as new ways to read\/interpret texts themselves, which is just what I hope to get out of any English class.",
    "Grasped a new sense of the American literature by learning the similarities and differences between writers, their works, and their inspirations.",
    "I learned a lot about the history and development of American Literature. I developed my close reading skills, and bettered my writing.",
    "How to closely read American literature. How to relate American literature to the American identity and explore philosophical concepts of the authors.",
    "This course focused quite heavily on the contextualization of the texts we read, far more than other literature courses I have taken, and this focus definitely deepened my relationship to each text featured in the course.",
    "I developed the skill to analyze poetry and prose. I can now look into the deeper meaning of all different styles of poetry along with short stories and complex novels. I also gained a lot of knowledge about classic American writers.",
    "I learned a lot about Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, postmodernism, analyzing poetry, and dissecting a text from a variety of different lenses. I've gotten a little stronger in my close-reading abilities, and my capability to distill a semblance of meaning or profundity from even the smallest line in a poem--which may in fact be counter to what we learned in class. I learned a lot about Melville and his short stories -- and some homoerotic subtext in much of these works. I pondered my definition of \"American literature.\"",
    "I learned to approach American literature in an interactive way, in which I analyzed texts by their words and phrases, as well as by the ways in which the author actively impacted me and my reading of the text (ex: making the reader feel paranoid while reading)",
    "More thorough understanding of some parts of the American literary tradition.",
    "I learned a lot about different American authors and how to close read and analyze their work.",
    "Close reading of literature",
    "I learned a lot about how to read and understand the context texts were written in, as well as how literature has evolved in America from the mid 1800s to the mid 1900s.",
    "what skills are needed to properly analyze literature, how to think about literature in different ways and in different contexts",
    "While in this course, I improved my ability to critically analyze different forms of writing from poems to short stories to books. I learned more in general about American literature and what makes American literature American literature.",
    "Ostensibly a survey of American writers. Realistically, very little.",
    "This course helped develop my ability to interrogate poetry through close-reading, especially with regards to researching each component of a poem  diction and etymology, references to people and events, and the historical context of the poem and author. We also were exposed to a lot of artwork throughout the course, whether the frontispiece to a poetry collection or work by contemporary artists that mirrored the themes of the readings and added to the historical and cultural context in which the author was writing.",
    "I learned much about reading and interpreting poetry, and the ideological progression of American literature."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures are a bit long, which can be hard to follow at times. But for the most parts they're pretty engaging and not like your standard English lecture. Professor Williams really goes out of his way to find interesting things about the literature that you wouldn't have otherwise thought of.",
    "Strengths: great professor with well-planned lectures that conform well to the online format, great TAs that encourage thoughtful and engaging conversations in section, breaks in-between the lengthy classes (especially nice on the eyes), reading material length perfect for the short period of time that we have (I also appreciated the ability to dive into the works without being overwhelmed in quantity of reading -- it deepened my understanding of the literature), flexible\/generous assignments, professor\/TAs considerate of online format and willing to adapt \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't find any -- was one of the best thought-out and executed courses that I have taken!",
    "Even though the course was online and basically became a lecture, I thought it was conducted really well given the circumstances. Assignments were great and feedback was clear",
    "It was a zoom course, but it felt like one of the best online courses I have taken. Discussion sections were interpersonal, and Professor Williams worked hard to engage with individuals even through the screen. I would have loved to read a larger range of authors, but being that the course was only 5 weeks long that may not be feasible.",
    "I thought this was a wonderfully structured course for the zoom medium. It required an appropriate amount of work, all of which was beneficial. The breaks within the class were also greatly appreciated! They helped me stay fresh through the whole 3 hour period.",
    "Strengths - very engaging, books were very interesting, questions always answered, very good support within my discussion section and TA, liked the prerecorded lecture that one time, was able to rewind and understand what professor was saying  \r\nWeakness - lectures were very long, there were low energy checkpoints, not enough engagement within lectures, felt very draining to have 3 straight hours of content.",
    "The discussion section was definitely the best part of the course for me. My TA Pooja Sen was really wonderful and the people in my section were all very engaging. The lectures were also very well put together.",
    "Strengths: content was very interesting and thought provoking. TAs were very knowledgeable.\r\nWeaknesses: If this class has to be online it should not be a lecture. Lecture format was very disengaging. Also, each session was WAY TOO LONG. We had class & section from 1:00-4:15pm twice a week. Would have been better to break it up into three sessions\/week. \r\n\r\nAlso, I was unable to access many of the lectures online, but Ive been having issues with my zoom account.",
    "The weakness of this course, in my opinion, was definitely the lecture segment. Perhaps it could have been improved if instead of having an extended lecture, and then a somewhat related discussion aspect, the two were more deeply intertwined.",
    "Due to the strange circumstances of this summer, a lot more students than normal were enrolled in the course. Because of this, our class was a mix of lectures and sections. English classes are usually more discussion-based than lecture-based, so the lecture portions of this class were often less engaging than the discussion section part of it. The weakness of this course was thus the nature of the lecture, but our instructor tried his best to incorporate discussion by having section at the end of class, which was the strength.",
    "Changing the method in the last two lessons threw me off my game. I would rather have the same lesson plan continue on; a lecture by Professor Williams (camera off and microphone muted) followed by Q and A by our TA and general conversation followed up by a wrap up of our conversations.",
    "Strengths: Professor Williams is amazing, the discussion sections were interesting\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it was hard to be engaged with the lecture portion",
    "Strengths: professor was engaging and taught an interesting perspective of American literature. The readings were also fascinating and built off each other. \r\nWeaknesses: the last assignment to write about what you learned was wack.",
    "Despite the course being online, Professor Williams's lectures were engaging, and he was very accommodating. While it was nice that a large number of students could enroll in the class and have the opportunity to take Am Lit, the large class size was also a drawback. Am Lit is supposed to be a seminarand because we had TAs, I never got to know Professor Williams, which is a shame bc he seems like a cool guy. Given the situation, however, I think Professor Williams did the best he could in terms of the class format by having lectures and section with TAs.",
    "During a very abnormal summer, Professor Williams led a class that was as easy as possible to engage with fully, overcoming constraints like time differences, the strain of online class and the difficulty of not being able to engage in proper seminar discussion when studying English. The teaching fellows were knowledgeable, invested in the students and very encouraging, which enabled me to feel immersed in the class even from over 3000 miles away from where it normally would be held. Though it was a summer course during unprecedented times, it never once felt like I was getting a second rate study of some very interesting texts.",
    "I think the only weakness of this course was that due to the short length of the course itself, we did not have time for lengthier texts. Overall though, the course was incredibly well formatted, especially with the mix of lecture and discussion over Zoom. I think the instructor and TAs did an excellent job of adapting the course to an online format.",
    "I thought the course was very strong, especially under the circumstances of having to be online and with such a large course enrollment. The setup was effective because we had lecture for the bulk of the class and then broke out into discussion sections which were very engaging.",
    "Because it was an online course, Professor Williams was in an interesting predicament. I think he did a phenomenal job of trying to maintain student engagement, especially given that the course is usually taught as a seminar, NOT a lecture. He had students participating in class, despite being over Zoom and without video, so it felt oftentimes like a real class, even if we couldn't be in person. His presentations are also beautifully constructed, intelligently, with a great deal of information. His lectures on Emily Dickinson were phenomenal. \r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, I think it was especially interesting that we spent one day on Langston Hughes and Gwendolyn Brooks. There were the only Black authors that we read, where there are a great deal other authors to cover. In addition, the normal sequence of American lit reads \"There, There,\" inviting a Native\/Indigenous voice into the mix. While I was pleased that I didn't have to suffer through Moby Dick, I would have liked perhaps a more diverse list. There is certainly merit in reading the authors that were chosen, but for a survey course, or an intended survey course, there is so much more that could have been covered. Moreover, I do not know why, to this day, Marshall McLuhan was included on the syllabus. Professor Williams studies media and teaches a media theory course. This class is NOT a media theory course. McLuhan's stuff is for sure interesting, no doubt about it. But it's not what comes to mind when one says \"American literature.\" We could've read Toni Morrison, Zora Neale Hurston, James Baldwin, or even something modern like \"There, There\" by Tommy Orange. What about an American Pulitzer Prize winning book? American literature doesn't have to be resigned to pre-1950s. But I digress--the theory, the McLuhan stuff, felt like it belonged in another class, and the lectures for those works, as well as those concerning Pynchon, tended to meander. I still don't really get Pynchon--I can tell Professor Williams does, but I still do not, and I'm not sure if the lectures made his writing any more clear. The class' duration was too long for the amount of things that were being covered, and so we could've done so much more. \r\n\r\nAlso a note regarding the TA's grading -- I'm always hesitant when a TA is in charge of the grading, and this course is no exception. I cannot see my grade at the moment, but once I do, I'm expecting an A-, which in all truth, I'm not sure is accurate. The comments I received from my TA on at least one assignment should've have brought my grade up to an actual A, yet her defense was that while my argument was fresh, exciting, well-written, cogent, it wasn't simply \"original enough.\" I'm not sure this should be the standard for receiving an A, and I've noticed a trend\/pattern of elitism in grading procedures among the Yale English department. The comments I received on this particular assignment were essentially nothing but good. I received not negative feedback--would this not imply an A? In another paper, I was praised for my originality, yet I was not given an A either. So what is the double-standard? Sure, this was my TA's doing. So I'd be interested to know how Professor Williams would've graded my work, had I written it for him in the more traditional seminar setting of this course. Needless to say, I am frustrated by this grade.",
    "I think this course could improve from more discussion of form. This class is strong in terms of close reading, but it would be helpful to discuss overarching motifs and specific literary devices of the text.",
    "More people of colour, queer people, and women earlier in the course.",
    "This course was hands off and uninteresting. Rather than analyze the author's craft or better understand the art of literature, the course focused on unclear historic trends or was simply rambling.",
    "The lectures were very interesting and Professor Williams is an engaging lecturer. The texts were also interesting and the writing assignments complemented them well. Sections were a breath of fresh air from isolation, and the discussions we had were useful and productive. I can't think of any glaring weaknesses besides inevitable ones caused by the fact that it was an online summer course; we didn't have that much time to read longer texts, and online engagement is hard to do. But I think the class worked around these limitations really well.",
    "One of the strengths of the course was that it made literature accessible for people who don't have a lot of background in the subject. The class was very interesting and we learned about more than just literature. A weakness was the assignments and grading structure. I think the course could have benefitted from having some smaller assignments, rather than just 3 big essays, to keep us engaged with the content. Also since so much of our grade was based on our writing we could have spent more time in class working on developing our writing.",
    "The course was really well thought out and I thought that the readings flowed really smoothly. This made it easier to draw different connections to earlier readings that furthered my understanding of the course. I also actually really enjoyed the bigger lecture and then smaller seminar structure of the course because it was a good mix of listening to Professor Williams talk and then also having time to talk myself in the discussion sessions. Once weakness of the course is that I wish we had more time to discuss some of the later pieces. It felt a bit rushed at times towards the end.",
    "**Strengths:** Good selection of authors on the syllabus. Professor Williams recognized the fast pace of the course in terms of the semesters worth of reading and an essay due each week, and was quite understanding, relaxing hard-deadlines for submissions with a real effort to make the summer session as stress-free as possible. I enjoyed the fact that in the second half, we would break off from the large lecture into discussion sections led by the TAs. The TAs were great and put in a lot of work! More than the professor...\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses:** Lecture was pretty horrible. During lecture, we barely analyzed the works we were assigned?! I will never forget how we pulled up sketches of Whitmans portrait from subsequent publications of Leaves of Grass and unironically focused on changes emphasizing how his crotch bulge \"\"increased in size.\"\" In a class on American Lit?? Its honestly startling how little focus we gave to literature during lecture (however, my TA at least clearly made an effort to bring a stronger focus during discussion section). We watched YouTube videos during class about some random guy who could only remember the last 30 second of his life, as well as a Playboy interview with Marshall McLuhan (who was Canadian btw... in a class on *American* Lit), like why  is literature not interesting enough? I say this as an applied math major. Also the essay prompts for this class were god awful, easily some of the worst I have ever seen. Essay 1: Memorize 20 lines of literature and write an essay about how *the process of memorization* helped you reach a new understanding. Essay 2: Read a work, then identify *a single word* and write a 3 page essay on that one word. Essay 3: Write 3 pages on what you learned by taking this course (We basically were graded on a quasi-course review). Honestly the hardest part of doing these essays was connecting it back to the literature?! Like the rubric *literally* said we needed to produce publication-worthy ideas that probably no one has ever thought of before to earn the highest marks. And writing something publication-worthy about the literature given these prompts?! Are you serious",
    "Overall, the course did an excellent job. I would have loved to interact more with Professor Williams during in-class discussions, but I recognize that the split lecture-seminar style required for online learning limited that; our discussion sections were well-led by excellent TFs, and we did see Prof. Williams even if it wasn't realistic for him to jump into our small group discussions. But I wasn't personally able to see him in office hours instead. As an English major, however, I hope to speak with him sometime this fall!",
    "Professor Williams lecturing style was did many things right--with lots of visuals and interesting topics--but I wish he had been more engaging. While he asked students to read to the class often, I wish he had posed questions and found other ways to get students involved throughout the class period. \r\n\r\nIt sometimes felt as though there was too much content being condensed into too short of a time. Picking the most important pieces and focusing on a few others to compliment them might have made more sense."

   "comments": [
    "If you're looking for a writing credit that's interesting and not too much of a burden I recommend it, or if you need this to fulfill English major requirements. If you're just taking it for fun or because you're interested in American literature, I think there are other classes that are a bit more engaging in that aspect.",
    "YES! This is the first English department course that I have taken at Yale, and I will highly recommend it to peers - especially if Prof. Williams is teaching. I have strengthened my close reading, analysis, and writing skills and gained further insight into American literature as placed in the context of society, culture, world, and technology. I liked how the lectures served as models for how we students should approach readings and assignments, and communication was handled extremely well between instructors and students. The lectures were even better (in my opinion) on Zoom because there were no distractions from the physical presence of other students, yet we all still participated via the chat feature and reading passages aloud. Sections were small and allowed us to discuss and develop ideas without feeling too pressured.",
    "Yes! Professor Williams takes an approach to analyzing that I'd never encountered before which was really cool and will definitely change the way you view literature. The assignments, too, aren't your standard English essays, for they always had some twist that made them much more thought provoking",
    "A very interesting course, a lot of cool reading. But I would take this course during the regular term to get a more holistic view of American literature.",
    "Yes! I think it was a great course to take - everyone should take an introductory literature course. Lectures were engaging and challenged students to think critically. It was also a very manageable pace.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is extremely enjoyable and interactive despite being on Zoom. I learned much more than I anticipated without being overburdened with work or mental exertion. It had an amazing return of learning for the amount of effort put in.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another person. It was very engaging and enabled me to work on my writing skills. I remembered why I loved to read with this course.",
    "I wouldn't because the biggest issue I had with the course was the lack of women writers and writers of color. I understand the course is about the Western American literature canon, but I felt that many readings by POC writers were left off that could have been incorporated. Initially, I had thought this meant the course would involve more writers of color, and was a bit disappointed when I realized that the majority of our readings were written by white men. While this literature was still very interesting to analyze and may be an essential part of the American literature canon, I would imagine that writers from different backgrounds would have a very different and equally illuminating description of the American experience.",
    "It depends. The material is interesting but the structure of the course was very disengaging. I would recommend this in person, but definitely not online unless you are self-motivated and\/or really love American literature and are willing to sit through it.",
    "Yes, I personally find English courses valuable as they allow students to deeply reflect on a variety of ideas that may not be possible without the context of the classroom facilitating such thought. However, the online format is certainly strange and at times frustrating.",
    "Yes. I think the nature of the course changed due to the pandemic, but I enjoyed myself nevertheless. The authors\/works our instructor chose to look at were very interesting and not ones that you would usually think of when thinking about American literature (at least for me).",
    "I would not recommend this course to someone more knowledgeable, perhaps in the 2nd or 3rd grade, however this was a wonderful introduction course.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot and read some great works.",
    "Yes. Gives you a good foundation in core American literature texts. It also helps you think more deeply about literature and how to read literature.",
    "Yes, depending on the student and what they want to get out of the course. Hopefully they won't have to take it online in the future and can meet in person.",
    "Definitely. The readings were diverse and interesting, there was something for every type of student not just every type of English student, all were a joy to read and discuss. Professor Williams and the teaching fellows were very supportive and very willing to adapt to the student and tailor the learning to the circumstances. Instead of being stale or passive, this class provided a rewarding, active study of literature with plenty of room for student expression through very interesting prompts.",
    "I would recommend this course. Even though our course had 60-something students, Professor Williams expressed interest in the interpretations and thoughts he heard from individual students. He would ask for ideas and suggestions during lecture, and he responded to them thoroughly. This made the course as engaging as a Zoom course can possibly be! If I had the opportunity to take an in-person course with Professor Williams, I definitely would.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the reading is interesting along with the background information on each writer.  We also studied some unique materials on media and different movements of art along with many different authors.",
    "I think out of the normally taught American literature courses at Yale, this one stands out, for the syllabus was markedly different. Professor Williams chose very different readings as compared to the typical Yale American literature survey courses, and I think this could be a major draw. Similarly, the assignments are unalike any I've seen before, and I did enjoy that. For those reasons, I would recommend this course. Yet for most this is a requirement\/pre-requisite or a simple way to get a WR credit, so I'm not sure I need to recommend it to another student.",
    "I would, it gave me a new approach to American Literature that I have never considered before.",
    "Sure. It was fairly interesting, if not consistently challenging for someone who has done some higher-level classes already.",
    "Yes, I would recommend taking this course. I loved how it was set up, with a long and interesting lecture followed by an engaging discussion section. It also met twice a week which was nice.",
    "No. This course had assignments that were interesting and provided an opportunity to learn, but the course itself was a waste of time.",
    "Absolutely; it's a great chance to read some interesting literature and think about the process of reading.",
    "Yes. The content is very interesting. This isn't a typical American literature class. We covered a lot of topics in history, philosophy, and media studies.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are curious and want to learn more about American Literature. It was a really good introduction to American Literature that covered many topics.",
    "Overall, very luke-warm recommendation. If you need a writing credit over the summer, I definitely would recommend ENGL220 Milton with John Rogers over this course, really excellent course. Otherwise, if youve already taken that and need your second writing credit, I suppose you dont have very many other options",
    "Absolutely! This was an extremely enjoyable introductory course. I would recommend any class by Professor Williams; he is an engaging lecturer and was able to create a supportive classroom environment despite the restrictions of online learning. He did an excellent job adjusting the course to accommodate the online format: altered assignments and pace, mixing lecture and seminar portions to split up the 3+ hour class, and using screen-sharing to visually supplement and organize the lecture. This class should be used as a model for how to utilize Zoom and Canvas features to the benefit of the class, with classroom policies that helped alleviate stress on students. Classes were recorded and posted to Canvas, providing a record of lecture slides and a transcript of the class (an incredible resource for those who require academic accommodations such as note-takers). Discussion Sections supplemented lectures with the equivalent of a 12-student seminar led by an excellent group of Teaching Fellows. Our TFs routinely used the Breakout Room feature to allow small group discussions between 2-4 students. Zoom links were easy to access on the home page of Canvas, along with a simplified syllabus with links to course readings and updated consistently with links to recorded lectures or supplementary resources mentioned during class discussions. If you want to be in a classroom designed to be supportive and help you focus on learning interesting things without all-consuming assignment deadlines, this class as taught by Professor Williams is an excellent way to read American Literature.",
    "Yes. There were very interesting and provacative topics being covered. My writing skills were improved as well."
