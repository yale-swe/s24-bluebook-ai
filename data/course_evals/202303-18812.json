                "This class starts off very slow. We spend almost 3 weeks on basic complex number ideas like complex functions. We also cover a lot of real analysis again. So, even though the pace at the end of the class is good, we only got to doing residues on the very last day. I think if we started the class a little bit faster, we could cover more. It would also have been nice to see more of the applications of complex analysis (for example to fluid dynamics or Fourier series). Also, having solutions posted for the homework problems would have been very helpful.",
                "It felt like we were moving extremely slowly through the content at the beginning (ie spending non insignificant time on complex conjugates) but then sped up significantly at the end. Regardless, it was pretty doable overall. The grading of the problem sets was a little frustrating. We have not gotten a graded pset back since the midterm (and it is now after the final). Before the midterm, we were told the exam would cover only the psets that had already been graded, and then they released multiple grades within twelve hours of the exam.",
                "Clear lectures and helpful office hours. Only weakness is that grading fell behind before the midterm and after the midterm, no problem set got graded.",
                "This course could be improved by:\r\n1. Not being at 9am\r\n2. Having more proofs and less computation on the problem sets\r\n3. Using a textbook that provides a bit more rigor and detail",
                "The topic material is really interesting  there are tons of nice results from complex analysis, even relating to the reals, which makes it satisfying to study. The lectures were also not too fast; if anything I would say they were a bit on the slow side, especially for the first half of the semester. My main suggestion would be to make the test questions more similar to pset questions.",
                "It would be great if we get our psets graded since we didn't get a single pset back after the midterm",
                "Strengths: course was well taught, and theres a lot of nice material. The professor was also very nice.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none other than maybe the textbook wasnt that good at covering some topics.",
                "This course was honestly a little underwhelming. I think we spent too much time on the first few chapters of the book, which are mainly a review of complex variables/real analysis/multivariable calculus, and didn't even get to residues until the last week. I think that this course could have definitely moved a lot faster and covered a lot more.\r\n\r\nWhether these are strengths or weaknesses depends on your own opinions, but I will note that the exams had basically no proofs on them at all and the homeworks were very light.",
                "The course was quite good overall, with a reasonable workload, clear lectures, and great peer tutor office hours. The biggest weakness of the course was the textbook, which often had very poorly worded questions and sketchy proofs. The lectures sometimes also relied on these sketchy proofs, which was somewhat frustrating. We also received very little feedback on problem sets, with almost half of them left ungraded until after we had taken the final exam.",
                "Several people I know in the course (including me) found lectures moved too slowly, and decided to learn exclusively from the textbook. The homework problems came from the textbook and didn't force you to really grapple with the material. Predictably, I didn't really internalize the material from this class---which lies on me---but I was not motivated/inspired to do so by the lectures.",
                "The material felt a little rushed toward the end; this could be mitigated by spending less time on the first chapter of the text. Overall a solid course.",
                "I thought the structure and pacing was good. I would have liked more feedback on problem sets I turned in.",
                "Strengths: Content didn't feel super difficult, Professor Kenyon is a nice guy\r\nWeaknesses: Couldn't understand lectures, probably better off reading the textbook than going to class. Didn't like how the class was structured. There was no ED discussion board to ask questions, barely any information about the exams (e.g. no practice exams, no idea what kind of questions would be on it, etc.). The worst part was that it was 9am in Watson Center and unrecorded -- that was unnecessarily painful",
                "The lectures are easy to understand and all concepts are explained pretty well in class, and the psets are of reasonable length. One slight problem is the book we are using has some typos and could have been a bit better organized, so I wish we used a more well-established textbook for the course.",

                "Strengths: Interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were disorganized, midterm and final did not feel like it actually tested what we had learned, only one of two ULAs was actually helpful, did not receive helpful feedback on homework (and homework took over a month to get back)",
                "Strengths: Prof. Kenyon cares about his students and keeps lectures relatively engaging. Homework was a good level of challenge and a good length (perhaps a little long took far longer than his suggested 3 hours a week to complete it).\r\nWeaknesses: The textbook is VERY dry but was honestly necessary to be able to understand the material. Often, the content did not make sense in the lecture at all, but would after reading the textbook.",
                "Strengths: manageable workload for a math class, fun material. Weaknesses: problem sets weren't graded until right before tests, and then were graded (mostly) on completion"

                "Yes; complex analysis is an important subject that has some pretty cool results even for a non pure-math major. Extending things to the complex plane (such as residue calculus) seems particularly useful, and there are nice connections to physics as well.",
                "Yeah, it was a pretty good math class  interesting results, not too hard to follow along. There were a few annoying psets (like lots of graphing functions or calculating coefficients for Laurent series, for example).",

                "Maybe, maybe not. On the one hand, of course complex analysis is a very interesting subject. On the other hand, if Dr. Kenyon is teaching, then the lectures will be not very different from the textbook chapters. I also walked away not feeling like I'd really learned much complex analysis overall. Fortunately, Dr. Kenyon is generous with homework extensions. Speaking of which, although there were a couple homeworks that were egregiously long, most of them were very fair considering how computational many of the problems are. That's another thing: the course was much more computational than I was expecting (though of course proofs are still there). This was also reflected in the exams, which ended up being more difficult than expected.",
                "Yes, its rather essential material that everyone should know, and its quite fun to learn. Its also not one of those courses that demands an unreasonable amount of time; you just do the homework each week which never took too long, and then prepared for the exam.",
                "If you're looking for an easy/low effort math class for a 5th or 6th credit, take this. If you want to learn a lot of math, you are probably better off self-studying the material and taking 315 instead.",

                "I'd recommend this course because the math has some neat, novel ideas that you don't really see anywhere else! But as a course, it wasn't great. If the math major ever changes to no longer have this as a core class, I wouldn't see a good reason to take it (unless you're specifically interested, in which case definitely do!).",
                "Would recommend to all math majors! Complex analysis is a truly beautiful subject and one that every math major should at least know the fundamentals of.",
                "Yes. I think Complex Analysis is a very cool subject and this course did a good job covering it. Might be nice to have taken 302 first (although I was fine without it) because a lot of the material is similar.",
                "Only if required or if interested in complex analysis, wasn't particularly interesting for me.",
                "Yes, it is a good introduction to complex analysis and helps you gain insight in any course that uses analysis.",
                "good intro course to complex analysis",
                "Yes, but with a different professor. The subject was great, and I appreciated a lot of the \"beauty\" that people talk about with this course. However, I felt that Kenyon's course administration was negligent in almost every way. There's about a dozen examples I could give, but here are a choice few:\r\n\r\nHomework grading was a joke. At least half of it was based on completion, and the other half contained cryptic or even outright wrong comments. Most homeworks were not graded for at least a month after they were submitted. The final three homeworks (out of ten!) were never graded at all. No answer keys were provided. So, there was functionally no feedback in the course.\r\n\r\nKenyon also seemed to enjoy screwing us on exams. After the midterm, he said \"based on what you've learned, I expected you to be able to do the first three problems.\" He did not give an explanation as to how we could've prepared for the other two problems, which required either pages of bashing (which Kenyon could not demonstrate upon request) or obscure magic tricks that only the math comp kids could figure out. So apparently understanding everything in the course only nets you a 60%. \r\n\r\nKenyon also gave us an ungraded homework 11 to do over reading period \"so that I can put this material on the final.\" The material in question was the most complicated and difficult of the whole semester, so we all spent a long time working through this homework and making sure we understood the concepts. Even Kenyon's final review session was mostly dedicated to going over the hw11. But of course, none of it was on the exam -- instead Kenyon opted for more of the obscure magic trick questions as a final \"screw you\".\r\n\r\nThere are many more things I would write about if I had the space. My feeling throughout the semester was that Kenyon is totally unaware of the consequences of his actions (or more often, his inaction). Seems that the people who actually need the help and support of a good prof really got left out this semester. Most of the top scorers in class never went to lecture, and our enrollment tripled on exam day. If you want a class where you work hard and are rewarded for it, please stay far away from Professor Kenyon.",
                "Yes! Beautiful math, breaks your brain a little but in a nice way.",
                "The content is kind of poorly taught. I felt really confused by certain topics, which I think aren't actually all that necessarily crucial to learning complex analysis. Maybe if taught through a different book, but Gamelin was a bit confusing at times, and the exams felt a bit too polarizing (questions were either trivial, or really tricky and difficult).",
                "Yes, it's definitely a great stepping stone for pure math majors interested in analysis, found it gutsy compared to other 300 classes",
                "With a different professor, yes. At moments throughout the course, I could see why I had heard complex analysis was great. I do not feel like the course helped me in seeing the greatness though. The lectures were pretty disorganized and sometimes hard to follow. I ended up reading every section of the book we went over and understood the material better. I think that many people did this as the class was at best 1/3 full during lecture. \r\n\r\nKenyon did not seem to care about how the general population were doing in the course. One day during an especially hard homework week, he asked how the homework was going. When someone responded \"awful\" he simply giggled and started lecture. \r\n\r\nAfter the midterm he stated that he based on what he had taught us, he expected us to be able to do the first 3 questions. There were 5 questions on the exam. So, he was expecting us to get 60% at best from his teaching. This was extremely frustrating as someone who went to class, read the book, and went to office hours as I was not one of the people who could just intuit the last two questions on the exam.\r\n\r\nHomework questions sometimes did not feel thought through. At one point Kenyon had to remove a question because he realized he hadn't taught us how to do it. Homework was not given back in a reasonable time frame. Before the midterm Kenyon stated that the exam would consist of homework 1-6 or all the homework up until that point that had been graded. Somewhere between 9pm-11pm the night before our 9am midterm homework 4-6 was graded. There was minimal feedback. Kenyon said that some of it was graded for completion. I realize this is possibly the graders fault but Kenyon graded both our midterm and final within 24 hours so I wish he would've helped on the homework grading.\r\n\r\nOur last homework was optional but was strongly encouraged because the material was fair game for the final. The final review session Kenyon held was largely over that homework. There were no questions on the final over this homework. I spent an entire day of reading period learning material that did not help me on the final at all. Yes, it was cool but it put an immense strain on me.\r\n\r\nWe had two ULAs for this course. One of them was extremely helpful (which was very needed on some homeworks) and the other sat there and did not answer anyone's questions. When this second ULA was holding office hours the room was silent as no one wanted to ask for help.",
                "Yes. If you want or need to take complex analysis, I'd take it with Kenyon. I did not understand the material during lectures and sometimes struggled to stay focused for the whole 75 minutes, but Kenyon cares about his students and his exams are fair game he doesn't try to trick you and truly wants you to have solid foundations. Complex analysis is interesting and the most I have enjoyed math since high school, however, I'm still not sure I fully understand it!",
                "I would recommend this class! It was very enjoyable with a decent workload on each problem set. I was not overwhelmed by the beauty of complex analysis as I was told I would be, but it was fun nonetheless."
