                "Strengths -- Jess and Janna are PHENOMENAL instructors. They care so deeply about the materials they present and the students of the class. The community they fostered over Zoom was like no other. I genuinely felt like I had made a connection with them and several of my classmates despite the fact that I had never met them in person. The instructors are incredibly discussion facilitators -- I always found it easy to contribute to the conversation. \r\nWeaknesses -- none!!",
                "strengths: Jess and Janna made every class so much fun and extremely knowledgeable about current issues and policies in early childhood education! I really enjoyed the guest speakers and weekly discussions. \r\nweaknesses: I wish we had received more feedback on the papers that we had written throughout the term. It was difficult to know what to work on without specific feedback.",
                "Strengths: Jess and Janna are the nicest people you'll meet and are committed to your learning about the field. \r\nWeaknesses: Things got a bit repetitive after awhile since it seemed to always go back to the same core issues and we didn't necessarily have new solutions. Maybe introduce the final project a little earlier + include peer revision?",
                "I thought that some of the strengths of this course were how the assignments and readings were structured, the instructors, and the class structure. I felt that all of these elements were able to combine in a way where I was able to learn from each reading and assignment and then in class learn from my peers and Janna and Jessica, the instructors. One of the areas that I thought could be a little different was the variety of the readings, especially in the first half. It felt like a lot of the readings hit on aspects of the same thing, which was good for reinforcement, but I think my understanding of the subject might have been benefitted by an article with a broader overview of the mechanics of the system. Funding was something I felt especially confused about the specifics of until a lot later in the course.",

The check-in activities they did really helped strengthen our class community.",

I think we focus so much on K-12 education and forget about the very important work happening in the early childhood education realm! If you are not an EDST Scholar, please take this class too! During the very first class, you will come to learn how much of an impact child care has had on your own life!",

The course did not give as much feedback on essays as I had hoped, but nevertheless was a very fun class.",
                "CW: gun violence, suicide, hate crimes\r\n\r\nYes! I learned a lot about a field I wouldn't have learned about elsewhere, and the fact that you're learning from two people who have worked in the field for decades is an unparalleled experience. The workload is super reasonable/manageable and your classmates are fun and kind. I hear there's weekly snacks when the class is taught in person soooo...! \r\n\r\nSomething that really stuck out to me this year was Jess and Janna's response after the shithole month that included the Atlanta spa shootings as well as Yale's own failures responding to a suicide on campus. We did a checkin like normal and everyone was feeling understandably terrible. They were really good at reading the Zoom room and let the checkin go on for longer than usual so we could talk about our feelings--much of which included grief, anger, frustration, etc. that we couldn't voice elsewhere. Instead of continuing class, they decided to give us the option to spend the rest of the two hours holding space for each other and talking about how we were feeling. We were also allowed to leave class early, and we made up the content in a future week. The space was really healing for myself and likely many classmates, and I appreciate that they were so flexible and empathetic to us, first seeing us as humans before anything else. I felt supported, loved, heard, and cared for--something that they're so good at doing every week.",
                "I would HIGHLY recommend this course to another student! It's one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. Anyone with an interest in the lives of children would find this course fascinating. For anyone with an interest in any level of the education system, this class is more than fascinating: it's essential. I didn't realize until taking this course how fundamental child care and early learning are to a child's outcomes and how inequalities in this early system create inequalities later on. Even if you do know those thing, this class is a great way to expand that knowledge. Additionally, Janna and Jessica are lovely.",
                "Yes! This is an important topic and the type of people who take this course are super cool.",
                "YES YES YES. Jess and Janna are gems and know so much about childcare and the workforce as a result of their work with All Our Kin. Such a pleasure to get to learn with them and exchange ideas.",
                "Yes, 100%! if you are at all interested in childhood, child development, education, early disparities in life, and/or policy relating to children this is such a good class for you."
