                "I learned about the Jesuits throughout history. Each week we learned about a different aspect of the Jesuits, such as their educational ministries, or one of their missions. We learned this through class discussions, research papers, and close readings of primary texts.",
                "I learned a lot about the Jesuits: their founding, their charism, and their global missions in the context of the early modern world.\r\nI developed the ability to read primary sources with an understanding of the historical context. Through the Op-Ed assignments, I learned how to relate the history we were learning to current events. I also developed my writing skills and the ability to communicate my ideas clearly.\r\nThis class was full of insights, the most striking of which was the fact that the Jesuit history is a living history. It was amazing to see the history we learned and the ideas we discussed come to life, in my own personal life, in the life of the Catholic Church, and even in the nation's present political life. Another insight I took away was the reality of \"mission\" as an integral part of the vocation of Catholics today.",
                "I became a much stronger writer. I learned how to better analyze texts, how to construct an argument, and how to debate with others. I learned about the impact of the Jesuits on the modern world. I also learned how history relates to today and why lessons from the Jesuits matter in current events.",
                "I learned about the badass Society of Jesus. Also, it helped me develop very effective research skills. I refined my knowledge of history and learned more about a group that (in my opinion) has been severely neglected by historians.",
                "We received an overview of the history of Jesuit Missions, both in Europe and across the world. We learned about the growth of educational structures and institutions (the massive landholdings in Brazil, for example). We also evaluated the efficacy of various missions, like Ricci in China.",
                "Through reading a variety of primary and secondary sources, I learned about the history of the Jesuits during the first centuries of their existence.  In addition to the course material, the written assignments (+feedback) greatly improved my writing.",
                "This course provided me with a solid background in the Counter-Reformation as well as theology, but the primary focus was on the global expansion of Catholicism through the Society of Jesus. My knowledge of this went from one sentence to a robust understanding of Jesuit education techniques and historical episodes. Not only this, but a better idea of how the modern world (especially colonial) was developing as well.",

                "Strengths: readings were engaging, Tom filled the time well with interesting activities, such as break out rooms, presentations, and discussions. We learned how to write a research paper and creatively include information in an op-ed. Tom was always willing to meet with students to go over any difficulties they were experiencing with the class\/papers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class ran smoothly with the discussions and Tom helped explain the important parts of each reading, but in the future it would be helpful to have time at the end of each class for him to quickly go over the most important parts of what we learned that week and how it ties into the general overview of the course and what we have already learned.",
                "The strengths of the course include the wonderful assortment of readings that were both fascinating and inspiring as well as the discussion format of our seminar. Rather than being a simple regurgitation of key facts from the readings, our seminar was a wellspring of new insights, perspectives, and ideas that encouraged us to engage more deeply with the texts. Obviously, being in person would have been fantastic, but I think our Zoom discussions were still top-notch.",
                "Stregnths: I loved the op-ed writing assignments. It was the most interesting and enjoyable writing assignment I have had in my four years as a history major. Additionally, the course discussions were engaging and lively. I always looked forward to coming to class, and I feel like I learned a lot.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses : Honestly, none! Sometimes there was a lot of reading, but that is part of a history course!",
                "Weaknesses: It's on Zoom\r\nStrengths: Awesome readings, material, and strong  (passionate) teacher leading discussions and raising questions in a neutral tone\r\nImprovement: A more comprehensive list of reading materials at the beginning of the semester. Sometimes books were listed as Yale Internet Sources, not a big deal but it would be helpful.",
                "The strength of the class was in its breadth. We spent each week focusing on a different location\/aspect of the missions. Because it was once a week, if we got sidetracked in a class, we would end up just not covering that area as much as we would otherwise. A further strength was the passion of both the instructor and the students. I have infrequently seen instructors as immersed in the area in which they study as Mr. Santa Maria. He clearly has a deep passion for the Jesuits and the history of early modern Catholicism. I cannot praise him highly enough for his teaching this semester.",
                "The course offered strong primary source material every week. This is a beautiful way to structure a seminar, and much harder to do in a pre-industrial time period. Moreover, the topics discussed were always varied and engaging, especially when we were assigned a book that our instructor knew to be controversial and most of us rejected its claim. The amount of writing in the course was perfect, and the feedback was very swift and detailed. He spoke to me individually about my interests and writing at least four times. One weakness of the course is that I simply wanted more time to meet, despite our instructor's generous office hours. Some of the seminar time was taken up by reviewing the quiz answers and other logistical matters which could be done by email in the future.",
                "Strengths: incredibly interesting historical subject matter, and the course was run in an intellectually stimulating yet not over-burdening way.\r\nWeaknesses: there are certain topics which could have been given more attention (such as the dissolution of the Jesuits). The course is a global survey course, and sometimes it can seem that a highly interesting or complex area\/issue is not given the time or attention that it deserves for that reason. But, this is a minor weakness in the scope of the course."

Additionally, making the final project due earlier actually helped us better budget time for overloaded schedules. The one COVID-19 adjustment which I disliked (other than being online itself) was the use of breakout rooms. They took up too much time and didn't allow us to be directed in discussion."

                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This course was the best one I've taken at Yale. The reading material was fascinating and inspiring, and our class discussions were very fruitful. I came away with new insights every class, both from the professor and from my classmates. In the writing assignments, I had the liberty to form my opinions and defend them, and the feedback I received encouraged me to hone my arguments and sometimes, to re-evaluate my stances. This was a true humanities course that was neither plagued by political ideologies nor constrained by a narrow Marxist reading of history.",

                "Of course!!!! This course is awesome for an number of reasons, including the teacher and the material itself. The Society of Jesus, although perhaps dry on paper, really did redefine the modern world. Although most students are Catholic, the teacher does an excellent job grounding the material for everyone.",
                "I would recommend any class that Tom Santa Maria teaches, and I mean that sincerely. That man has a passion for his area of expertise that is heartening. He also had a way of making the history of the Church feel alive (I am sure it helped that most of the students were Catholics). One small example, he would preface any message he sent to a class wishing us a happy feast day of whichever saint's feast day it was. I would also recommend the course as a topic and study, as the course was well structured and the readings relevant.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  I think that it improved my writing skills, presentation skills, and ability to productively contribute to a seminar.  In addition, this course including surprising insights about modern society, despite the pre-industrial subject matter.",
                "I would recommend this course in the highest of terms. I absolutely loved this class, and it has frankly been one of my favorite history classes at Yale. Professor SantaMaria managed to make a seemingly distant topic feel engaging and related to current political social and educational questions. The Jesuits themselves are also rich and complex historical subjects. Their accomplishments, failures, and nuances made them extremely compelling subjects to study, and provided important moments for group and personal reflection.",
                "I would certainly recommend this class to other students. The combination of rich historical detail with strong narratives is what the best history courses at Yale should be about. If you are at all interested in empire, colonialism, or religion, this class will be extremely informative.",
                "Yes. This course is excellent for those wishing to examine a highly interesting, under-studied area that is gaining traction in recent historical scholarship."
