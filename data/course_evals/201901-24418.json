   "comments": [
    "I think this course does an amazing job of closely covering the grammatical devices of Spanish which are often overlooked or ignored in other high-level Spanish courses (and even in non-high-level ones). While I had at some point learned some of the material before the class, what I think the course did really well was teach me why the grammatical rules function the way they do and it monumentally improved my understanding of the Spanish language in a really cool and enlightening way.\r\n\r\nI think it could improve by teaching students to speak the language better, as grammar applies in speech as well, but the course (likely due to time constraints) focuses more on writing and reading.",
    "distribution of work is pretty good, but some days are busier than others. sometimes class is slow when all youre doing is correcting homework",
    "Our professor made it so comfortable and easy for students to speak, even if they were very unsure of whether or not what they were saying was correct. It was really helpful to have such a safe space, but also to know that any mistakes we made would be corrected.",
    "It was well taught and had good content."

   "comments": [
    "For students who would like to gain a stronger grammatical understanding of the Spanish language, absolutely yes.\r\n\r\nFor students who feel like they already have a strong understanding of the ins and outs of the Spanish language, you probably do not need to take it. I think the class prepares you very well for future Spanish courses, however.",
    "yes, i felt i learned a lot about grammar and the way the material was presented was effective",
    "Absolutely. It was a great way to practice my Spanish and learn about different advanced grammar concepts, and the professor was wonderful.",
    "Yes!"
