                "Strengths: Maria is an incredible teacher and was DEFINITELY the biggest strength of the course. She always had a good lesson plan and activities for us to do which consistently kept the class engaged and interested. \r\nWeaknesses: I feel like a lot of people will say this and I do agree a bit: the book doesn't include vocab lists or anything in English. In some ways, this is actually a pretty helpful way to teach foreign language. For me, I learned very well with it. But I can see for others who prefer the lists and direct translations that this could be a potential weakness.",
                "The Prof does not overwhelm students with vocabulary and incorporates learning how to speak and read the language into the curriculum too. The only downside is that the textbook does not have any English in it (but in class we define all the vocab words anyway so it's not a terrible issue).",
                "Strengths: Teacher is fantastic, material is not overwhelming, high retention rate of content covered. Weaknesses: the textbook is somewhat confusing and hard to understand at times",
                "Strengths are the pacing, the level of interaction and engagement during class, and the flexibility of the instructor in adapting lesson plans to how students are learning the material. \r\n\r\nOne thing that could be improved is assigning more homework, to ensure students get more reading and writing experience on their own.",
                "Biggest strength is the professor! She is so extremely kind, warm, patient, and fun. It's a real joy to walk into class and see her everyday."

Maria will make it worth your time, and you learn so much! The workload is also not insane like some other language courses, and I feel it teaches just as much.",
                "Yes! I've always disliked language classes but this class is taught in such a way where students actually learn the language and internalize it.",
                "Yes absolutely - this is the only language class I've ever taken that I have thoroughly enjoyed",
