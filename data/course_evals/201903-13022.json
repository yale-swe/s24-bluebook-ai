   "comments": [
    "My writing improved tremendously by taking this course. I learned how to write essays incorporating multiple texts, research papers, and personal reflections. This course is great for learning how to grow from a more basic high school style of writing to an elevated, academic college style. Although this course was a writing credit, we explored unique texts in class that fostered interesting discussions. Our class conversations caused me to think more critically about close reading and author's purpose.",
    "I learned much more about how to connect my evidence to my argument and not assume the reader is making the same connections I am making.",
    "I greatly improved upon my close reading abilities, as a large focus of this class is to identify tensions within a piece of writing. I noticed this personal improvement not only in class discussions by also in my own writing. Additionally, I had the opportunity to work on crafting of arguments. For all of the papers, it was necessary that we articulate and construct an argument either from one, two, or several sources. Writing the third paper was especially challenging but allowed me to grow as a writer. This paper was a long research paper about a topic of our choosing, but it was required that we construct our own argument based on the sources we interacted with. I learned a lot from this assignment about how to combine the skills necessary for writing a research paper and those for an argumentative paper.",
    "Early in this course, I was introduced to close-reading as a way of analyzing text, and crafting my own essays. I spent a good deal of time practicing identifying the claims\/tensions of selected texts and  and practicing clearly presenting our own points in writing. This course armed me with a new set of tools to use during my editing\/revision process. \r\nMy greatest gains were in my editing\/revision process. I developed skills to use during independent edits as well as ways to hold more productive peer reviews. We spent a good deal of time working in groups, exploring each others writing, and discussing what our peers did\/did not see in our writing.",
    "I developed advanced writing skills that have improved my overall writing.",
    "This course helped me hone analytical skills such as careful examination of literary texts and rigorous creation of logical arguments. This course also helped me realize many common misconceptions and errors in everyday writing such as redundancies and logical breaks in sentence construction.",
    "I learned to put aside the formulas\/structures that were taught to me in high school and make my own strategic decisions about how to lay out my argument. Every aspect of my writing has improved after taking this course, and I even started reflecting more on my own relationship with religion."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: great class discussions, responsive professor with excellent feedback, interesting texts, wide range of assignments \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: really minor, but having feedback on the first essay before turning it in would have been great",
    "Strengths: The amount of feedback I received from my instructor was great. I had very specific advice given to me which enhanced my writing a great deal.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I believe more office hours should be given in this course.",
    "The four paper assignments themselves are definitely a strength of the class. I am grateful to have been exposed to a wide variety of types of essays, from research papers to personal narratives. While I did enjoy the readings from the class, I would have appreciated been able to read more from the secular perspective. The class is called \"The Sacred and the Secular,\" so I expected to read things from both sides, but it was almost exclusively from the perspective of religious individuals.\r\n\r\nI also think some of the deadlines could have been shifted, so we had more time to do rough drafts, annotated bibliographies, and prepare for presentations, instead of having too much time for revisions.",
    "This course had very strong reading selections. My favorites were Kathryn Lofton's \"Consuming Religion\", Saba Mahmood's \"Feminist Theory, Embodiment, and the Docile Agent\", and Langston Hughes \"Salvation\". These texts, among others, served to present new ideas and demonstrate writing techniques that inspire me to continue to refine my skills.",
    "The main strength of the course was the amount of clear feedback received from the teacher. A weakness in the course would be the lack of diversity in the type of material covered. It could be improved by including a wide variety of religious text that touch on different subjects.",
    "I engaged with the course material and was therefore able to provide insight into relevant readings and reflections. I believe my personal analysis and argument were rigorous and defensible. I may have, however, struggled to convey my arguments in their full complexities through my writing which could have been accomplished with more time."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this course! The content of the course is interesting by itself, but having class discussions with individuals holding varied perspectives was really fascinating. The course is definitely a challenge, but the feedback offered by Professor Baynes-Ross will help you improve a great deal. This course helped me write in ways that I hadn't previously thought possible, and has really helped my writing for other courses here.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to enhance your writing, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who wants to bring his or he academic writing to a more sophisticated level and who is interested in the subjects of secularity, religious fullness, etc.",
    "Indeed, I would. This exercises and readings in this course enabled me to develop my writing and work to communicate more clearly. I was given stellar writing samples and ample time to sit and think about how I could take my writing to the next level. The classroom discussions were a place where I was challenged to think deeply and analyze the texts, as well as to respond to the points of my peers.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it provides a challenging course that improves your writing.",
    "If the student has a natural curiosity towards discussion on religion and secularism and a natural inclination for writing, this course does an effective job at combining these two interests. If the student has these two qualities, I would recommend this course. If the student does not care for discussions on religion and secularism, they may not find this course an appropriate fit.",
    "Absolutely. I was initially really hesitant to take this course, as I just wanted an easy writing credit. This class has changed my mindset about writing, and it has greatly improved my research and communication skills. Every aspect of my writing has improved, and I've even started thinking more critically about my own relationship with religion. I was always engaged in class discussions and Professor Baynes-Ross created a great environment where everyone felt comfortable sharing their opinions about a potentially controversial topic."
