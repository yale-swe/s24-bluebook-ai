                "The daily discourse was nice when it was about current events. When it was about random thought leaders or pick your own leader it kinda fell apart. The lecture portion didn't seem to really cover much as it was presented by the students. I didn't get much from the lectures, most of the info came from the student readers which many times don't actually have information in them as they expect the topic to be taught via lecture.",
                "I really enjoyed the daily discourses and guest speakers. I thought our class discussions allowed us to make use of the Air Force curriculum in a way that is actually meaningful - which is not how I have felt about all AF classes. Perhaps a little more time doing things like case studies would be good.",
                "The strengths of this course lie in the many great discussions we had, whether it was daily discourse or sharing our personal experiences, the conversations were always intellectually stimulating.",
                "Strengths: \r\nthe best AS course so far; very flexible and engaging, creative and informal; covers a lot of ground, and Maj Moen incorporates engaging and dynamic material into the course for an enhanced learning experience\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nclearer expectations with the first and second assignments (fixed for 3rd and 4th though)",
                "Strengths include that it was much different from previous AS classes and I actually learned quite a bit of real-world insight and going-ons as well as how that connected to Air Force values and goals. However, a possible weakness is that, especially because this class is not even considered a credit at Yale, there was more work than I think it necessarily entails. Often, I spent more time on this class than I did in my other classes. While I learned so much more this semester, it also became a point of stress for a little bit. I think in the future clearly state that this class will be much more work and/or reduce the amount of outside-of-class assignments that are required each week."
