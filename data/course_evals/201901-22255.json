    "I learned how to approach the field of ethnomusicology in both reading a wide range of pieces from the field, but also from doing my own field work as a part of the final project. Having a small seminar and such engaging topics in music to discuss made each class interesting and worthwhile.",
    "I learned a lot about the anthropology of music and how to read and understand enthnographies",
    "This course allowed us to examine the role of people who make music in the music itself, and how various human factors such as culture, language, and tradition shape the music that a given people produces, and how those who listen to it relate to these musical practices."

   "comments": [
    "If youre hoping to take typical world music class, this isnt it. This class is more about the world of ethnomusicology, topics in ethnomusicology, and involves a personal engagement with the field.",
    "This course was able to be many different things at the same time. There was discussion of more technical musical concepts while also adding an anthropological element to the studies of music. The course allowed students to focus on different elements like writing, independent research, and leading class discussions all within one seminar course."

    "I would highly recommend any class that Professor Moore teaches, whether or not you think youd be interested in the topic itself. Professor Moore will make it interesting, engaging, and honestly seems to know everything and everyone under the sun in this field. She is a brilliant academic and Yale is lucky to have her.",
    "Absolutely, Prof Moore is amazing and it was a really wonderful and intimate way to approach and think about music in a non-technical context",
    "If the student legitimately enjoyed readings and discussions, I'd wholly recommend the class to them. Those who detest active participation or actually attending class would do well to steer clear of this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in or would like to know more about the more human aspects of the process of making music."
