   "comments": [
    "I had read a lot of short stories in Spanish before taking this course, but I'd had very little exposure to Spanish plays, poems, or essays. I increased my comprehension, reading speed, and speaking abilities. I also learned about history and politics, not to mention a of technical poetry terms.",
    "Knowledge of short stories, poems, and other texts; intertextuality; utilizing secondary sources in Spanish for writing paper(s)",
    "I developed a better ability to read Spanish literature and analyze works in Spanish.",
    "I learned to analyze pieces of literature in a better fashion and also improved my communication skills since the class was a seminar.",
    "During this course, I improved my skills in reading, writing, and speaking in Spanish. Given the literary focus of the class, I also improved my literature interpretation skills.",
    "This course offered a broad introduction to Spanish literary tradition through the study of poetry, essays, drama, and short stories. I learned a bit about literary conventions, the politics and society of various Spanish-speaking nations, and the broad analysis of literature. I also learned how to write a thesis-driven literary essay that draws on the analysis of other scholars.",
    "I got to read a breadth of Hispanic literature. I improved my analytical writing in Spanish.",
    "I developed an understanding of the different types of literature in the Spanish language.",
    "Ability to analyze Spanish literature.",
    "Learned a lot of crucial information for the analysis of literature, poetry, and theatre in Spanish. Also great practice for composition in Spanish, especially if you have little prior experience in writing longer works",
    "I learned to use Spanish in a more academic context as opposed to more everyday use Spanish that I learned in high school. I also think that I developed a lot as a writer in Spanish and improved my ability to communicate my thoughts about literature in Spanish"

   "comments": [
    "This course was very dynamic. I liked the variety of assignments we had, although the quizzes could be brutal (especially the one on poetry--that was basically a midterm's worth of material). I do wish we had the opportunity to write a paper between the first unit and the final. Also, I would have preferred a shorter poetry unit, but that is a personal preference.",
    "First year seminar! So good for ensuring that class will be engaging! Syllabus was good, assignments were fair and opportunities for learning... solid course",
    "Its strengths are covering a wide range of genres and authors in Spanish literature. The class discussions were particularly interesting and were the foundation of the class. It was a great class, and I'm not sure how it could be improved. I enjoyed the fun activities of writing a parody of a poem or acting out a scene, so maybe a couple more things like that would be fun and engaging.",
    "One of the strengths of this course was definitely the professor. She was always open to new ideas and never turned down anyone's opinions. She made the whole class feel comfortable even if our Spanish wasn't the best. I also enjoyed all the readings and felt that they all kept students engaged and the seminars felt pretty laid-back which was nice. I seriously can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "Since this was a first-year course, there was a steep learning curve given the difficulty of the course and adjusting to college. Besides this, the course was a really great high-level Spanish class that helped my writing and reading skills a lot.",
    "I enjoyed many of the course readings and their broad distribution over different eras of Spanish literature. I wonder, however, if seeking to include works from many different time periods caused us to lose our focus. While I truly loved most of the readings, I ended up losing my excitement for the course due to the rushed feeling of the reading schedule (around four literary works a week). It is not a problem of work loadI was happy to read a lot, and really enjoyed the few times where we read a sustained work (a play or novel). The poetry unit was much better in terms of focus, as we read groups of poems from the same time period. However, I found the memorization of countless poetic terms and the counting of syllables to be less conducive to learning than discussion-based analysis of meaning could have been. Professor Harkema is a true expert in her field and clearly passionate about Spanish literature, and always willing to help with essays and general understanding (go to office hours!!). There were times, however, when the expectations for the course were unclear. I found the tests hard to study for due to a lack of explanation about what would be covered. I also wonder if testing students on literary definitions and syllable-counting is the best way to provide an introduction of Spanish literature at the level of a first-year seminar. A focus on more literature from the Spanish-speaking world outside Spain would also make the course stronger (I know there are possibly constraints due to the desire to represent literature from the Renaissance to now, but more modern work would be very welcome).",
    "strengths--readings chosen, very open ended writing assignments. weaknesses--too many texts chosen that they were only very briefly discussed. Would rather have less texts and deeper engagement with those texts rather than discussing an entire novel in 2 days.",
    "I think the scope of this course is far too broad. By being a survey course, you lose track of literary timeline. There is simply too wide a range of works. This course should narrow its scope to being a survey from some date, such as 1800.",
    "Course design keeps students engaged, but some of the texts are a little inaccessible for students who dont have a very expansive Spanish vocabulary. Definitely manageable but requires some extra effort",
    "The strength of the course was that it was very non judgemental, I felt like I could speak in class and even if I made lots of grammar errors Professor Harkema would just help me say what I meant rather than judging or shaming me. I also thought it was really interesting that we were able to do literary analysis with books in Spanish because I'd never gotten the chance to do that before. The weakness of the course is that a lot of the texts felt old and white male centric. I would have appreciated some more modern works + works by women and non-white authors."

   "comments": [
    "Even though the material is tough, the class environment (which I credit both to the group of students and to Professor Harkema) made the class very accessible, even for less confident speakers. If you're interested in Spanish literature and want a seminar class, I'd definitely recommend this course. Professor Harkema is fantastic and the material is very interesting. You will also push yourself out of your comfort zone by learning so many different types of literature.",
    "Yes, especially if you need to get your L5 credit done - this is a great way to meet other first-years and read and think about a lot of cool Spanish texts",
    "Yes, I would. It was a great L5 course that was interesting and greatly helped my ability to speak with it being discussion-based and my ability to write scholarly in a different language. I also would recommend it for the small class size and the opportunity to meet other first-years",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student simply because of the professor. I thought she was amazing at conducting seminars. I also felt that it was a good way for me to keep close ties with my Spanish.",
    "I would not take this course (as it currently stands) again, and would recommend it only to another student who has a VERY deep interest in Spanish literature and sees this as the Spanish course most interesting to them that is offered at the time. I would like to emphasize again that Professor Harkema is amazing, well-intentioned, and always happy to help. The structure of the course, however, is not ideal. I signed up for it because I love Spanish literature and thought I would be able to read and discuss it with a group of other students who share that love. I found myself, however, in a class that was a strange mixture of lecture and discussion, memorizing formulaic terms and feeling as if the classwork was a chore. The course had many good parts, but I feel as if I could have found more enjoyment and learning from another Spanish class. It also might just be me, but I really found the confusion of the test and assignment expectations as factors that detracted from my learning.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Hispanic literature\/getting their distributional requirement out of the way first year. Would also recommend to someone who wants to get a breadth of texts in Hispanic literature in order to decide what to study more in depth later.",
    "If you have never taken a literature class before and are looking for an L5 to start off your Spanish career at Yale, this is a great option.",
    "If you are interested in reading and analyzing Spanish literature, then yes. It was an interesting course and Professor Harkema is very kind and helpful. However, the reading can be tough, so if you have difficulty reading in Spanish, make sure you are willing to struggle a little and put in some more time on the readings. I found that getting through the readings could be difficult, but because we discussed them in class it was still manageable to succeed in the class if I paid attention and kept up with the work."
