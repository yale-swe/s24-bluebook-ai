It was a small seminar so we were really able to engage with our classmates in discussion about the material that covered all sorts of topics including disabilities, mental illness, malaria and epidemic diseases, and les Algues Vertes, which allowed me to become more comfortable speaking and understanding the language. Professor Tertrain is a fantastic professor who cares about all of his students!",
