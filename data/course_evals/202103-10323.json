Dr. Robinson is a great guy and gave me great feedback on how to improve my writing.  If you focus, you will learn how to write well in your own style.  Death to the five-paragraph essay!",

If you want an A, you can get one.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: One studentwho I will not name in the interest of making whoever evaluates these evaluations job easierdominated all class discussions by spouting absolute nonsense.  Dr. Robinson, bless his heart, put up with it (and even encouraged it at times), which I thought took away from what we could discuss as a class.",

Professor Robinson's section is a gem in the ENGL 114 sections, the material (especially the Supreme Court cases and the discussions of obscenity law) is fascinating, and Professor Robinson cares deeply about you and your learning. Engage with Professor Robinson in class, go to his office hours and learn more about him, the course, and his advice about writing. THIS IS A GREAT COURSE, AND A GREAT ENGL 114 specifically. TAKE IT! \r\n\r\nProfessor Robinson has put together a great syllabus, will help you become a better writer, and will introduce you to the rigors of writing courses at Yale College. This is a great introduction to writing here, and Professor Robinson's sections are the best of the ENGL 114s.",
                "Absolutely.  If I was stuck on a desert island and could only take one thing, I would take Dr. Timothy Robinson so we could discuss obscenity law at length and write some *bomb* papersin the sand presumable, as there would be nothing to write on.  Maybe we could stack rocks and make an exciting enough thesis for an overpassing plane to stop and save us.",
                "Yes, it teaches you good writing principles.",
                "Yes, it is a good introduction to college writing. It covers a wide range of different writers and writing styles and improves your writing.",
