The most difficult part was completing the same volume of reading between Monday and Wednesday that we were assigned between Wednesday and Monday - I think reducing the reading load during the week would be my main recommendation for an improvement.\r\n\r\nThe best part of the class was the workshop element - I enjoyed sharing my work and getting feedback from my classmates, as well as hearing their writing and giving my own feedback in return. It's a great way to get exposed to other styles of writing in Hebrew, and also practice a different kind of Hebrew conversation than you find in other classes.",
                "Strengths: workshopping, dynamic learning style, ability to write creatively in different mediums \r\nWeaknesses: no weaknesses stand out to me other than there being a lot of work but it was a great course.",
                "The course setting and structure is a major strength. Being quite small made it easy to connect with peers and with the professor (who is also incredible!). The course is structured such that there are a few weeks of reading, then a week of writing, and then a week of presenting/discussing. This structure was very helpful as it kept everything moving at a set pace and expectations were very clear. Feedback was also excellent. The only slight weakness was some of the homework didn't always feel particularly helpful. But overall, an amazing course!"

You don't need prior experience in creative writing, although if you are an avid creative writer you do get the option to modify and translate a piece you've written in a different language to fit the assignment so I imagine that could be a timesaver.",
                "Yes definitely it is a great Hebrew class with opportunities to read a lot and work on creative writing in hebrew.",
                "Yes, absolutely! This class was often the highlight of my day/week. Discussions were always great, and it was just fun. There didn't seem to be a lot of pressure, yet by the end my Hebrew improved significantly, and I feel like I got so much out of this class."
