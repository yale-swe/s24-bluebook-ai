                "Surface level understanding of FMEA topics that probably should have been taught years ago. An understanding of how to interact with a company in the research setting. How to schedule, complete, and document, a research project.",
                "From lecture: nothing that I should not have already known. \r\nFrom my project: a decent amount.",
                "We learned how to make spreadsheets for budgets and to account for interest and inflation. We learned how to make some decision making matrices. We learned what certain valves and switches do. Learned about several historical engineering disasters and vaguely how they happened. Also learned what gant charts are. We learned about using an Arduino kit. That is everything I can think of for the entire semester (just lectures). I learned much more about manufacturing and design while actually working on our project but most of that came from Nick in the machine shop or our own research.",
                "I wanted to learn a lot from this class but I don't think I learned very much, even though this course was very time-consuming and I put a lot of effort into it.",
                "The knowledge I got from this class can be divided into three categories.    \r\n1. In the technical category, I learned about manufacturing techniques, including laser-cutting and woodworking; material selection; and design with a focus on manufacturing.    \r\n2. In the procedural category, I learned about concept generation; concept evaluation; project management and organization; budgeting; and ordering parts, especially through McMaster.    \r\n3. Perhaps most of all, I learned a lot about communication. For this class, I had to communicate with a variety of parties (my teammates, the teaching staff, and the client), in a variety of ways (in-person meetings, emails, written reports, presentations, etc.). There was definitely a learning curve to all of this, and I think my improved ability to communicate was one of my biggest takeaways from this class. One particular insight was that for this class, more communication with the teaching staff was almost always better.",
                "The lecture part of the course is (supposed to be?) a broad overview course for mechanical engineering. It gives tastes of different topics across engineering such as ethics, material selection, budget, etc. But it is just a taste. The lectures don't go into depth on any one topic and are very hand-wavey, making it much better suited as a freshman intro class to mechanical engineering. It's disappointing that this is the class for fourth-year students.\r\n\r\nOn the project side of the class, the knowledge and skills developed will really depend on the project that you get and the advisor that you have. It makes for an awkward split in the class with half of the students having lots of hands-on experience, engagement, and fruitful projects with Dr. Datye and the other half of the students being confused and frustrated and not understanding the project they are given.",
                "This course has provided me with a better understanding of the business side of engineering and the balances that must be achieved when working on a design project. The specific project I am on has taught me a lot about industry and allowed me to practice various materials science areas. I have been able to look at how one may improve a setup to recreate real conditions as close as possible."

                "One of the biggest strengths is obviously working with a real company on a real engineering problem. This is the most substantial and real world engineering experience you can get without working an internship over the summers. There is quite a bit of debate over how the groups were decided on for each project. Some people were very unhappy.",
                "A weakness of this course is that it just feels like a filler course for the abet required topics. Because of this, we spend no significant amount of time on learning any one thing and the lectures feel insubstantial compared to the projects we're working on. I think the lessons learned during this class should be taught much earlier in the curriculum, and leave this class for actually discussing topics that we will use on our projects, such as advanced engineering design concepts, design for manufacturability, parts and hardware selection, more advanced stress\/fatigue\/cycle analysis for more complex mechanisms, etc.\r\n\r\nI didn't mind making slides every two weeks to keep instructors updated, but all of the design reports felt like nearly pointless filler work, with many of the categories not applicable to all teams, and our team spending more time trying to write anything down we could to fill out a report rather than actually work on our project. Additionally, the grading for them was unclear, and ended up being harsher than was implied by the rubric, which didn't really have anything specific on it. If these are to remain, I think they should be shorter, a little more open ended, and a completion grade.",
                "The problems with this course lie both with the content and the instruction. First and foremost, the content is elementary and should have been covered in well-taught 185 and 325 courses. Ideation, pugh matrices, gantt charts, motors and pneumatics, should all be covered in freshman year in 185. Materials selection and failure theories should be covered in 325. Arduino and 3D printing are already covered elsewhere in the curriculum. Students from our year do not know how to make, dimension, or tolerance engineering drawings properly -- but this is not covered in our current curriculum either -- we will graduate without it. Engineering economics and engineering ethics should each be a mandatory half-semester class. The fact that any of these topics are covered in the senior design class demonstrates the organizational shortcomings of the major, its sequencing, teaching, and rigor.\r\n\r\nInstead the class should cover advanced topics, including systems engineering and engineering management (explaining how team projects are organized at large companies), control and quality systems, IQA, verification vs. validation, different ISO certifications, the fine details or working with suppliers and subcontractors. Toward the end of the semester, Dr. Booth asked us about the strength and weaknesses of the class, and multiple students raised the concern of topics being basic, to which he responded, \"what is an example of an advanced topic.\" We do not know, because we have not been taught them. Whoever is in charge of the curriculum should look to the curricula of leading institutions (MIT, Stanford, Michigan), and see what topics they cover in their advanced seminars. They should not be asking the students, who frankly do not know the expanse of what they have not been exposed to. \r\n\r\nThis difficulty of students understanding whether or not they have received high-quality teaching unfortunately casts a shadow over the entire course-review based system. The lectures that Dr. Booth gives are not very carefully planned, are usually surface-level, and do not always demonstrate a mastery of the material by the lecturer. Dr. Booth is clearly knowledgeable and I am sure a capable researcher and engineer, but teaching is an entirely separate skill, one that does not come easily nor always yield to effort or support from non-engineering poorvu 'teaching experts.' Moreover, students in his projects may feel that their projects are sufficiently advanced and well-run because they require and reward effort, but they do not require or reward thought. Not all mechanical engineering projects need to be materials- or research-focused, but if they involve mechanical design and product design, then they should also do the work of market analysis, tolerance analysis, manufacturing analysis, that is, take advantage of the relative simplicity of the project to engage with more advanced topics. \r\n\r\nThe fact that we are students with limited knowledge means that more than anything we do not know what we do not know. That means that it is very important for the professors to clearly define the scope of the project for the students, because students should be told what is expected of them. Students without experience who choose their own scope can easily end up doing very basic work because they are not expected to push themselves, to learn and teach themselves new topics. \r\n\r\nIn summary, the course must be improved against a trusted benchmark - a new professor, highly regarded by their peers, and students. Dr. Booth cannot be expected or allowed to improve himself because he is not a quality of teacher who can be, as he is now, in charge of the entire mechanical design curriculum of the department. This may seem harsh, but I urge all mechanical engineering professors and relevant administrators to sit through the final presentations at the end of Spring semester. If these are all projects that you would brag about to colleagues in industry, then I retract my words",
                "The chicken coup Arduino project felt like entirely a waste of time considering that we had no intentions of using Arduino and our group already had experience working together. The project was the worst combination of too easy to encourage actual creativity and learning and too time consuming to waste our time. The rest of the assignments were not that much better, often asking about things that we had already accomplished or asking for us to circle back and make diagrams and drawings for designs we had already made. \r\n\r\nThe lectures are not much better, only using 1 of the 4 hours we have a week to vaguely go over random engineering related topics. I have encountered the same problems with this lecturer as in previous classes, namely that he will teach us what things are but not how to actually use them or how they are relevant in the big picture. For that reason, the lectures were mostly useless. Most of the actual learning happened in the machine shop or wherever we we designing and building our prototypes as a group. Which again, the assignments in the class took time away from.",
                "My group's client company is supportive and helpful. Nick, Kevin, and Pete are very helpful and knowledgeable. However, working with Dr. Booth and the TAs is frustrating. Expectations are unclear and pertinent information often isn't communicated in a timely manner. My time isn't respected in this class. I didn't learn very much.",
                "I wish that the lecture component taught us specific design skills that we don't learn anywhere else (like FEA, etc). I also wish that there were more opportunity for collaboration across groups, or at the very least to know what our peers are working on before the final presentaiton.",
                "I like the overall structure of the course, with 3-4 person teams and external clients. I also liked that the structure of about 1 hour of lecture and 3 hours of reserved work time per week. I liked how available the teaching staff and support staff were, and how responsive they often were to our questions.\r\nOne weakness was that the projects varied widely in the breadth and specificity of their scopes. I sometimes felt that the class tried to hold all the projects to a similar schedule of deliverables, even though this timeline was a better fit for some projects than others. Also, the lectures sometimes felt a little disconnected from the projects, which is partly due to the sheer number of different topics this class is supposed to cover.",
                "This course has a lot of weaknesses and its saving strength is the potential of what this class COULD be. As a senior design class, the potential for this class to showcase and enhance the students' learning is astronomical, but it falls incredibly flat. The lectures are sporadic in their content and don't lend themselves well in aligning with the students needs during the course. Also the fact that no student is able to propose their own senior design project is ridiculous. This is a senior capstone class. All other engineering schools let students choose their own project because it should be a reflection of the students' own work, creativity, and curiosity. This is an incredibly frustrating course and I hope that fixing this becomes a priority for everyone involved.",
                "I think something this course could use is a greater focus on reviewing and expanding upon project-specific concepts. While the review of concepts like a HoQ and design generation concepts is nice, I feel this belongs more in mechanical design. Reviewing concepts that apply to our specific projects (e.g. material property meaning and analysis) and going in-depth more than in other courses would be more beneficial. Furthermore, I think some class time practicing activities, while intended to be helpful and allow us to make progress on reports, could overall be used more effectively as time on projects and prototyping."

                "Its hard to say. On the one hand, I really enjoyed the opportunity to work on a group project with an external client, and Im proud of the work weve done. I think the mechanical engineering major, as a whole, doesnt teach enough hands-on skills, and this class helped address that deficit. On the other hand, this class can completely take over your semester if you let it. The workload is very high, and it could be stressful at times, particularly towards the end of the semester.",
                "No I would not recommend this course. The structure of project formulation and student engagement with this should be radically reformatted. Senior mechanical engineering students should be able to choose their own projects and be part of the project formulation process. Yale prides itself on student-centered education. This class should be no different.",
