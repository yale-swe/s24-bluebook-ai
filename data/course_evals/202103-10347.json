                "I learned both how to read creative nonfiction through the lens of writing, watching out for certain techniques and moves. I also learned how to write slower and more clearly. Even further, I learned how to read classmates' writing and critique it.",
                "I learned how to write and read the modern essay through example essays and writing my own.",
                "This course taught me not only to be a better writer, but also how to analyze texts, evaluate our human experience, and discuss this all in a culturally competent, inclusive manner.",

                "I learned to reflect critically about my thoughts and to then effectively communicate it into short essays. Because this class requires shorter 4-5 page essays, students have the time to revise thoroughly and therefore focus on their command of language and complexity of thought. Because these are shorter essays, we are writing essays that do not have to have complete and solid conclusions, but more essays that introduce conversation about a critical thought (which I think is more approachable than the former)."

                "This class is as excellent as everyone claims. If you do all the readings (which on a day to day level is not that intensive) and writings (which is to be fair quite high as compared to other courses), you can get an immense amount out of this class, even if it is just more confidence in your writing skills.\r\nThere is the problematic bit about reading David Foster Wallace, who is both a genius and an abuser. Not sure if removing him would be an improvement, but maybe even an acknowledgement of that...",
                "I liked being able to read my peer's work in the workshop phase. I would have preferred stricter deadlines for work-shoppers, since many students submitted work 1-2 days late to the class, when there were only 2-3 days to edit\/write feedback. This made it difficult to give valuable insight and feedback since I was pressed for time.",
                "This course was one of my favorites that Ive taken at Yale. Although it was quite intensive, it was well-organized and the content was always engaging. It really made you think about your place in the world and learn how to convey that through your writing.",
                "strengths- read a lot and a large variety of essays from different authors, learned clear techniques that we could implement to improve our own writing\r\nweaknesses- none",
                "Strengths: There are some very fun and interesting readings. In our discussions of the readings, I was exposed to many literary techniques Id never studied before. And I learned how to incorporate these techniques into my own writing. I also really enjoyed the workshopping aspect of this class. Professor Shirkhanis instruction was wonderful. Shes genuinely great at teaching, and she always gives extremely helpful feedback. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Cant think of any.",
                "The range of readings alone gave much inspiration",
                "Engl 120 has 5 essays due, each with a draft that is due before the final draft. Thus as a student you are constantly writing some draft or are thinking about the next draft. I think the design of this course is perfect to improve your writing: the essays are 4-5 pages and therefore there is no doing anything \"half-way\"-- because these are short pieces, students have the space to revise and think critically about what they want to write about. The essay prompts allow for so much creativity and reflection, but Professor Shirkhani also teaches that creative writing can be a craft and more structured than people may believe otherwise. All of the content that we read for class are shorter essays: bite-size, and interesting content. Although there are 5 essays to produce and many essays to read for each class, everything is short and therefore the student can really engage with all of the pieces. \r\nThe only \"weakness\" is that it is a seminar that is heavily influenced by the instructor, so I cannot speak at large about English 120 as confidently as I can about my section (SHIRKHANI). But overall, English 120 structurally is a great course that I recommend.",
                "The class was very well structured with a reasonable workload, but it felt that the essays chosen could have been from writers of more diverse backgrounds\/subject matters.",
                "A strength of this course was Professor Shirkhani! The selection of readings was also great. I appreciated having a regular schedule of assignments, rather than the midterm-and-final format of so many other courses. \r\nNot many weaknesses. Discussions could stall when it was clear some students hadn't gotten to all the readings, but Prof Shirkhani gracefully picked up the slack. It was good to read some of the shorter pieces in class."

                "YESSSSS!!! Over and over again.",
                "YES! This was one of my FAVORITE courses at Yale! The prompts for these essays were SO FUN to write. The essays that we read in class were so FUN to read. Literally, one of the units we learn is satire, so by design it is supposed to be a fun unit. There are many sections for English 120, and if you can shop the one with Professor Kimberly Shirkhani! She is always willing to talk with students outside of class, and provides astute, critical feedback in the kindest way imaginable. \r\nEngl 120 has 5 essays due, each with a draft that is due before the final draft.

                "Yes! I felt like I improved a lot as a writer!",
                "Yes! Regardless of your choice of career\/endeavors after Yale, you will need to write. This is a great intro course and a real opportunity to improve foundational skills. You read great pieces with a variety of styles and subjects. Also, you get to write about anything you want.",
                "Yes, especially if you are able to take the course with Prof. Shirkhani. Her feedback is thoughtful and individualized. I would highly recommend going to office hours for this course if you want to talk through your ideas."
