                "This class actually has me thinking about the world in a new way. I think about the methods used in air pollutions quality monitoring all the time. I have never had a class do that, actually impact my day to day life.",

                "This course was great, I enjoyed how the units were broken up and I thought the problem sets and exam (1,2 haven't taken 3rd yet) were designed well and overall the research project was interesting and something unique that I've never done something like before.",
                "Great class!! Drew and Mia are amazing and the grading is so so fair",
                "Strengths\r\n-Low pressure grading distribution (i.e. exams are not heavily weighted)\r\n-Very engaging and challenging psets with lots of support offered\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-Lectures could benefit from some more high-level synthesis (e.g. \"from this example, we learn XYZ broader concepts that we could apply to other problems\") since we tend to focus on specific case studies or examples\r\n-First exam was way too easy in my opinion \r\n-I think a lot of the readings were... not strictly necessary. Might be good to make students aware of this.\r\n-I didn't really learn a lot from nor did I enjoy the AQ wiki part of the class.",
                "Strengths: The workload is very manageable. Problem sets are not too intense  and the use of cheat sheets on exams is great. \r\nWeaknesses: Lecture is very conceptual and problem sets are generally quantitative with convoluted questions so can seem like there's a disconnect. Material on exams is very conceptual as well, but the quantitative problems on the exam aren't similar to the ones on the problem set.",
                "The interactive-based class makes it engaging and makes it a lot better than a 75-minute lecture. Some of the material can become repetitive over the course but other than that, it's a great introductory course to air quality and how we manage/control it.",
                "Strengths: lots of interactive activities in class that break up the lecture format, problem sets and exams are intellectually engaging but not impossibly difficult, topics covered feel very applicable with real-world consequences and examples, incorporation of case studies in addition to equations and formulas (engineering with real world examples). Weaknesses: example exam questions did not line up too much with actual exams, schedule of topics did not always line up with the schedule being followed in class, readings from the textbooks were difficult to understand",
                "great class!",
                "Professor Gentner is an excellent lecturer.  I actually found it mildly irritating sometimes because I personally hate having to form little groups in class and discuss but it is unfortunately an extremely effective teaching/learning style, much to my despair (and benefit because we worked a lot of things out together in our groups and I definitely learned more from having engaged with the subject matter in this way).  But, Prof. Gentner is definitely a strength of this course.  \r\nThere were also lots of opportunities to be graded: psets were of reasonable difficulty and spread out over the semester; we had 3 exams, all of which were very fair; we had an individual final mini research project/presentation and a collective/collaborative semester-long project; and there was a participation-adjacent grade. I wouldn't call the class \"easy\" but it was reasonable and Prof. Gentner is more than fair about exam difficulty and extensions/accommodations.  \r\nI don't have particular points for improvement. The psets/3 exams structure really works for me as a student.  I don't know that I really \"got\" the collaborative project (Air quality wiki) but I also personally didn't have enough time to really engage with that aspect of the course as much as I wanted to. Either way, it was a helpful exercise for the final exam.",
                "Strengths: course was set up and structured really well.  TA Mia was soooo helpful on homeworks! Great professor who was kind and explained things clearly.  In class activities helped build learning and there were a variety of assignment types so things didn't get dull.\r\nWeaknesses: the content felt rushed towards the end of the semester and the homeworks felt a lot harder than the class example problems.",
                "I really enjoyed the format of this course. The lectures were exciting but I'm glad that there were also a lot of small-group discussions to keep me engaged. That being said, sometimes I feel like a bit too much time was dedicated to the more open-ended group questions--there were times when my group was finished, or perhaps a bit stuck, and I felt like I was not taking away as much as I could from the time spent. I did appreciate how Professor Gentner went around to individual groups during these discussions though, and overall I think that the mixed format of this class should be kept the same in the future!",
                "This course was very interactive and professor did an awesome job of asking questions to improve the learning of the class. I enjoyed that part a lot. I think I would've enjoyed a more quantitative approach at times, and I also understand that this is an intro course, but it felt like it was difficult for me to tell what professor wanted me to put for certain questions on the exam."

                "Take this as an elective if you are a chemical engineering major. I took both water quality and air pollution control and both courses were great! There is less emphasis on solving numerical problems compared to other chemical engineering courses, but there is more emphasis on free-flow discussion based talking about air quality problems.",
                "Yes! This course teaches you all about air pollution and how pollutants are emitted and transported in the atmosphere. The course definitely makes you more aware of the air and the complexity of air pollution and control strategies. A lot of the topics covered feel applicable to real-life and environmental contexts as opposed to other science/math classes I have taken that have felt more abstract and theoretical. It is also approachable for people who do not have as strong of an engineering background.",
                "yes",
                "I would recommend this course.  I would say it's average in terms of workload and probably easier than average in terms of academic challenge for an eng. course ie the number of psets/exams are about the same as normal but you probably won't spend 12 hours working on one pset. Prof. Gentner is a really great professor: he's very energetic, fair and has a great attitude towards teaching and learning.  It was clear to me as his student that he really wants all of us to learn and succeed.  He doesn't hand out good grades but he does set up the course so that you can get a good grade if you put in a reasonable effort.",
                "I would highly recommend.  I'm not an environmental engineering major but I found that the course complemented my studies in Earth & Planetary Sciences.",
                "Yes! This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale so far, and Professor Gentner is not only super knowledgable about the content, but willing to share with students and answer any questions. I will say though, as a sophomore taking a lot of other intro-level courses, the resources in this class definitely required a bit more work on my part to seek out--for example, in terms of exam preparation, there were no review sessions, however ultimately the exams did reflect the content from class lectures pretty well. The PSETs were also quite tricky since they often included aspects that were not fully covered in class (class also felt a bit fast-paced). But, they became more doable when I went to office hours. And, a lot of the concepts really built on each other, so although I felt a bit overwhelmed at first, by the end the important ideas really started to come together.",
