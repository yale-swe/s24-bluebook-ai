    "Developed strong grammar and vocab from the course.  Learned the alphabet, basic phrases, and overall introduction to Korean.",
    "I learned the foundations of Korean and conversational language.",
    "The course teaches Korean at an introductory level, and has lots of room for practice.",
    "I learned beginner speaking, writing and reading skills in the Korean Language. I can now comfortably hold basic conversations as well as navigate my way around and do menial tasks in Korean."

   "comments": [
    "strengths: fair teaching pace, adequate number of exercises to practice skills.",
    "Strengths are activities. Weaknesses is constant quizzes.",
    "I think that the additional conversation sections is very helpful and the teacher does an excellent job at engaging students. It is also very collaborative and does a great job at creating a close, supportive learning community.",
    "Picked up a lot of vocab and grammar, but wished we did more speaking and listening practice in class. Also not much cultural exposure.",
    "The teacher is excellent, and students learn a lot by taking the course. However, the course is very fast, and doesn't have as much support as other classes outside of class for students. However, I feel like there should be more focus on grammar, such as verb conjugations and tenses.",
    "The class moves at a fast pace but was really engaging and fun. Park seonsaengnim was very sweet, supportive, and available. Definitely learned a lot in a comfortable environment. My only complaint was we didn't actually use the listening book, so we could've avoided spending that extra money.",
    "There are no weaknesses that I have perceived from this course, the discussions have been tremendously helpful in not only reinstating what had been learned in class, but allowing the student to become more comfortable and speak more confidently and fluently."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course, especially among the intro language courses. Professor Park is a really dedicated teacher, who cares about her students. She also challenges students by encouraging students to learn additional vocab and not underestimating the potential of students to understand faster speaking.",
    "Yes; the course content was enjoyable to learn and the instructor was very good at teaching the students.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Under Professor Park we were introduced to a new culture and language. The class was taught in a supportive environment that helped us engage with the material.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, if you want to learn Korean is it a very good introductory course and it is a very fun and community-creating course.",
    "If you are interested in Korean, a great course if you're willing to put the work in. As any language class, you will only learn as much as you put the effort in for. Can get a lot out if proactive in learning, and also interested. Is more work than a typical course, however.",
    "L1 Korean is great! I've always wanted to learn Korean and this course taught me the basics of what I need to know and more.",
    "Yes; it is a very good introductory course, and is a good start for anybody who wants to learn Korean.",
    "Yes! If you're interested in learning Korean even just a tiny bit, consider taking this class!",
    "YES! I absolutely loved this course, it was extremely student driven as well as eye opening toward a new language and culture."
