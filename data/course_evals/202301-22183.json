                "I believe that every premed needs to take this course. It teaches so much about the history of drugs, and it should be required to understand this history for people who will be future prescribers. The course is super well organized, the workload is completely manageable, and the material is fascinating. Best class I took at Yale, and I could not give it a stronger recommendation!",
                "I learned about a whole other strand of US history that tied in really nicely with what Ive learned in previous history classes. This course has made me rethink the narratives I read in historical writings and current media about drugs and substance abuse.",
                "I learned about drug development and regulation throughout American history.",
                "Learned about the political and social impact of drugs in the United States.",
                "I learned a lot about the histories of drug classifications and how they've been treated by government agencies, health professionals, and the general public. The biggest lesson I took away is that drugs aren't inherently good or bad; their \"risk\" is defined by the social and political contexts surrounding their usage.",
                "I enjoyed this class and felt like I gained a new perspective on the topics that we talked about.",
                "I learned about the History of drugs in the US and the different racial, social, and political reasonings behind drug classification.",
                "I learned a ton about the history of drugs and it totally changed my perspective on all of it.",
                "I learned so much about the history of drug use, the medicalization of drugs and addiction, the history of the United States and institutions, and so many other things. I was able to learn how to explain a primary source in great detail as well as connect multiple events in history together.",
                "This was a phenomenal class that challenged us to critically examine why we think about certain drugs the way that we do. Professor Ramos structured the class roughly chronologically and encouraged us to think about the historical continuities and complexities that the history of drugs presents in the U.S. and how this continues to impact our lives today.",
                "the history of drugs and how they change categories",
                "this course is INCREDIBLE!!! everything discussed is super relevant and will shape your understanding and perception of American history and the modern world. COULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CLASS MORE !!!",
                "A lot of important topics about drugs in american history",
                "I learned a lot about the history of drugs in America and the systems that we still have in place today.",
                "Learned about drugs throughout American history--completely changed my perspective! I had no idea that things like racism, sexism, and classism ran so deep in drug policy, but this class did a great job providing an overview of this.",
                "I learned about the history of drug in the United states and how drugs are catagorized not by their biomedical composition but depending on power relations.",
                "I took away so much from this class. I learned how racialized drug policy is in the United States, which I was not aware of before. \r\nOf course I had heard of Prohibition before, but did I know about the mad Granny that would ravage saloons? Or did I know about the Women's Christian Temperance Union? Did I know about how the United States and the KKK teamed up to enforce Prohibition and wreak havoc on the black community? No. So now, I know so much more about the effect that drugs have had on society.",
                "Good class",
                "Learned how to think critically about the history of drugs in America and the differential and oftentimes unequal enforcement of drug laws",
                "I learned a lot about the history and classification of drugs in the US throughout history, more specifically the social-political factors that affect the perception of drugs.",
                "I learned about different drug categories and how much social factors play into the perception of drugs. The history was super interesting and I learned many new facts.",
                "This class took a deep dive into the intricacies of public perception of drugs. It completely subverted all ideas i have about drug use",
                "This has been one of the best classes that I've taken at Yale. The material is truly so interesting and intersects with so many different fields. It will really teach you to consider the contextual social factors that go into the labeling of certain substances and the people that use them. It helped expand the way I look at history and think much more critically.",
                "This course helped me gain unbelievably insight into American history through the lens of drugs and addiction. I learned so much about different substances that are always talked about, and I now know the context, history, and intricacies behind these substances. In terms of hard skills, the course helped improve my ability to analyze and place historical images (advertisements, newspaper articles, photographs, etc.) in historical context.",
                "understanding how context influences perspectives, analyzing history from the lens of drugs/substances",
                "This course was really amazing in understanding the classist and racist themes throughout American history in reference to drugs.",
                "This class made you think critically about previous assumptions and beliefs you hold regarding drugs and drug use in America.",
                "I really enjoyed the class. The professor was very enthusiastic. Really interesting conversations.",
                "I developed an understanding of drugs and their use in our society. This class challenges your preconceived notions about drugs and lends a different explanation about them and their intertwined relationship with power structures in our society.",
                "Learned about the history of drugs in america.",
                "As the title suggests, I learned a lot about the history of drugs in 20th century America. I gained a deeper understanding of how drug categories changed throughout time and how they are constructed, not necessarily with respect to their biochemical properties but rather by social and political circumstances.",
                "I learned so much about the history of drugs and the social, political, and medical implications of our drug categorization system in the United States.",
                "A super in depth and exciting class! The lectures are fascinating.",
                "I learned about the history of drugs in America",
                "I was able to synthesize information from various different sources and re-conceptualize how I view drugs: not from their biochemical properties, but from their social and political contexts.",
                "Your understanding of drugs will be challenged in a productive way. Ramos really breaks down a substance's perceived \"goodness\" or \"badness\" drug by drug in this class with his discussion of white and black markets and the sociopolitical structures surrounding them. You will think more critically about how deeply entrenched racism and classism is in the public attitude towards drug use and addiction, but also in broader society. I think mostly everyone would benefit from and enjoy taking this class.",
                "Wide variety of knowledge on how drugs have been viewed in the US",
                "Learned about broad survey of drugs history.",
                "This course taught me how drugs shift across licit/illicit, medicine/poison, and recreational/pharmaceutical category boundaries, not due to their biological properties but as a result of power dynamics involving race, class, etc. I learned about the cultural history of several specific drugs including alcohol, cocaine, Miltown, opium, birth control, and marijuana, among others. I also learned a lot about legal legislation regarding their regulation and how to analyze primary sources.",
                "I learned alot of new things while taking this course, and I would reccomend it to everyone (if if they think that they aren't inclined towards STEM or are not pre-med!) This class helped me to look at history through a new perspective not only because I learned so many new things about the history of drugs, but also about that history impacted different groups of people. I learned more about medicine and now have a greater appreciation for this history of drugs in America.",
                "Very interesting insight into how drugs have shaped our historical understanding of the US",
                "Gained a pretty wide range of knowledge about different substances and the history of overall drug enforcement",
                "I gained important knowledge regarding the forces defining black and white drug markets in the United States. I also learned the complicated history of drug development and policy.",
                "I was able to challenge my conception of drugs and realize how drug categories are not as straightforward as I originally thought. Some of the topics this course focused on included how the perspective of certain drugs have transformed throughout Americas history, how drugs have been utilized for sociopolitical aims, and how drugs have been used for optimization.",
                "I learned about the history of different substances throughout history and how their regulation and use is a product of social relations as opposed to the biochemical properties of the substances.",
                "pretty good timeline history of drugs spanning from pre-colonial times to present. all about the different markets, socio-economic and political factors at play.",
                "I really learned a lot about how the way we categorize drugs is not based on their actual biochemical properties and more so the social, political, cultural contexts, etc.",
                "This course allowed me to learn a lot about different substances, how they have been used throughout history, and how they came to be placed into categories such as licit and illicit.",
                "I gained an incredible amount of knowledge about how drug classifications operate in America. Even if you think you have a good grasp on how drugs (both prescription and illicit) are viewed in America through things like Prohibition, the War on Drugs, and the opiate crisis, there is so, so much left to learn.",
                "I learned a lot not just about the history of drugs, but also the histories of social movements, cultural history, and the development of the pharmaceutical practice.",
                "I gained a nuanced understanding of the history of drugs in America -- why some drugs are illegal and others are not. The class went beyond the politics of fear and sensationalization and instead focused on the socio-political issues associated with drug use in the States.",
                "I learned a lot and found the class incredibly interesting",
                "I learned about the histories of different drugs in america and their interplay with politics, racism and sexism. I also learned about the evolution of drug policy"

                "Very well organized, manageable workload, fascinating material",
                "The course material was really interesting, and it was also quite accessible. I sometimes felt like the class could skim over really basic information (eg what is Jim Crow or what is a primary source), but I also think it was designed as an introductory class. Finally, I would have preferred to write a research paper rather than take a final exam because there were so many interesting topics we touched on that students could have taken in a lot of interesting research directions.",
                "Lectures are very engaging with occasional student participation through online tools. Professor is passionate about the subject and has a clear outline for every lecture. Workload is light with the exception of the week before spring break where both the midterm and the primary source essay are due within one day of each other.",
                "The strongest aspect of the course was the conversation it invoked in me and my peers. Every lecture felt like a masterpiece, and I left almost every time confronting a bias I once had or continuing to engage with the thoughts that the professor brought up in class. There weren't many weakness in the course, but I wish there could've been more opportunities to be in discussion with the professor. I get there was a lot of interest for the class, but I feel like this is a class that's better suited for a seminar (or at least a leminar/large seminar) rather than a formal lecture.",
                "I enjoyed the way this course was taught and do not believe there is much room for improvement.",
                "This course was very interesting and I learned a lot. A major strength was the information and the way it was presented.",
                "The class was very well structured and followed a very clear timeline and theme. The course was really designed to teach a rarely-taught history that gets you simultaneously thinking about your own interactions with drugs today, so there was very little stress around grades and exams. I really enjoyed it.",
                "I honestly cannot think of any weaknesses of this class other than it was only a 50 minute lecture when I wish it was more. The class was engaging, interesting, and overall one of the best I have taken at Yale. The course brought in different perspectives on drug policy that I had never thought of before and investigated the intersection of communities.",
                "Some strengths of the course: \r\n- the primary source analysis assignment was really insightful and helped us choose something to critically study and contextualize \r\n- recording lectures and sharing slides! huge accessibility measure that I appreciate greatly\r\n- including lots of historical context outside of drug use specifically to help us contextualize broader movements and ideologies that inform these histories\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n- One potential improvement would be to talk a bit more about historical examples of people organizing in their communities around drug use and harm reduction as a means of keeping themselves safe. There's so much to say and so little time! \r\n- instead of having both a midterm and a final, I think having a more creative option for engaging with the course would be really beneficial. Perhaps a final project or paper would allow people to make tangible connections with their lives, passions, and interests. I think the final project/paper option for Sickness and Health was really engaging, as it was incredibly open-ended and each student could really design something they felt passionate about and contribute to their lives, education, and communities.",
                "the teacher is really invested, the slides could use some more words other than images",
                "strengths: fascinating, organized lectures -- material is incredibly interested and presented super clearly, readings are manageable and super interesting, prof is engaging and knowledgable af, low workload (only assignments are midterm, open book final, and 2pg primary source analysis!) this class is all pros and 0 cons",
                "Very well organized, had so much help",
                "The lectures were very cohesive and Professor Ramos did a great job of connecting points from previous lectures together as he progressed through the history of drugs. One topic I wish he had covered is fentanyl; I feel that we are in a pivotal moment of history with the fentanyl crisis in America. I would have wanted to learn how the opioid crisis we had discussed in class has led to very high overdose deaths due to fentanyl, as well as other social and political factors contributing to this epidemic.",
                "This was a great class! The lectures were fantastic - they were well-structured and very clear. The readings were also very interesting and complemented the lectures well. My only suggestion would be to drop some of the readings that are not explicitly connected to the lectures.",
                "Strengths -- I've never taken a class with such interesting readings that were so well tailored to the course content. Weakness -- I would've preferred a different type of paper as opposed to a primary source analysis, like maybe a research paper. That way students could engage more with what they are specifically interested in.",
                "The class covered fascinating topics and the lectures were clear. However, I would suggest that an essay replace one of the final/midterm exams. I think it would allow me to explore and analyze the topics in greater depth rather than writing based on memory and in the span of a 50 min - 1.5  hour exam.",
                "One of the great strengths of this course was the great lecturing. Dr. Ramos is a great and clear lecturer, so he does a well job at keeping students engaged. I enjoyed going to lectures. \r\n\r\nOne weakness I can point out was that the irregularity of the discussion section responses made things sort of confusing. A lot of us were not on the same page and did not submit questions on the same topic because our discussions covered the topics from the week before. I was confused about which week we were discussing too.",
                "Good",
                "Great lecture very interesting topics and readings",
                "Strengths - topics are very interesting. Weaknesses - Readings can be a little too long and slides have too many pictures and not enough words so if you miss class, unless you watch the class recordings its hard to know what is being said.",
                "Ramos is an AMAZING lecturer!!! So engaging and interesting. His lecture is a must",
                "This is by far one of the best classes Ive taken at Yale. The material is interesting, important, and presented in a manner that keeps students engaged. Section discussions facilitated by awesome TFs really help you reevaluate all you thought you knew about history. The only way I would improve the class is by having them give me more feedback about my writing; the grading was honestly a bit too easy.",
                "I thought the lectures were very interesting, I enjoyed going to class and section and discussing the material of the class. Overall, this is probably my favorite class that I have taken at Yale and I don't have anything negative to say about it.",
                "No weaknesses at all for me! Professor Ramos and my TF were both incredible perspectives to hear from and the course is set up to facilitate student learning and help you succeed. Each lecture was structured and engaging and Professor Ramos is a delightful lecturer. I was always excited to show up to class.",

                "Strengths: The syllabus is really well structured, and I love how each week or so followed a theme that focused on one or two substances while the course itself still moved in chronological order. Professor Ramos is an excellent lecturer which made each class feel enjoyable to sit through. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I can really think of no weaknesses. This course was truly one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale.",

                "The content covered was very interesting and the readings complemented it so well.",
                "I think the content is interesting. Professor Ramos is a good lecturer. There was no science even though it was a SC credit.",
                "The course was adapted from a seminar Professor Ramos taught. Some weeks, the amount of reading assigned would be roughly what you would expect for a seminar, which is fine (all the readings were very fascinating and are worth going through in depth!) but it can feel like a lot if you did not expect to do a lot of work going into it. I also didnt like that engagement with the class dropped off substantially in the later part of the semester. That said, this course was excellently taught by Professor Ramos, and theres a lot of interesting material to learn!",
                "Incredible course. Learned a ton about the history of drugs in America",
                "I liked the structure of the course and thought that the small group discussions were a good way to reflect on the content from the whole week!",
                "The strengths of this course far outweighs its weaknesses. Engaging lecture, thoughtful discussion, and great readings. You learn a lot about a wide range of drugs and their sociopolitical context in a short period of time. Maybe this could be a pro or a con for you, but it is meant to be an overview course. Additionally, we were able to learn and discuss a substantial amount about most every drug we covered.",
                "Some of the lectures seemed to drift away from the material \r\n\r\nProfessor Ramos was an engaging lecturer and used a variety of media to convey his message.",
                "It was interesting and Ramos is passionate and kind. Would love to see him teach a. Class about LSD/psychedelics.",
                "Strengths: Well-organized, flows logically, very interesting course content, and Prof. Ramos is amazing! Weaknesses: none",
                "Engaging lectures, weak discussion sections that are only peripherally related to narrative of course.",
                "One strength is how this class is structured. It is structured around a main argument (or \"thesis\") and each one of our lessons serves as a \"body paragraph\" for that thesis. Everything also flowed mostly chronologically, which helped me to more easilly make connections between different time periods and the histories of different drugs. Professor Ramos is also a very engaging lecturer, and I enjoyed how our lectures would incorporate video and image to keep us more engaged. To add one, discussion section was also very engaging and I enjoyed going to section each week (shout out to Ben!) Also i felt as if the readings were not too much, even though it may be heavier in some weeks in comparison to others. I don't have any weaknesses for this class!",
                "Very engaging and relevant readings, lectures, and discussions",
                "Professor Ramos was a major positive in the course, incredibly engaging and made the lectures interesting",
                "This is a wonderful course. The lectures are clear and interesting. The content of this class is also very important and well taught. I can really understand how history has impacted the drug market today. There is a lot of reading every week, potentially these readings could be cut down to highlight the most relevant components of them. However, the readings are chosen well and fascinating.",
                "I only found strengths in this course. It was designed to aid our learning through informative lectures, engaging discussions, and midterms and assignments that served as useful measurements of our knowledge of the course content.",
                "The lectures of this course are very engaging and the weekly readings are interesting and relevant as well.",
                "My discussion section was not particularly interesting, and it had a lot of potential to be.",
                "The readings were super interesting and the TA's helped a lot to facilitate discussion, also cool to see guest lecturer talk about topics we had touched on in class",
                "Although there is a ton of information covered, it is all presented in a very digestible way. I actually wanted to go to lectures, even though they're videotaped. The course is also structurally framed really well, and the readings are fascinating. The one thing I would say is that for some weeks, one out of a couple of readings would basically be the lecture content, so it was a little repetitive. Maybe it's worth considering removing those readings and focusing on ones that provide more specifics. There were tons of in-depth readings though.",
                "I liked the format of this course and the mostly linear model for teaching allowed me to understand how policies and events interacted with one another",
                "The class was great as an intro course. It provided a lot of breadth and decent depth. The few times when some of the course material covered needed more context and explanations, office hours were available to delve into that more. I loved the hands-on approach of the class, such as the visit to the medical library.",
                "I loved the format of this class, though sometime i felt that the lectures repeated a lot of what I got from the readings and I wish they might have diverged a little more."

                "Absolutely! Amazing class, I think every pre-med should take it. Provides so much history and context for our world today, and is an amazing class.",
                "Yes! Loved it very interesting",
                "Yes, it was very interesting content to learn and Prof Ramos was an amazing, caring professor.",
                "Yes! You will get the most out of the class if you do the readings, which are very well chosen. This is not a course where you will vastly improve your writing and research skills, but I learned so much fascinating material and have improved my critical analysis skills.",
                "This course is amazing. It teaches you a new, valuable perspective on all types of drugs from caffeine to heroin.",
                "Yes, great course, super interesting content, great lecturer",
                "Yes, shake up your understanding of what a \"drug\" really is.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in learning not about the biochemical mechanisms of drugs, but their societal impact in the US.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, especially to people who are looking to work in the healthcare field.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. I think there aren't many other courses that would teach this material.",
                "Yes! It was super interesting and not that much work.",
                "This course was phenomenal and I would recommend it to anyone, regardless of major. It's a history that everyone should know about.",
                "Yes! Yes! Yes! If not this course take one also taught by Professor Ramos. The course material is excellent and truly exposes history in America that I had never known. I really love this class and cannot say enough good things about it. Professor Ramos truly cares about destigmatizing drug use and creating a space where each student can learn/grow.",
                "Absolutely. would highly recommend if you're looking for a class to challenge your thinking about drug use, drug categories, and the ways that society, stigma, and the criminalization of drug use creates harm.",
                "I would if they were interested in this history or wanted to go into medicine",
                "I COULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYTHING MORE!!! this class is fascinating -- it's stuff you wouldn't learn anywhere else that is INCREDIBLY important to being an informed participant in the sociological and medical world of drug use and discussion. literally one of my favorite classes ever at yale!!",
                "Absolutely! I would highly recommend to pre-med students because you get a very comprehensive view about the role of medicine throughout history.",
                "YES!",
                "ya if you care interested.",
                "As a graduating senior, this is one of the BEST courses I've ever taken at this university. Professor Ramos is a very engaging lecturer, but the content of the course is so nuanced and interesting. His unique perspective makes this course a MUST TAKE during your time at yale",
                "yes super interesting class on a very important topic",
                "yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this class! I had no background in HSHM before taking this class, and it was fantastic. The lectures and readings were great and the workload was very manageable. The topics discussed in the class are very interesting and definitely relevant to our contemporary time.",
                "Yes, it is a great class that has lectures recorded, so you do not have to go. The readings can be skimmed through and correlate well with the lectures. If you are a stem major looking to take an interesting and easy humanities course, I highly recommend this course.",
                "yes",
                "Sure, go to section and try a little bit on the exams and you can get an A",
                "Yes, 100%! This class was very interesting and I learned so much, without there being any unmanageable amount of readings or assignments. Teaching staff is also great.",
                "Yes I would. I think the topics were fascinating and essential to understanding how drugs, drug policy, and substance use disorder is a reflection of the bigger isms.",
                "I already have recommended this course to other students. Drugs are an interesting subject. Being able to talk about some illicit substances and their usage over time is fascinating.",
                "Yes",
                "yes! this is one of those yale courses that youll talk about forever. the material is very interesting and relevant to the present. workload is very manageable and youll learn things youll bring up in conversations all the time",
                "Must take class",
                "YES HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!! Amazing, interesting, and cool course. Highly recommend for HSHM or anyone going into a field of healthcare.",
                "Yes. Easy grading, super interesting/relevant material, and great for people of all majors, from history to chemistry to pre-med. This is by far one of the coolest classes Ive taken at Yale, and I cant recommend it highly enough. If you can get Ben Schafer as a TF, do ithe is the best.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking for a history course or looking for an extra class to take. The workload is on the lighter side, which I really enjoyed as it let me learn the information in the class without the constant stress of grades.",
                "I would recommend this class a million times over if you're interested in thinking critically about historical narratives and what shapes them. Whether you're interested in history, medicine, the mind and social sciences, public policy, etc. you will get something out of this course if you're fascinated by the topic. It will also help you think more carefully about modern conversations regarding drugs and their users and helps dispel a lot of harmful perspectives.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would absolutely recommend History of Drugs to anyone; whether a STEM or a humanities student. The class was so engaging, and everyone I talked to across majors thoroughly enjoyed it. If you are in STEM or interested in medicine, the class is a perfect way to learn more about the world of pharmacology, medicine, and addiction. If you are interested in the humanities, the class follows such interesting historical themes, and you learn so much about the history of drugs without doing lots of busy work or reading like in other classes.",
                "yes, i think this is a unique opportunity to learn about history through a medical lens or through the analysis of particular substances",
                "I have actually already told all my friends to take this course or any course with Professor Ramos. I can not speak highly enough about this course. It was so interesting and intellectually fascinating.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. Great history class. I loved going to class.",
                "Yes, it was interesting enough and was not too much work.",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely! This course is truly amazing and one of the most interesting ones offered. You will learn so much about the history of drugs in a way that might surprise you.",
                "Yes!! Its very chill and fascinating.",
                "Absolutely, if they are looking to learn more about the history of drugs in America",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. I found myself being challenged to think while also being engaged into the class. Professor Ramos did a great job of making history relevant to the present day.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. Ramos is an engaging lecturer already, but the content itself is extremely intriguing. You will most definitely leave the course with a radically new perspective on the politics around drugs and their implications for different groups of people. The workload is very, very manageable (although this may change considering this is the first time this course has been offered as a lecture), and the readings are thoughtfully chosen. Notably, the lecture and reading content overlap considerably. Anyways, if I could take this course again, I would. You really get to deconstruct your understanding of drugs and reconstruct it again with the new plethora of information you will gain from this class.",
                "If you want to learn a new perspective on drug history, yes.",
                "Yes! Its fun and interesting and not too much work.",
                "Yes! The course is very interesting and the teaching team is very supportive. HSHM 238 teaches you how to view drugs not only from a medical perspective, but also a social, cultural, and historical perspective, which is important to everyone because all people use drugs in some capacity, but especially so for people in medicine and law.",
                "Yes! One of the most interesting and well-taught classes I have taken at Yale!",
                "This class focused on a fascinating topic and kept me wanting to come to lectures, but didn't necessarily challenge me to explore new material on my own outside of that. I would recommend it.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone! Those who are pre-med may be a natural fit for this course, but this class makes learning about the history of drugs accessible to anyone (including me, someone on the pre-law track). This class mostly focuses on the history, and not too much on technical medical terms (sometimes they are mentioned, but will be explained to you in a way you will understand). This history is one that often isn't taught to us in school, but is very important to know.",
                "Good, but a little underwhelming given the reviews of the class as a seminar. Lectures were taken directly from the readings and provided little to no extra insight. Key takeaways were clearly highlighted, but often directly read off slide notes in monotone.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ramos has created a brilliant syllabus and clearly has a deep understanding of the material. I would love to see him develop this course further to dive deeper in the lectures than the reading he assigns, and to be more engaging in his presentation of the material.\r\n\r\nOverall the class is actually really interesting and I would totally recommend. It was also very easy. I just think it has the potential to be a true gem, and it wasnt quite there this time around.",
                "Yes, this was one of my favorite courses taken at Yale",
                "Yes, it was amazing.",
                "I feel this is a course every student should have to take, especially if they are going into science, business, or policy. The content of this course is so important and everyone should have an understanding of it. Marco Ramos is also a wonderful lecturer and if you have the opportunity to take a class with him you should.",
                "Yes, this course was very engaging and gives you an opportunity to gain a new perspective of American history. In addition, it challenges our conceptions of drugs and shows that the topic is more complex than it may seem at surface-level.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the topics learned are applicable experiences in daily life and they provide interesting perspectives on social phenomena.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes take this course",
                "Yes! Professor Ramos is amazing!",
                "Absolutely! You learn so much about your own bias and very important histories as well with regards to specific drugs",
                "Absolutely! One of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale. My perspective on drugs in America has changed significantly after taking this course. All the readings and lecture material are fascinating, and the workload is pretty light. I would highly recommend this course to anyone, but I think it's particularly essential for those going into social work, the medical field, or law.",
                "Yes definitely! I think HSHM courses are great because they are taught like history classes but are on very different topics, and I enjoyed how much we looked at and worked with primary material in this course",
                "Absolutely. It puts in conversation a lot of notions that we hold for granted and allows students to form their own informed opinions and, hopefully, become more empathetic and holistic in their perspective on issues surrounding drug usage.",
                "Yes definitely it is very very engaging and a great class with. agreat professor",
                "Absolutely, professor Ramos is an engaging lecturer; the topic is very interesting and has applications to our current life and how we exist and function in society; and most of all the course is fun"
