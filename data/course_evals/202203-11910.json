                "My knowledge of comparative politics was quite low when entering the class, but the material was quite understandable through class discussion and the guidance of Professor Aldrich. I was given the tools to pick apart research in the field and read dense papers on theory to apply them to real world scenarios.",
                "The course provides a phenomenal basis for understanding political and electoral systems. The course taught me how to read quantitative political science papers, acquainted me with the canonical texts on the issue, and allowed me to apply critical research skills in a country-specific case study.",
                "I learned about how different electoral systems function and their consequences. We discussed the theoretical foundations of political parties as well as case studies looking at subtopics like party finance, populism, gender, and more."

                "Strengths - well organised class - professor open to feedback and responsive. great learning environment. also covered some really interesting topics \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- no fault of anyone but we had a couple of seminars on zoom and I much preferred leaning in person.",
                "Professor Aldrich is possibly the greatest strength of this class. She creates a syllabus and molds it to the interests of her students and their needs as the semester goes on. She keeps class engaging and provokes meaningful and thoughtful discussion about the topics she is so passionate about. Individual projects such as the case study and research poster allowed students to explore areas and countries of interest with a level of freedom that is just right. That being said, the theory is quite dense in the first few weeks of the class, but it is crucial to a foundational knowledge in the structure of political parties and electoral systems. There are far more strengths than weaknesses in this class and I learned a great deal of information throughout the semester.",
                "No weaknesses. The instructor is really engaging, and I found the course fascinating. Though some of the heavier theoretical pieces are rather heavy, once the class delves deeper into research papers the theoretical underpinnings prove useful and rewarding.",
                "I liked the content and Professor Aldrich facilitated good discussions in the classroom.",
                "Strengths: Professor Aldrich was an enthusiastic professor who gave it her all every class, even though the class was at 9:25. She kept the conversations going and kept us engaged. The case study project was great, and the weekly workload was pretty manageable. Weaknesses: some weeks, the readings got highly theoretical and no one really understood what was going on. Some of the group activities were painful in the morning."

                "YES. This class is incredible because Professor Aldrich is so passionate about the subject matter and brings that level of interest to class. She facilities meaningful discussions and adapts the coursework to the needs of the students, changing conversation as it goes in class as well. The material of the course begins quite slow with lots of paper on theory, but transitions into more interesting modern research about comparative political parties and electoral systems. The projects in the class to not provide much difficulty, but they allow student to explore their own interests.",
                "Absolutely. The greatest strengths of the course are the instructor and the small class size. Anyone who is interested in the topic in general would greatly benefit from the class.",
                "Yes its an excellent course with interesting content. I wish Id taken a class with Professor Aldrich before my senior year since I really enjoyed the teaching style.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this course to political science majors who want to learn about how electoral systems and political parties function outside of the US. Professor Aldrich is knowledgeable and friendly, and the readings for the most part are light and interesting (except for the theory at the beginning, and she said she'd shorten it for future classes). Workload is relatively light and the case study project was enjoyable. Definitely a solid, interesting but not hard polisci comparative gov elective."
