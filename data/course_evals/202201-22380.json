                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The text is unlike many other texts I have read, so it was very cool to spend a whole semester reading and studying it. It is also a very long book, so it felt very rewarding to read the whole thing! Professor Wetters and the other students in the class always made sure that class discussion was interesting and captivating. We were also able to meet the translator of the book, which was an amazing experience. The only caveat is that because the book is so long, it is easy to fall behind on reading assignments, which makes class more difficult to follow.",

I do think that in order to get a lot out of this class, one needed to have a focus or \"way\" one wanted to approach the bookand it helps to have some background in other modernist novels, at least in a limited fashion. Also, we had the translator of the text come to class! That was awesome! Definitely the highlight of the course, by far. So rich and so fulfilling.",
