                "Definitely learned how to better read scientific literature, and 100% feel like I am more comfortable with seemingly complex research articles.",
                "I learned how to read scientific papers in genomics and think critically about the concepts and findings presented in these papers. I especially gained a lot of experience with interpreting the figures in the papers, which is a skill that I struggled with in the past.",
                "MCDB 450 helped me to develop the skills to read, analyze, and discuss genomic research from a variety of fields and applications. I also gained an awareness of current developments, controversies, and breakthroughs in the field of genomics.",
                "I gained immense amounts of knowledge regarding the human genome, processes by which data collection occurs, and how to read primary scientific literature. This course is a deep dive into relevant, current genomics research, allowing for opportunities to gain reading, understanding, and speaking skills relating to genomic research.",
                "I learned a great deal about reading complex papers. While the topic of the class was the human genome,  I left with a greater appreciation for scientific papers and the immense work that goes into making one.",
                "This course helped me to understand the field of genetics as it stands today. I learned how to dissect important information out of scientific literature.",
                "I developed insights into how to read and interpret scientific literature.",
                "I developed my ability to read papers and analyze complex data figures which will be very helpful going forward in my career.",
                "I learned so much. The thing that I take away the most is that I learned how to read hard literature in the field of genomics and genetics. This was invaluable.",
                "I developed a deeper appreciation of the Human Genome project and the far reaching effects its had on shaping genomics today. I also learned how to critically analyze a research paper by breaking it down into smaller digestible parts. I now feel more confident analyzing and discussing science.",
                "I developed scientific analysis, thinking, and presenting skills from reading all the papers assigned for class! But most importantly, I gained valuable insights as to how the field of genetics is intertwined with so many other field of sciences",
                "How to approach, read, break down, digest, then reconstruct, and communicate primary scientific literature in human genomics.",
                "My scientific paper-reading skills vastly improved in the process of taking this course. Being exposed to a wide variety of papers concerning genetics and genomics helped deepen my understanding of those two fields and the methods that are important for those fields (e.g. techniques like different types of genome sequencing and algorithms like Monstr). Furthermore, I became better at presenting scientific data in a clear and concise (as well as interesting/funny) fashion. Having to present at least 1 figure every week really improves thinking on the spot and public speaking."

                "I think the course was pretty perfect as is--the only thing that could make it better is having it be in person, but that will come in time.",
                "Strengths: There were a lot of opportunities for group discussion, and the professor and TA were very helpful when they explained sections of the paper that the students struggled to understand. In addition, I liked being split into breakout rooms in the beginning of the class to discuss one figure/table with a few of my classmates; this helped me understand the figure/table better and be able to present it during our whole class discussion.",
                "This is a fantastic course! Prof Dellaporta puts in a ton of effort to keep the course engaged. You learn from the professor and your peers.",
                "Strengths: small seminar discussion format is awesome, really gives you a chance to get to know everyone, and the diversity of backgrounds the students have adds to the discussions. Professor Dellaporta strikes a great balance between contributing his own very extensive knowledge and leaving it to the students to contribute. At the same time, the class is well structured, so it never feels like we are on our own. I really liked having the last two weeks to present many different papers to get a taste of many different topics, and I also loved how Prof. Dellaporta really kept the reading reasonable so we could focus on diving deep into each paper rather than trying to get to too much. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Dr. Dellaporta and Matt (our TA) were awesome - two of the strengths of the course! Another strength was the papers we read throughout the semester. Dr. Dellaporta picked relevant, thought-provoking publications that are at the forefront of the field of genomics, leading to fruitful discussions of the data and its implications in future research and our current lives. Dr. Dellaporta and Matt were very accommodating and often acknowledged the fact that the course was challenging, making it less stressful when trying to learn how to get through the material. The only weakness of this course is the initial learning curve of understanding how to interact with the material. This is an artifact of a course such as this, however, and I think it is unavoidable. Even though learning how to interpret the figures and content of the papers was difficult at first, the class is set up in a way to allow this understanding to occur with little pressure.",
                "The only weakness of this class was the virtual format and that's something that was unique to this year. Especially when we had a rather challenging paper, sitting in class for 2 hours puzzling over advanced methods became a bit tedious. \r\n\r\nStrength was Professor Dellaporta. He cares so much about the topic, and is always there to help students further their understanding.",
                "This is an amazing course and Professor Dellaporta is extremely invested in your learning and making sure that you understand each topic and are able to have meaningful discussions around the papers. I loved the class and can imagine it wouldve been so much better in person.",
                "Strengths: tremendous sense of community, Dr. Dellaporta and our TA, Matt, were simply incredible. Take this class if you can get in!!",
                "The course was all discussion based, so being completely remote was difficult. I think the course will be much stronger next year when it returns to in-person learning.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Dellaporta  he's a phenomenal professor and really cared about the subject. He was also so understanding of student needs during the pandemic. Could not have asked for a better professor. The content was hard, but very manageable. It was a great balance of challenging but not overwhelming.",
                "The strengths of this class are the instructor as well as the format. The instructor did a great job being available to answer any questions. The format makes the class quite laid back and fun to participate in. There's less of an emphasis on getting a bunch of assignments done and more in-depth reading of a single paper.",
                "Strengths: the professor, the TA, the students of the class are all so welcoming! The papers were challenging at times, but they were all so relevant and current which really open your eyes to how advanced the field of genetics is! The best part of the class was the student presentation where we got to present on a topic of interest that was still related to genetics. Although I never personally used it, another strength is how flexible both the professor and TA are with office hours, so I am sure if I ever needed help understanding the paper, I can easily reach out to one of them or attend one of the student-run office hours",
                "Strengths: Fair work load, challenging material but just the right amount of difficulty and support to get students into that slightly uncomfortable growth zone. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Strengths: The format of this course is my favorite of all the science classes Ive taken in my four years at Yale. Weekly discussions of 1 paper, no examinations. Such a structure enables students to really focus on the literature, and keeping it to 1 paper a week enables us to thoroughly digest a particular topicany more and it probably would be overwhelming. Prof. Dellaporta also makes a strong effort to present students with the latest and greatest papersso the science we are learning is quite fresh. Another great strength of this course, compared to other seminars Ive taken, is that there is reduced emphasis on getting through the whole paper on any given week. Rather, Prof. Dellaporta emphasizes question-asking, which slows us down as we go through the paper, but actually, in my opinion, helps us learn a lot more. In other classes I might feel bad for slowing down discussion by asking a question, but as Prof. Dellaporta clarifies, we dont need to feel bad for doing so here. \r\nWeaknesses: As far as weaknesses go, I can only think of logistical things. It would be helpful to get a bit more time to prepare for the presentation on the week that we are assigned. Furthermore, Prof. Dellaporta helpfully gives students a few pointers that they should capture during the presentationbut it may be even more helpful if those pointers came a little bit earlier, because I spent some time preparing material that didnt fall under those points before I got the email. Another note is that students sign up for introduction slots not knowing which paper (and in what field) they are going to present (this to me is not a big deal though)."

                "The virtual format of the course did present challenges and technical difficulties, but nonetheless the level of engagement in this course was very strong, and I believe that we had fruitful and lively discussions each week. In addition, Dr. Dellaporta was always willing to arrange individual meetings with us if we wanted to discuss things outside of class!",

                "I think this course would have been better in person, as with many courses here at Yale, but I still feel like the course was successful nonetheless. We were able to separate figures for discussion and move into breakout rooms to discuss, allowing for peer interaction in addition to the whole group discussion.",
                "Being able to go into breakout rooms to discuss figures was always helpful. What didn't work so well was when everyone came back into the main room but only one person at a time could speak.",

                "He did the best that he could and we are all so grateful for it.",
                "The breakout rooms were a success! It facilitated student interaction. The one thing I would improve is some logistical stuff for the student presentation. For example, four slides is kind of too little to fit all the important figures of the paper. I feel like there shouldnt be a slide limit as long as we keep to 10 minutes. Also, if the professor and TA can figure out a way for students to control the slides, that would also be extremely helpful, as it helps for us to be able to guide the audience to where we want them to look!",
                "Everything being online was tough. As a seminar, it may benefit by incorporating some sort of in person aspect.",
                "Prof. Dellaporta did a fantastic job given the difficult circumstances of teaching in the past year. Although the beginning was a bit rocky, I feel like our class showed much more chemistry when we as students together realized that what Prof. Dellaporta was looking for was more question-asking and active engagementand less concern about whether or not we go through the paper. Once this expectation was clear and set, it made it a lot easier for students to participate. The only suggestion I have for the future is for Prof. Dellaporta to lay out those expectations loud and clear starting from the very beginning.\r\nProf. Dellaporta also mentioned that one adjustment to this course for COVID times is that only one paper is assignedI think this is a fantastic adjustment and should be there to stay even after COVID. When I have too many figures to try to understand, its difficult to understand each figure as deeply."

                "Absolutely. This was the most rewarding/satisfying MCDB course I have ever taken. Also, Prof Dellaporta is probably the best prof I've had. He understands students and understand the fruitlessness of busy work--we just had 1-2 papers to read and understand each week for discussion, so the class was very manageable. Also such a manageable load really helped with allowing you to spend more time on something you didnt understand in a paper, rather than just skip it because you had other stuff for the class to do.",
                "Yes! This course helped me immensely with reading scientific papers and thinking critically about the most recent findings in the field of genetics and genomics. Anyone who is interested in genetics and/or wishes to pursue a career in biological/biomedical research should take this course!",
                "YES!! This is a fantastic course.",
                "ABSOLUTELY!!! I would consider this a must-take for all MCDB majors (it would be very hard to get a spot for non-majors). The course is a fantastic balance of challenging concepts but limited work, with great instruction from Professor Dellaporta. The course is a small seminar that discusses a genomic paper each week. The only assignments are reading the papers and participating in class, which is perfect because you can then focus on diving deep into the material rather than worrying about tests or busywork. To some, reading a paper each week might sound tough, but the papers chosen for the class are always really well written and interesting, so it's not hard at all, and I found myself really enjoying it. Discussions were always excellent and quite enjoyable, Prof. Dellaporta guides students and contributes his vast knowledge while also not overstepping and this creates an awesome, student-driven conversation each week. You'll learn a huge amount about genomics, from a variety of perspectives (including how genomics are used in cancer research, rare disease research, ancestry studies, population sciences, and even public health) There are no downsides to this class whatsoever, and I couldn't recommend it more. Take it!!!\r\n\r\nMake sure to email Professor Dellaporta early in the fall semester to get the application (due in December).",
                "This course is AWESOME! If you get a chance to take it - DO IT, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! Dr. Dellaporta is one of the best professors (particularly in MCDB), and even if this course wasn't as good as it was, Dr. Dellaporta would make it worth it! The course itself is not too intensive, so long as you don't mind reading a genomics paper anywhere from 7 - 12 pages for a once-a-week discussion. I didn't find the material too difficult to get through, particularly once I got the hang of how to read this type of material. Discussions are very relaxed, but you will be expected to introduce a paper at least once over the course of the semester (a very low-stress assignment). In addition to weekly discussions, our final involved choosing a paper of our own interest and presenting it to the class, which was an extremely rewarding and exciting way to end the semester. Overall, this course, if you are able to get a spot, is one of the best MCDB courses available - and you should take it 10000%!",
                "Definitely take this course. It's rare to find another Yale course in which you learn a ton, the work is low, and the challenge is doable. It's a great treat for MCDB majors after 3 years of lectures. You'll leave with a far greater knowledge of the current state of genetics as well as several new friends.",

                "Definitely! Its the best MCDB elective Ive taken!",
