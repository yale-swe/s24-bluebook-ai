   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about all of the different disorders and feel comfortable with my understanding of each one. I also learned about what creates stigma, why it's such a big issue, and even recognized some of my own misconceptions. This course certainly made me more empathetic towards people experiencing these disorders and opened my eyes to the problems that they face. It also made me want to pursue further research in this field not only clinically but also regarding society and how we can improve the experiences of people suffering from these mental disorders.",
    "The pros and cons of DSM5 and learnt many of its disorders",
    "Lots of memorization as it is a summer class but overall very interesting. Everyone is impacted in some way or another by mental illnesses, and the knowledge I gained from this course I am sure I will apply in my everyday life. Prof. Joormann and Ashleigh (the TF) were also super kind and accommodating for the students, and it made the class experience enjoyable.",
    "I have a deeper understanding toward mental patients in details, knowing their difficulties in their lives and how to treat them properly. It was a great experience to communicate with students around the world and learnt their perspective. Its also a good chance to practice my English!",
    "I learned many fundamental knowledge about abnormal psychology and mental disorders. Most importantly, I learned that the diagnosis, research, and treatment of mental disorders can be more complex than we think.",
    "This course provided a strong overview of the practice of clinical psychology, and the diagnostic criteria and clinical pictures of various mental disorders. Through this class, I also learned to dismantle many implicit stigmas I held about mental illness. I would recommend all students take this course -- it would be especially great as a 5th class or credit\/d.",
    "A much greater understanding of the pathology of mental disorders and sympathy for those who suffer from them.",
    "breadth of knowledge on the clinical\/diagnostic aspects of abnormal psychology; ethical debates surrounding diagnoses; treatment options currently; biopsychosocial model of mental illness",
    "I learned about the psychology of disorders and treatment paradigms."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I think one of the strengths was that Professor Joormann focused more on the facts of each disorder that she discussed in the lectures, and Ms. Rutherford focused more on what changed clinicians and society should make. This combination was helpful because we had the ability to review and ensure that we understood the material factually, but also were able to deep-dive to ask ourselves some of the same questions that current professionals are dealing with right now. My only comment to improve the course is to be more cognizant of the amount of time between classes. I know sometimes between Thursday and Tuesday I only had 5 lecture videos, which I was able to complete very easily, and between Tuesday and Thursday I would have 15, which was more challenging considering it was 2 days vs. 5 days to complete the work. If you know that one topic will have more assignments I would try to assign when students have 5 days opposed to 2, so they have the opportunity to fully digest the material.",
    "Strengths- enjoyed the lecture videos. It was imformative \r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes i did not have any questions or doubts to post on the discussion page. Felt forced to post something as it was graded",
    "I think almost all the aspects are quite good since the professor and instructor are always willing to help us through our study and answer any question if we have.",
    "The strength is that it is well organized and the bi-weekly discussion sessions were effective. The grading and the exams are also fair. One weakness is that perhaps the timing of discussion sections for some students. Maybe having different discussion sections at different times would be more convenient for some students. Overall, it was a well designed course.",
    "Very informative and interesting. Could be improved with more projects\/assignments.",
    "Strengths: clear slides, reasonable workload, I enjoy having recorded lectures as homework so that I can take breaks or replay parts and then class time is used for clarifications and discussion, both professor and TA were knowledgeable and helpful and they cared about our learning\/understanding\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures don't have subtitles (or I just couldn't figure out how to get them), it would also be good for the class to both bring up and be more inclusive of other identities: for content, it would be interesting to look at diagnostic and care differences among races given U.S. history of flawed and biased healthcare of Black individuals especially. Also, while I know there is likely not enough data to include trans\/nonbinary identities when we discuss gender prevalence ratios, I think this population should be included in our studies given both their high rates of suicidality and the history of the DSM and gender identity. This could be improved by included recent research articles, in addition to the perspective pieces, in our reading assignments that supplement the textbook.\r\n\r\nOverall this class combines an abnormal psychology survey course with a public health and ethics of psychology seminar -- this makes the lecture course super great, but it also leaves you wanting more of the seminar piece. I realize you can only fit so much into a semester, so maybe there can be a follow up course to continue to dig deeper -- I don't really know. With all that said, wanting more is also a hallmark of a great course, so this isn't a dissatisfaction, but more so a desire to have a class that continues the conversation.",
    "I liked the interactive format."

    "I would definitely recommend this class. The workload was very manageable and interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed the discussions and I had the opportunity to learn from great teachers and excellent peers.",
    "Yes as it is a good summary of the DSM 5",
    "The material applies to everyone, even if you yourself don't struggle with mental illnesses. Makes this course important to take! Clinical psychology is important.",
    "Yes.\r\nThis field is quite interesting and the professor is very nice to all of the students. It was amazing to get in touch with other students and learnt from them.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to learn about the basics of psychology and mental disorders. It is a great introductory course into clinical psychology. Because of its introductory difficulty, I would even recommend it to any students who are simply interested.",
    "This course is great if you are interested in psychology or generally just interested in learning more about mental health and mental disorders! The course is fast-paced during the summer, and the live sessions are discussion sections, not lectures. This was a really nice component and was great considering the normal lecture course during the year is so big, it was nice to have more intimate discussions about the content with Professor Joorman and our TF, Ashleigh. Expect anywhere from 2-5 hours of lecture material to watch before each class, with at least one full textbook chapter and the occasional supplementary material. \r\n\r\nBased on someone who is slow at reading textbook chapters, it generally required about 5-12 hours of work before each class (2x\/week), including 2 quick discussion questions on Canvas. That being said, it's really well organized and if you actually take the time to thoroughly watch lectures and read the textbook (staying on top of it!) you'll do quite well! Exams were very fair and mostly multiple-choice w\/ about 2-3 short answer questions. The MC questions were very similar to those in the textbook as far as types of questions\/structure, so that's a great resource for studying. Would definitely recommend!",
    "Would definitely recommend!",
    "Definitely. I think everyone should learn about abnormal psychology because of its practicality. Everyone will be impacted by mental disorders at some point in their lives and they should be educated on them.",
    "Yes! It's a great course with a good professor, manageable workload, and interesting material.",
    "It's a good and interesting class with not too high of a workload."
