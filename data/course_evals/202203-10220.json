Caryl Phillips focuses primarily on character; that singlemindedness can feel limiting at times, but it justifies itself over time. The main skill this course develops is creating characters that feel like they matter.",
                "In this class I learned a lot about the craft of writing short stories. The 'how' of writing was broken down, it seemed, and I was left with a better understanding of the mechanics that make short stories tick."

                "Caz is an amazing instructor. He's always willing to meet to discuss a story or talk about what you're reading. I really appreciated his book recommendations during meetings. He's also great at facilitating discussions during workshops. He has some really great insights into the characters you create that will make your stories so much sharper. \r\n\r\nThe focus on two longer stories throughout the semester was also great. The required revisions meant you had the chance to totally rethink your story if you wanted.\r\n\r\nSome people in the class hadn't written any fiction before. It's a difficult situation, because many writing classes are hard to get into without prior experience. Caz stated that he admits you into the class if he feels like he can improve your writing, not if he thinks your writing is necessarily the best. But some people in the class were quite poor writers and their comments weren't at all helpful, which was a shame.",
                "I really loved everything about this course. No weaknesses!",
                "Strengths of the course are its focus on character, and its intimacy; with so few people, you can't really hide or stay silent, which is a good thing. There's very little feedback on the level of the language and the sentence, but the structure/content feedback is thorough enough that it doesn't really feel lacking."

                "Caz is amazing. Your character-based fiction will improve.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any person who loves to write. On the first day of class, Caz said that we were all there for the same reason, that we all have the same affliction a big imagination. If you need an outlet for your ideas, and structure to your creativity, I recommend this course.",
                "I'd recommend this course to anybody who is serious about fiction, but I wouldn't recommend it as a casual creative writing class.",
                "This course is fantastic! If anything, it gives you the impetus to finish and revise your fiction. I loved workshops; they fine-tuned the way I analyze short stories, including my own. No matter how good your fiction may already be, you'll still learn something from this course."
