I had a difficult time figuring out what specific, perhaps under-researched issue I was going to explore in my senior essay, but by looking into the details that were noted, but not fully elaborated upon in the literature I was reading I was able to locate a more precise topic. I also learned to go beyond the literature, and seek out oral testimony, which has been especially relevant for my topic. With the help of my advisor and librarian, I was able to figure out how to properly stage this kind of interview, which questions to ask, and how to best document it.",
