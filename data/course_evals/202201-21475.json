                "The only thing I would change about the course would be to focus a bit more on casual speaking and conversation. The textbook included grammar that I don't think I would ever use when speaking to others in Chinese.",
                "One strength of this course is our daily interactions. I enjoyed how the class was very engaging and everyone wanted to learn. A weakness of this course is the textbook. I understand that the grammar in this textbook is needed, but the content is not applicable to daily life.",
                "strength is that ao lao shi is very passionate and enthusiastic about teaching\r\n\r\nthat said, she grades pretty strictly and the participation feels forced at times",
