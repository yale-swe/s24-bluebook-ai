                "One of the biggest take aways from this class is to take into consideration the perspective of scientists. They are often blind and make various assumptions that are baseless, especially regarding sexuality.",
                "I learned about the history of sexuality as a science and how it developed throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. I learned about Freud and Foucault's conceptions of sexuality. I was also exposed to more modern works on sexuality, particularly the role of science as a way of understanding sexuality. I also gained some brief exposure to science and technology studies, which is very interesting and will change your whole view on science. Overall, I really unlearned a lot of the misconceptions I had about sex and sexuality. I gained a greater appreciation for asking questions of what is largely taken to be true or natural, which is something that is so important to think about as students and human beings. Also, on a more practical level, I learned how to analyze primary sources and work with archives.",
                "I learned so much in this course. I've seen how sexuality has ebbed and flowed throughout history and how so many factors play a role in how we view sexuality as a science and as an art.",
                "This class was very mind-opening to the role that sexuality plays throughout the history of society. I learned how the views surrounding sexuality have shifted through history as well as how they influence the modern day.",
                "I learned about the origins of sexuality studies and how the initial texts decided much of our current conversations on sexuality today. I also gained an in depth understanding of what sexuality encompasses and how many biases are present in scientific fields",
                "History of sexuality and the past and current perspective of the society towards homosexuals. We read many many many articles relating to polygamy, homosexuality, theories on sexuality, psychologists' analysis of homosexuality, and scientific studies on this topic.",
                "A better understanding of the history of sexuality through various readings/scientific texts including Freud and foucault, Angela Willey's scientific text on Undoing Monogamy, and some scientific surveys.",
                "improved writing + editing skills; greater understanding of historical perspectives on sexuality + their relation to societal depictions of sexuality today; deeper understanding of the weaknesses of humans conducting natural sciences, particularly with reference to studies on sexuality; a basic understanding of the relationship between race and sexuality (I would like to learn about this more); increased appreciation for the value of studying texts even though they contain deeply problematic elements (e.g. Kraft-Ebbing)",
                "I really learned how to dissect historical texts. I also learned about how sexuality developed and how it varies between cultures. This course allowed me to actually have discourse about sexuality in a way that I had never had before.",
                "This course teaches you to rethink the way you view / judge / analyze situations. We didn't just explore the history of sexuality - we covered why and how it was told the way it was. As the course went on, I realized more and more how dangerous assumptions made by the scientific community can be, and I learned the importance of multiple perspectives in research."

                "I enjoyed the discussion format, especially sharing our emotions before class.",
                "This course only has strengths! I could go on and on about how amazing this course was, even in a remote learning environment. I think by far the biggest strength is Professor Trumpler herself. She is so wise and caring. Every discussion with her was incredible, and she has a way of drawing out the best in each and everyone one of us. She was always providing some bit of historical context or a new perspective on a reading that would just completely change my entire view. She was also so so SO accommodating and understanding. Before every class, we would have a little check-in to say what we felt about the readings, and having a class where what I felt mattered was so important for me, especially as a remote student. She was also so understanding of what was going on, and she was always willing to give an extension or offer pass/fail in order to make things easier for us. She is such an amazing human being and I wish I could've met her and had class with her in person. The other strength was just the class environment itself. Everyone was so insightful and engaged; every discussion I felt I was learning so much from my classmates. It was great to be able to form that little community even through a remote setting. Also the content is AMAZING! We read texts that traced the beginning of sexology like Krafft-Ebing and Malinowksi. We also read Freud and Foucault, which prompted one of the most incredible discussions ever. Towards the end of the class, we got to more modern works, particularly ones that dealt with science and sexuality, and reading Undoing Monogamy is incredible! That book will just blow your mind! Also the workload was never overwhelming. Again, Prof T is so understanding and really wants to make the class a space for learning and sharing. She also helps you so much when it comes to writing your papers, and I have become a better writer because of it. NO WEAKNESSES!",
                "I think this course is amazing. The professor is amazing. The readings are well chosen, and the discussion is extremely engaging.",
                "The frequently and lengthy readings for each class made it difficult to remain engaged in the information because of short amount of time offered to properly digest information.",
                "Professor Trumpler was a strength because she was great at hearing everyones opinions on the topics and adding her own interpretations as well. The texts were all very interesting and the workload was fair. I loved the variety of texts we got to look into",
                "Very interesting topics and engaging conversations/guest speakers. However, readings should be much shorter. Assigning a huge reading (a full book or article of 50 pages) due in a few days for discussion only forces students to skim everything and make up answers.",
                "Absolutely love Professor Trumpler. The readings could be a bit dense and overwhelming in the beginning, but the seminars make everything worthwhile because prof trumpler and your peers will help dissect the text during class.",
                "strengths: well-organized, readings were extremely engaging and interesting, discussions were thought-provoking and illuminating, workload was not too laborious and felt useful and fulfilling \r\n\r\nhow it could be improved: only one comment- the fact that the class met Tuesday and Thursday meant that it was very manageable to complete the readings due Tuesday, but readings due Thursday were more difficult to complete because there are only two days between Tuesday and Thursday. I'm not sure if this has already been considered, but maybe it would be possible to assign shorter readings due Thursday compared to the ones due Tuesday, especially if there are readings assigned for both Tuesday and Thursday.",
                "A huge strength was the chronological order of sources. We were able to look at when sexuality was first mentioned scientifically as well as texts by people who were just writing about their own lives.",
                "the professor is an amazing tea her who accommodates for her students! i learned a lot about the history of sexuality and ways to understand it",
                "Course is taught in an extremely engaging manner, and you will love every source you read."

For the usual go-arounds, because everyone appears in different spots on their screens, she would have an order already set up, so conversation always went smoothly. Also, sometimes we would be put into breakout rooms to discuss certain readings or sources and she did a great job of setting them up and giving us questions to spark conversation. Also, the willingness to push back a deadline or offer lenience in grading due to particularly stressful events was very helpful.",

The texts are so well chosen and provide create insight to the history of sexuality. The professor is also a sweetheart and super considerate of her students. One of the only classes where I felt human.",
                "YES! PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! This course got me through my remote semester. Everyone should take a WGSS course and this is one of the best! It is absolutely incredible! You will come away from this course with a totally different outlook and attitude toward sexuality and sex and science. Prof T is an absolute gem! She is so caring and brilliant! All of our discussions were incredibly insightful and engaging. You get to read Freud in a way that you might not have in other classes (don't let that scare you! This class will change the way you think about Freud in ways that might surprise you). Also, getting to read Foucault as well and understand his views on sexuality, discourse, and power is so incredible and makes you evaluate how sex is discussed and talked about in your everyday life. This course is also a great first exposure to STS (science and technology studies). As a STEM student, gaining a new perspective on science as something that is not objective or the end-all-be-all was incredibly transformative for me. It will change the way you think about science, not just the science of sexuality, but of biology, chemistry, physics, and so much more. Also, the guest speakers were incredible. Reading Angela Wiley's book Undoing Monogamy and then having the chance to talk with her and ask her about her experiences in \"queering\" science was truly amazing. This class was truly and amazing, transformative experience for me! I wish so much that I would've been able to take it in person, but even over Zoom, Prof T created a lively, friendly space to tackle some tough questions with equally engaged and insightful students. I can only imagine how incredible the class will be in person. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!!! TAKE THIS CLASS!",
                "I would recommend this course to any first-year who can take it! It's truly a beautiful introduction to the study of sexuality for any curious about what it means to study sexuality.",
                "I would recommend this for any student interested in gender and sexuality studies, especially for those in the LGBTQ+ community. This class was very inspiring and eye opening, and I am grateful to have learned so much about this subject area.",
                "Yes definitely! I think it gave me great perspective and I really enjoyed learning about different biases and interpreting topics from multiple directions",
                "Yes it is great for students wanting to learn and get english writing credit without worrying about grades. With the elimination of stress on grades comes interest in learning the topic itself.",
                "Yes! You learn so much about sexuality, and I think it was great coming into this class as a STEM/prehealth major.",
                "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course. It's a great way to actually learn historical perspectives on sexuality, and it helps you understand the historical basis behind why sexuality is treated the way it is today. Additionally, it's also a fantastic way to hone your paper-writing skills in a relatively low-stakes environment with lots of support. I really enjoyed this class and I think most (if not all) of my classmates agree.",
                "I definitely would. it allowed me to look at the world differently and to question science a lot.",
                "YES. Whatever you major in, PLEASE take this course! You will learn so much about the way you view the world and others - everything in this course can not only applicable to our lives but also to our careers. From scientific articles to works of philosophy to journal entries to comics, we covered a diverse range of media that was fascinating to read and explore. I was personally surprised by how many presumptions people - including myself - considered as truth, and this can be dangerous in the scientific community."
