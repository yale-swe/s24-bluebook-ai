    "I learned a lot of Chinese (aka zhongwen, if you're into that)",
    "This class has been very helpful in expanding my vocabulary and my cultural knowledge. The units have helped me understand a lot of modern Chinese history and culture that I did not know before and I feel as though I can confidently write and converse about these topics.",
    "Definitely a step in a new direction for the chinese sequence. I started with L1 at Yale, and this course is now a transition less into learning new vocab but rather new sentence structures, differentiation of similar words when appropriate and exchanging all of the elementary vocab with more sophisticated speech.",
    "Really improved my written, oral, and reading skills. Also, great emphasis on Chinese culture.",
    "A sense for formal vs. informal Chinese",
    "Aspects of Chinese culture like online dating, brand-name fever, television dramas, regional economic development, floating population, and marriage traditions. Also learned a lot of advanced vocabulary and grammar.",
    "New aspects of modern China and vocabulary related to these topics",
    "I learnt mainly how to discuss the topics that we covered, for example online dating and tv.",
    "Formal Chinese"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course could be improved by having a classroom closer to the rest of campus. Also, it should move a little faster to cover more interesting topics.",
    "This course is taught directly out of the textbook. You learn many relevant vocabulary and sentence structures, and I think this course does a very good job of emphasizing the differences between conversational\/casual Mandarin and formal language, particularly with regard to grammar. \r\n\r\nI personally often get frustrated with character memorization, mainly because I feel it promotes a memorization based learning style and I often still don't know how to apply and actually use a word or sentence pattern even when I've memorized it. However, I think Zhou Laoshi does a great job of helping us see how these different pieces of the language are relevant to everyday use. Oral and writing assignments are particularly helpful, because he gives us prompts that are relevant to our own lives and asks us to use the recent vocabulary in responding.",
    "Teacher is very proactive and engaging in teaching Chinese. Course content a bit repetitive (same weekly format). Quizzes are pretty hard sometimes.",
    "Not super well organized to facilitate long-term learning, instead structured in a way that encouraged cramming",
    "The daily quizzes, oral presentations, essays, assignments, exams, and meetings with tutors will really improve your Chinese. Could be a bit monotonous at times because you're closely following the textbook and it's all routine, but Zhou Laoshi is incredibly funny and reasonable and understanding.",
    "Professor Zhou is the sweetest professor ever. His teaching style is also clear and coherent. However, the largeness of the class makes it hard for us to follow and stay engaged.",
    "the content was interesting and it wasn't as intense \/ stressful as most language classes. I feel like it could be more challenging if maybe we had to write longer essays, or do essay corrections, or write a longer essay by the end of the class by writing it paragraph by paragraph.",
    "There were too many students and the professor did not care individual students."

    "If you took a Light Fellowship, do not. It's a waste of time. If you're a first year, then take it because you have to. I just think that the level of the course is too low, all of it was review.",
    "Yes. This is one of the foundational courses required before you can take any option courses, so that alone should be incentive to take it, but it is also a very accessible and interesting course on its own.",
    "Absolutely! Zhou laoshi is fantastic",
    "Yes. If you are trying to improve your Chinese, you really will.",
    "Yes, the materials are interesting and your Chinese will improve a lot.",
    "Would recommend, only if the section has 10 people or less"
