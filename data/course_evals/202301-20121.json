The workload is pretty unbalanced, at the beginning of the semester our homework assignments would take double the amount that was given towards the end.

I think the professor and the teaching style in the class was excellent and I learned a lot and progressed in my abilities to speak French, but it also hindered me from being able to take a fifth class or another class with an intense workload because I was scared I couldnt handle it.",
