This is particularly helpful for students who just entered a new field of research. Also, this course presents the students with ancient paintings, maps, books and scrolls at Beinecke, which is both an ideal way of teaching and a rare opportunity to appreciate the cultural relics in hand. Perhaps the course can give a more thorough introduction on ancient booksFor example, how did ancient Chinese scholars tell that whether a claimed-to-be ancient text was forged or not?"
