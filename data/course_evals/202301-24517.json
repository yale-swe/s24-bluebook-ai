I learned of so many different perspectives from which the story could be told, read a tremendous amount of primary documents, and discovered that the Civil War is one area where it feels impossible to have an original take.",

                "Somebody in a past evaluation said that you learn how to skim readings, which I agree with. You cannot do all the readings for this class; it is 200-300 pages a week of often quite dense material. So you have to learn how to get the information out of the readings that you need in the time you have. My suggestion is to prioritize McPherson and Foner so you understand the facts, and try to get to McCurry and Charles Dew (125 pages!), then go to the primary sources books only when you're writing your papers. Also, most of the books are available free online, so don't spend $200 buying books you'll barely read.",
                "I learned so much about the Civil War and American History in general that, as an international student, was very interesting. After this course I kind of get the whole American patriotism and where the fundamental divisions in this country stem from. One of my favourite courses at Yale for sure!",

Many new insights about the nuanced perspectives from soldiers to home front families to leaders.

                "Through this course, I learned in-depth about the years leading up to the Civil War, the war itself, and Reconstruction. The course especially deepened my knowledge of the social history of the Civil War, because much of the course focuses on the experiences of individuals instead of just the major figures discussed in textbooks, like Abraham Lincoln.",

This course enhanced my knowledge of the causes, effects, events, and historiography of the Civil War and Reconstruction periods. It allowed me to build upon my knowledge of not only political events, economic patterns, and battles relating to the period, but also social history, and the narratives of individuals who lived at the time.",

If anything, the course provided me with a strong foundation of Civil War history and a look at the intricacies of Civil War and Reconstruction events that are often presented as monolithic in high school classes.",
                "I feel like this course taught me a lot about what I don't know as a history major and what skills I need to improve on. A lot of this class was making big claims about overarching themes, which was something I wasn't used to. I also learned a pretty nuanced view of the Civil War that I hadn't had the opportunity to learn about before this class.",

                "Prof Blight is a very engaging lecturer, but time management quite honestly was a consistent inhibitor to him covering all the content. Perhaps making it a 1h15m lecture or 3/week.",
                "The essay prompts are an unfortunate combination of long and vague. They ask many (extremely broad) questions with the expectation of a 5-page response. I think it's crazy to ask 'why did the Confederacy lose the war' as only part of a much longer question, and expect a sharp essay which touches on all relevant points. I wish there were more prompts, but that they were briefer and less vague. The strengths were many: the readings were excellent, the lectures exciting, and the section honestly enlightening.",
                "Interesting lectures, great TF (Daniel)",
                "Too much reading. Exceedingly difficult, even impossible, to keep up with weekly readings in excess of 300 pages. Little relevance to lectures, which were idiosyncratic and unpredictable, if entertaining.",
                "The content of the course is taught in an extremely interesting and engaging way.",
                "Professor Blight is one of the most passionate lecturers I ever had. His verve will inspire you.",
                "The strengths and weaknesses are both David Blight. He's a cute old man professor that will tell you the best Civil War bedtime stories and have great takes on the world around him but the lecture is mostly bedtime stories and hot takes. As far as the assignments go, I liked the final -- the review sheet is large but if you have a good grasp of the review sheet there will be no surprises -- but Blight's prompts tend to be massive questions (\"Who caused the Civil War?\" or \"Is the Civil War an example of progress?\") that are impossible to answer within the pages you get. I thought the key was to pick a lane and support it with the evidence you have and don't worry you're not coming close to an exhaustive essay, but most people seemed to dislike the prompts.",
                "Blight is a really great professor, though I thought his lectures could be a bit hard to follow at times. The storytelling he weaves in is so interesting, but ultimately can distract from the lectures main argument. Too much reading!!",
                "Professor Blight without a doubt. His lectures were amazing.",
                "Strengths: Excellent lecturer with extremely engaging stories - you'll not find a better lecture series on campus. A sense of the human cost and contribution of the war. Structured sections with activities fill in content gaps and clarify timeline/concepts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A LOT of reading is assigned - very interesting but not feasible to finish within the week; it's the student's responsibility to prioritize which pieces to read, which to skim, and which to skip. Minimal emphasis on military engagements during the war or economic changes after the war. Difficult to place events on a timeline, but every event is contextualized.",
                "Strengths - amazing lecturer, amazing TF, great readings\r\nWeaknesses - lectures could veer somewhat from readings",
                "What first seemed like a weakness--the near-impossible reading list--turned out to be a strength. It was soon realized that not all books were necessary to read, and the breadth of texts made it so that each student could engage deeply with the sub-subjects that interested them.",
                "Lecture presumes lots of knowledge about happenings of war, which wasnt always a good assumption to make about audience. Didnt focus on battle strategy/battle specifics, which was appreciated. \r\nDavid blight is obviously a civil war whiz and a pleasure to watch/hear speak.",
                "It's a great class. My TA (Daniel) was amazing, and the lectures and readings are all interesting. The only thing to know is that Blight isn't a very structured lecturer -- he always just talks about what he thinks is interesting and usually goes 10 minutes over. It doesn't bother me much because he's so good, but it can be annoying at times.",
                "Somewhat overwhelming reading load, that could be narrowed down to highlight key points for interesting discussions. Professor Blight's lectures were mesmerizing--like your grandpa reading a great epic tale.",
                "All of Professor Blight's lectures are fascinating and added a lot to my understanding. Professor Blight is the best history lecturer I have had while at Yale because he makes all of his lectures incredibly engaging and incorporates a lot of his research. While there was a lot of reading, I really enjoyed all of the books and articles in the course. As someone who does not enjoy finals, I would have preferred a third essay instead of a final worth 40% of my grade, but that is only a minor downside of the course.",
                "I do wish that Professor Blight's lectures discussed more of the material we read in McPherson and other texts. Writing essays and studying for exams proved more difficult than other history classes because I had to rely solely on the text rather than pulling from the readings and lectures.",
                "The lectures were general but very interesting. Blight is a great storyteller. The readings were where you got the detail.",
                "This course had very interesting lectures and discussion sections, but it was very difficult to get through the amount of reading that was assigned. If less reading was assigned, section discussions would have been more productive.",
                "The lectures were great and I really like how free the TFs were to teach section how they wanted.",
                "the lectures are incredibly strong because blight is so knowledgeable on the subject. there is an astronomical amount of reading and i think more of it would be completed if the total amount was reduced. i also think a bit more time on the reconstruction era may be better for our conception of the era as a continuous one.",
                "Strengths: professor is incredible, content is interesting; weakness: sections were very unstandardized and grading felt a little arbitrary",
                "Course is a large lecture hall that would benefit from more intimate discussion beyond discussion sections",
                "Blight is an incredible lecturer, readings are interesting, some work but not overwhelming. The paper topics are too broad, however. Theyre the kinds of things you would see on an exam but are hard to write a compelling argument with",
                "S: We cover a lot of material and it feels like a fair portrayal of the war. There's not too much than an average history student wouldn't already know, but Blight gives some specific details, story, and poetry that try to bring the stories and emotions of the war to life. The readings, although a lot, are great texts I think I will keep for a long time. \r\nW: Lectures can be a bit chronologically scattered, and sometimes too much time is spent on secondary stories or figures rather than the main events. A fine section, but I don't think it's necessary for the course. Also not much time spent on Lincoln's beliefs and ideologies, very big picture overview. \r\n\r\nMy biggest complaint was that Blight, although a great professor, has a lot of biases that come through in his lectures. He makes jabs on contemporary politics, conservatives, the religious right, and the Republican Party. Whether it's guns, abortion, elections, or Trump, he would make passing comments that showed his personal beliefs, and seemed out of place in a history lecture. It distracted from the course material, was unnecessary in the large lecture context, and was very frequent. Each class having at least a couple disparaging political comments. It didn't feel discriminatory, but it annoying.",
                "Strengths - well-structured for someone used to history classes, interesting course material, and helpful TAs. Professor Blight is a huge strength as well! He's an excellent lecturer and makes the material fun to learn. Weaknesses - I don't know how Prof. Blight expects us to read so much (~500 pages per week sometimes) and come to discussion sections prepared. I felt like I was having to pick and choose which readings to do each week, and found that a lot of the money I spent on books early in the semester went to waste.",
                "Strengths-- variety of texts and comprehensive overview of Civil War\r\n\r\nWeaknesses-- lack of visual aids during class",
                "There was so much reading that nobody thought it was realistic and nobody did the reading.",
                "Lecture aids",
                "Strengths: blights personality and lectures. Weaknesses: section. People did not do the reading and we had very few substantive discussions.",
                "The strengths of the course are the diversity of the chosen texts (primary documents, secondary documents, documents pertaining to both the history and Union, and documents that cover the perspective of women and enslaved people as well), the variety and active nature of lectures, and the engagement involved in discussion section. The combination of discussions, lectures, and thorough texts allowed for a nuanced and extensive understanding of the events discussed in the course.\r\nA slight weakness of the course is the density of information that was necessary to cover in shorter periods of time.",
                "Great lectures and conversations in section",
                "The lectures by Professor Blight were incredible and engaging. I never failed to be anything short of entranced by his opening and closing remarks, and even the meat of each lecture always gave me at least one profound insight or takeaway. Unfortunately, much of my course experience was hindered by an overbearing amount of readings and a rather lackluster discussion section. The McPherson is certainly something everyone should read at some point in their life, but I'm not sure trudging through it is the best path the course should take. Instead, focusing on primary source books like the Gienapp and Lincoln Reader encourage a development of historical understanding and method that would be more beneficial for a history course. In terms of my discussion section, my teaching fellow was, according to themself, ill-equipped to be leading a discussion section about the Civil War. They also just generally promoted a class environment that was not conducive to learning. That part of the course really was a disappointment and hampered my overall experience and enjoyment of what was otherwise an in-depth and thorough examination of the Civil War era.",
                "Strengths: This was my favorite course of the year! Professor Blight is a fantastic and engaging lecturer, so much so that I was upset when lectures were over! Essay assignments provided interesting prompts and were not at all overwhelming, and discussion sections helped me not only organize the material that I had learned but also identify and analyze important themes and trends across the massive amount of material covered in the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Readings are interesting and greatly enrich the lecture material, but the quantity of reading assigned every week is very high, and part of this course is choosing the readings that you will and will not complete.",
                "The readings are really interesting and Professor Blight is a great lecturer, the TFs are also wonderful and very helpful with digging into the information provided in the readings and the lectures.\r\n\r\nOne big weakness is the amount of reading: it is a huge amount of reading for a 50 minute twice a week course, especially since very little of the reading is actually covered in lecture. Professor Blight also gets distracted easily and falls behind, which was frustrating because I didn't have a strong background in the subject.",
                "This course was wonderful. The only weakness it has is that it is difficult to condense all of the content into a single semester.",
                "The major strength of this course is Professor Blight himself. I'd listen to him talk about anything, actually. His passion for history--and within that, his passion for human stories--is infectious and entrancing. This passion is obvious in the way he recounts the story of the Civil War, but also in other things--in his love for poetry (particularly Whitman, read from his lovingly dog-eared copy), the many striking diary entries which he reads aloud, and through his repeated ability to connect history to the present day.",
                "Blight is maybe my favorite lecturer ever at Yale. I wish there had been fewer readings or that TAs had picked certain readings to discuss because not everyone did the same ones, which made our discussions far less rich than I think they could have been."

                "If you're expecting to learn a ton about the Civil War, read McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom (which he assigns) and skip taking this class. Blight is a very engaging lecture, but his lectures feel like something you'd hear at your local library or a conference -- they don't add up to a full understanding of the Civil War. That being said, even if his lectures are usually on anecdotes, they're on terrific anecdotes. He tells stories of individual people -- two escaped slaves, Yale students who fought in the Civil War, Frederick Douglass and Walt Whitman -- that are always great to hear. That being said, the lectures are mostly independent from the material you need to know to write the papers and take the final.",
                "If they REALLY like the civil war, maybe. But even then it stays pretty surface level, so a seminar would probably be better. Of course prof Blight is also a huge reason to consider the course, but if he had a seminar Id recommend that instead.",
                "Absolutely. This is one of those courses that all Yalies should take!",
                "Yes. You must take a course with Prof. Blight. This is the kind of humanizing storytelling and contextualized history that makes a Yale education worth it. If you are concerned about the readings and tests, I'd recommend Credit/D-ing so that you can take the course at your own pace, but there is so much American heritage and explanation here that it's worth finding a way to attend the lectures regardless of the academic value of the course.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. Professor Blight was an amazing lecturer and storyteller who was also very knowledgeable on the subject. The readings were also very helpful and presented a lot of great, interesting perspectives on the historical period.",
                "Yes. It is a good overview of the time, and the texts are wonderful.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, but I would caution them that theres a lot of reading, and the lectures can be hard to follow if you havent done all of it.",
                "Yes! Such a good history class about a really important period. Great professor, great readings, and my TA was great.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to history majors or any non-majors considering taking a history class. The reading load for each week is heavy, but Professor Blight is a fascinating lecturer and I learned a significant amount about the Civil War era from taking the course. I always looked forward to going to each class. My Teaching Fellow was fantastic and gave us feedback that helped us improve our writing.",
                "Absolutely it is a wonderful course overall.",
                "Yes, I would. It was a quick but detailed look at the Civil War.",
                "Yes. Professor Blight is excellent. Be aware that the reading can be a lot (especially if you're taking this class \"on the side\") and much of it is necessary to given the style of the lectures. Blight's lectures focus more on providing interesting insight and perspective on the material than covering everything comprehensively.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it is important to learn the history of the civil war. I also loved Professor Blight's lectures.",
                "Yes, most definitely.",
                "i would. if you are at all interested in history/want to take a history lass, this is a typical yale class. the professor is the leading intellectual in the era (many of the books on the syllabus are his) and you will benefit tremendously from his lectures and descriptions of the decades of archival research he has done.",
                "I would, but only if you're really interested in the content. Otherwise, it's hard to stay motivated past midpoint. I took it bc my friend recommended, and overall enjoyed it, but definitely lost momentum",
                "Yes, very informative and captivatingly taught",
                "Yes! Just a great lecture and a must-take for any history major, but interesting for anyone.",
                "Yes! Everyone should learn about the Civil War, regardless of major. If you don't know much, this is a great chance to get a big picture look, and it's more focused on the politics and ideological battles behind the war (rather than the actual battle strategies). If you are familiar with the war, as I was, you'll still walk away with a lot. The lectures are interesting, the readings are good, and the papers make you think!",
                "Yes! As long as you have an interest in the subject, the course is engaging and super interesting.",
                "Absolutely, if you feel that your understanding of the Civil War is at all lacking. I was lucky enough to recieve a great US History education, and so at times found myself retreading information, but even still I gained a much greater appreciation for the nuances of this historical moment.",
                "Yes! I learned so much about the Civil War, and learned a lot of skills that I can apply to future history classes.",
                "I would with the understanding that you only get out what you put in. You could get through this course without learning much if you do the bare minimum.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes",
                "It depends. If you have no knowledge of the civil war and youre interested in it, then yes. Frankly, you can get a lot of info from this course thru google because discussions were rarely illuminating. Blight is a fun Professor but his lectures are often hard to follow.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student, particularly to students interested in American history and/or twentieth century history. It provides a narrative of the Civil War and Reconstruction that stretches beyond a series of events to delve into individual perspectives and the lasting historiography behind the war. The course was taught in a vary engaging manner, connecting events and effects of the Civil War to modern events and the larger discipline of history. It was a very enjoyable and rewarding course to take.",
                "Yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! This was my favorite course of the year, and it provided me with not only a rich understanding of the Civil War and Reconstruction eras but also a deeply moving reflection on the evolution and nature of the American identity and the ways in which the darkest chapters of American history are remembered. This class was a welcome intellectual challenge, a rare course that seems to have had a genuine impact on the ways in which I view American society and that has expanded my knowledge of the Civil War era far beyond what I learned in high school history class. I am not a history major, and I would readily recommend this course to anyone with the space in their schedule to take it.",
                "Professor Blight is a super entertaining lecturer and incredibly knowledgable about his field, and I would recommend taking this class just for the fun of it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone. I feel that the content is important to know and there is no one better to teach it than Professor Blight.",
                "Take this class. I was doubtful about taking a class on the Civil War, but his class is not really about military strategy--it's about the people involved in the war and the many ideologies, conflicts, and emotions at play in it.",
                "Yes! You'll walk away with a better understanding of an important period in American history, and you'll get to experience Blight's lectures."
