I don't think the library session is super helpful; maybe we could have a more specific training on Zotero or qualitative research tools or GIS?",
                "I really enjoyed getting to meet with other seniors and hear about their research methods and processes. It was great to be in a group with others coming from a variety of different academic disciplines and backgrounds, because I got to learn about how research is approached from those perspectives and how to discuss work across disciplines. \r\nThe early assignments were not necessarily particularly useful to my final project in the form I submitted them, but I think they work well in that they function as deadlines for making important decisions (research question, what sources to use, etc.).",
                "The meeting schedule was a bit disorganized. Certain weeks I wasnt sure if we would meet or not. Sometimes Id come into the classroom assuming we were meeting, but we didnt. Overall the colloquium wasnt really helpful. If anything the time could have been better used to work on thesis independently. I think the structured class meeting times should be replaced by optional office hours. It felt like a waste of time to come in and sit there for 40 minutes, maybe sharing a piece of evidence with others. In addition, the assignment timeline seemed a bit delayed. I would have preferred assignments be due a week or two earlier than they actually were this semester, in order to better keep us students on track. For example, the thesis outline felt like it came out of nowhere, in addition to the thesis draft. The assignments before felt too basic and easy to fulfill, like a piece of data or evidence or a few sources.",
                "It would be nice if the weekly assignments corresponded more to writing the real thesis",
                "I think the strengths are the discussions we have as a mentor group, but one way to improve the course would be to make the increase in workload a little more gradual over the course of the semester"
