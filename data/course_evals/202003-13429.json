                "I enjoyed getting to learn about my peers' projects, but at times I felt as though the class was taking up time that I could otherwise have spent writing my essay.",
                "The biggest strength was the meeting with the librarian and how much that helped with getting more sources. Other than that, I really didn't get much out of the course, other than it keeping me on a schedule for my thesis, which was nice. However, I wish we didn't have to spend two hours per week discussing readings that felt irrelevant. I would prefer have two hours to turn on zoom and work on our theses, being able to ask the professor questions if we came across any during our two hour set aside work time.",
                "Strength - Professor Hierro really tries to juggle all 20 ish students' projects which is a difficult task.\r\nWeakness - We often read readings which were very unrelated to most of our projects. Professor Hierro did not give us much time in our groups to actually discuss our projects. I felt I often had no direction or idea of what a senior thesis in Political Science should look like, and my peers felt the same. We often thought Professor Hierro thought we were not trying, but we were lost and could not express it to Professor Hierro. This class should be kept but redesigned with better timelines. The assignments should actually be chunks of our thesis we submit.",
                "Strengths: facilitated one on one time with the professor; provided structure for thesis work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: had a lot of big deadlines but not little ones; for instance, students were asked early own to write a memo describing our research question, motivation, and potential methodology when many had not even pinned down a question. A lot more time near the beginning of the course should have given students research deadlines so that they could pin down a solid research question before moving forward",
                "Many of the assignments bore little connection to thesis writing and seemed more geared to having students just check the boxes.",
                "Strengths: Excellent peer and instructor feedback!!\r\nWeaknesses: Not made for all political science students.",
                "I think the department may want to reconsider this course. I understand the desire to make sure that students writing senior essays receive some exposure to research design, but I think that this course comes a little too late for that, and its focus on discussing research design and workshopping students' designs felt like it kept me in the planning stages of my project when I wanted to be starting on my research. I think that allowing students more time for research during their senior year could help us produce stronger projects. Instead of keeping this course in its current form, I think it could be helpful to have some sort of methods requirement before the senior year so that the class component of this course can be scaled down. Meeting for two hours a week was a lot (and the full two hours of seminar discussion was really, really challenging over Zoom!), so instead of this really being a class, I think it would be much more helpful to have something that met for a shorter span of time during the week and was much more focused on organic discussions among students so that we can talk through our challenges and ideas as we actually do our research, to troubleshoot together. In the Zoom format, I think breakout rooms can be useful to this. So I would support a methods requirement before senior year so that this course can look less like a formal class. \r\n\r\nI think Prof. Hierro made a really strong effort this semester! She was great about giving us very specific and timely comments on our work, and I also appreciated that she solicited student feedback herself on the last day of class and at a few points earlier in the semester. I also liked that Prof. Hierro put us in small groups at the start of the semester based off of our projects, and I would have liked for us to do more in these small groups throughout the semester (especially since we ended up having like 18 people, which is a lot for seminar discussions). Instead of the big, formal presentations in front of the whole class, I would have preferred smaller and more frequent check-ins with the people in my group. \r\n\r\nIt was also nice that Prof. Hierro listened to our feedback about the first quiz and designed a second \"quiz\" assignment that was more suited to our individual projects. Overall, I think she did a good job but the purpose that this class is expected to serve is just very difficult to work with.",
                "It does what it is meant to do. The virtual format took away robbed some of its effect, but I nevertheless found meaning and motivation."

I've learned a lot about (1) what my academic interests actually are, (2) information\/recent scholarship related to my academic interests, and (3) political science as a field by coming up with my own project, working with an adviser, and planning to carry out a long-term and serious research project. I would highly recommend! Even if you're not excited about this course, it is doable and you'll still get to spend most of your time on the research and paper itself, not this class.",
