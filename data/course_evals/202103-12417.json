I learned this using mathematical models and intuitions, historical examples, and current examples surrounding the covid pandemic. I gained a better insight as to how the fed decides to set interest rates, and how those interest rates affect other metrics like GDP.

                "Strengths: well-organized, prof and TAs were helpful. Learned some macro. Weaknesses: Not a very compelling course, dull material, sometimes very long psets. Would have liked it more if we learnt more real-world applications",

                "The sections for this course were incredibly helpful for understanding the math covered in the problem sets and exams; however, the sections covered the math for the previously due problem set, rather than the upcoming problem set. Since lectures move at such a quick pace and spend more time covering concepts and derivations than mathematical applications, it would have been much more beneficial to discuss the math relating to upcoming problem sets in sections.",
                "Strengths: good peer tutors and team of TFs\r\nWeaknesses: would prefer 2 midterms instead of 1 because there was a lot of pressure during each exam given those 2 assessments made up 80% of the grade.",
                "This course could be taught more clearly",
                "The strengths of this course is the clear division and theme of each unit.  The topics were grouped together intelligently and the transition into a new unit was clear.  The TF's were also very helpful in recapping material learned during lectures.  A weakness of the course is the inconsistency of the difficulty and styles of the problem sets.",
                "could use more conceptual discussions beyond just the mathematics",
                "A major strength was our TF, who always was able to present topics covered in class in a new, but clear and concise manner. Also, our professor always seemed engaged with students and encouraged us to come to him with any confusion we may have had. The biggest downside was the inconsistency between some of the psets; some were much more helpful with understanding the course material, while others seemed like hours of busy work.",

Sometimes the lecture slides that are posted on Canvas are a little different than the ones presented in class, which sometimes made it confusing in terms of note-taking. This became less of an issue later on throughout the course, so maintaining the status quo would be great.\r\n2. I wish there were more explanations on the lecture slides - sometimes I'd be looking back at some slides and I wouldn't understand what was going on in the slide. It definitely is on me for not taking more detailed lecture notes, but it would help a lot.",
                "The strengths were that the course was interesting and the topics were all relevant to our current world. A weakness was that some of the material that was quite difficult was covered very quickly, while some of the easier material had tons of time dedicated to it.",
                "Lectures were useful but sometimes dwelled on one topic for too long.  Problem sets were a fair representation of the course material and exams were challenging but fair.",

He also would occasionally do dynamic models which I found to be helpful in understanding certain topics, like the shift of AS-AD curves over several periods, for example."

It may be a bit dry to learn for an elective course coming from another major as it is fairly theorhetical and math heavy. However, it seems to give good preparation for further studies in macroeconomics and development. For example, econ 122 with Fabrizio definitely helped me understand the papers, articles, and speeches I had to read for a class on the financial crisis of 2008.",
