                "Big picture overview of political and military developments of Russian history until the 19th century",
                "I learned a lot about Russia and its pre 19th century history. You really cover a serious amount of content over the semester. Professor Bushkovitch is super knowledgeable and the lectures are concise and digestible. If you are interested in Russia, this is a great survey.",
                "I learned a lot about Russian history and how the culture, religion, and society developed throughout time. This course provided a lot of very interesting primary sources that complimented the history readings really well and gave me an even deeper understanding of the subjects we covered each week.",
                "I learned a lot about the fundamental narratives of Russian history and the drivers of the empire's expansion. We studied the principal rulers and characters from the 9th century onwards and examined in depth the changes in Russia's internal political structure, ethnic/national makeup, and increased relevance on the international scene."

                "Professor Bushkovitch is a very effective lecturer who clearly knows the content inside and out, and his ability to cover huge swathes of time while still providing specific enough details to give a sense of history as carried out by people instead of abstract concepts was amazing. However, in many cases, it could be difficult to connect one lecture to another along any dimension other than chronology and geography, which could at times make it feel as though two or three different smaller classes were occuring in parallel. The readings were also frequently a bit too detail-oriented as compared to the broad strokes taken in lecture.",
                "I liked the course size but felt that it could have placed more emphasis on what everyday people's lives were like rather than who was in charge because that was often not very significant. Although I felt like I had a good sense of who did what from the throne/government, I didn't always feel like I had a good sense of what life was like in Russia at this point.",
                "Strengths: Comprehensive overview of Russian history and society, manageable workload, Prof. and TA both great and delivered information succinctly; Weaknesses: Readings at times were a bit too tedious and hard to tell what was the most important information to take away from them"

                "This course would likely not be a good choice for a first college level history class, as the level of note-taking and connection forming required to maintain a good grasp on the class themes throughout the centuries would require a steep learning curve. However, for a student with some experience of college level history classes, the reading load is manageable, lectures are engaging and communicate the concepts effectively, and a good understanding of the content can be maintained without excessive studying outside of lecture and section.",
                "I would if you are looking for a light workload lecture with a lot of interesting content and a professor who knows what they are talking about.",

                "Yes! I'd recommend to someone interested in Russia or imperial history specifically -- otherwise, the material might seem a bit dry."
