                "Strengths: professor was incredible, material is interesting\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of repetitiveness in lectures, every class was surrounding paper studies (which isn't necessarily a bad thing in my opinion)",
                "Strengths: very clear narrative and connections between different parts of the course, Prof Munshi is a very engaging lecturer. TFs are very helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes we dive too deep into the details of the paper, and I don't understand the technicalities and they are not tested on exams. Expectations for exams are unclear so it's difficult to know what to study for.",
                "Strengths: Great Professor, engaging lectures, able to distill sophisticated concepts down to a level that anyone can understand, interesting papers on economic development\r\nWeaknesses: Problem Sets and Exams not very linked to development economics or to the lectures.",
                "strengths: lectures were fun and based on research papers, mostly papers the prof was involved in\r\nweaknesses: none! perhaps prof can post practice exams",
                "The course was relaxed but interesting.",
                "Prof. Munshi is a great lecturer and is definitely very passionate about this subject (after all, a lot of the papers we focus on are his own research). He is very helpful and is good at explaining broad topics. He does a good job of building on top of each lecture. Although class lectures were very detailed and math-heavy at times, exams and psets focused more on large topics.\r\n\r\nA weakness is that the course is rather fast-paced, and if you miss a class, you'll be rather lost.",
                "The psets and the midterms were not really conducive to help students learn outside of the classroom despite Prof Munshi's extreme skill and engagement as a lecturer. The class was interesting, but there was hardly enough work to actively engage with the material on a deeper or sufficient level.",
                "Strengths: Prof Munshi was very passionate and knowledgeable in the field, offering several of his own insights from his own research\r\nWeaknesses: few assignments or assessments make up the bulk of the grade.",
                "More clearness on how to study for the exam maybe",

                "Good solid lecture course. I think there could have been more guidance for the exams. The psets were very short and (aside from the last pset being very similar to the exam) did not instill confidence that the exams would go well. I almost wonder if having more pset material would assist in this weakness. Professor Munshi was a great and engaging lecturer and Burke was a wonderful TA.",
                "strengths: interesting topics, unique approach to economics compared to most Yale classes, manageable workload \r\nweaknesses: the lecture slides could be clearer and with more explanations, sometimes it was hard to review them on my own",
                "Strengths: course organization is good, fair exams, Prof Munshi is a great professor and a super kind guy, great teaching staff who answered questions well; Weaknesses: not many, perhaps sometimes lectures were a bit fast near the end of classes. Sometimes psets were a little vague in what they were asking for but going to OH usually helped",
                "strength: passionate professor, exposure to interesting content without a lot of workload\r\n\r\nweakness: there's no good way to prepare for the exams, if you don't come to the lecture (which people often did since it was at 9am in Watson) then it's hard to catch up",
                "Strengths: Munish is a great lecturer; you get to see how economics research is done, which is really valuable if you've mainly been taking a lot of theory-centric economics courses.\r\nWeaknesses: None really"

                "Yes! Professor Munshi is a great professor and he is truly invested in the material which makes learning it even better. The topics are very interesting and this course helps develops economic intuition and skills, especially as a first economics elective.",
                "Yes, if you haven't taken a development economics class and are interested in more qualitative narrative of development. This is not a gut, this is not a gut, don't be fooled by the course ratings. You need to put in a lot of time understanding the materials.",

                "Absolutely. If you engage with the class you will be able to say that this is one of the best econ electives that you've taken at Yale. The coursework is not heavy at all, the material is most interesting (albeit I do wish there was some more diversity within the topics and types of papers discussed). Hopefully with feedback, Prof Munshi can better design the course so that it poses more of an intellectual challenge and allows students to actively engage with the course more in the future.",
                "Yes, professor munshi is super great",
                "yes if you want a good step after econometrics ot understand how Econ research is actually done / how to read economics papers. \r\nNo if you want higher level policy type insights into how to do economic development \"Right\" - the class is super micro and sometimes rather abstract",
                "Absolutely. An excellent course with an excellent professor.",
                "Yeah-- I think if you're interested in Econ- especially Econ research methods, this is a good solid not to difficult course that will keep you engaged and allow you to come away with lots of valuable skills. If you are super adept at stats already, it will probably feel very slow.",
                "Highly recommend!",
                "Yes. I was able to approach economics through a sociological lens, which I had not been able to do before at Yale. I underestimated the importance of biology and social institutions for how our world develops, and it's interesting to look at economics as an evolving story of different societies and peoples.",
                "Yes, this was my first econ class that exposed me to reading research papers and that's a pretty useful skill even if you don't plan on going further in economics research",
                "YES! This is a great course with very interesting content (economic development Asia, but the principles can be used in different developing countries) with low workload. Majority of your grade is determined by two exams which are difficult to study for, but if you have a good math/stats foundation, you will be fine. Prof Munshi is VERY passionate about the subject and he's done a lot of research of his own. The psets could feel little disconnected to the lecture content and it's hard to study the exams just off of psets.",
                "No, this course is at its fundamental level purely about economic development in India as told by 16 papers that we studied and their models, that's it. Please don't think this course is a gut or about any economic developmental theory or anything like that, it's not fun and I regret taking this course. Just don't take it, take something you're interested in. If you're interested in economic development just read a book or watch a youtube video, don't take this class. All that said, the course material was boring BUT Munshi is actually a really good professor, he teaches well, explains things well, makes complicated things look simple, and cares about his students.",
