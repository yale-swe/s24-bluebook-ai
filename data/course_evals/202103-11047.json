                "I read Les Miserables in full, which was so rich and valuable in itself, and also learned a great deal about nineteenth and eighteenth century France which I would not have learned had I read the book on my own. We covered everything from child care to barricades to gardens, and having that additional content enhanced my reading of Les Miserables and was very interesting in its own right.",
                "I learned so much about how to analyze an epic work like Les Misrables. I was able to read all of Les Misrables (probably the longest book I've ever read) and learned all about the context of 19th century France. I leave this class with specific knowledge about the novel, and broader critical reading and thinking skills.",
                "Knowledge of 19th century France and all things \"Les Misrables\"-related",
                "This class really taught me to dive deeply into one text and appreciate the context present in any piece of literature. I feel like most literary analysis classes cover so many books that it is hard to appreciate the true depth of each book individually. In this class, however, we all got to become experts on different aspects of the novel and you could focus on one issue in depth.",
                "Through discussions in class, I gained a lot more knowledge and context around the Restoration period of French history. Additionally, this class really developed my critical thinking skills in terms of analyzing Hugo's intentions in writing Les Mis and separating his intentions from what his text actually communicates.",
                "I gained perspective on the historical and social context of the novel, as well as learning more about Victor Hugo's personal life. I developed my skills as a writer and researcher by engaging in the writing assignments and class presentations and discussion.",
                "I learned about French history in the 19th century and how it shaped Hugo's novel Les Miserables.",
                "Cultural history of 19th century France.",
                "I learned all about the historical context in which Hugo's Les Misrables was written including everything from sewers to secret societies - it was all really fascinating. I also got to learn more about the characters in the original way Hugo wrote them as opposed to how I knew them through adaptations of the novel such as the films and musicals.",
                "Critical reading skills, writing skills, knowledge of French political, economic, and cultural history",
                "In this course I had the opportunity to explore creative writing by creating a pastiche of Hugo's work. I also learned about the historical context of Les Misrables through weekly student led presentations on a variety of subjects ranging from child welfare to inheritance laws. Finally I gained an appreciation for the text itself, Hugo's style, his intentions, and the legacy of this monumental novel.",

                "Professor Samuels was very good at guiding the conversation and looking at the novel from both broad and specific perspectives. The structure of the course was its biggest strength. It also had a very manageable workload which made it easier to enjoy and focus on the content. It was a little large as a seminar, so I did not quite get to know everyone\/the professors as well as in other classes, but it is a fantastic course.",
                "Strengths: the in-depth coverage of French history during the 19th century as well as the in-class discussions about the novel\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "I think this class was well organized on a week-to-week schedule. Every week, we had to read about 100 pages of the novel, we would have two student presentations on some historical context, and then would dive into that week's reading. I think the class benefited from being a seminar but was large enough to have some variety in opinions presented. I also thought the professor and TF were both very knowledgeable about Les Mis, Victor Hugo, and the various contexts, so they were able to answer most questions with ease. \r\n\r\nI think the assignments could have been a little more guided. There was only ever a single line about each assignment on the syllabus and we got little clarification. That being sad, both the professor and TF were available to meet and could answer questions. I think it might have been easier, though, if the papers had been a little clearer from the start.",
                "Strengths: super engaging discussions, lots of engagement with historical context, discussions were very balanced and it never felt as if certain students were dominating, all the students also seemed to have a genuine interest in the material, many opportunities to get help or meet up with either Professor Samuels or Abigail",
                "I enjoyed this course very much, and the class discussions were definitely a highlight of my week. The only weakness I would note is that given the size of the class, sometimes it was difficult to really have a conversation, or voice ideas as they naturally came to me. While everyone was clearly engaged, it was a bit too big to really have any back and forth between students.",
                "Strengths: fascinating discussions in every class, extremely engaging, the class structure is phenomenal and so is Professor Samuels!",
                "It was a great class. No weaknesses overall. Maybe there could be more focused and constructive contention in class discussions.",
                "I think that everything about the class actually worked perfectly - I'd 100% recommend it to another student.",
                "One of the major strengths is just how amazing Professor Samuels is. He's extremely engaging and knows so much about French history. He also leads discussions in a way that perfectly balances the history of the novel with the literary aspects of it, and it overall felt like a really enriching experience that wouldn't have been remotely as good without him.",
                "Strengths: an incredible class with an incredible professor and TA\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
                "I think that Yale professors often struggle to find new ways to approach older texts, but Professor Samuels proves that books like Les Misrables are indeed still accessible to us. I admire how so many of the conversations in this course connected with contemporary class issues and how engaged students were when we tackled these topics.",
                "Strengths: Awesome balance between book analysis and history\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of reading to do per week"

                "Yes! There is probably no other time you are really going to make yourself read les mis. I really appreciated the class and the opportunity. Added bonus that the only work was reading the book, one short presentation, a pastiche, and a 10p paper.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! If you're a fan of Les Miserables and have never read the book, or have read the book and want to read it again in a classroom context, this class is definitely worth taking. The discussions and historical context were interesting and valuable, and the readings and workload were very manageablealthough the novel is lengthy, there were only about 100 pages of reading per week.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed this course. I thought it was both fun and very manageable. I really enjoyed getting so immersed in one work and I hope to take more classes of that style in the future.",
                "Yes! If you love literature and stories, take this course! The book may be long, but it's so interesting and exciting and worth it!",
                "I would definitely recommend this class, especially if you are already interested in Les Mis! The class has pretty consistent pacing so it is a nice balance to some other heavier workload classes. Additionally, the readings are fun and it is usually clear what sections are easier to skim if need be.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student with an interest in Les Mis, French literature, or French history. The atmosphere of the class was always very relaxing, and I genuinely found myself looking forward to coming to class. Professor Samuels and Abigail are both so insanely knowledgeable with regard to Les Mis and this period of French history, plus it is an amazing accomplishment to have read the entirety of Les Mis. I also found both of the assigned papers to have been a lot of fun to write, and very rarely have I had the chance to study one piece of text in so much depth.",
                "Take this course! One of my favorites at Yale.",
                "Yes! If you have a remote interest in Les Mis, take this course!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to spend time diving into the novel in depth and exploring the plot in its historical context. Whether you've read the book or not, doing the reading weekly is really important to feel a part of the class discussions. The writing assignments and presentation were manageable, and the reading is ~100 pages a week so nothing to crazy. If you want to know more about nineteenth century Paris, this is an excellent way in.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course especially if you love Les Miserables or if you have a love for French culture. You have to be committed to do the readings to get the most out of the class, but it is extremely doable if you are passionate about the subject.",
                "Absolutely. Take any class with Prof Samuels. You'll not regret it.",
                "Yes - not only was the pacing very manageable, but I feel as though I was able to participate in discussion very easily and also learn a lot at the  same time which is a rare combination in classes.",
                "Absolutely recommend it. There's no better way to tackle this book, if you have any intention of doing so, than in this course. I learned so much about the novel, Victor Hugo, and France in the 19th century. Plus, everyone who takes this class tends to be pretty deeply interested in the novel (obviously), so it's a great community of people all really engaging with some very rich material. Take it!",
                "Definitely!! It's one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale so far. It's one of those rare gems which is both intellectual stimulating and also just plain fun. Take it!",
                "Yes. Classes like these give you a badge so you can tell everyone you tackled this giant novel, but it is also an opportunity to go in depth and ensure that you get all that you possibly can out of such a big book where your likely to miss information without a professor as a guide.",
                "I would recommend this course! Every class began with a student presentation which covered some aspect of 19th century French culture. The discussions were interesting and the novel is a captivating read.",
                "Yes, I thought it was a really meaningful and engaging way of diving into such a beloved story"
