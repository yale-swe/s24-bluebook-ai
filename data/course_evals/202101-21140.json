                "Strengths: Zhou Laoshi is an excellent professor and has designed this course well. The topics that we cover in class are interesting and relevant (climate change\/environment, elder care\/demographics, public health, as well as topics currently in the news). Furthermore, assignments (weekly writing assignments, Quizlets, presentations every few weeks) give ample opportunities to practice the vocabulary students have learned. Lastly, I enjoyed the amount of customizability in this course; Zhou Laoshi is very clear that this course is largely dependent on the student's willingness to learn, and to this end he gives flexibility in what vocabulary words individual students wish to learn or which topics they wish to focus on for presentations. \r\n\r\nWeakness: My only criticism of the course is that the final project might be better as a live oral presentation rather than a recorded, mock news studio format. I found myself spending a lot of time editing the video and getting shots right, which, while a good exercise in videography, did not directly help my Chinese skills and instead took some time away from my other courses. Additionally, I think an additional presentation would have helped me improve my extemporaneous speaking skills even further.",
                "Strengths: improvement-focused, grounded in current events, fun!\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of work, excessive amounts of work at some points in the semester",
                "The strength of this course is definitely Zhou Laoshi - he cares deeply about his students and every class with him is just made better with his comforting presence! The one weakness that comes to mind may be lack of speaking opportunities - there is a lot of emphasis on writing in this course but I personally would've preferred more opportunities to speak casually in class (outside of formal oral presentations)"

                "Yes absolutely. If you are interested in an advanced Chinese language class that doesnt follow the mold of typical language classes (textbook readings, vocab quizzes, etc.) this is the class for you.",
                "Yes! Zhou Laoshi is the best. This course is a lot of work, between readings, vocab, twice weekly fake news stories, oral presentations, and other assignments. But Zhou Laoshi is very generous with grading and really just wants to see you improve. It is really fun to apply Chinese knowledge to real world news stories. The vocab you learn in this course is very useful for reading about and discussing current events.",
