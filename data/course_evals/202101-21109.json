                "Smaller class size and practice reading and writing Chinese during class were very helpful in the online format. Although I did lose some motivation to learn hanzi every day, so I often saved a lot of it for one day of the week. I liked the Fall semester's method of daily quizzes to force me to be accountable for learning 5 hanzi per day. It is unfortunately very easy to become disconnected, which can't be helped even in the best online classes.",

When we learned a new grammar point in class, she would ask us to try using the new grammar point, so we would be able to practice with her. She also put us in breakout rooms occasionally, and this allowed us to practice our Chinese and meet new friends!",
