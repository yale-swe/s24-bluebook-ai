    "This class most helped me with my grammar and writing skills.",
    "A lot of grammar and a bit of Latin American culture.",
    "I got a lot better at speaking and reading Spanish",
    "A better grasp of Spanish grammar rules.",
    "This course helped improve my skills in spanish immensely. I feel much more comfortable speaking in any situation, and I also feel I acquired a proficiency in reading and writing that I did not have before this course.",
    "I learned a lot about spanish language, culture, and grammar.",
    "I developed a thorough knowledge of Spanish grammar and gained exposure to some elements of Hispanic culture.",
    "I learned every single Spanish in just a short 13 weeks! I learned how to improve my sentences grammatically and convey my messages more effectively in another language.",
    "Improved my Spanish fluency and understanding.",
    "Improved spanish skills",
    "lots of verb tenses (futuro, condicional, pretrito perfecto, pluscuamperfecto, condicional perfecto, futuro perfecto, imperfecto del subjuntivo), si clauses, passive voice, indirect dialogue, some history\/culture (United Fruit Co in Guatemala and dictatorship of Pinochet in Chile)",
    "My Spanish skills improved tremendously.",
    "This course helped increase my proficiency in effective communication in Spanish and also introduces you to a brief history of some Latin American countries, which I really appreciated."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A lot of the assignments were redundant and unnecessary\/unhelpful. The course readings should definitely be changed.",
    "The strength of the course is that it focuses a lot on culture, which makes it less boring to also learn grammar and to practice other skills. My main issue with the course was that the syllabus could be very confusing at times, and I would often have to clarify things with my professor. I felt like it could have been organized a bit more clearly.",
    "Great teacher. A lot of work but its organized nicely",
    "Professor Symons is awesome. Shes always willing to help and go above and beyond to teah a concept or practice.",
    "The course does a good job of getting through all the material but could give the teacher greater freedom.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is Prof. Symons. She was an absolute delight to be in class with every day, and this made the entire class feel comfortable in speaking and participating. Thanks to her, I was able to progress in a steady, easy to understand way.",
    "The course is great in a seminar style but it is annoying how the course director decides \"rubrics\" for how to grade quizzes, exams etc. Some other teachers were extremely lenient grading exams while others were with presentations. Profe Symons was amazing and fair and tough!",
    "I like that this course makes a concerted effort to have us engage with Hispanic art and literature, while still giving us good practice speaking and writing in Spanish.",
    "I loved the course, it was awesome! My teacher was amazing and the book was MUCH better in terms of length than the one in SPAN 130. However, I do think the last two weeks had WAAY too much to do. We had the art gallery, presentations, a composition, AND our final written exam? Little too much.",
    "The strength is that through the every day class, you will become better in Spanish even if you do not put in 100% of your effort.  A weakness is that there are exams\/quizzes\/presentations nearly every week, and the last 2-3 weeks of the semester are especially busy.",
    "Best professor",
    "You learn a lot very quickly in this class in the way of grammar. The short films in the first half of the course are a fun way to end the week. The latter half of the course, however, is extremely work heavy. On top of the normal class work, there are projects and extra assignments that would be better spread throughout the course.",
    "Great course materials and activities."

    "only if you have to take it",
    "If you have to take L4, you have to take it. If you can take it with Professor Symons, definitely do so. She's a wonderful instructor and person. I enjoyed her teaching style a tremendous amount. Many of the topics covered can be dull, but she was able to make them a lot more enjoyable.",
    "Yes. Great teacher who helps you learn a lot",
    "If you can take it with Prof. Symons or Prof. Len, it will be a good time. I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. You will get much better at Spanish and enjoy your time in the class!",
    "Yes, it's a requirement but Symons is great!",
    "I would recommend this class to students interested in Spanish language and culture.",
    "YES!! I recommend Professor Deborah Symons, she is so sweet and amazing, and she loves to get really technical with all the grammar if you'd like her to (it helped me learn better!).",
    "Yes.  I think most people would be taking this for the language requirement and it's tough that it meets 5 days a week, but if you can get Professor Symons, it will be easier.",
    "Yes!",
    "If you are seriously interested in taking your Spanish to the next level, take this course. If not, the class is a lot of work and won't be much fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course to other students. Spanish skills will be very useful in the future.",
    "Yes! It's a fun, engaging language course, and less technical than entry level courses might be."
