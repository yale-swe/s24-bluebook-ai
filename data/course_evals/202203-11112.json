                "Strengths: infinite participation opportunities because it's such a small class, kind and supportive professor in and out of class, clear assignments meant to help us grow language skills.\r\nWeaknesses (sort of): nothing major just high level of commitment required; Shiri had me meet with a tutor outside of class as part of the course requirement which was good for my Hebrew I just had to make more time outside of class",
                "It was a wonderful and enjoyable course. The class discussions were engaging and stimulating, the movies selected were thought-provoking, the weekly blogs helped students come prepared to class and also hone their writing skills. By cultivating multiple skills (speaking, watching, writing, reading, exposure to academic Hebrew), the class allows each student to improve their Hebrew in different ways. We mostly watched movies from the past two decades, and many of them were a bit sad (because that's the nature of much of Israeli cinema)."

                "Absolutely! The course was fun and interesting. The discussions were stimulating, the community of students was great, the movies were well worth watching and I believe any student can learn from the class given its emphasis on various language skills (reading, writing, watching, academic Hebrew, speaking, etc). Prof. Shiri Goren is an incredible instructor. She is highly knowledgeable, insightful, understanding and caring. I'd warmly recommend taking a class with her."
