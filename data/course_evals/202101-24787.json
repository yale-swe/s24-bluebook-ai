                "I learned a lot about monogamy's role in contemporary society, especially capitalistic US, as well as the otherness of nonmonogamy and possible reasons behind it. The course shed light onto my own relationships, whether romantic or platonic, and I see myself referencing the course  in my daily conversations for years to come.",
                "I learned much of the theory necessary to understand how monogamy is situated historically, socially, and politically in contemporary society. I especially enjoyed making connections between this theoretically groundwork and current scholarship about monogamy. The live virtual seminar was also lovely because I could interact with my peers.",
                "I developed a greater understanding of the history and theory around non-monogamy. I also learned to turn a critical eye to a lot of monogamy-supporting structures.",
                "This course fundamentally altered my perspective on romance\/sexuality - it elucidated the historic ties between monogamy (a norm of organising intimacy which so many of us have been taught to see as the only healthy\/normal option) and capitalism, racialisation, religious prejudice, misogyny, and queerphobia. However what I really loved about the course is that it was never didactic; it simply prompted students to question norms and assumptions that we'd previously been encouraged to take for granted, allowing us to come up with our conclusions and counter-questions.",
                "i learned how to apply dense theory like foucault and freud to so many things in everyday life--using monogamy as the entry point. you'd be surprised how many things you can trace back to monogamous ideology-- i constantly find myself doing close readings in my everyday life using the things we spoke about in this class",
                "I definitely felt like this was a wonderful introduction to sexuality studies, as someone who had never taken a WGSS course before. I learned to think critically about structures that we take for granted, such as monogamy, and evaluate the ways in which (and why) such structures are perpetuated."

                "This course has so many strengths. The first is Professor Evren Savci. Her awareness of how the pandemic impacted students' lives and sensitivity to the pressures we were under this semester made me feel recognized. Additionally, her ability to synthesize the points of each student and make connections was excellent. The second strength of this course was the quality and diversity of the readings. I appreciated the fact we started with some foundational theory and built on it each week. \r\n\r\nI wish this class were longer! Every week, we met for 1 hour and 50 minutes, but I enjoyed the class so much that I wanted more time to talk about the readings and hear my classmates' thoughts. I recognize this is not a reasonable request, but it speaks to how wonderful this class was.",
                "The strengths of the course are 1) the really interesting readings on the syllabus and 2) Evren Savci is amazing at guiding conversation and is the most understanding professor I have ever had. I can't think of any weaknesses!",
                "I truthfully cannot think of a single weakness of this class - the subject matter was fascinating, student conversation was encouraged and well-moderated, and anything that students didn't seem to immediately grasp was explained very well by Prof. Savci. I enjoyed every minute of this course, and found that it was one of the few courses I've taken so far that both taught me a great deal while also allowing me to apply this knowledge to my specific areas of interest.",
                "no weaknesses, it was amazing, great syllabus, fantastic prof (evren <3) and really fun and exciting discussions",
                "The only weakness of this course is the wide variety of topics and analytical tools covered in the syllabus--if the instructor could give a more cohesive overview of how the weeks fit together either in writing in the syllabus and at the beginning or end of each class that would be very useful!",
                "Biggest strength of this course is undoubtedly Professor Savci. She's fantastic at guiding a seminar and always keeping the conversation going in a direction that is both approachable and engaging. She also made it one of the most stress-free courses I've taken at Yale, though never in a way that felt like I wasn't learning."

Evren is a wonderful professor and you will learn much about the theoretical underpinnings of monogamy as well as the ways in which we all navigate a world that valorizes monogamy. Regardless of whether you are monogamous, the readings are enlightening and engaging. If you have the opportunity to take this course, I couldn't recommend it more strongly.",

Every class was incredibly engaging and enjoyable, and I learned a great deal not only about the specific thinkers\/areas of theory we were covering, but also how I could apply these perspectives to my primary areas of academic interest and my own life overall.",
                "YES! this course was so interesting and evren's pedagogical style truly changed my expectations for what i understand a course at yale should be like.",
                "Yes. Yes. Yes. If you want to think (and engage!) but not to stress, this is the one.",
                "I cannot recommend this course enough. If you get in, take it. Professor Savci is not only one of the best professors at Yale, but one of the kindest and most engaging people here, too. Monogamy (and the ways in which sexuality is organized in general) is a fascinating subject that impacts everyone's life, so everyone will get a lot out of this. The readings and workload are well thought out and never overbearing, and the papers she assigns are fun ways to implement the knowledge you accumulate throughout the course. Absolutely the highlight of my week to go to this class on Thursday - I would always WANT to finish the readings no matter what so that I could participate in our fascinating discussions.",
