                "I learned so much about women in art, the lives and experiences of afrolatinos, and immigration. The selection of readings/videos was excellent, and I really enjoyed the topics, discussions and assignments in this class. I learned a lot of vocabulary and skills with the assignments we did - how to describe works of art, narrate a story, analyze songs/poems, discuss themes from a film. Because this felt more like a discussion/seminar class, I learned a lot of vocabulary and skills in a way that was much more engaging than memorizing vocab, and I also learned a lot through discussions with other students and getting to hear their perspectives.",

                "I advanced my ability to converse and understand spanish and learned about aspects of the spanish speaking world that I didn't realize had been omitted from my Spanish education thus far including immigrant narratives and the art and history of Afro-latin women.",
                "spanish",
                "We learned about various topics within the spanish-speaking world such as afro-latina artists, migrant communities, indigenous communities and hispanic artists. This was great because it really showed the scope and reach of Spanish in the world and allowed students to find a topic or two they really connected with/found intriguing."

                "Very engaging with a lot of in class working towards better Spanish.",
                "Strengths - Jorge was absolutely amazing, and he really made the class engaging and enjoyable. The homework was engaging and took a reasonable amount of time, the topics we explored were super interesting, the format of the class (specifically having a lot of small group discussions in class) was extremely engaging and made it fun and easy to learn. \r\nWeaknesses - I can't think of any.",
                "Amazing instructor and very interesting course content",
                "The flexibility in homework assignments and classes were very helpful in improving my Spanish. Presentations were very well constructed since they were in small groups and repeated, so we felt less pressure and improved with each presentation.\r\n\r\nWhen points were taken off assignments, it was often unclear why, which was quite frustrating.",
                "In this course you learn Spanish by using it, not by being taught it directly. I think that's a great approach for a few reasons. You find yourself learning without even really trying. It's just through exposure. Of course exposing yourself requires effort, but it's easier to learn a new grammatical structure by seeing it and practicing it with material that is genuinely interesting. The main advantage of this approach is that it's much less exhausting to attend class when you're studying a topic using Spanish, as opposed to studying Spanish by using a topic. There were days it felt like an art history class and not a Spanish class, and those days kept me from feeling burnt out at any point in the semester, which is pretty remarkable for a class that meets 4 days a week +asynchronous day.",
                "The course built well throughout the week and the asynchronous day was a good breakup of information to practice other skills.",
                "I think Professor Mndez-Seijas was a standout and really helped keep students involved and engaged in class. The altered version in how this class was taught (emphasis on experiences and participation in class and not so much grades) was excellent and really made me look forward to attending class. To me this class was perfect."

                "Yes, absolutely! Jorge was an amazing professor and I genuinely looked forward to going to this class.",
                "Yes, I think it's a great class to work on your Spanish, although you only get what you put into a class like this and can either really improve your Spanish or not change your fluency at all depending on how engaged you are",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend L4. You not only hammer home what you learned in L1-L3 but you actually learn about things that aren't the Spanish language. I was exposed to art that will stick with me the rest of my life that I wouldn't have encountered otherwise. Jorge was a truly great professor and even if he isn't teaching next year, he designed the course so I'm sure it will be good. If you feel burnt out on Spanish, don't worry because this will be a breath of fresh air.",
                "Yes, it is a great stepping stone in the spanish sequence and is much more culturally engaging than other courses I've taken in the department.",
                "yes",
                "Absolutely. I know Professor Mndez-Seijas said this would be his only L4 class teaching at Yale. I wish it wasn't so. It's important to have professors who understand how students learn languages and how to keep students engaged. Take this course if you want to continue to develop spanish, this class uses everything from L1 and L2 without infodumping like the first classes do."
