I feel like we often hear about globalization and if its good or bad but I really liked that this class broke down the facts and let us make our own conclusions. We also learned how to better read\/interpret political science papers which I always appreciate any help I can get for.",

                "I learned a lot about international political economy, mainly about the political and economic implications\/workings of international trade and financial systems, as well as of international migration and climate change.",
                "I better understand the worldwide impacts of globalization and the international dynamics of trade, aid, loans, and FDIas well as the roles of international institutions and cooperative solutions to climate change.",

                "understanding of how different electoral systems (majoritarian, plurality, autocracy) affect foreign policy decisions; building different models to explain the winners and losers of international trade; discussing interesting questions (why does populism exist? what makes climate change a hard problem to solve? what does foreign aid actually accomplish?)",

            "comments": [
                "The professor is superb but the TA was horrible, did not make his expectations for the class clear at all, very little teaching ability, and basically screwed everyone over in terms of grades at the very last week of class.",
                "I really enjoyed lecture for this class and thought the assignments were honestly quite helpful to preparing for the midterm and final. The thing I would have changed was section. I did not think the labs facilitated my learning in the course especially due to their structure around R. I think it was confusing for things to be presented in R but not learning how to actually use R programming. I would have preferred to be all in or all out with R.",
                "The strength of this course is the material. It really covers a wide breadth of topics within foreign policy and shows an interesting way of approaching the material. Professor Queralt did an excellent job of making the assignments both realistic in terms of career prep and interesting.  \r\nThe weakness of this course is definitely the labs. For the first six weeks or so, we just looked at the TF's code and graphs and interpreted his results. When we were finally asked to analyze raw data sets on our own, we were expected to be able to create basic plots using R. However, as someone who has never taken a stats class or been exposed to coding, this was really challenging. Its unclear if we were supposed to have this knowledge coming into the class or if the TF was supposed to teach us, but regardless, it was not communicated well. Additionally, the grading rubric for participation was not explained until the last lab of the course, by which point it was impossible to improve any of our grades.",
                "Strength: The professor was amazing! His lectures were fun and his expertise really shines through, you feel like you're sitting in a class at Yale--because you are! I think a place for improvement was the labs where we had to engage with R. It was definitely a stretch as someone who did not have any prior experience in the coding platform and there was a bridge missed when it came to the execution of the data collection.",
                "Strengths: course material was very interesting, good lecturer, and manageable workload.\r\nWeaknesses: the TA during this year was not very good, discussion sections covered material that was not very relevant.",
                "The class was deeply enjoyable. The readings were engaging, assignments were fair, and the teaching was great. I learned a lot. That said, the design for the labs could use a change. Data analysis is paramount to understanding the research on the topics covered in this course. However, it seemed like the introduction to data analysis tools like R was too simplistic for some students and too unfamiliar for others. Perhaps the course could require data analysis or R experience as a prerequisite so that labs can include more hands-on work with data.",
                "Strengths: interactive lectures, helpful assignments\r\nWeaknesses: students did not participate much",
                "Incredible course overall. \r\n\r\nHowever, I have a very negative impression as a result of the way grading was done in section. It was exceptionally harsh relative to other section grading systems I have seen as Yale. Moreover, the teaching assistant used a system of strange metrics that were not announced until the end of the course. I wish that we had been given better insight in advance that such a radically draconian grading system in section would be used. I think the average section grade was around a 65%, which at Yale, constitutes a failing grade.",
                "Strengths: good, well researched content\r\nWeaknesses: horrible (!!!) grading, no consistency in class expectations, the TA was especially bad, not super engaging at times",
                "This class attempted to cover a wide range of materials (global finance, foreign aid, climate change, immigration) in a way that was initially appealing (before I took this course), but proved to be too much to cover well in a semester. This class felt like a very intro-level breadth class that didn't dive too deep into any topic, but still required random memorization of facts for assignments and exams. There was poor communication between the professor and TF, meaning exams and prep material did not align well. Peers and I also felt undersupported by the teaching staff, who very clearly are new to this.",
                "Strengths: Covers a broad range of topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Most ideas seemed to only cover a very surface understanding.",
                "Strengths: lectures are easy to follow and the workload is manageable; assignments are fair and synthesize your learning well; section applies the material from the lecture to very interesting current events and topics (opioid epidemic, Brexit, caudillo leaders, etc)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the feedback on the assignments were more clear, specifically it would be nice to see on which questions I lost points instead of only being shown my overall grade on the assignment; I also wish we could have had more in person section. This semester presented unfortunate circumstances, but section was much better in person than over zoom.",
                "Strengths - Course material, professor, and ability to access material following lecture. \r\nWeakness - Use of R - I did not feel that coding was sufficiently taught throughout the class, and it was not necessary to the course. I would say either teach  more coding in section\/lecture directly, or drop it. Sections would be more useful as discussions.",
                "I loved the combination of the statistics sections and the lectures on politics. It gave me a great opportunity to learn about international and domestic politics from both empirical and theoretical levels.",
                "The lectures are a huge strength of this course. They were engaging, clear, and never felt like they dragged. I took notes online partially because I want to keep them around and be able to look back at them. Not because theyre likely to be super important prerequisite knowledge for another class Im taking, but just because theyre that interesting.\r\n\r\nOther strengths: The labs, Prof. Queralt is very nice and was always accommodating if there was some sort of issue, and as a leminar its not too difficult to participate. Also, I enjoyed that wed frequently dig into the methodology of studies we analyzed  I felt like I understood not just the top-line results, but also how authors reached them, as well as some of the limitations of their approaches.  \r\n\r\nThe only weakness that comes to mind is the grading. Point reductions are frequently in 5 or 10-point increments, which can be a bit harsh  cross your ts and dot your is on all of your assignments! That said, Prof. Queralt is definitely not out to get you and I got the sense that he wanted students who put in the work to do well: for instance, he was responsive to student feedback and changed the grading on both the midterm and the final to make sure they weren't too harsh."

                "I would recommend this course. It was a good class to dive into the international relations aspect of Political Science while staying grounded in domestic politics as well. I also again appreciated that the class helped break down a lot of complicated conversations about globalization, allowing me to make my own conclusions.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student only if they are genuinely interested in the materials. In a lot of ways, this class sometimes felt preprofessional in that many of the lectures were walking us through how to conduct research on a specific topic and different theoretical models to approach a problem. If you are not interested in these problems, examining how to conduct research for them can definitely be a bit of a grind.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Queralt is a gem and this content is so relevant to today. There was a nice continuity between lectures and each day I was excited to go to class. There was also enough space between assignments that there was time to actually digest the material and the readings.",
                "Yes, I found the course material particularly interesting. It provides a nice overview, while also getting pretty specific, of the interaction between politics and economics. If you want to learn more about international trade and finance (mainly these two), immigration, and more, you should take this class.",
                "Yes, it really helped my understanding of world issues regarding  economics, immigration, climate policy, and trade.",

                "If youre really interested in the content, just dont expect it to be a good class",
                "No, this class as a concept tries to do too much and ends up doing not so much at all. The breadth of topics comes across as haphazard and disjoint, without providing much depth and intellectual challenge to any topic. The Professor and TF did not work well to coordinate with each other, meaning there was often confusion among students about what rubrics and expectations looked like.",
                "If you want a broad introduction to international relations and trade while not spending too much time.",
                "Yes! This class is manageable and interesting. You will learn about lots of cool topics (populism, foreign aid, foreign investment, international trade, immigration, climate change, etc) and discuss the leading theories that explain WHY these trends, events, and problems exist. This class gives you a deeper understanding of ongoing global patterns and the trade offs that they present.",
                "Yes! All around great class. Incredibly useful and important information.",
                "I would! The topic was very interesting and encompassed a lot of materials. Didacs enthusiasm was contagious and the material can also be applied to hot topics in contemporary politics.",
                "This course is excellent: if youre interested in politics and economics, take it. \r\n\r\nI really cant speak highly enough about the lectures. They were very well-paced: I felt like I was constantly learning new material but it was never a struggle to follow along. Each class was organized around a central question, all of which were very interesting: What are the obstacles to compensating the losers of trade? When and why can aid be harmful? What drives opposition to immigration? Why is international cooperation on climate change so difficult? \r\n\r\nProf. Queralt would give background and summarize 2-3 current studies that shed insight on these questions, most of which were fascinating. I learned, among many other things, that the U.S. uses aid to bribe countries on the UN Security Council, that a single factor predicts whether trade coalitions are organized by class or industry very accurately, that the Belt and Road Initiative has been quite effective in undermining democratization abroad, and that greater urbanization makes democracies more likely to default on their debt but autocracies less likely to. The lectures were a real highlight of this class, and they were probably among the best lectures Ive attended throughout college. \r\n\r\nThe workload is also very reasonable, in that the readings and assignments (which are basically psets) are quite manageable. There is very, very minor use of R in the class (there were two assignments that involved it, but both in very small ways), but dont be intimidated  I had never coded in R before and was never too anxious because the teaching staff always provided a lot of support. The labs (basically, section), which evidently were new this semester, were also really cool. They consisted of following along with our TF as he showed us how published studies arrived at their results, which provided a really interesting under-the-hood look at how social science research is conducted. \r\n\r\nI also want to briefly note that the class isnt super difficult, but isnt a gut either. Be prepared to put in some work if you want an A. That said, in my opinion, extremely worth it. I feel like I learned a lot in completing the assignments and studying for the exams in the class.",
                "Yes, I would. It might just be personal preference, but I found the course material to be very engaging and always applicable to real world experiences. I would say that this class is essential for anyone pursuing the Global Affairs major."
