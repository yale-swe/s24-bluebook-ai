However, this class spends too much time on abstract visualization theories, which is not relevant to the practice of creating visualization. Personally, I couldn't pay attention in class, and it seems like not many other people were.",

                "The lectures/readings can be a bit dry at times just because they are a lot of information. I come from a design background so some of the theory is very interesting, while some of it is not as exciting to me. Also I don't really think the memorization based midterm and final are a good assessment of engagement and learning in the course (it's just going through the slides and trying to memorize everything, and coding on paper which to me does not really make sense).",
                "The textbook and lectures from this course were very helpful and explained well.",
                "I believe using another programming language instead of javascript would be a great improvement in this course.",
                "strengths:\r\n- great instructor, great TA.\r\n- not too big a workload, just start on the assignments early and if you're stuck, go to office hours once and you'll get all your problems fixed.\r\n- first half of the course (before the midterm) is interesting\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- second half of the course (after the midterm) is a bit disjoint and harder to follow. the topics become much more abstract and complex and aren't really elaborated on in lecture\r\n- the coding assignments are completely disconnected to what you learn in class. so like, you'll be learning a bunch of conceptual stuff and then a coding assignment will pretty have nothing to do with that. it's fine for the most part but would have loved some more guidance on the D3 coding.",
                "Strengths: You learn how to display complex data in more accessible ways and about basic UI/UX principles. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the exams felt incredibly arbitrary and always tested on the nichest knowledge, which often felt irrelevant to what we were doing for PSets (and what most people probably would be building in the future).",

                "No, even though Professor Rushmeier is a very kind and helpful person, and I respect her greatly, I cannot in good conscience recommend this class. To be honest, I came into this class expecting it to be a gut. It isn't, so if you are looking for a gut, this is wrong place to go to. Each visualization assignment takes a long time to do, and the two midterms require fact-based recall of at least 100 entries of facts each, which is another time sink. It would be justified if these concepts were actually relevant. They are not. They are very abstract, academic theories about data visualization that might be useful if you are interested in doing meta-research about visualization, but are not useful for any kind of practical applications. To give a specific instance (to illustrate the absurdity of some of the facts we were asked to remember), we were asked to recall the name of a person (who is not even particularly famous) who created a specific visualization at a specific event in the twentieth century. I don't understand why remembering facts like these is conducive to anyone's learning. As another example, we were asked to recall what three guest lecturers each specifically talked about in their presentations. It almost feels like the class is structured around taking attendance, such that the purpose of the exam is also to check attendance. Indeed, on each lecture attendance is taken, and you cannot even miss more than 4 lectures even if many of them you will find convey little meaningful information. Data visualization is great, but you should learn it elsewhere. Please do not take this class.",
                "Yes  if they were interested in learning the basics of visualization design and theory.",
                "It is somewhat of an interesting course but can be pretty dry at times -- the workload is pretty manageable though so that's a pretty big reason to take it. The exams are just a bit rough but if you manage to study a bit each week you'd probably be better off.",
