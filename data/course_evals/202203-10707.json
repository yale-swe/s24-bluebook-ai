                "analyzing Spanish literature in a critical way, learned the history of Spain during Lorca's lifetime, and so much about the Lorca legend himself!!",
                "I developed and improved my Spanish-speaking skills by reading and discussing Spanish poetry and literature.",
                "Strong Spanish literary analysis skills, deeper understanding of not only Lorca and his work but also the broader cultural, political and social context in which he wrote",

                "Insights into Lorca's life, work, and contemporary society.",
                "Of Lorca's work, I had only ever read \"La casa de Bernarda Alba\" before this class. Through this class, it was pretty incredible getting to read almost every major work from a single author, especially Lorca who had such a distinct voice. We learned about his life, Spanish history around the time of the Civil War in 1936, and his public reception then and onwards in time.",
                "This course gives you deeper insight into Lorca's life, work, and impact on other artists and politics. The class focuses as much on the work of Lorca as the political and thematic context that surround it, which I loved. You will learn to evaluate and analyze poetry and plays in greater detail, as well as different art films and pieces of visual art.",
                "I practiced and developed my skill of reading and writing in Spanish, as well as understanding Spanish literature.",
                "I learned more about the life and death of Federico Garca Lorca, as well as how his image has persisted after he was killed. I enhanced my ability to analyze and comment on poetry and plays in Spanish. I also gained exposure to other Spanish poets who had a connection to Lorca.",
                "this course helped me gain reading/writing/speaking skills in Spanish beyond the ordinary grammar class. I also loved learning about and analyzing Lorca's work.",
                "The course allowed me to read and analyze the work of one of my favorite authors, and to improve my literary analysis and paper writing skills.",
                "Participate in Spanish.",
                "An overview of the work of  Federico Garcia Lorca, along with historical/literary context for his work",
                "I improved my knowledge of the Spanish language and life of Federico Garcia Lorca.",
                "I developed an appreciation for Federico Garca Lorca that I never had before. Beyond this, the connection between death promoting and fueling life was highlighted for me in a new light; death being the genesis of artistic inspiration for Lorca and for his poetry and works in particular.",
                "This course taught me how to analyze and profoundly understand the works of Lorca that are filled with surrealist imagery and symbolism. It introduced me to the cultural period that Lorca belonged to and the conversations surrounding art at that time, and also get an understanding of what was happening during the Spanish Civil War",
                "Large body of works of Lorca (one of the most important Spanish writers/poets of all time!), Lorca's life, more confidence in speaking and writing about literature in Spanish, context of Spanish Civil War",
                "I learned about how to read and analyze poetry and plays, and was introduced to the works of Lorca.",
                "Written Spanish, literary vocabulary in Spanish, a little bit of Spanish culture/history, Lorca's plays, poetry, and history",

            "comments": [
                "Prov Valis is THE expert of Lorca. Wish the course was in a small-seminar setting. Had the class size of a lecture but still taught as a seminar, making class participation difficult, or easy, depending on someone's engagement with the course and personality. Overall, the course readings and analysis were fascinating.",
                "Strengths: Interesting content to read and analyze, a mix of Spanish and English, a balance of history and literature as you learn about Lorca, a passionate and enthusiastic teacher\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very structured discussions, hard to speak if you had other ideas on the topic, no chance to get feedback from essays besides in the final grade",
                "The material was fascinating, but lectures werent super interesting or useful",
                "The strengths are in the course material, Lorca is a fascinating and compelling writer and the lyricism of his work rings especially true when read and understood in its original form (in Spanish); weaknesses of the course lie in its format, the class was a seminar of 30+ students, making it more of an \"interactive lecture\" than a seminar. Unnecessary emphasis seemed to be put on the secondary texts, including a disproportionate amount of attention in the midterm exam placed on identifying the secondary texts. Speaking and discussion was limited, I feel the class would have greatly improved from the following:\r\n\r\n1) Enrollment cap to facilitate more discussion and less lecturing\r\n2) About 1/2 to 2/3 of the number of works by Lorca, allowing for greater discussion (perhaps focus on the Triloga rural, Romancero gitano, and Poeta en nueva york)",
                "Prof. Valis is an engaging lecturer who encourages a lot of participation from the students, which I appreciated. She also gave ample feedback on assignments. I can think of no weaknesses to cite; this is a great class with a great professor!",
                "Strengths: Professora Valis is brilliant. Her essays she assigns are the best pieces of reading for the entire class (other than Lorca's). She is a devoted teacher, and her lectures are filled with heart. The class is very clearly laid out, and even thought it is a lecture, she asks for a lot of participation. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is not the class to improve your spoken Spanish, nor is it really the place to learn more about writing or grammar. This is a class that expects you to come into it with a high level of Spanish and to demonstrate it on a semi-regular basis. Another weakness is that if you don't keep up with the readings, the lectures are especially boring. So, do your work! Also I would really recommend banning electronic devices because so many students disengaged into other homework.",
                "As a student who is not fluent in Spanish, I was intimidated to participate in this seminar because I feared that the instructor would get upset if my Spanish was wrong. I think making it a more open and accepting space of the different levels of Spanish fluency would have made me enjoy the course more.",
                "I enjoyed the class discussion and the insight that Profesora Valis and Martha brought to the course. The course might work better with a smaller group, but it was effective as is. However, I wish we had dedicated part of a class period to learning and reviewing poetry terms in Spanish. This would have given a clearer idea of which techniques to look for when going through poems.",
                "The course readings were well selected and discussions were very interesting. I wish there could've been more in-depth discussion of the context of certain readings and how they connected to the rest of the author's ouvre, maybe by taking less readings and spending more time on each one.",
                "Easiness of conversation\r\nWeakness: classroom",
                "Professor Valis is an incredible lecturer who assigns enriching readings. I did not notice any weaknesses.",
                "Professor Valis is an absolutely wonderful professor. Her brilliant lectures and exuberance when discussing content energized each class. One weakness of this course was that it was not seminar style, and while it is amazing how the number of students in the course was not capped, it would have been wonderful to sit around a round table to discuss Lorca's works as it often was difficult to hear classmates' thoughts and stay engaged throughout the entirety of each lecture.",
                "The strengths of this course is that you read a large breathe of Lorcas work and are constantly engaging with her his style and influence. One really learns how to grasp his voice. The class is also highly engaging making for really great discussions. Sometimes I wish there was more discussions and participation but I think that would only be conducive if this course was a seminar. Perhaps if more people came to discussion sections this could be resolved.",
                "Strength is Prof. Valis who is so knowledgeable and really cares about all of her students. All the pieces we read were so interesting and lended themselves to great discussions. One of the best experiences in the course was a trip to the Beinecke arranged by our TA to view original copies of Lorca's works.",
                "Strengths-the professor is very passionate about the course material. \r\nWeaknesses-the course can be quite difficult for those who have never taken a class in reading poetry or plays.",
                "Strengths: great trip to the Beinecke, good use of leminar style class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: more engagement with classmates",
                "One of the course's main strengths was the format. There is no pressure to speak in class (especially since we were sitting in rows, so there isn't any of the awkward staring that occurs in a roundtable seminar discussion), but it's also quite easy to, and students really do talk for a lot of the class, not just answering Valis's questions but also providing new insights and requesting clarification. Though there are multiple essays throughout the semester, they are completely manageable at a 2-3 page length.",
                "Fun course that was manageable. Could be improved with more projects instead of traditional papers and exams."

                "Anyone studying Spanish or Spanish literature, absolutely. Anyone looking for an L5 course to improve their speaking and comprehension, no. My studies outside of class did more to improve my reading and speaking, though reading and writing Lorca was very helpful.",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in Lorca or even literary analysis more generally.",
                "I have taken four L5 Spanish courses at Yale, and this one was the second best I'd say. Amazing teaching staff, super nice, great syllabus, not too much work. Also, if you're worried about your Spanish level not being too great, Professora Valis is super nice, and she encourages people to talk no matter their level. Class discussion felt like spaces where anyone could talk.",
                "yes, but only if you have a real interest in Lorca, poetry, and theater. Also you really MUST do the readings or you will be BSing everything. I wish I would have gone to office hours and the optional section more because I know I would have been able to practice speaking spanish more, which was one of my incentives for the course. Also, I really recommend having the hard copies of the materials because it is easy to get sucked into your computer.",

                "Absolutely!",
                "Yes, it was a very interesting literature course that I feel I gained a lot from as a native Spanish speaker.",

                "YES SO GOOD LOVED IT",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Spanish Literature, just make sure to do the readingss",
                "Yes! The course material is so interesting and Professor Valis is incredible.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is passionate about Spanish literature and poetry/reading amazing plays.",
                "Yes, yes, yes! If you love poetry and drama, or literature in general this course is a must if you know Spanish. There is so much beauty, sadness, love, and laughter found in the works of Lorca and this class takes you through all of those emotions and more.",
                "Yes! Was a great course for someone interested in Spanish literature and it offers a great setting to practice talking about literature in Spanish. Prof. Valis's analysis brought our discussion to another level.",
                "I would recommend to another student if they are interested in Lorca's works.",
                "I would recommend this class, it was interesting and it is very refreshing to be able to read plays and poetry rather than dense academic articles.",
                "100% You don't have to be the best Spanish speaker or even have read Lorca's work before. I suggest you look up a few of Lorca's poems and see if you're interested in discussing death and sex and the green of young, impossible desire because that's what this class is about. However, even though a lot of Lorca's works are LAYERED in meaning, you can show up with a new take on a word or phrase and contribute greatly to the class. There is no pressure to speak in class (especially since we were sitting in rows, so there isn't any of the awkward staring that occurs in a roundtable seminar discussion), but it's also quite easy to, and students really do talk for a lot of the class, not just answering Valis's questions but also providing new insights and requesting clarification. Though there are multiple essays throughout the semester, they are completely manageable at a 2-3 page length each. Plus, though it might seem crazy to spend an entire semester on one man, you will end the semester with genuine knowledge and an overview of his life and Spain's socio-political climate that will stick with you. So often, we cram so many people and events and concepts into a semester that we don't remember any of them. But I assure you that you will remember Lorca, and even if some poems seem too flowery or complicated to be appreciated when you're reading them at 1am, a few lines or ideas will 100% stick with you.",
                "Yes - difficult course for non-native speakers but very enjoyable."
