                "The biggest strength of the course was that my teacher was extremely good. The material is very difficult, but he did a good job of teaching and making sure our questions were answered. I think the biggest weakness is that outside help was relatively limited.",
                "This class was very well structured and planned; assignments and lectures nearly always followed the schedule, which made it easy to keep up with. However, one weakness was the variance in instruction\/lack of interconnectedness between various professors. This was most evident during the pre-exam review sessions, which would lead to confusion in times of preparation for exams. This could be fixed by increasing communication regarding teaching material between professors.",
                "The classes are overall well structured and allows sufficient time for discussions.",
                "No real weaknesses of this course. Everything was planned carefully and there were always resources available if I needed extra help",
                "Brett was great. helped out a lot, though 1-1 time is critical to do well.",
                "I'm not sure there are any improvements to be made, it can be hard to focus in online lectures but that is a matter of zoom and not anything that can be fixed. There are lots of explorations, office hours, and videos to help fill in gaps you might have in the subject matter and if you are good\/okay at math and you try then you should be fine.",
                "Strengths include the Explorations, Concept Checks, review sessions, peer tutors, and the (conveniently-timed) office hours. I have no weaknesses to report!",
                "My strengths were integration and volumes. For the most part, I understood how to integrate problems and compute volumes beyond the basic level. I understood how to do each of those problems thoroughly I felt. My weaknesses were in the area of series and sequences. I did not fully grasp how to do these problems as well as I did other topics.",
                "I think the math department suffered the most from the limitations of online instruction. I think there is a mismatch in what is taught in the course and what is assessed on the test. The course instruction focuses so much time on broad concepts or applications, whereas the tests are strictly computation, often of types of problems we've not seen before. A greater focus on computation would improve the course.",
                "Weakness: Too much material, too little time. \r\nStrength: Brett Smith is very helpful and nice!",
                "The strength of this course is definitely the homework structure with smaller regular checkin assignments and problem sets once a week. The weaknesses are not having recorded lectures which can leave students confused or behind if they are unable to attend class for a day.",
                "The course material was structured, and the theoretical aspects of the concepts were thoroughly explained; the links between differential and integral calculus were made very clear, which helped with the conceptual side of the course. At times, the course material felt a bit rushed, especially with regards to the parametric\/polar unit, which were left until the last week or two of class. I feel as though we could have been given more opportunities to demonstrate learning and improvement, in addition to the midterm and final exams.",
                "The course is very well-structures and the psets and exams are very good representation of your understanding of the material discussed in the class.",

I also liked the Jamboard breakout rooms, but I would suggest only 1 per class or to switch groups more often because my group didn't interact as much, so they didn't contribute to my learning. I didn't look forward to meeting with them, which caused me to become less active during breakout room time.",
