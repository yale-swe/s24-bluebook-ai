                "I don't think there are major weaknesses! However, coming from studying Arabic during the summer in a very rigorous program, this class and its learning pace felt frustrating at many times. This being said, it is a very chill class and Professor Sarab is lovely. So if you take the class with little expectations of learning new things, you'll have a good time. It is not very rigorous, but it is a nice break from the very heavy L1-L4 language classes and there was always nice conversation happening and a really warm atmosphere.",
                "Professor is very good. Honestly, this is a great class!",
                "Strengths: The themes allowed us to learn the Arabic language in ways that are applicable to Arab society. The class was super engaging since it wasnt centered around pure grammar and spelling but rather integrated these skills seamlessly. The themes were also flexible and the topics were relevant (eg. climate change, protests, the World Cup). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This isnt necessarily a weakness but the format of the class is repetitive (two weeks spent on themes, writing assignments due on Wednesdays, tests every other week on Fridays). If youre someone who likes to switch things up, the structure may not interest you but it didnt bother me."

This is very chill class; if you take it with little expectations of learning new things, you'll have a good time. It is not very rigorous, but it is a nice break from the very heavy L1-L4 language classes and there was always nice conversation happening and a really warm atmosphere. Push yourself and speak only Arabic in class! You'll get what you put in.",
                "Yes, absolutely, but you need Sarab as the professor. IF you have Aziz as a professor, this will be a horrible class.",
                "Absolutely. If youve studied Arabic enough to be able to speak and write without receiving explicit and intentional grammatical instruction, this is the class for you. Classes were engaging, discussion was fruitful, and the topics covered were thought provoking."
