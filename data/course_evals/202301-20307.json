                "Strength: talented classmates - people's commitment to their work and their literary flair makes preparing for class workshop always a joy; a knowledgable professor who is really skilled at leading discussions and striking a tasteful balance between contributing to the conversation and making people feel safe & ready to chime in; these two led to one of the most engaging and productive classroom discussion environment that I've ever experienced at Yale which, to me, is essential for a seminar. \r\n\r\nWeakness: we move through each person's work pretty fast, which is understandable by the \"advanced\" nature of the class. However, I wish we could slow down just a little (maybe 2-3 workshops/class instead of 4-5). I could tell each person takes their translation project really seriously. I appreciated how, during the Practice of Literary Translation class, we were able to settle into the particular rhythm of each person's work and then get into the feedback portion, where each separate piece of advice came together to form a general direction of revision which had been the most helpful. Sometimes during our class this semester, I felt we had to move on just as we were settling into the rhythm of this particular piece. Although professor Cole is, as usual, skilled at summarizing the gist of our discussion and making sure each translator leaves with a take-home message, I'd appreciate the time and space for each piece of feedback to be digested and built upon in real-time.",
                "This was a fantastic course! Great way to focus very closely on creating the best possible translation and develop editing, writing, and theoretical skills developed in the intro course. Discussions were productive and dynamic, readings were manageable, engaging, and extremely useful."
