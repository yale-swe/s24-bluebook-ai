The course really pushes you to think beyond the standard conversations you may have in a history seminar, as it simply covers so many different issue areas, from gold in Colombia to Indigenous artifacts in Mexico to the history of anthropology in France. It was very intellectually challenging and made me a stronger history student. I would say one way to improve the course was that it was often hard that students were not sharing so much in class conversation  I think the course could try to bring more students into the conversation.",
