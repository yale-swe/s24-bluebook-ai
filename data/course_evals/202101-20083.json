                "Strengths: Great professor (KMJ) who was very clear in her lectures and had an incredibly well thought-out outline for the topics. The sequential order made perfect sense to me and I felt like the test material was fair -- all extensions of concepts we went over in class.\r\nWeaknesses: While I loved the real-world applications of the project, I do believe it was a bit ambiguous for some parts (ie. calculating response magnitude).",

The class is not easy by any means, but Prof. Miller-Jensen really does a great job at simplifying seemingly impossible models into digestible solutions. Also, the project presented a very nice break from the P-set routine, and I think I was able to learn better through the project.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Since lecture was on zoom, there was little incentive to actually show up to class, necessarily leading to a lot of review outside of class. This may not be a bad thing, but perhaps more can be done to incentivize people to show up to class. Also, section was not very helpful.",
                "Strength: I liked the teaching \r\nWeakness: The wording of problems on PSETs was sometimes confusing and convoluted.",
                "Strengths: KMJ is an incredible professor. She lectures clearly and welcomes discussion/questions. She experimented with breakout rooms, polls, etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class itself is very equation-heavy (which makes it confusing for students taking this course concurrently with biosignals and images). The PSET questions are also long and very involved. The project was frustrating and not super helpful for learning the material.",
