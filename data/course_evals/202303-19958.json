This class gave me some understanding of writing analytical argumentative papers, citing sources and developing ideas. Even if this isnt something I am passionate about, I can appreciate the methodical development of skills throughout this course.",
                "We covered plastic as a concept and material. In short, we discussed how humanity's obsession with plastic has lead to people wanting to be plastic (sometimes seen in plastic surgery or the idealized look of Barbie). As a material, plastic has become the very foundation of everything we touch, and eat! While I came in with a decent level of understanding around plastic waste and the microplastic problem, this course expanded my perception of plastic to cover much more of our daily lives than I had previously thought, particularly as a concept. When writing our research paper, professor Hubbard introduced me to an incredible environmental writer, Naomi Klein. It was a wonderful class and I highly recommend it regardless of level of understand around the topic of plastic.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: feedback was clear, and it was very helpful to have drafts submitted for feedback before the final paper was due. Much of the content for class discussions were engaging and took a variety of forms (readings, music videos, documentaries, etc.). Class visits to museums/exhibits related to the topic were also very engaging as well. Weaknesses: some of the discussions were slightly dragged out/not a ton of room for a wide variety of opinions on some.",
                "The strength of this course is the gradual, structured approach to teaching. The first essay was short and only counted for 10% of the grade, which let me build confidence in writing skills. The subsequent essays had ungraded draft assignments that allowed for instructor feedback, which further motivated me to want to do well and gave me confidence in my work. Especially as a first writing course, I appreciate not being left to get on with it on my own and receiving clear guidance. \r\nThe weakness of the course for me was the seminar format and the slow nature of discussion which came with it. The only way to ensure everyone participated was to go around in a long circle which got boring very quickly, and dialogue and response to points had to be postponed until everyone had spoken. I am not sure there is a way to solve this issue short of further downsizing classes, but I realise how much resources that will take means its not really possible.",
                "The material of the course felt very relevent to my life which made it interesting. It never felt like a chore to do the readings and the class discussions were all interesting."

                "I think this course is a solid choice to fulfil the writing credit if no other credits seem appealing. It isnt in any way exceptionally interesting, but as a skill-builder course and a course which teaches you to express ideas, you wont go too far wrong with English 114. The one caveat to that is the reliance of the course on the Professor being good. My professor was great and the highlight of the entire course, but I can see how someone with a less passionate and helpful professor may enjoy English 114 less.",
                "Absolutely! I think this course is a great way to engage with an under discussed topic usually overshadowed by climate change. Plus the professor is great and really cares about her students.",
                "I would if they have an interest on the role of plastic in our lives. I not only learned more in depth about topics I was familair with, but was introduced to a variety of ways that plastic impacts society that I had never thought of before."
