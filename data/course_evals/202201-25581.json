                "This is a fantastic course, but I would have appreciated more focus on Ancient Rome and less focus on modern corruption (as opposed to the current 50-50 split between ancient and modern). I was somewhat surprised (maybe just based on the name of the course) by how much we discussed modern corruption. At times, it definitely felt more like a political science course than a history course.",
                "Strengths: Loved loved loved the prof. What a chill yet so informational professor who excites you to participate and think broadly about concepts in class. He was super understanding as this semester was rough as it was. Weaknesses: none -- just engage in the class and you will get so much out of it!",

                "It's listed under the history department but it is much more than that! Take the course if you would be interested in taking some time to make connections between practices in ancient societies and modern."
