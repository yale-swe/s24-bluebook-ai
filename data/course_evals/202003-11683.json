                "The strengths were that you could meet any time for office hours with the professor and he would respond to emails extremely promptly.",
                "Strengths - Mastery based grading system meant that it was very clear what areas we needed to improve on and what areas we were proficient in.\r\nWeaknesses - Some sections had great amounts of inconsistency between what was taught in class and the material we learned and were tested on as set forth by the course director. Depends on the professor - Edwards did a pretty good job of sticking to the curriculum, but I heard that some other professors did not do a very good job of it.",
