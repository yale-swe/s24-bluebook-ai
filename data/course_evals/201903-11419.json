    "I learned a bunch of new Arabic vocabulary and grammar rules.",

    "I continued learning MSA. Vocab and grammar",
    "I learned very little in this course. I gained short-term proficiency in each units vocab, and hopefully long-term proficiency in some grammar topics covered.",
    "I really made a lot of progress with my Arabic skills, at a crucial level.",
    "I continued learning Modern Standard Arabic. A great intro into the \"standard\" dialect.",
    "Learned more Arabic vocabulary related to daily life, gained proficiency in writing essays about ideas beyond just personal ones, and discussed some cultural phenomenons",
    "We learned a lot of new Arabic vocabulary and grammar in an interactive and not intense way.",
    "The course develops more advanced grammatical skills in Arabic."

   "comments": [
    "I would find it helpful to have more opportunities for extended speaking in addition to answering short questions.",
    "Sarab is an overall good instructor and very reasonable. The workload was manageable. I wish we had focused more on speaking and on Shaami. It felt like the speaking exercises we did at the beginning of each class were forced and not worthwhile. I wish that we had more real discussions and conversations rather than staged questions. The last two weeks of the semester, after we'd had our last test and covered Chapter 5, honestly felt like a waste of time. In the future, it would be better to spread out the work until the end or even cover an additional chapter.",
    "Sarab is a really great and caring teacher and wants to see us succeed. Also pedagogically in terms of teaching methods she's really good",
    "Strengths: Sarab is very kind and wants everyone to succeed. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found that the class meetings, homework, and assessments had very little reinforcing power with each other. I really struggled with this classroom structure - most of the focus was on oral performance - but then the tests were written and audio assignments were in dialect (which was not emphasized in class at all). I also felt that Sarab mis-assessed the proficiency and learning of the class because many native speakers in our class were amazing at spoken proficiency (which is what was on display in the class meetings). I felt that Sarab did not realize how little some people were learning because of the perceived proficiency of many students in our class.",
    "I thought it was really good, all around. Perfect work level, etc.",
    "Strengths: many contact hours, a teacher who really cares about her students, a small department so small class size. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it's a hard language and it's going to take a long time to master, we learn modern standard rather than a dialect so you don't really get to speaking that well, and at the end of the day learning a language well means you really should go abroad and be immersed in that language. That said, especially toward the end I really enjoyed the class.",
    "A strength of the course was the time for discussion\/talking, the biweekly writing assignments, and the regularity of the test\/homework schedule",
    "The class is fun and enjoyable and not too much work but this does come at the expense of not really mastering the grammar especially.",
    "The course is well taught and covers a lot of material. The difficulty is practicing speaking and learning grammar since both are very different."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, Arabic is great and Sarab's class is very manageable.",
    "If you want to take Arabic at Yale, Sarab is a great choice.",
    "Yes! I learned a lot and made a lot of friends and had fun all the while",
    "Honestly, I would only recommend this course to the following types of students. \r\n\r\n1. those who need to finish their language requirement and have already completed L1 and L2 Arabic\r\n2. those who want to progress to the next levels of Arabic at Yale \r\n3. those who want to work on their oral proficiency and are willing to put in many (3 hours \/ night) hours to really learn the material on their own.",
    "Yes, for sure.",
    "If you want to learn Arabic, by all means take this course. It's challenging, but at the end of the day you will have a basic knowledge of the language, and enough to take it abroad. The departments care about you, and want you to learn. \r\n\r\nIf you need to take a language just for credit, and do not intend to learn this language, you will be thoroughly crushed by the amount of work and difficulty of this language.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if you're not going to half-ass it, you will get a lot out of this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course especially with Sarab, especially for those who are looking to understand Arabic casually.",
    "It's a pretty solid course and many of the concepts discussed are fundamental to a deeper understanding of the Arabic language."
