As someone who has to take film classes for their major concentration, I'm excited by how different this class felt from my previous film class. The emphasis on \"how\" just as much as \"why\" works are made-- on materials and techniques, animation vs. live action methods of creating diegesis, and the question of what digital methods can bring to the mix -- were all super fascinating. If you're someone who enjoys making art just as much as viewing it, you might find a lot of inspiration here."

            "comments": [
                "It was great to see such a wide variety of films in the class, though some of our screenings ran a bit long. On those weeks, lectures + section + films to watch + readings got to be a little much, and it could get hard to parse all of the information & remember it for the final.",
                "Selection of film screenings was super fun and insightful. Professor's lectures were very passionate, resourceful, and well organized. It was very helpful that the lectures were recorded and available to students on Canvas.",
                "Strengths are the content and discussions, as well as the films we watch. The weaknesses are having so many films to watch which can be time consuming during the week.",
                "This course is really interesting because I think most people can relate to the course material. However, There are two lectures, a screening, and a section every week, which is a lot to devote to a gut class...",
                "Strengths: Screenings were fun to attend every week, especially towards the end. Professor Gerow's lectures are interesting. Not totally necessary to do the readings every week because Professor Gerow summarizes the important readings in lecture. Not very much work. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Trigger warnings should be required before watching Hentai!! I know the TAs talked to Professor Gerow after that lecture cause everyone was a little caught off guard.",
                "Gerow is a bit of a dry lecturer. He rehashes the readings in lecture but doesn't necessarily make them any clearer. I really enjoyed the one lecture where the TA taught because it was much more clear and concise. I also think he tried to do too much in the lecture course, since there was always an overwhelming amount of readings and other material squashed into one lecture, and he always went over time, which made it difficult to get to my next class.",
                "The strengths of this course are its many different forms of learning: from lecture, to screenings, to section, there are many different modes that are used to the teach the topics at hand. The course did not have many weaknesses, but I think the final exam was quite pointless and could be replaced by a lecture quiz on canvas for each class. This would increase attendance but also assure that concepts were getting across as they are taught rather than asking students to study a semester worth of information that is not very conducive to being memorized for one test.",
                "The lectures were a big strength of the course; they were structured perfectly. I enjoyed the film screenings and section as well. Some of the readings could be a little dense. I also wish we had more practice closely analyzing films before the midterm.",
                "Great class. Was initially scared of the final exam, but its not as bad as it sounds, just pay attention in class and do some reviewing/studying before the exam. I liked the option for a creative project, but it would be nice to have a little bit more info on what is expected with the creative project. The 2 essay/1 essay and 1 creative project is a good amount because it is not overbearing. Most of the movies were really good.  I particularly liked Mulan, Princess Mononoke, On-Gaku, Bobby Bumps puts a Beanery on the Bum, and Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend.",
                "Strengths - \"no fear\" attitude for people who have had little or no experience studying film. Shear volume of different animation and examples from early prototypes to classics to experimental and more - we saw lots of great examples in screenings and in class. Professor Gerow brings in the voice of many different animation theorists but doesn't try to indoctrinate students with them (something that is rare but important!) - he provides supporting and counterexamples, evaluates strengths and weaknesses of arguments, posits further stipulations of them. Sections allow for independent thought with a smaller group within the larger lecture. Workload for most of the semester was reasonable  readings (skimmable) for every class, very small animation assignment, short paper. Opportunities to try your own hand at animation.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - time investment for the class is substantial, even if you really enjoy the class. Between two lectures, a mandatory section, and a 2-3 hour screening (+ readings and occasional on-your-own screening), the time does add up. Final assignments were also a bit extra intensive - a short final exam (part of which you need to study almost 100 of the short films we saw) + a short independent animation with a 5-page paper OR a 9-12 page paper on a chosen topic.",
                "Strengths: Great lectures from Prof Gerow, interesting films to watch (some were popular and some were less well-known)\r\nWeaknesses: Course spent a ton of time on early animation, which were among the more dry lectures. Interest definitely picked up as the course went on. Also the final was WAY too focused on memorization of names of films and directors, rather than big ideas in animation, which were what the class focused on.",
                "This course provided a wide range of knowledge and perspectives relating to animation. The readings were almost always relevant to the material covered in class, and the films screened outside of class helped provide examples of the concepts taught by Professor Gerow. The major weakness with this course was the final exam, which leaned heavily on memorization rather than concepts and theory.",
                "Strengths: there is lower weekly workload and the lectures are really engaging. Weaknesses: the TA grading isn't really standardized.",
                "I think the structure of the course provided a really strong timeline of animation history and the major events that informed it. The choice of films was a weak point as I think there were a lot of unnecessary films added to the curriculum.",
                "This class was very entertaining and engaging- I think getting classroom engagement with the material most days of the week (Mon./Wed. lectures, Tuesday screenings and Thursday sections) helped with my understanding of the content. Although I believe the theoretical readings were slightly difficult and drew away from certain lessons. There are also so many films that are watched throughout the course that it was difficult to study for the in-class final exam.",
                "I think this was a very strong course overall. I think one way it could be improved would to have had a smaller writing assignment before the first essay to have a better idea of what was expected from our writing.",
                "strengths- well-organized content, engaging and accessible lectures\r\nweaknesses- I found it a bit odd that the films from women and people of color were assigned over the weekend instead of being screened to the whole class",
                "The films we watched, especially those in the middle and later halves, are really good! The Japanese animation portion was particularly cool. However, I found the lecture to not be particularly engaging. Personally, too, I found the readings to not be conductive to what I was looking for in the course: they had a focus on history, but I was more interested in analysis and interpretation. That, however, might not be a downside for you.",
                "Very cool films and lectures, weakness was that it was a lot of assignments.",
                "Strengths: screenings were very fun, class was engaging, TA's were fantastic\r\nWeaknesses: I cannot think of any",
                "The overall content is very interesting to learn, however at times, the lectures, section, and screenings, coupled with readings take up a lot of times, a better balance of out of class work and in class learning may help the class be more manageable.",
                "Cool class",
                "The course was extremely well-organized and very engaging throughout the semester. The only downside was that the grading was harsher than expected and the exam was quite difficult",
                "Loved the selection of films at nearly all of our screenings! Maybe we could have forgone Final Fantasy and the Ratatouille short, though... \r\n\r\nThe non-Disney parts of the syllabus were more interesting to me than the Disney parts, since more of it was unfamiliar. I get that it's important context for American animation, but it seemed that a lot of people would skip these screenings if they've seen those films before. We might have benefitted from a few more films that we're less likely to encounter otherwise."

                "I would definitely recommend this class to someone. It was fascinating to learn about animation's history and watch new films. It definitely strengthened my appreciation of animation as an art form.",

                "If a student is looking for a \"fun\" course on Disney, I would not necessarily recommend it. However, it does have interesting content and provoked me to think more deeply about the films I'm watching. Just know that it has a lot more content that one would expect and the screenings can get long.",
                "Yes! Professor Gerow is a legend and one of the best professors in the film and media studies department.",
                "I would highly recommend this course, though it is not as easy as it first appears.",
                "Yes, the workload isnt bad, the movies are interesting and so is the stuff about animation that you learn. Well-structured. Interesting. A lot of good movies. Weakness: a couple really long screenings. Strength: The professor was understanding about the length of the screenings.",
                "Yes! it's a fascinating topic for people from a variety of academic backgrounds and experiences. You really stretch your idea of what you think animation is. In just a semester you really do learn a lot about many different kinds of animation (not just Disney), and the theories and implications behind many examples.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in the whole history of animation, not just modern techniques. The course focuses a ton on earlier techniques and animation studios, which is definitely not everyone's cup of tea. There are a few opportunities to make your own animation, but this course does not focus on student-created animation, more the analysis of existing animation.",
                "If you are interested in animation or film studies, I would definitely recommend this course! It's a great introduction to animation as a medium and I found it to be very enjoyable and interesting.",
                "Definitely! This is a great class to add on if you are a different major. It is super interesting and you get to learn a lot of new insights about films that you already know and love from your childhood.",
                "I would recommend. The films are interesting to dissect and the large majority of the films were unknown to me so there was a lot of exposure to new content.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in animation or who wants to learn about various forms of media!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I found it both very informative and engaging.",
                "yes! anyone interested in animation and film studies",
                "I would recommend this course to the student that is interested in Animation history first and foremost. Although the papers of the course were analyses of films, I found that teaching was not centered around that.",
                "Yeah! take it. super fun.",
                "Yes I would. I found the staff to be friendly and engaging, and the material of the course to be fascinating.",
                "If you are interested in learning about the history of animation, yes. If you are interested in practicing animation yourself, no. The class is very much a survey of animation history and not a hands on course in terms of learning how to do animation. Overall, you watch a lot of good films, but occasionally the time spent for classes, readings, and screenings can be a bit much.",
                "Yes",
                "If you are very interested in an in-depth exploration of animation and its techniques then yes -- you must also be willing to dedicate substantial time to writing the papers and studying for the final exam. Not a gut!",
                "Yes!! There's so much to like about this class. The units on experimental animation, animated documentary, and animation in East Asia are really wonderful. The screenings for this class were a highlight of my week, every week (except for when we saw Final Fantasy, which was also kind of iconically bad). You should definitely try and attend as often as you can. Lectures were really interesting, and Prof. Gerow does some really interesting close analyses during class. Even if you're not that interested in Disney, you might still like this class. The course covers so much content beyond that and also goes substantially beyond animation production in the US. The assignments are as challenging as you want them to be-- not stressful at all. I personally had a moment, during my first week in this class, where I wasn't sure if I wanted to take this class (didn't love the first screening, which was Who Framed Roger Rabbit). I'm happy I chose to stick with it, since the most interesting parts of the class (IMO) came later on."
