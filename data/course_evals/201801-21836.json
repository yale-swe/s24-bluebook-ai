    "I definitely learned how to research, cite, and write during this paper. It was a steep learning curve and an intimidating paper, but I tackled it well!",
    "This was the most demanding independent research project that I have ever embarked upon. I found a niche field in American political science with little published work, came up with some interesting research questions, scoured for data across a lot of sources, tested statistical significance, and made some conclusions. Not to mention, I wrote 30 or so double-spaced pages for the first time... maybe even the only time.",
    "I learned about agricultural development, program design, and skills around conducting interviews. Additionally, the process of planning and executing a larger research paper like this was useful in terms of time management and resource management.",
    "I learned the value of an outline above all else.",
    "How to be a strong writer and think like a political scientist",
    "I learned a lot about the methodical critical thinking behind organizing and writing a research thesis as well as many of the available resources the University had to offer.",
    "I learned how to conduct an independent research under the guidance of Professor Ian Shapiro.",
    "I learned how to conduct rigorous research from creating a research question to situating it within theory to doing the original work myself. Professor Horan taught me how to do critical scholarship and engage in others scholars' work.",
    "I gained a great deal of knowledge about the history and trends of the coal mining economy in West Virginia, as well as knowledge about how to properly conduct research, organize my findings, and draw conclusions.",
    "I tied together all of my major findings from my studies of American Indian law and policy into one cohesive essay.",
    "I delved deeply into one specific area of political theory and gained a deep familiarity with it.",
    "I learned how to design a semester-long research paper with competing hypotheses. I also learned how to draw from academic journals, books, and public opinion surveys in both English and Korean."

   "comments": [
    "The length of the paper and the time constraints of the paper were fantastic. I appreciate that we have very accessible advisors, as well as very clear instructions. There are many resources for help. Lastly, I love that we don't have artificial due dates along the way like other majors. Great course!",
    "I appreciated the freedom with which I could find an adviser. Because I had no problems with my adviser, I do not know how to improve the course.",
    "I think for an independent research project it is well designed.",
    "Positive feedback. Strong criticism",
    "Strength: Flexibility in having adviser not only be Political Science instructors \r\n\r\nWeakness: Not enough faculty who are experts in SE Asia",
    "I enjoyed the independence PLSCE 480 provided. It would be nice to have a little bit more structure. One thing I would suggest is having students submit a draft by April 1st to the DUS office. Other than that, I really like that students can choose their own adviser and work out a general timeline with their adviser.",
    "Strengths: I met every week with Professor Horan who always read and critically evaluated my research, writing, and expectations. She was honest, straightforward, deeply caring, and knowledgable. \r\n\r\nI only wish that I had done a year long thesis (which of course is not professor Horan's fault). She is a fantstic instrutor.",
    "The strength of the course is that gives the student lots of freedom to design their own paper according to their academic interests. A potential weakness of the course is that its largely up to the student to keep themselves accountable for meeting with their advisor and meeting self-imposed deadlines."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Under a few conditions, I would recommend an independent one-term senior essay. It will be the easiest if: you have already have a positive relationship with a given professor in the major, your topic doesn't neatly fit into an existing seminar, and\/or you have already taken the seminar that best aligns with your topic.\r\n\r\nI was lucky because my adviser took interest in my unorthodox topic and had enjoyed me in class throughout the previous semester.",
    "If political science students want to write about something not offered in a senior seminar then I definitely recommend this option.",
    "Yes. Forces you to do in depth research and be a good writer.",
    "I would recommend this to a students who has good discipline and good time management skills, because working in the senior thesis in an independent course greatly requires these two skills.",
    "I would recommend doing a two semester thesis because it provides more time, and I felt like with all the other commitments of senior year, I didn't have time to do the thesis that I wanted. But Professor Horan is incredible and committed faculty member.",
    "If you have a focused idea that you know you want to explore further than a seminar essay would necessarily allow, then this is a great option for you.",
    "Yes, after writing the thesis independently from a seminar, I can say that it was definitely the better choice.",
    "I recommend this course for people like myself  students who cant find a seminar that matches their research interests but dont want to spend an entire year working on their senior thesis."
