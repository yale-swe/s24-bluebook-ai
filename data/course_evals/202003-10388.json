I not only learned about key players, events, and trends in Japan's history, but also about the connections these figures had to Yale during the period. Outside of lecture, I got a chance to look at primary and secondary source documents to better contextualize the readings, and also learn how to read historical documents using a four question framework.

                "This was easily the best course I took this semester and one of the best courses I've ever taken at Yale. The professors and TFs actually really cared about student engagement and took the time to really set everything up for remote learning. The video lectures were super engaging and edited so it was easy for non-Japanese speaking students to take notes on Japanese terms, and the handouts were really good and helpful but not so detailed that they would discourage note taking. Also had the most well-organized Canvas of any class I've taken.",
                "I loved Professor Botsman's videos and his attempts to engage with the students through personal interactions.  I thought that sections could have been outlined better by our TA to help us better prepare.",
                "Everything was great. Maybe would have preferred more of a direct linkage between the primary source texts we discussed in seminar and the historical developments described in lecture.",
                "The lectures were well organized and very interesting. It was useful to be able to watch the lectures whenever free since they were recorded. I would recommend some more visuals be added to the lectures.",
                "Strengths: the worksheet to accompany the lectures was very helpful to following the lecture, the length of the readings was manageable, sections were very helpful, the lectures were excellent and cinematographically impressive\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the release of the Thursday lecture was often too late to be seen before section",
                "One strength is the professor. Professor Botsman was so passionate about the subject and a wonderful lecturer. He transitioned so well to this format, his video lectures were fun to watch. \r\nAnother strength was the readings. The readings we did were so interesting as they applied to that week's lectures, but also brought very new information into the picture. \r\nOne weakness, which we cannot control, was the fact that I couldn't learn this in-person or through a live lecture. But, I do think the pre-recorded lectures were great.",
                "Great teacher. Good content. Too many assignments that felt unnecessary",
                "Prof. Botsman is a charismatic public speaker and really understands that this course happened in an unusual semester. Strengths are Prof. Botsman's lectures, while a weakness could be that this is a survey course, so I wish we had gone in more depth into some of the topics. But at the same time, it was really great and crucial (I think) to cover as much time as we did, so I totally understand the tradeoff that had to be made. I haven't taken any other classes on Japan or Japanese history at Yale, but I'd be down to take another one of Botsman's classes.",
                "The quality of the lectures was very good and Professor Botsman did a very good job preparing material and information for the lectures he posted. My only concerns were that sometimes the readings for the week would be uploaded late and that I think having a rubric for some assignments would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Botsman, absolutely. This man is a gem and he put so much effort into the recorded lecturesthey were super well filmed, snappy, engaging, and full of fun effects\/pictures. Genuinely looked forward to watching them every week. Workload is manageable, though the course is a bit frontloadedafter midterm, there's not really anything due until the final. Few, if any, weaknessesthere was a bit of uncertainty about expectations (re length, style, etc.) for the first two-ish assignments, but this was quickly cleared up after being brought to Prof. Botsman's attention. Teaching team was wonderful. Would highly recommend.",
                "I enjoyed this course",
                "Strengths: really loved the pre-recorded lectures + small-sized discussion sections, Alex was an awesome TF and Prof Botsman was a great lecturer \r\nWeaknesses: I wasn't really sure how much to read into the secondary readings, so I sometimes skipped them entirely. Since some of these secondary readings are quite long, it would be helpful to point out specific sections that we can skim to better understand the primary discussion topic.",
                "grading is a bit unnecessarily tough on seemingly simple quick assignments, but the assignments themselves are pretty fair and the lectures are highly entertaining, botsman is a fantastic lecturer",
                "More themes + concise focus instead of a general survey of everything.",
                "Professor and TAs are really good. Material could be dry, especially because it was all in lecture form.",
                "I liked how the course was recorded and that we could look back on the lecture whenever we wanted to.",
                "Strengths: Professor Botsman is superb. He's really passionate about his subject as well as sharing his knowledge with others, and it really comes across in his lectures. The recorded format also provided an advantage in terms of flexibility, and I never found myself bored watching the lectures. The TFs in this course (at least my TA Alex) was amazing and super helpful and flexible. If you have even a modicum of interest in Japan's history from 1800-1900, I would highly recommend.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None really. Maybe a final exam + a final paper can be a lot during finals period, but to be fair, during the semester, there wasn't that much work, so just something to keep in mind. The grading is pretty hard, but you never feel like it was unfairly graded -- it just gives you insight into what true top quality historical analysis.",
                "Recorded lectures were very good! They were smooth and well-presented, and always engaging. The one thing that could improve is the reading load leading up to the second paper, which was quite heavy. If I hadn't worked a week ahead of the syllabus, I would not have been done with the required reading for that paper in time to write it.",
                "Strengths - Prof Botsman, interesting content and lecture format, good section leaders. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The first assignment, a historical document analysis, would have massively benefited from a sample paper to show the type of work expected. Prof Botsman picked up on this for the remaining assignments though and it wasn't an issue, but that was a bad way to start what was a great class during the semester."

Once classes can be held in person again, I think it would probably be better to hear from Prof. Botsman in real-time and in person, but for now that's not possible.",

                "As above, the recorded lectures were fantastic. Virtual discussion sections worked well, although I think that participation was lower than in the typical in-person seminar. This is probably due to the Zoom format.",
                "Asynchronous lecture was much more palatable for the virtual learning environment. Prof Botsman went above and beyond in trying to make them interesting by adding in pictures, funny animations, and interesting factoids. By and far the easiest lectures I've watched. The fact he also actively tried to condense them to be shorter helped a lot too. \r\n\r\nThe sections were also good. While each group was quiet, our section leader did a good job of asking the right questions, slowly walking us through the material, and making the readings and discussions interesting."

Workload isn't too heavy, so you won't resent the class, but you still get to learn a lot from the lectures, the reading, and the written assignments.",
                "Absolutely! Please take it! Interesting, engaging, not too hard, accessible to people without a background in the area (I'm an MCDB major and my only background was AP World History), plus Professor Botsman is incredible.",
                "I would recommend - a lot of work but I learned a lot",
                "Yes! I would recommend this course to any and all Yale students. I would especially encourage STEM students to take at least one Yale history course before graduation.",
                "Yeah definitely",
                "Yea, it's an interesting course and the workload isn't too bad. The readings are long but deadlines are pretty lenient as well.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in Japanese history.",
                "This was a very interesting and fun class. The readings were also very enticing. Overall this was one of the best courses I took this semester. That is why I would recommend this course.",
                "YES! Professor Botsman is AMAZING and carries the course by itself. I only had a mild interest in the topic, but he made it sooooo very enjoyable and I definitely felt like I learned a lot.",
                "Yes! Fascinating and comprehensive course about Japan during its modernization period.",
                "TAKE THIS COURSE!! Prof Botsman is an ABSOLUTE GEM and I wish he taught more classes at Yale! I couldn't speak highly enough of this course, which I was looking forward to taking ever since I saw it while bluebooking. The course content is incredibly interesting, the professor is amazing, the TAs try to make section engaging, and the workload isn't that bad? Literally the perfect recipe for a great class."
