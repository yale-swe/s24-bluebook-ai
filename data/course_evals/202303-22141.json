                "Figlerowicz provided an open and comprehensive view of what literature is and how it should be viewed, putting pieces together of a study that has never really clicked for me. Viewing literature as art, a multifaceted expression of the human condition, with monumental thought and detail embedded into things I thought were irrelevant, has changed my perspective on the subject as a whole. The value of unintended meaning, what once seemed trivial and perhaps a stretch, became very clear to me throughout her class. She does an excellent job of showing why understanding literature from the past requires an open mind and an understanding that the values and ideas presented in the text requires a completely different cultural view. Overall, the course completely changed the way I viewed literature and art as a whole, showing me that it is an expression of the human condition like no other.",
                "This course really developed my writing and close reading skills. Professor Figlerowicz was incredibly helpful both in class and office hours and she taught me how to find and simultaneously hold multiple meanings of the text.",
                "The Literature track of the Directed Studies program allows one to engage themselves not in just the literary content of the texts themselves, but a close reading of the themes such texts may have in themselves. Even more-so than Philosophy and Historical&PoliticalThought, Literature will make you develop the skills necessary to truly understand how to find meaning behind every single word written by the author."

                "Strengths: Always community. Basically everybody is excited to be here and exchange ideas. That's what DS does strongest. The texts for literature always spark some very lovely discussion.\r\nWeaknesses: It's definitely a lot to get through, and it will always feel like you're not going as deep as you want to. But it depends on if you're willing to sacrifice that for the experience of traversing the span of the Western canon.",
                "The strengths include incredible incredible insight, amazing texts, a great structure. The only way it might have been improved is with a reduced reading load. In class we mainly focused on specific sections, so doing such a large amount of reading sometimes seemed unnecessary.",
                "This was an incredible class environment. I would've maybe liked one less class on Virgil and one more on Ovid or Augustine but otherwise I think this class did a great job covering an incredible amount of reading.",
                "Unlike H&P and Philosophy, Literature is actually really well designed in terms of how much content students get to read through over the course of the semester. Unlike the other two tracks, I have not felt the amount of reading I was doing for this particular track to be overwhelmingthough I will have to acknowledge that I had to skim through most of my readings."

                "I would recommend this course and D.S for anyone looking to understand how literature was molded and shaped by  different cultural contexts. I would say this course prepared me for higher level writing and was very facinating. I think for students who want an easier workload, D.S is a bad idea overall because the reading is a lot. Some people don't do most of it, but I think that takes away a large part of the benefit.",
                "Absolutely! It's was a lot of fun and helped me consider literature in a new way.",
                "Much like the rest of the DS program, I am recommending this particular course if you are interested in learning the Western canon in its entirety. If you do end up taking the program, then I HIGHLY recommend taking it with Professor Figlerowicz. Besides the fact that they are incredibly knowledgeable in the literature (and especially poetry!!) that you get to read, but they are also incredibly responsive and very much care about the quality of the work that you put out. They are more than willing to work with you on your ideas outside of class, and the type of feedback you receive on your papers is thorough and most importantly fair."
