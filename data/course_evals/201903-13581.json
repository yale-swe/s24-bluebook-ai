    "I learned how to skim Shakespeare, how to better perform a close reading without removing all possibilities of other interpretation.",
    "I developed an appreciation and knowledge of Shakespeare that i had not before had.",
    "A new lens of looking at Shakespearean texts",
    "I gained a broad knowledge of some of Shakespeare's major plays, and learned about the relationship between his original work and later adaptations.",
    "This course is a journey through the work of Shakespeare, touching on several of his notable works and draws parallels between them. The class also uses a study of adaptations of these works, film and stage productions of the plays, and printing\/publications of the work to further understand the role of Shakespeare in our culture and the influence of these various stories.",
    "Shakespeare was a crazy dude, and there is so much that you can learn about history, psychology, philosophy, politics, race, gender, violence, humor, love, beauty, and the world in his plays, and in the dramatic interpretations of those plays on stage and on screen.",
    "I learned so much about Shakespeare! Both about how the plays were received when they were originally performed, and how they have been transformed now.",
    "I learned how to appreciate Shakespeare's work on a variety of levels and ultimately improved as a writer.",
    "Lots of insight into Shakespeare plays I never would have otherwise read. Enjoyed examining the nitty gritty details that give Shakespeare his legendary complexity\/nuance.",
    "I learned how to think critically about Shakespeare texts, and move beyond the text to understand both the historical context it was written in and contemporary relevance\/ connotations. The course was also helpful in expanding our understanding of Shakespeare beyond just his texts to theatrical performances and adaptations of his texts.",
    "I read a lot of works by Shakespeare, and analyzed the ways they are interpreted from text to performance, and the social context in which they are received.",
    "I learned the skills of close reading and analysis, and I learned to ground my writing in the text.",
    "My relationship to Shakespeares' works morphed and mutated. Having taken the class, I am ambivalent about the \"value\" of Shakespeare and what this \"value\" might reside in. As the canny readers that we are in 2019, what sorts of meaning can we draw from these texts?",
    "I learned about the history of words used in Shakespearean plays, and how his famous plays were brought to life and interpreted throughout different time periods.",
    "Reading a Shakespeare play every week, the biggest takeaway for me was just the sheer exposure to Shakespeare's writing and how that writing evolved (and got extremely weird) over time. Along the same thread, the most fun part of the class was how Shakespeare evolved in the popular imagination through adaptations on film and in theater over the past decades. While I wish we explored more film\/stage adaptations in class, the class's focus on close-reading definitely helped me digest Shakespeare' soften inaccessible language.",
    "I gained knowledge of Shakespeare's works, background, and legacy. I also gained insight into how Shakespeare's work has been interpreted and how it has affected people over the years.",
    "I learned an enormous amount about Shakespeare's plays and, in particular, the adaptations that have been produced of his works.",
    "I read more Shakespearian comedy, and explored a few forms of writing not usually present in academic environments",
    "We read eleven Shakespeare plays and discussed their text and their adaptations."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths\r\nexposure to various aspects of Shakespeare's lingering impact today. I loved how Professor Nicholson's lectures made constant use of productions of the plays we read and how she historically contextualized each play\r\nI also really liked the exercises and how they gave us an opportunity to interact with the text differently, especially to analyze performances of the plays (since taking this class has shown me i much prefer interacting with Shakespeare in this way)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nreading one play a week meant we didnt really get to talk in depth about the plays; and given other coursework, i couldnt closely read the plays. Most people had read most of the plays before the class, but students who were not so well-exposed to Shakespeare (i.e students from less privileged high schools who only studied a scene from romeo and juliet) were at a disadvantage. \r\nI would like to have had the opportunity to write the midterm paper as a close analysis over a performance instead of being constricted to only writing about the texts.",
    "The lectures and classes were so engaging, though got hard to follow. maybe more of an outline can be made so that the train of thought is more easily followed.",
    "The lectures are amazing! Catherine is a star and knows how to completely captivate you. The short assignments are extremely fun to do and can act like a good starting point for the midterm and final essay.\r\n\r\nI wish there was more room for the postcolonial literature discussions that started in the last week of class.",
    "Strengths: Professor Nicholson is a great lecturer, and always had interesting insights about the plays we read. Also, the material is incredible; it's Shakespeare. \r\nWeaknesses: If you prefer to discuss literature in a seminar format, you only get to do so for 50 minutes per week in discussion sections. Also, while most of the guest lecturers were solid, I found Professor Nicholson's lectures to be far more interesting. And, because it's a play per week, you move pretty fast.",
    "The lectures for this class were incredible. They were basically fifty minute TED Talks, twice a week. I always left the class feeling enlightened and inspired. As an artist, I felt the urge to engage with this work and make something new from it. As a student and scholar, I felt the urge to learn more and do more research and write. As a person, I felt I had taken away something new about humanity.",
    "This was nearly 100% a class about the text of Shakespeare. I wish there had been more Stage and Screen!!!! \r\nI think that the pure amount of reading made it very difficult to thoroughly engage with adaptations of the plays. We read eleven plays, and probably 20 of the lectures were text-interpretation based. We read a play each week, and both lectures of the week were the same: interpreting the play through text. If we were assigned maybe 8 plays and many more adaptations to watch or discuss (or write about!), that would be great. Even if the reading stayed the same, that could be fine if one lecture per week were dedicated to an adaptation. Or even if there were optional film \/ play screenings to go along with section, or more adaptations available online or discussed. \r\nThe guest lectures were done very well because Professor Nicholson framed them, although I could always use more framing. \r\nThis class could be amazing if the engagement with theater and film was as thorough as the engagement with text. It seemed to be more balanced in terms of assignments (ie, we had an assignment about an adaptation), but I would have loved to see an equal engagement during lecture. \r\nThat said, Professor Nicholson's lectures are absolutely brilliant. She opens up Shakespeare to a world of people who might initially be resistant to studying such a canonical writer. I love how she uses every minute of lecture and I am always spellbound by each word and each interpretation of hers. Never make this a seminar.",
    "I loved this course! No weaknesses, only strengths. Prof Nicholson was an excellent lecturer and the writing assignments were well designed to prompt thinking in different ways about the text. She brought in excellent guest speakers and clearly put so much attention and time into creating the lectures. Could not have been a better class.",
    "The lectures were amazing. Many students applauded after them, because they felt much like the works of art and literature we examined on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nClearer feedback and outlined expectations on the part of the TAs. Many people struggled to find ways to improve because of lack of specific feedback.",
    "Strengths: fascinating and insightful lectures, engaged TAs, interesting and varied material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: cant really think of anything",
    "strengths - lectures were great, so were the short assignments\/ additional movies and plays we had to watch \r\nweaknesses - depth\/ quality of discussion in section",
    "This course has a lot of great lectures on Shakespeare that look into the plays from new and interesting perspectives. There were also several fun events\/guest lecturers. You do have to read a play a week, so at times it is easy to get behind on the reading.",
    "The course load was unrealistic. I wish we read fewer plays and spent more time on each. I found that I read very few of the plays because so many were assigned.",
    "I loved how many plays were covered in the course. I also enjoyed the set up because Professor Nicholson would give historical background to the plays and bigger picture issues in lecture, then in section we would dive into the nitty gritty. I thought section and lecture really complemented each their.",
    "Teaching Shakespeare is sort of an overdetermined exercise to begin with. Ok, so, as good members of a disenchanted academy, we're supposed to read the works of Shakespeare as we might any other text, paying careful attention to matters of genre, device, reception, etc. But if Shakespeare=Sontag=the menu at Denny's, then why not the menu at Denny's? If the point to be able to see with and through the myth of Shakespeare, then why Shakespeare? This is the question that I kept asking myself.",
    "Strengths = the professor, guest lecturers, inclusion of play-clips, material\r\nWeaknesses = none!",
    "Professor Nicholson's lectures were a definite strength. Given the limit of the 50-minute time frame during lecture, she still brings in wonderful insights to the class and commentates on Shakespeare's writing in an unpredictable yet wholly informed way. Still, I found the lectures to go by so quickly as to where there was no time for questions, and I often left lecture a least a little confused on the ideas presented to us during class. I found section to be helpful in nailing down some of those ideas; however, I would've appreciated a bit more guidance in understanding the language itself and how that language transforms on stage and on screen. Besides the various adaptations assigned to us as homework, I hope future renditions of the class finds a way to incorporate that relationship between text and screen or stage in a more direct and engaging way.",
    "This was one of the best courses that I have taken at Yale. The lectures were very engaging. The class was paced well so that we read a wide array of works but the workload was still manageable.",
    "This course's lectures are excellent, and the material is captivating. I can't think of any real way to improve the class; it's already excellent.",
    "Professor Nicholson's lectures were incredible, but the assignments for the course were not as engaging as those normally found in a Shakespeare course.  Also, for a course supposed to encapsulate the full scope of Shakespearian drama, this course was severely lacking in Histories.",
    "Amazing lectures, fun material, no weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "It's a good exposure to an overview of all aspects of shakespeare (page, stage, and screen). because english majors have to take a renaissance class, i think this one is good because of how influential shakespeare has been on english.",
    "Yes absolutely. The material was so much fun and interesting. I loved how each of the plays had equal time devoted to them, so we got to learn about more of the lesser known plays with as much time dedicated to the less famous ones than the more famous ones.",
    "Please take this class if you love Shakespeare!! Catherine's lectures are amazing and provide a very different perspective on every text and theme in Shakespeare.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in Shakespeare or who wants to fulfill the renaissance requirement for the English major. Professor Nicholson is a great lecturer; she consistently had interesting insights, and made fascinating connections between everything we read\/watched. It was also interesting to see how Shakespeare's original material has been adapted to later times. \r\n\r\nYou read a play a week, so it's a reasonable amount of reading. There are 3 short, 2-3 page assignments, and 2 major essays (midterm and final). \r\n\r\nAs with a lot of English classes, grading can feel harsh at times (an \"A\" essay can seem very difficult to get).",
    "This class is so incredible, and I would recommend it to anyone who feels they want to learn more about Shakespeare and engage with his plays in a new, fun way. Even as a theater person, I feel like I always found Shakespeare difficult to read and understand, but now I feel like I'm a great reader of the work.",
    "I would recommend this to a study interested in primarily discussing the text of Shakespeare. This is not a theater-studies or film-studies exploration.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone else. I ended up Credit\/Ding the course, so I didn't put in as much time as I probably should have to get the full experience, but I still feel as if I understand Shakespeare on a new level as a result of this course. Professor Nicholson is amazing, and her lectures are a joy to attend, even if you haven't done the reading. That being said, a close reading of a full Shakespeare play every week is a lot of work, especially on top of other courses that are reading heavy, so be careful about that.",
    "Yes! Professor Nicholson was great, and the course is really fun.",
    "Yes! Any class with Prof Nicholson will be a joy. I am firmly convinced that no Shakespeare course is complete now without her firm grounding in Shakespeare's cultural context and the cultural contexts into which it has been adopted now.",
    "Yes, because it provides a whirlwind tour of Shakespeare's work that is insightful and thought-provoking.\r\n\r\nNo if you know you already hate Shakespeare because you will be forced to write about it a lot.",
    "Yes, definitely take this, whether you are or are not familiar with Shakespeare. You will read plays that you otherwise likely wouldnt have, and youll gain interesting insights into the more famous ones. The assignments are interesting and not too taxing, and they really help you develop the skills you need  in order to write the midterm and final papers.",
    "yes, especially if you like Shakespeare! the lectures are great, isn't too much in terms of workload, and can be really interesting! I didn't find the discussion sections very helpful, but just reading the texts\/ listening to prof Nicholson is great. She explores the historical significance, the various meanings individual words within the text and alludes to several critics only to offer her own, often refreshing perspective.",
    "I would recommend this course to people interested in Shakespeare, whether or not they are super experienced in his works. The lectures are always really well done.",
    "Yes, this is a great course if you want a taste of Shakespeare.",
    "Definitely not. Definitely not if they are interested in viewing Shakespeare in adaptation--at a script a week, in a class all about adaptation, we watched one movie and one recorded stage production, which would be expected in any Shakespeare class, not least one called \"Page, Stage, and Screen.\" Lectures were aggressively didactic, entirely scripted (there was almost no improvisation or flexibility in presentation), and often felt as though they pandered to modern dogwhistles of \"wokeness\" without critically considering the gap between Shakespeare's literature and contemporary sensibilities. Rather than truly grapple with antisemitism in \"The Merchant of Venice\" for example, a trigger warning was provided, sympathy was expressed for any students who might have found the text difficult, and then a lecture was delivered on how \"maybe Shylock isn't an antisemitic portrayal, actually.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, since section is only 50 minutes long and sections are not particularly small, I did not feel that we were able to have as many interesting conversations as we might have in a seminar format.",
    "Yes, I would! If you're interested in Shakespeare or the theater, I would highly recommend because it really was such a great experience! As a student in this class you are able to bridge the worlds between reading plays and seeing them interpreted in various ways throughout various time periods, helping you not only better understand the ways in which the play's context can be comprehended but also how certain words or characters affect the entire plot.",
    "There is a heavy but manageable workload and a few fun short writing assignments; however, Shakespeare is still Shakespeare, and his writing still can be daunting and frustrating. The course's slight focus on medium (theater, ballet, screen) slightly mitigates that frustration, but it is still an English class with a heavy focus on close reading and writing. I would recommend this course to a student who is open to reading more Shakespeare or enjoys it (or to an English major obviously looking to fulfill a requirement), but Shakespeare's writing itself remains the main hurdle of the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It would be a great class for students who need to earn distributional requirements or the Renaissance requirement for the English major. Even for students who don't need the class, I enjoyed it so much that I would still recommend taking it simply to enrich one's skills in analyzing and writing about literature.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Keep in mind, this is not a rigorous seminar in the Yale English Department; it's a lecture, so the opportunities for engagement will be fewer. Be prepared for a slightly more passive experience (apart from the papers, of course). This is not necessarily a bad thing, however; sometimes, it's nice to just sit back, relax, and bask in a professor's expertise.",
    "Yes, but be prepared for odd writing assignments and a lack of histories - the course is overwhelmingly comedies, which I personally find least interesting.",
    "Yes this course was so fun and I gained a new perspective on theater."
