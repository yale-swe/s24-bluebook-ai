Feedback from the prof and TA was also super detailed. Lecture was sometimes slow.",

I also appreciate that there are recommended readings, in case theres a topic you find particularly interesting and want to research further; writing assignments and take-home exams were manageable and interesting; recorded all lectures, which was great during the pandemic and as someone with a chronic illness. All around a great course.\r\nWeaknesses: the only one I can think of is that sometimes sections were super unstructured, and although I really liked sections and the TA was really awesome, I did wish that there was more of a plan for sections, even just a teeny, tiny bit more structure, rather than just discussion based on whatever points people happened to bring up.",

                "Yes, this is a fantastic course if you are interested in monkeys/primates. Be aware that it is not a gut though. There are six papers throughout the term and there is enough writing that the course could be worth a writing credit. However, I found the papers very easy to write because the material was very engaging. There are no quizzes/timed exams, so there is less of an emphasis on memorization and immediate recall. The readings are helpful to understand the lecture material, but I mainly referenced them as I was writing.",
                "Yes, especially for those interested in cognitive science or ecology.",

                "no really, except if you are really interested in reading papers about primates. i thought that the course will be more interesting, but the way it was presented did not work for me. i was not engaged and could not pay attention. I needed more stimulation and readings that were more interesting. i wish i learn more about what day-to-day lives of the primates in the wild are like and did some field trips where I could learn from hands-on expeirnce. I liked when we saw videos and observed bones in seciotn. i wish there was more of that.",

If you're the latter, you should almost definitely take this course -- all the people in the class who were majors seemed to be ecstatic about it. Otherwise, the multitude of papers, the boring sections, and the lack of responsibility for any of the material (which means you have no reason to pay attention to David's lectures, as great as they are) means you could probably do better elsewhere.",

                "Yes! Great low-stress, non-major course if you have even a passing interest in primates. You pick up some cool knowledge and get to know if further study is right for you, and the course won't demand too much of your time.",
                "Gut class that's interesting and not something you'll learn about otherwise unless you're into the subject.",
                "No. Unless you see primatology as your future career, or find non-human primates so interesting that it is worth expending a credit d/f, do not take this course.",
                "Yes! Its a great overview of primates, what we know about them, why we study them, and what issues researchers and scientists are currently working on. If you have no interest at all in primates, animals, the environment, etc., then this probably isnt the class for you, but if youre interested in at least one of those things, I think you should check it out! Itll also help you develop your skills for reading, understanding, and even evaluating/critiquing scientific papers.",
                "I think it's a fun class if you are interested in primates. Learning about them helped me gain a deeper understanding of human behavior to a certain extent",
                "Yes, if the student has an interest in primates this course certainly covers that.",
