Many of the facts I learned shocked me and really opened my eyes to the good, the bad, and the ugly that is associated with the Farm Bill and the farming industry as a whole. Additionally, I also learned how to write a proper research essay that was highly analytical.",
                "Through this class I refined my writing mechanics techniques as well as developed skills to anaylze written pieces. I also learned to conduct research and synthesize multiple sources into a research paper. Further, I gained knowledge about food and the farm system in America as well as its problems.",
                "I leaned a lot about our current food and agriculture system, as well as SNAP and other food assistance programs.",
                "I learned a lot about the farm bill and food policy in various scenarios including conservation, agriculture, and hunger.",
                "This class greatly improved my reading and writing skills through the multiple essays and articles we were required to read over the course of the semester. Going into the class, I was not a strong writer, but after some trial and error in this class, I saw growth in my own ability to write papers, especially ones of higher intellect and length. Also, since this class is very much discussion-based, my overall ability to form opinions, ideas, and thoughts and share those with other people in an intellectual but comfortable manner was definitely strengthened.",
                "We learned a ton about the food system and the farm bill. We also learned how to construct an arguable claim, how to use tons of evidence and cite it properly, and overall how to write a strong argument\/research essay.",
                "A wonderful, interesting dive into the agriculture system. Great practice and feedback on critical reading and analytical writing.",

                "There is a lot of reading involved, and although this is necessary for the class, it also makes for a lot of extra hours to be put in in order to better understand what you want to write about and what interests you. This can either be a strength or weakness of the class, depending on how you look at it.",
                "The readings for the class were interesting and the professor did a great job of helping to guide the students through the essay writing process. The professor was also very helpful in providing feedback on drafts of essays.",
                "The strengths of the course was that professor Stuart provided a lot of feedback on writing assignments which helped a lot with developing my writing. \r\nThe weaknesses of the course was that there was a lot of readings which were manageable, but at time times, were a lot.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it does a great job of improving your reading and writing skills. Professor Stuart is a great teacher, and the class is structured in a way that is predictable and manageable. The workload was not too bad, except for the pretty long articles and stories that we had to read for each class, especially at the beginning of the semester. Also, the first essay was the shortest, yet it seemed like we spent the most time on that unit, compared to the second essay which we really only had like 1 week to complete. Dr. Stuart is a lot of help with writing these essays though, and for the final research paper, we are given a good amount of time and resources. Another weakness is that at the end of the semester, mostly the research paper and panel discussion are rushed, so you need to really manage your time well at the end, but I did like how we had no more work for this class during the reading period and beyond. Also, Prof Stuart is a pretty hard grader, and it seems you need to be the best of the best to earn an A in this class.",
                "The content is very interesting and not often taught or talked about. I learned a lot in terms of how to write a strong argument essay. The course is engaging but since the content is probably fairly new to most, we had to spend a lot of time in the beginning building a foundation.",
                "This class is incredibly interesting and well taught. Even for someone with no prior interest in the subject matter, I would recommend. It is one of the best ways I can imagine filling a first-year writing credit. Towards the end, some of the readings felt quite repetitiveespecially about the farm bill. I think unit 1 in particular could have been cut down significantly, in order to spend more time on unit two, which felt quite a bit short. In general, the reading was also quite arduous, and the large amounts assigned got very old once they were saying the same thing over and over.",

Obviously, since it was online, I think there was a bit less excitement and engagement in class because we were able to be at home, but the intense discussions required in this class still initiated a great amount of participation. However, being online definitely made class instructions a little vague and confusing.",

I learned an incredible amount of information, and I feel like I truly became a better writer.",

                "Yes. If you are even slightly interested in food policy, I would definitely recommend that you take this course. Professor Stuart is very knowledgeable about this topic and offers a lot of insight that you may have never thought of. However, beware that it is difficult to score an A in this class as there is no curve and Professor Stuart can sometimes be a harsh grader. Though a B+ or A- is pretty feasible as long as you put in the effort and attend office hours.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it because the information that we learned was interesting and engaging, but only if you like the topics of the course. Know that this class is mainly about the Farm Bill, and things like food stamps, the government, environment, and other more serious things, not actually anything with the more creative or fun aspects of food. Also, you really need to be on top of your game in the class if you want to do well, so if you would put the effort in then I suggest taking it.",
                "Yes. This course has a lot of interesting information and really helped improve my writing.",
                "Absolutely. This seminar is a fantastic dive into an interesting and important world topic. Even for people with no prior interest or knowledge, The Real World of Food is one of the best ways I can imagine filling a writing credit, even if that's all you take it for.",
                "Yes, I think the professor is really supportive and the course material is interesting and important. You also become a better writer.",
