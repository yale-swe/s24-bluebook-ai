                "This is a wonderful introduction to writing at Yale. I found that the standard in high school was no longer enough, but Professor Grogan definitely improved my skills by the end of the term. This course specifically focused on our relationship with wilderness and how humanity views and interacts with the outdoors. A welcome change from the \"into the wild\" whitewashed book.",
                "I greatly improved my ability to read a variety of types of pieces analytically and put them into conversation with each other. I also learned an incredible amount about American wilderness, nature, and exploration history.",
                "A new light of how to view, understand, and appreciate nature and wilderness.",
                "Was instructed on and improved skills for writing an argumentative research essay. Also developed new insights regarding wilderness, land rights, and other topics related to the class through reading and discussion.",
                "We practiced a couple different types of writing (literary analysis, research papers, public-facing pieces) and discussed a large variety of literature critically. I also learnt a lot about the nuances and complexity surrounding ideas of wilderness."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: This course was taught seminar style and was very engaging. Readings were not too heavy and easy to comprehend and discuss in class.\r\nWeaknesses: There isn't too much writing in the course. Only four major writing assignments, which doesn't give too much opportunity for feedback. Final papers were due before Paper 3 feedback was released.",
                "This course was phenomenally taught. The reading list was well-selected, and readings layers onto each other well. The only organizational weakness was that papers werent graded too promptly - only our first two out of four were graded before the semester ended.",
                "I loved this class. Top 2 of the courses I have taken at Yale. \r\nStrength - Commenting and discussions with Persuall is fabulous. City documentary is amazing as well",
                "Strengths: Well structured discussions, fair assignments, lots of provided support, interesting material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of",
                "I think the course is structured very well - there are a good amount of drafts required (forcing you to think about what you are writing earlier), and if not a draft, a roundtable. Prof. Grogan was very accessible and replied to emails quickly. I think some of the texts could be a bit more interesting, though I understand why they were picked (I also will note I thought most texts were quite interesting). I also think grading could be improved: we got our essays back quite late, and the feedback offered was sometimes quite valuable for future essays."

                "Into the Wild was my favorite class Ive taken at Yale - I cant recommend it enough to another student. As someone who loves the outdoors, it was fascinating and satisfying to feel my knowledge of the history of wilderness deepen and grow over the semester. So, so glad I took it over a gut writing credit.",
                "Yes. Overall fantastic course for anyone interested in nature or the wild at all. Permanently will change my outlook forever.",
                "Definitely anyone interested in wilderness topics who wants to improve their writing should take this class.",
                "Yes. It's a basic introductory writing course, and I feel as if it has served that role - I believe I am a better writer now compared to 4 months ago. The readings are generally quite interesting, the discussions are valuable and the class offers a lot of opportunities to get feedback on your writing."
