I also learned how to analyze biological research papers, learning how the experiments conducted were able to be carried out because of biochemical properties. In addition, these skills, along with the guidance from the TFs, helped me to become better at scientific writing through conveying complex topics in accessible and precise language.",
                "After taking this class, I developed the skill of analyzing and writing scientific papers with a deeper understanding of how these papers contribute to our greater understanding of biology. Furthermore, I improved my skills in applying my knowledge of biology to real-world applications. Finally, as a pre-medical, potential MCDB or MB&B major, I have expanded my knowledge within the field of biochemistry and biophysics that further enhanced my understanding of laboratory techniques as well as new biological concepts.",
                "This class is the start of the bio series, so it taught me the basic foundations of key biological and biochemical functions that should build my knowledge for later courses.",
                "I developed an understanding of biochemistry and biophysics, specifically in the 4 non-covalent bonds.",
                "While I came into this class with a relatively strong background in biology and biochemistry, I found that this course provided me with a more in depth exploration of many topics, including epigenetics and biotechnology. I also found that I was more equipped to read high-level scientific research papers and fully comprend them, as this was emphasized in journal clubs as well as the final independent research project.",
                "I developped the skill to analyze scientific papers.",
                "I learned a lot more about the basic macromolecules in more depth than in high school biology classes. I also learned how to better read academic papers.",

                "I have definitely gained more insight into reading scientific articles and analyzing them. BIOL 101 has aided me in being able to break down scientific papers, but also on how to build a community. Journal Clubs during discussion sections definitely aided in helping me further understand and talk with others to look at different perspectives and aspects that, I, myself would not have looked at before. I found collaboration to be vital and learned that it is very helpful when learning.",
                "I developed a greater understanding of the underlying principles of biology, in addition to further advancing my scientific writing skills. I learned about the way that high-level scientific research functions and the importance of papers to that work.",
                "I was able to learn the basic functions of some proteins, such as lysosome and the protein I studied for homework. This class allowed me to learn about many biological functions and their process through protein replication.",
                "Learned about macromolecules like DNA and proteins, and their functionality. Also gained insight into some modern research techniques such as Gel electrophoresis, PCR testing, and chromatography. Learned about Gibbs free energy and thermodynamics, as well as chemical kinetics.",

                "I feel like I developed a strong sense of biochemistry and biophysics. It was a fun course to start out the bio sequence, and I feel like I know a lot more about biology than I did when we began this semester.",
                "As my first college biology class, I think Biol 101 was a very smooth transition. I learned how to manage my time effectively and get my work done in the first half of the week. I also gained insight into how college courses at Yale work in a really kind and forgiving way, that allowed me to make mistakes without being penalised.",
                "I gained a much better understanding of biology, especially examining why things happen, not just that they happen.",

                "This course gave me a very solid foundation of what's going on in biology on a molecular level. I feel like I understand a lot more about many of the fundamental processes and am ready to start building on what I know in the later bio classes.",
                "This course taught me how to teach myself.",
                "I learned how to critically apply the key concepts and terms of Biology into real life situations. This course helped me develop a sense of what college science would be like along with the expectations for succeeding. I did my best to work with others around me and consult my resources for extra help. I learned what timed exams were like and the responsibility that comes with studying and preparing for these quizzes. I worked hard to understand the foundations of biology and tried to think critically about the importance and use of these concepts in the world today. I learned to accept failure and that my resources and support systems are vital to doing better.",
                "I learned about research discussion groups in the professional world, and a useful free resources for modeling molecules.",
                "This class provided an overview of biophysics and biochemistry, discussing intermolecular forces, types of molecules (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, DNA),  DNA replication, transcription, and translation. The lectures also went into various experimental techniques, like PCR, and explained how to dissect a scientific paper.",
                "I learned more about the basics of biology and how smaller molecules govern the complexity of life.",
                "I learned a lot about how to read and analyze scientific papers. I also learned about biochemistry, biophysics, and kinetics. I found the connections to contemporary issues to be very interesting, like how in the last week of class we learned about how all the class key concepts related to the covid-19 pandemic.",
                "I learned the basic concepts of biochemistry and biophysics and how they apply to modern-day research and modern-day diseases. I also gained some helpful study habits by having to learn everything outside of the class.",
                "I learned how to effectively and efficiently read scientific papers.",
                "I learned about the application of biology and the biochemistry and biophysics behind life. I learned about the gel electrophoresis and how biology plays a role in explaining about the COVID-19 virus.",

                "- Knowledge about Biochemistry and Biophysics and related lab procedures\r\n- How to read a scientific paper and participate in journal club",
                "We had a weekly benchmark to research a molecule of our choice. It was helpful to practice reading primary literature and responding to it, since I think most of us hadn't done so before.",
                "By taking this course, I learned a lot about the basics of biochemistry and biophysics--the laboratory techniques, intermolecular interactions, the central dogma, and even applications with COVID-19! I also learned how to manage a more intense workload and developed a strategy for test-taking. We also read some scientific papers that helped me develop my scientific literacy.",
                "I learned how to study without memorizing, I learned a lot about the foundations of biology that I felt like was missing from my background.",
                "I learned how to think a bit more critically about topics common in AP Bio or other aspects of biology I have learned about in the past. Biology 101 requires careful analysis of the topics studied and goes beyond surface level memorization. I think this is a good way to learn, although I would have liked to have in person lectures as a way of reinforcing the ideas shared by the course.",
                "This course was a review of AP biology. I learned to apply knowledge to specific situations and how to read scientific papers.",
                "I learned how to read a research paper well - very useful",
                "This course was really helpful in cementing the knowledge of biochemistry that I'd gained in high school.  While the material of the course was very similar to what I'd covered in AP Biology, I think that what set this course apart from other biology courses that I've taken is the emphasis that was placed on research and persisting questions in the field of biology.  It gave me a much better idea of what biologists and biochemists are currently studying, and it introduced me to some of the big questions that I could explore if I were to become a researcher myself.",
                "I developed a nuanced way of thinking I have never experienced before in my biology class. It was more than just the facts but what you can do with it to derive a solution to a problem.",
                "This course reinforced my knowledge on the biochemistry and biophysics components of introductory biology. Most of the class was review for me (I took AP Biology in high school), but I actively developed skills reading and writing scientific material. I like that this course had a big emphasis on skill development. Also, my mentor, Jacob Mathai, pushed me to learn more about genetics and mutations, which was cool.",
                "I learned how to think like a research scientist.",
                "I gained a lot of knowledge on fundamental biochemistry and also learned basic scientific techniques. I specifically learned a lot of biotechnology applications and understood how biochemistry is applicable in many ways to today's scientific, technological, and medicinal world.",
                "This course was a good review of a few units from AP Biology.",
                "I learned how to read and parse scientific papers. I also learned a lot about this topic of reading primary literature through the cumulative independent protein project we did. That project, while hard, taught me a lot about how to apply the concepts of MB&B to a current area of research, in the case of my protein.",
                "I strengthened my time management skills since the lectures were all asynchronous, as well as critical thinking skills since we were often asked to apply our knowledge to new problems instead of memorizing facts.",
                "This course was useful for learning how to read a scientific paper. Also, even when the material was nothing new, the quizzes forced us to apply our knowledge, making it a worthwhile class even for those with a solid background in Biology.",
                "Topics regarding biochemistry and biophysics, but the knowledge covered was rather shallow and not as in depth as I wished it could've been. However, the pace at which we were covering material was very quick, which made sense that nothing we learnt was really discussed in deeper depth. I developed a good understanding of how to write a research paper for science and experienced my first journal club. It was informative and I appreciate having had this experience. In terms of skills, learning how to fit in several hours of remote lectures every week was challenging but I  developed a more efficient way of studying, although my grades may not necessarily reflect that.",
                "I developed an understanding of basic biochemistry and biophysics in a broad manner. It was useful to get a big overview of the topics and to get a sense of what biochem and biophysics is. I developed a few study habits through taking this course, and I learned how to utilize the peer tutors through this course. An insight I had was that I like learning about these topics and am really interested in the next courses to come.",
                "I learned about basic biology and physics",
                "I learned about transcription, translation, and protein structure and function. The course did a good job explaining the physics behind protein folding and interaction.",
                "I learned a lot about biochemistry, DNA, proteins, and genetics.",
                "You do learn a bit about biochemistry. Definitely try to contextualize the molecular things into the grander scale.",
                "I learned not only concepts but applications of macromolecule functions, the chemistry behind life, and some thermodynamics. Furthermore, we were taught to \"think like scientists\" where we read papers and watched interviews of real researchers who utilized what we learned in class.",
                "Great introduction to college biology. It feels like a good set up for the rest of the biology sequence.",

                "How to read scientific papers and general biochemistry basics",
                "I developed more knowledge on the basics of biochemistry and biology through this introductory course. More specifically, I was able to refine my knowledge in the central dogma of molecular biology and see what were the various biological component that help with this. By understanding the basics of chemical interactions, I was able to learn why and how these molecules are able to interact.",
                "I learned a lot about the biochemical and biophysical processes involved in life.",
                "Honestly, my paramount experience was learning about how to best learn from online courses and stay engaged with a material that in many ways seemed impersonal ( though the lectures were engaging in and of themselves it was hard to maintain focus when I felt detached from the experience virtually).\r\n\r\nIn terms of actual course content I definitely was challenged to not only memorize content but apply them to real world applications which actually showed the gaps in my understanding and helped me learn better. I think this is a strong point of the course for sure! I definitely learned a thing or two about scientific history which was new and I liked to learn about the drama between scientists, haha but also I liked how Professor Koelle discussed issues of women in STEM, which brought the class out of a purely objective space but consider human relations to science as well.",
                "Since I took AP biology, I felt that a lot of the material covered in this course was review. In addition, I felt that the teaching fellow zoom meetings were not particularly helpful as my TF did not give me much feedback. I thought that the discussion sections were entirely unhelpful, as the topics covered during that section were usually the ones that were the most clear during the lecture.",
                "The capability of engaging in independent work and holding myself accountable for my assignments and lectures.",
                "The biggest skill I developed in this course was time allocation and management. At first it was hard to balance the required course load with all my other classes, but after some time I was able to better balance the work load and make genuine time to review material.",
                "I learned how to analyze research papers well and learned the basics of Biology well.",

                "I learned about the basics of biochemistry and biophysics: the four macromolecules (their structure and functions), central dogma of molecular biology, free energy, etc. I developed skills to analyze scientific papers.",
                "It's less about the actual content for me, because I personally had to relearn how to learn by myself.",
                "I learned the basics of biophysics and biochemistry and how to take the knowledge I gained from lectures and readings and apply it to answering questions on quizzes about biology and how to use key concepts to draw conclusions about biological systems. Additionally, I learned how to critically examine and learn from scientific papers and how to use these to write significantly about biological topics.",
                "Taking this course has enabled me to develop better time management skills that have allowed me to balance the work for this course, in addition to work from other courses. I have also been able to improve my scientific writing and comprehension skills, which has enabled me to better understand the text I had to read for the course, and for text I will read in future science / biology courses.",
                "In this course, we learned the fundamentals of biology, including the central dogma of life, gene regulation, and structures of essential biological polymers. At the same time, through weekly benchmarks, I feel like my academic writing skills improved. Also thanks to discussion sections, I was able to comprehend some of the most essential research papers of the century, including that of Watson and Crick.",

                "This class helped me to focus on the application of the concepts learned rather than only memorization.",
                "I learned that I need structure whether that is self-imposed or class-imposed to maintain a healthy time management schedule. In regards to knowledge, I definitely know a lot more about the parts of DNA and the bonding systems certain parts of the body/systems employ. Certain body processes and rules like Gibbs free energy, DNA replication, and multiple experimental techniques were also covered. Through the kinds of questions on the quiz, I learned how to answer more conceptual questions instead of just regurgitating information.",

            "comments": [
                "The discussion sections were one of the strengths of this course in my opinion. At the discussion sections, since we were challenged to approach the material through application-based problems, I felt that I better understood what I had learned that week. Although I didn't attend any due to schedule conflicts, I have heard from friends that the peer tutoring sessions were very helpful. \r\n\r\nThe quizzes were quite difficult sometimes, though. I felt that the weekly homework helped prepare me for the writing portions of the quizzes, but the multiple choice questions were occasionally confusing. I think it would be nice to have access to multiple choice questions, along with an answer key, for students to practice throughout the week and force them to truly understand the material tested on in the practice problems.",
                "The major strengths of this course is that the lectures are asynchronous meaning that students can rewatch lectures at any time to review class material and content as well as having lowest quiz grade and homework assignment dropped. The major weakness of this class is the way that the quiz is worded to trick students into picking wrong answers on the quizzes and therefore cause points to be lost due to lack of clarity.",
                "This course is taught in a flipped style, which was very unfamiliar to me. I think that it obviously grants instructors more time to go over content and allows students to go over the content when it is most convenient, but the con is that it does not allow for the student to engage with the content the same way they would in a live lecture.",
                "Strength is that it provides a lot of information regarding biochemistry and biophysics. The weaknesses is the very long lectures that likely take more time than in person lectures. The class feels very distant from one another, with not as much group engagement besides section.",
                "Some strengths of this course include the independent research paper, the meetings with the teaching fellows/mentors, and the breadth of information that is taught in such a short period of time. You do get a comprehensive understanding of the course material. In addition, the Ed Discussion forum helps to clarify any questions that students may have without the need to go to office hours.\r\n\r\nI think some weaknesses include the number of meetings with the mentors. As there are four benchmarks, I feel like there should be four meetings with the mentors. In addition, I think that it would be beneficial to have lectures due later than Wednesday afternoons, as they are quite time consuming to complete.",
                "The concepts could be explained better. I also wasn't a fan of the asynchronous video lectures either.",
                "Strengths: in depth material, lots of supplementary resources, interesting concepts, homework was fairly easy\r\nWeaknesses: flipped class, discussion sections were not helpful (but required), and quiz questions were poorly worded",
                "The strengths are the peer tutors and the help that was offered to students. In addition, there were a lot of assignments that added a buffer to quiz scores.",
                "I can not learn well in asynchronous environments. I did not like how the lectures were online. If I had a question I could not get a real time response that would allow me to continue my understanding of the topic.",
                "Strengths: I liked the protein project. I liked the information we learned. \r\nWeaknesses: I did not like how the course was structured. It felt like there was never a break, as every week there were multiple things due at 3-4 different days/times throughout the week. It was made even more stressful/confusing by the fact that each week the timing of one or two assignments changed. The overarching calendar on the canvas page did not always reflect the actual timing of assignment due dates throughout the week. It was confusing that some weeks the HW video quizzes were due on Wednesday at 11:30 and other weeks at 7:30. Some weeks, I had a pset and a benchmark due on Saturday, then a quiz due on Monday, and then the next pset due on Wednesday (when we were discussing specific papers in section.) This felt like way too much work due around the same time. I wish we had either few assignments or had the same amount of assignments but with a more consistent timeline. There are so many documents explaining what to do each week or how to format thingsI think the whole system should be simplified so their is more focus on the actual bio material. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the recorded lectures by Dr. Kabeche were difficult to follow especially in comparison to Prof. Koelles'. I did not get much out of them. I had to look up the information she taught on my own.",
                "Strengths: The course was relatively low-stakes, which fit my expectations for an introductory course into biology, especially for students who have never taken a biology course. I also liked the fact that lectures were made available online, alongside other materials to aid students in their studies. My favorite part about the course is its discussion sections because that is where you can get the chance to actually talk with others and collaborate. I think collaboration is key and the discussion sections help to explain things that may not have been covered in the lecture. It also gave students a chance to talk to their TAs and get some questions answered/clarified. I also thoroughly enjoyed the Ed Discussion option, which came in very handy when you are wondering about something. The Final Project/Benchmark was also helpful, in my opinion, because you were able to look at real life proteins and connect them to the concepts you learned about in class. I found that the concepts that I had applied to my protein, were the concepts I understood more in the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did not enjoy the entirely asynchronous aspect of the course. Needing to dedicate time to watching the lectures, while also preparing the other assignments often was too much for many students and many people ended up doing the mini-quizzes first just to finish before the Wednesday deadline. It felt like a lot of work at times, especially for those who had discussion section on Wednesdays. Another weakness was getting grades back on time --although I understand that it is difficult to grade everyone's responses in a timely manner, it is frustrating when you do not know what your previous score was on a quiz in order to gauge whether or not your methods of studying/understanding are working. Having that score can help students know if they need more help and need to attend more office hours or continue doing what they're doing.",
                "The flipped class format makes one feel small and isolated, since there is no opportunity to interact with the professor or other students. Discussion sections have fairly low energy, at least in my experience, despite the best efforts of the teaching fellows running the sections, and I suspect this is because they are offered at unpleasant times of day, and the desirable sections are filled up quickly by upperclassmen. \r\nThe course provides a very good overview of the basics of biology and biology research, but the sequence of the course feels odd, and the units are not organized in the most logical way possible. It feels as if we are constantly jumping to and fro from topic to topic, instead of gaining a solid grasp and then moving forward.\r\nThe assignments themselves, especially the course-long molecule project, were intellectually stimulating, engaging, and significantly enhanced my understanding of the material. Nothing felt like \"busywork\" in this course.",
                "I believe that one my strengths was that I was able to keep up with the online lectures and could pause and go back if I didnt understand a topic. It also allowed for me to take easier notes. However, having to learn 5+ lessons and 2 homeworks and readings, every week felt like a lot and many times it was hard to learn some topics as I had to quickly move on to the next. Also, taking a quiz every week did help to study the topic more but it was hard to really grasp new lessons every single week.",
                "I feel like this course works well for a certain group of people that prefer to learn the material on their own, rather than by attending lectures. While I can see why this actually makes the course quite flexible, I don't think that it's for everyone, nonetheless. I also think that there could have been more preparation for quizzes, which were often very unpredictable.",
                "Strengths: Covers a lot of concepts in a very short period of time. Lilian Kabeche (a guest lecturer of sorts) was amazing and the recorded lectures she did were coherent and engaging. Serves as an excellent way to bring everyone from high school up to the same speed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Covers a lot of concepts in a very short period of time. Consequently, the number of pre-recorded lectures and the content contained seemed like a lot at times. If you have an extensive background in biology from high school, the videos may seem mind-numbing but there is enough new content sprinkled throughout that you still must pay attention to do well on the weekly quizzes. If you don't have any background in biology, the amount of content learned is, at times, overwhelming and requires quite a bit of time to derive all the information from the lectures.",
                "The course is set up to be a hybrid of asynchronous and synchronous teaching. As a personal preference, in person lectures are more beneficial to me. The recorded lectures in this course were helpful for review and note taking purposes, however the in person activities (discussion sections) is where I felt I benefitted most. The strengths of the course include the organization and accessibility. The Canvas page was easy to use and navigate and the professor was very attentive to correspondences. The asynchronous portion is the only area I find any weaknesses, I think there are often a lot of moving parts going on at once and at times it can difficult to balance between asynchronous and synchronous efforts.",
                "Strenghts: I liked that the course was concept-based instead of memorization-based, the lectures were structured well and the reading workload was not too high \r\nWeaknesses: I did not like that we only had effectively two days (Mon and Tue) to watch all the video lectures as they were due Wednesday, that part of the workload usually takes me the most and I had to cramp it in.",
                "I enjoyed the course.  However I prefer in-person lectures to recorded lectures.",
                "I think the course could be more engaging if it was in an in-person format, or at least if the online content itself was more effectively taught. As it is, its quite difficult to grasp the material without outside help especially since the discussion sections only cover a fraction of the week to week information rather than all of it.",
                "I liked having the final project because it enabled me to improve my reading comprehension of scientific papers and I could see how the key concepts from class were used in the real world.\r\n\r\nI didn't really like having the prerecorded lectures because it was hard to maintain focus for the entirety of the videos. However, it did provide more flexibility.",
                "I think that this course is very good at teaching kids how to critically think about science and get past simple fact and answer questions. I also really enjoyed the final project, and I think that it really helped facilitate my learning. I also really liked that so many resources were available to students if we needed help. I was able to go to enrichment, office hours, and homework sessions, and they were all very helpful. I think that the only weakness of the course is just that it is so broad, so it is a little difficult to study for the quizzes. A little more direction in terms of what to study would have been helpful.",
                "I really liked how the work for the week was layed out on Sundays. I also appreciated all the resources that were available throughout the week for help with course content.\r\n\r\nOne thing I would change is the outdated lectures. I think it would be really helpful for Professor Koelle to re-record the lectures rather than using old ones that question things like when will we have a covid vaccine.",
                "The lectures and flipped format were excellent, but the quizzes were often a little too disconnected from the lecture material and it felt like there was no way to prepare for the actual information that would be on them.",
                "I think the layout of this course could be greatly improved. The pre-recorded lectures were obviously just online lectures filmed during the pandemic which not only made the class extremely boring but also harder than it needed to be since it was difficult to interact with the material.",
                "Strengths: the recorded lectures are a plus. A lot of courses don't have recorded lectures, and it's terrible that they don't. However, because of the recorded lectures in BIOL 101, you can rewatch lectures at your own pace to synthesize all the lecture material. The class is very nice in terms of accommodations to people's learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the timeline is very strict and extremely fast-paced. Each week, there is an in-person quiz on Monday. Weekly lectures are released the Sunday before and due on Wednesdays at noon. Homework and Benchmark (final projects that you work on throughout the semester) are due on Saturdays at 11:59 p.m. Some of these deadlines don't make sense to me. I wish that we had more time to do the weekly lectures/mini-quizzes. They should either be released before Sunday or not due on Wednesday. Releasing it on Sunday doesn't make sense since people will be studying for \"last week's\" quiz on Monday. I also believe that Homework and Benchmarks should be due on Sundays since it is appropriate to do all of that week's work on that week. The rigid deadlines make the course very hard to learn at an appropriate pace. \r\nAnother weakness is the ambiguity and unclearness of quiz questions. It causes people to interpret the question incorrectly and lead to incorrect responses. It's unfair for students when the problem is not their learning but rather the way questions are worded, not precise, not concise, nor clear.",
                "The lectures for this course were clear and easy to follow! And the professor and TA's were accessible to ask questions and all very helpful.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark projects were a bit frustrating at times and I wish there was slightly more guidance in terms of how to find good academic papers because there was a lot of guesswork that went into that process, and I wish that during the individual mentor meetings we had gone over the specific papers we referenced in our benchmarks to make sure we had actually understood everything fully.",
                "This is a course that does not need be online as it is tough course for students to guide themselves. Students would benefit if the course was held in person.",
                "I think that the strengths are the support available through HW sessions, tutoring and enrichment. I like that we can kind of work at our own pace but I think making the lectures due at a later time is a decision that should continue to be implemented. Journal club with the annotations at the end of the article were extremely helpful. I loved the study sheet every week and our to do lists. I appreciated the emphasis on learning rather than worrying about the grade. I also really liked EdDiscussion. I think that the 1-1 meetings with advisors for our benchmark can be useful, however I did not like the benchmark project. I understand the idea behind it and the exposure to scientific articles / independent research outside of the provided materials, however I found myself each week struggling for hours and hours to understand anything about my protein. I'm not one to shy away from hard work, but it felt like I was thrown in the deep end and required to write a lot about something I couldn't comprehend. It is good that these benchmarks are graded based on your education level in an effort to make things more equitable, but I could still feel the education gap very strongly. When I did stumble across concepts we learned in the course, I found it so difficult to conceptualise them in relation to my protein because the rest of the reading was too advanced. Although it did force me to understand the concepts on a deeper level, I felt like most of the time I didn't understand what was happening and hoped I sounded correct so I wouldn't fail. I appreciated the support from enrichment and the intention behind it, but I feel like there needs to be a better management of time for these sessions. There are a lot of things to cover and often times I feel we didn't get to the most important parts due to time. The worksheets were good, it would be better if we could take them with us though. This session would benefit from more student voice in what we feel we need to go over in the session. From attending peer tutoring and completing the quizzes, I found that some questions were put in that we barely talked about and felt that I wasn't prepared for. I also wish HW sessions were offered at another time during the week, I wasn't able to attend it and would've really liked to!",
                "The class format of watching lectures each week and only being in person to take a quiz does not allow students to be truly engaged or ask questions. The anonymous Ed discussion forum does not usually provide helpful answers. There is a big disconnect and this class does not encourage deep engagement with the material. I have heard many people say that they wanted to pursue biology but changed their mind after taking this course.",
                "Strengths: Recorded lectures allow for time to pause lectures and take notes when needed. Recorded lectures allow for the students to rewind and check the information, as well. I do enjoy the intention of reducing stress by dropping the lowest quiz, homework, and discussion section store. \r\nWeakness: little to no engagement with class can result in a poor understanding of concepts. There isn't really any opportunities for \"checks\" to make sure you fully understand the work because everything (except for discussions) is online. Discussion sections were the most helpful part of the class, but the topics discussed were either irrelevant to the quizzes or did not go in-depth enough to fully aid in answering quiz questions. Additionally, lectures had little to no turnaround time for watching and fully comprehending.",
                "Strengths are the ease of content. Weakness is the virtual video lecture style. The videos are a lot to get through and generally less engaging than an in-person lecture would be. Respondus Lockdown browser used for tests is inconvenient.",
                "Strengths: This course allows for one-on-one support and feedback from a mentor on scientific writing, and is a great first introduction to reading scientific papers. I somewhat liked having recorded lectures since I could go through the content at my own pace. The weekly discussion sections were also very helpful. Weaknesses: While the content was not necessarily difficult to understand, it took a lot of time getting through the weekly lectures and homework. You have to be careful not to procrastinate when taking this course, as it can be easy to fall behind.",
                "At first I enjoyed the asynchronous lectures but later I realized it may be more time consuming and less engaging.",
                "I didn't love how the class was asynchronous, and I think that I would have learned better in a synchronous class. There were many resources available like the discussion board, but I think the information might be better conveyed in a live setting, where live questions could be asked and students could interact with each other more.",
                "The course was very poorly structured. The online lectures were not a preference of mine and made it harder to concentrate and learn the material than it would have been in an in-person lecture. The final project was also a big weakness of the class as it felt like redundant busy work. The TFs are busy and don't have enough time to properly help each student with their project so feedback wasn't very helpful. The quizzes also made the class more stressful with very little benefit. Yes, we were forced to study the material and not having a proper midterm was nice, but it was hard to study material that was only presented in an online lecture. Instead of having the quizzes it would be better to take some time out of in-person lecture to go through the HW p-set, allowing students to interact and ask questions then. The class did have some tutoring hours and homework sessions, but they would sometimes conflict with other classes which is why utilizing the actual class time is something that should be done to improve the class. The professors and TFs are all extremely nice and willing to help, it's just hard to ask questions about things you don't understand because you don't even know how to phrase a question or what to ask. I would recommend switching to in-person lectures, reducing quizzes and getting rid of the final project, extending the p-set to compensate, as that is what helped me learn a lot of the concepts.",
                "Ed discussion was a major strength for this course. I did not find that the collaborative homework sessions were very helpful. The discussion sections were great.",
                "i dont like the fact that there are no office hours with the proffesors especially because some of these topics are foreign to me. the questions on the quizzes were sometimes trick questions and it seemed like you needed atleast 90% mastery with the topic to even get a b on the test. mastering the concept proved to be hard especially since everything seemed rushed. peer tutoring had to many students to ask questions i found trouble with especially when it seemed like everyone knew what was going on. its hard to understand on the ed discussion forrum because im more of visual leaner.",
                "I like the fact that the lectures on online, but I feel as though the lack of office hours negatively impacted my understanding of this class. I feel as though I did poorly in this class, so much so to the point that I have decided to pivot my career plans. I enjoyed the lectures and I think that Professor Koelle explained concepts very well, but I don't think that my understanding was properly tested during the weekly quizzes. It felt as though I understood the concepts. but the manner in which the questions were asked made no sense to me.",
                "Weakness: \r\nSlow response on edstem \r\nQuiz questions were quite different from the lectures and discussion sections\r\nSlow grading system \r\nDifferent discussion section quality \r\nStrength:\r\nActually learn knowledge",
                "I think the strengths is its focus on applying your knowledge. Many of the questions, homework, and assignments stemmed from applying concepts you learned in class. I think a weakness of the course is the virtual lectures. I do not like learning asynchronously, and I feel like having lectures in person would be more beneficial.",
                "There were many small assignments every week - online lectures with imbedded questions, PSETs, benchmarks on a protein we researched, quizzes, and textbook and primary literature readings. Between all of these, I felt the workload was too high. That said, I did enjoy what I learned through the benchmarks. I wish the lectures weren't online, but they were well structured around key concepts.",
                "I loved how the professor and TAs were always very engaged with the course and took the time to answer questions on the Ed Discussion forum! The office hours were also very helpful, and I feel like Professor Koelle's lectures and homework assignments were always very clear. I also thought the feedback we received for our assignments and benchmark projects was very clear and helpful. However, I was personally not the best fan of the asynchronous lectures. I feel like I learn best in-person, and not being able to ask questions in real time sometimes threw me off. I also tend to take a lot of notes, so the lectures sometimes took a long time and were a struggle to fit in my schedule. Another difficulty I had was that sometimes we received our quiz grades over a week later, which made it difficult for me to review them in a timely manner.",
                "A strength in this course is the ability to rewatch the lectures at your own pace. It helps that I can go back and look at them at anytime. I also really enjoyed my discussion section because I was able to learn about the applications of the course material. The final project was also enjoyable. A weakness I would say would be preparing for the quizzes, I wish we had homework questions that were more similar to what we would see on the quizzes so we could have more practice with them.",
                "The asynchronous lectures allow for more free time, but I also found disconnect between the lectures I think in person lectures would have helped my understanding more. I think a strength of the class is the 1 on 1 meetings with a mentor for the essay project as it gives students a connection with someone researching a topic in biology and gives student the opportunity to ask questions.",
                "If I had not taken AP biology, I would have been very confused in this intro level class. The instructors are not accessible for questions. I liked the Ed Discussion forum. The homeworks and discussion section topics seemed to be hyperspecific and loosely related to the lecture topics, they could be more focused on preparing for the quiz or reinforcing lecture material.",
                "Strength = it was online (I liked this format), not too much busywork\r\nWeaknesses = I don't think I learned as much about the basic concepts as I should have, but I got good at learning obscure knowledge that I fear might not be helpful for the future",
                "I think a main strength of the course was its use of specific examples to illustrate the concepts that had been covered in the course.  Lysozyme and other examples of enzymes were really helpful to explain the key concepts of the course.  I'd say that one weakness of the course would be in giving feedback after the weekly quizzes; I'm not sure that the ed discussion format was the most efficient way to get explanations of questions that you're unsure about.  I think an improvement for this would be to put explanations of the correct and incorrect answers on the quizzes so that once the grades are released the students already have those explanations available to them for every question.  I think this could ensure that everyone gets feedback on the concepts that they're unsure about.",
                "I think the course truly prioritized the students' learning and grasping concepts over memorization of facts. For example, the discussion sessions allowed me to engage in scientific conversations and it was also a space where I can ask for clarification on the current topic. As for a weakness, I would say that the weekly assessments are a little too short and don't cover everything I've studied.",
                "The asynchronous lectures are kind of a double-edged sword. While I liked the freedom and flexibility they provided, I was significantly less engaged with the learning. I don't know if sitting in a lecture hall with 230 students would have helped, though. Overall, I appreciated the asynchronous system. The independent project and mentor system were definitely strengths of the course. I also like how every Sunday we would received a Canvas message with everything we had to do for the week. That kept the class, readings, and assignments organized. I think the biggest weakness of this class was low engagement. The discussion sections somewhat remedied this, but sometimes they ended up being a little bit like lectures. I think those could be made a bit more dynamic.",
                "The lack of in-person lectures is truly disappointing. Many times it seemed like these were pre-recorded videos from 2020 during the pandemic. Some of the videos even had 2020 as a date on slides. It shows that the professors became complacent.",
                "I think this course provides a strong biology foundation and does a good job of introducing techniques like understanding research papers, interpreting figures, etc. I think that the asynchronous format is somewhat of a weakness - it makes it slightly difficult to ask questions/clarify difficult concepts.",
                "The biggest weakness of the course was the clarity of some of the quizzes. Multiple times, quiz questions could have been revised to make them easier to understand.",
                "I really did not like the asynchronous format of the class. I would much prefer to be in lecture with other people, engaging with the professor in real time.",
                "I enjoyed the unique format of this course being mostly asynchronous because it allowed me to learn the material at my own learning pace and around my schedule. I also thought the way that we were asked to apply learned material was creative, applicable to the real world, and engaging.",
                "Asynchronous learning allows students to take their time while learning and to forward or rewind videos when needed. The paper is also a good opportunity. The mentorship program could maybe be stronger, so that students are not left guessing how to fix benchmarks from vague comments but can truly understand how to improve.",
                "I don't enjoy the flipped classroom format of the class. I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that in person lectures would've proved to be much more engaging and improve the quality of this class. It is nice how the class requires a final project, a research paper because it makes me feel like I'm learning something other than just knowledge, a necessary skill I could apply to future classes.",
                "A strength of this course was the peer tutor hours on the weekend. It was super helpful to attend the hours, especially on Sunday right before the quiz to clarify any questions and study the material. Additionally, I really liked how the material was explained in the lectures by Professor Koelle. A weakness of the course was that the lectures were unlocked on Sunday, and were typically due on Wednesday, which put some students on a time crunch to get 6 lectures and textbook readings done in three days along with other classes and studying for the quiz that Monday. I think a better alternative is to have the lectures done before each student's discussion time rather than at 12:50 on Wednesday. Additionally, I think that some of the quiz questions were ambiguous and therefore caused a lot of confusion. Because the quizzes were only out of 20 points, even just one ambiguous question could significantly impact the score of that quiz. I think the quizzes could be clearer.",
                "The strengths of this course would be the discussion sections and the final project divided I to multiple parts. However, the main weakness would be the online course format for lectures.",
                "The strengths of this course were that every week was split up into manageable chunks, and that the lectures were pretty clear and descriptive. In terms of weaknesses, I think that too many of the discussion sections focused on reading research papers instead of reviewing the class material for the week, which I would have rather done.",
                "Definitely designed for you to have a lot of resources and outlets to ask for help and learn outside of the online lectures. TFs are involved and take it seriously to help or advise. But, I will say that the lectures are sometimes way longer than the time that youd meet in class which is like a logistical timing thing.",
                "I did not particularly like the online format of the course. For me, biology is a very visual and conceptual course where questions should be answered as they appear within the taught lecture. Oftentimes, details are lost within virtual education that cloud understanding. I would have loved some demonstrations of the concepts in person; however, I do realize the limitation of resources that might prevent that from happening. Overall, I think for being an online class I though the discussion sections were very engaging and helpful and that responses from professors when I did have a question were very fast and helpful whether though email or Ed. The quizzes were also very short and I feel like unreflective of the weeks material at times. I feel like they should be made longer( and have more time allotted) so students can actually display what they learned.",
                "I think that an in person lecture with the option to watch the lecture online or later on after lecture would be a good improvement. While the time spent watching the lectures would be equivalent to the lecture time for this class, it doesn't work out as the lectures are released on Sunday, we have a quiz for 30 minutes during lecture on Monday, and then we are supposed to finish watching the lectures before class time on Wednesday. Given this format, there are only about 30 minutes of class time that I can use to watch the lectures, and I end up having to take time out of the rest of my day to watch lecture. I understand that they aren't that long but it is a little frustrating.\r\n\r\nI also think that it would be good if there was a corresponding lab to go with this course.",
                "Strengths: very student-friendly. Weakness: online course",
                "Strengths: content was in-depth, felt like I came out of the course having learned a lot.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Fully remote lectures. A student who has never taken AP Biology would likely struggle in this course. Content was very rushed, with entire equivalent units of AP Biology being taught and assessed within a week. The peer tutors were very helpful, sometimes more helpful than professors. Some quiz questions asked things that students should not have had to memorize (ex: what percentage of the genome do humans and chimpanzees have in common) or had mistakes in their creation that professors refused to take accountability for. We often had 6 20-30 minute lectures needed to complete in three days, even when we had other classes to be mindful of.",
                "One strength of the course was having access to a variety of perspectives from professionals in science (professors, TFs, etc.). It was great to get mentorship and feedback from people currently working in the field of research! I feel that one weakness of the course was the asynchronous nature of lectures and lack of active class timealthough I got to work with people in discussion section and talked to some friends who were also taking the class, I did not feel like I got to know many people better through class itself.",
                "I wish we had more smaller group discussions so we could refine our thought process!",
                "I enjoyed the speed at which new topics were covered. One thing I did not like was the asynchronous format of the class. I feel I may have benefitted more from some in-person lectures.",
                "strengths: great content, well taught by a knowledgeable professor, good slideshows (more important than people think! super key to enjoyment and assisting learning. for example see psych 110's slideshows! accompanied by a great professor, class becomes lively!!), prepares you to think like a scientist\r\n\r\ncons: i think the asynchronous style was great for me purely as a first year because it have me the freedom with my time BUT also greatly impeded me a first year because i had to put away at least 4-5 precious hours to watch the lectures, which yes, \"should\" be 3 hours total in film given to us, but to actually process the info i had to stop and pause to take notes. i would've just preferred to go to class which is much less draining and my notes often are better when i can gain nuance from in person discussion as opposed to endless stream of info. yes, the key concepts and weekly notes were a life saver but as someone who learns a lot from writing out my own thoughts, it was difficult.",
                "The strengths of this course were the homeworks. I felt that I learned the most from the psets. The weaknesses of this course were the lack of office hours. The only \"office hours\" was the collaborative homework sessions, which I couldn't attend because I had a class during that time. Another weakness was the online lectures. Oftentimes they took a lot longer than it would have taken me to just sit in the lecture, and they weren't engaging. I thought that the TF presence in this course was also less than helpful, as my TF was pretty slow to grade things and didn't give that much feedback.",
                "The strength was how it was heavily focused on student individuality and capability to kind of do the work on your own while utilizing the Ed forum which was really helpful. As for the weakness, I would say for a first year intro to Bio course that's supposed to be an equalizer between certain types of students (those who took AP Bio and those who didn't etc. ) the whole do the work on  your own served a disservice. I liked the fact that we had homework collaboration but given that it was only during Thursday afternoons where most of my classes occurred I couldn't attend. I would loved for more homework collaborations during different days if possible for the next section of students.",
                "Weakness - I would say was commitment to taking notes during all lectures and reviewing in a useful manner.\r\n\r\nStrength - I would say would be ability to utilize what we learned in different contexts.",
                "The online lectures made the course incredibly unengaging and unenjoyable. As a student, I found it more difficult to take in the knowledge when it wasn't delivered in-person. I think that the online lectures should be continued to be offered as an additional option, for students to be able to watch them back at a later date, but lectures themselves should ultimately be in person. I also think that discussion sections should be utilized for doing the weekly homeworks, as the activities done were generally similar topics to the homework, and felt like pointless extra work.",
                "I wish that the lectures were in-person. As a first semester first year, I think it was difficult at first for me to figure out time in my schedule to devote towards the online lectures.",
                "Honestly I really appreciate that this is the one foundational stem course at Yale that is actually and truly accessible to people regardless of their background. Quiz questions were kinda weird though. Honestly I feel like Biochem is a bit of an awkward place to start a bio sequence.",
                "Strengths: concept of an individualized final project, Professor Koelle, problem sets, asynchronous lectures\r\nWeaknesses: topics tested on quizzes, problem sets, content and structure of discussion sections",
                "Very well structured, the class is made to help students succeed!",
                "The strength of this course was the weekly examination format in which we were constantly prompted to revise cumulatively.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course were the \"switched class\" format in which we were expected to watch the six mini lectures. While these were only about 30 minutes long each, they were taught at a pace that required pausing frequently to take down all the notes and ended up taking at least an hour each. This meant much more time reviewing these online lecture videos than the time that was actually allocated for lectures had it been taught traditionally. I also felt there was a lot of \"busy work\" that meant we would often have 2-3 assignments due at once that did not actually improve my learning. Lastly, the weekly quizzes, while nice for the reason listed above, often contained \"trick questions\" that didn't assess my true learning. The fact that they were so short meant that if you got one or two things wrong it tanked your grade tremendously.",
                "The recorded lectures give students much more flexibility to learn the content, but I prefer to have in-person lectures as they give students more opportunities to interact with the class and be more attuned to the content. The discussion sections were really helpful in tying together the main points of the week's lectures and helping to foster a deep understanding of the assignment/paper. The key concepts available to write on in later benchmarks was limited because of available information on the web.",
                "The strength of this course is that it is very comprehensive, as it manages to stuff a significant amount of material into a single half-semester module, and due to the constant workload the key concepts and other takeaways of the course are reinforced. However, the main weakness of this course is the online lectures, which do not stimulate interest in the class as much as in-person lectures in my opinion, and the sheer workload of the class, which is not difficult but can quickly become tedious as their are multiple assignments spread out across the week which always keeps one busy with biology. I found myself getting tired of the work at times, but all in all it could have been worse. I think a major road for improvement would be to condense the work into one or two larger increments of work per week.",
                "I enjoyed the hybrid model of this course. The combination of in person activities during discussion sections, as well as the in-person quizzes, balanced by the pre-recorded lectures was very appealing to me and my style of learning. This enabled me to take notes as I watched the lecture at my own pace (without worry of the professor moving too quickly and not being able to finish writing down notes), and I could rewind the lecture in case I didn't understand something and wanted to better comprehend the topic. \r\n\r\nOne improvement could be releasing the weekly material more than one week before hand. In this way, I can know in advance what assignments I have to do and how to plan out my week. There were times when I found myself struggling to balance the work from my other classes as a result of this. I do understand that we are notified if there are any assignments due earlier in the week than usual, but with the material releasing only on Sunday and having 2 days to complete it is still a bit stressful.",
                "I think the asynchronous class method is very beneficial and useful to students who have good discipline, but I would not recommend the course to people for their first semester because many have yet to build those skills.",
                "Every homework was due on Saturday. I wish the deadline was on Sunday. Also, there were quite a lot of \"weekly\" things to do: homework, quizzes, discussion sections, and benchmarks. Maybe such a workload may be eased.",
                "This course took on a flipped classroom format, which meant that all lectures were videoed and the only times we met were for discussion and to take quizzes. I thought this format was helpful to get adjusted to the BIOL 101-104 sequence, although I would have preferred the fully in-person format. I thought Professor Koelle was very organized, an engaging teacher, and did a good job explaining all of the concepts.",
                "Because the course is essentially asynchronous, it was difficult to adjust and find time to learn the material on your own. However, the course was very organized and there were many resources offered to help.",
                "i did not like that the course was asynchronous because i found it difficult to retain the material",
                "This course can be improved by having the video lectures posted earlier each week.",
                "The quizzes in this course went very in-depth into the material taught in the lecture, however, the online format was difficult to follow and not engaging. Because of this, the quizzes were extremely difficult and unmotivating for those with a weak background in biology. The main strength of this course was the final project and the benchmarks, as I found it was the only way I was able to learn some of the topics thoroughly. In my opinion, it would be beneficial for this course to either go in person or make the quizzes less difficult (or less weighed in the final grade) so that the material being tested accurately covers what is being learned by the students. It would also be beneficial to hold the homework help/office hours at a different time because the time slot on Thursdays often conflicts with other class meeting times and office hours. The wording of some of the quiz questions was also unclear and often led to deduced marks; someone should look over the questions and rewrite some of them.",
                "I think this course would function better if the weekly homework assignments were due Friday or Sunday and the online lectures opened every Wednesday. Having the HW due on Saturday made it so that I couldn't have a break from my studies on the weekend. My weekend workload would have been further reduced if lectures opened on Wednesday, not Sunday.",
                "I really believe that the contents of this class were very useful, and the discussion sessions were extremely helpful in helping my understanding of concepts. I think that the online lecture structure led to less opportunity for clarity, but I did like how I could pause and catch up on notes, especially when drawing out the images presented, which I feel helps my understanding of biology. I did not like how there was only one HW session and how other resources were advertised to those who \"really needed it\" because I was not able to attend the HW session due to other classes and I felt discouraged from using up resources since I already have a basis in biology.",
                "STRENGHTS: Interesting material, I actually enjoyed the final project and the discussion sections. I like the approach of getting us to think like \"scientists\" and how the course wasn't memorization-focused. This course helped prepare me for future bio courses/labs at yale. The Ed discussion and peer tutoring sessions were great; I felt very satisfied with the level of support I had in this course.\r\nWEAKNESSES: Some of the lectures on genetics (by the guest lecturer) were very hard to watch and might be better if they were rerecorded. I also wish there was an in-person lecture option like S&DS 10X. Also would be helpful if the lecture slides in the files section on canvas were bigger; the text is so small and partially hidden by a thick black border.",
                "I did not enjoy online lectures.",
                "quiz questions were sometimes too ambiguous/not covered in lectures.",
                "The async format of course was weird at first, but I think I quickly got used to it and I think I actually prefer it now. Professor Koelle is very good at explaining concepts, the guest lecturer not so much.",
                "Stengths - lectures were very understandable, we had many resources, it felt like a great course to take as a first year due to 'nice' grading choices like allowing us to drop our worst quiz score, discussion sections were great and helped me understand the topics better. \r\nWeaknesses - online lectures made face to face interactions with professor rare",
                "Strengths: The instructors made this course very accessible to understand as a student who had extremely little previous biology experience. They made resources available to ask for help and improve your understanding of topics.\r\nImprovements: I would have preferred in-person lectures to online ones. Online lectures made it easy to retrieve relevant information, but I think I would have learned more effectively if they were in person. There were too many assignments that often felt like \"busy work.\" I felt as if I was always doing biology assignments but did not need all of them to fully grasp that week's key concepts.",
                "This class really should not be asynchronous. There's minimal chance for engagement in the course given that you only show up to lecture once a week to take a quiz in-person. The quizzes themselves are poor assessments of knowledge, as they are all multiple choice and written incredibly vaguely. Watching lecture recordings is not particularly engaging and the discussion section, while occasionally helpful for clarifying content in the lectures, is basically just a group of students who don't want to be there sitting in a room. On the bright side, the course was graded well. I liked that the non-quiz assignments were given more weight since the benchmarks and the homeworks were far better assessments of understanding.",
                "I personally am not a fan of the flipped classroom model, I prefer to hear lectures live as it better facilitates my learning the material. I do think recorded lectures are helpful though, as sometimes I go back and review concepts that I had trouble grasping in the moment. I also wish the timeframe for collaborative homework sessions was a little wider. It just so happens to fall in a really busy window of my schedule and I was sad I couldn't participate.",
                "Strengths the professors are great lecturers. Even though the lectures were on zoom, hes very easy to understand. \r\nI personally like that the assignments were more split up through the quarter than all bunched into a couple assessments.\r\nThe slides were easy to follow.\r\nI loved the research project! It was fun to learn a little more in depth about a certain protein.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nThe impersonal lectures made it hard to stay engaged all the time.\r\nSometimes it was difficult to find what hey concepts we should use in reference to our protein, as some were more specific and some were very broad.",
                "Felt somewhat basic - jump from 101 to 102 feels significant.",
                "I really enjoyed the asynchronous lectures. It really freed up my time to work on the assignments and review important topics in the videos.",
                "My note taking skills",
                "Strengths are it's very well paced and designed, weaknesses are that the lectures are all online. Wasn't personally a problem but it was for some.",
                "The quizzes were relatively difficult but psets were fine and content was manageable as well.",
                "My weakness was initially knowing how to study for quizzes and learning content with not much background however this improved over the course. My strength was making sure I did everything I could to prepare myself for discussions and quizzes",
                "The course's strength comes from the clarity of the information presented and the fact that the professor and teaching fellows are eager to help when a person requests their services. Another strength may come from the professor's office hours because he always conveyed information in a clear, concise manner. A weakness to some is that since the course is structured asynchronously, many hours of your week may be taken up trying to learn and understand the information.",
                "The strengths of this class are that it is very forgiving to people who are barely starting to learn biology. However, one of its biggest weaknesses is that the benchmark requires you to link your protein to a key concept and that is always incredibly difficult to do since most of the time the concepts do not relate to your protein in any way so you are forced to link them very vaguely.",
                "The asynchronous classes resulted in a huge time burden on students as we had to watch all the lectures and take notes on our own. Additionally, discussion sections rarely enriched lecture material, the workload was unreasonably high and quiz questions were often poorly worded and unclear. This class could be improved by being taught synchronously, improving sections, having more input from TFs and other members of the teaching staff for quiz questions and removing the final project and its benchmarks.",
                "Terrible that there are no in person lectures.  Barely any teaching. we had to teach ourselves everything",
                "I don't like how the lectures were recorded and we had to watch them outside of class. I feel like when the lectures are in person I learn so much more from the questions that I can ask and the questions others ask. I also do not like how we had to use the ed discussion if we had questions. It's so much better to be able to ask questions in person; I learn so much more from in-person conversations.",
                "I found that the asynchronous format worked very well for my schedule. I liked doing the lectures at my own pace so that I could rewind and pause and replay to make sure I understood the concepts. It also allowed to finish all the lectures early so that I could get started on the homework earlier in the week. This course could definitely be improved by adding more opportunities for office hours with the professor, and peer tutoring. The collaborative homework office hours is only held once a week, late in the week, and during a time when a lot of people have class. And considering the large class size, I think a lot of us would have benefited from having more days and times where office hours were held. Also, peer tutoring only being held on the weekends was not always great because I felt that it enabled me to procrastinate studying since I wouldnt be able to get help and review for quizzes in person until the weekend.",
                "I did not like how it was online. That did not help my learning and it seemed very disorganized. The times when Prof. Koelle was not lecturing was very difficult to understand what was being taught. The quizzes also did not test us on our ability to comprehend the concepts.",

                "I don't think it should be pre-recorded. At least for me, it wasn't an effective learning experience. I think the amount of work assigned made it even less enjoyable. Maybe the Benchmarks should be reduced or added as a small part of the weekly HW. I think the Quizzes every week are excesive.",
                "Strengths: collaborative homework sessions and TA office hours were useful, professor was very active in responding to Ed Discussions, weighting was forgiving as an introductory course\r\nWeaknesses: video lecture format was not highly engaging/can be better split up",
                "They provide many resources to get help, and the peer mentor for the protein project (including the required meetings) were especially helpful guidance resources. The revision element of the protein project was also extremely helpful. The fact that each week required a quiz, a HW assignment, section attendance, 5-6 mini lectures, a Benchmark assignment, and a revision of the last week's Benchmark assignment, made the class particularly involved and stressful at times to manage.",
                "This course went into so much depth about chemistry and even some concepts in physics. As a beginner who has never taken a single physics class, this class was advertised as being beginner-friendly. This class is too overwhelming to be beginner-friendly, though. They would introduce a concept as if we were learning it for the first time, which is fine, and then they would skip and go well in-depth and then demand for us to know how to explain the skill in a complex and in-depth manner.",
                "Strengths: engaging and great introduction course\r\nWeaknesses: quizzes are worded weirdly and remote lectures",
                "I think the virtual structure of the class is a weakness, as it essentially makes the class entirely asynchronous. I think the discussion sections are a strength, because they allow us to practice in small groups and practice our skills. The final project/benchmarks are also a major strength, in my opinion.",
                "I thought the teaching by Professor Koelle was really strong and clear. I was never very lost in any of the material, and I liked the format of the mini asynchronous lectures.",

I also appreciated the journal clubs, especially the annotations provided for the papers -- they helped guide me through the content and taught me how to read scientific writing. I think a weakness was the asynchronous classes. As a first-year, meeting and collaborating with people in class helped me build community during this first semester, and I was not able to do that with BIOL 101.",

                "This course was an atrocity because it was conducted entirely asynchronously. This is the only course in Yale taught this way, and the reason for that is because asynchronous learning sucks. It was impossible to engage with the material because it was done exclusively through a computer.",
                "I feel like it should be taught in person rather than just online. Also the material felt just glossed over at times."

                "If you enjoy learning biology, then definitely yes. The instructors have specifically chosen real-life applications and examples of the topics taught in the course, which makes the class much more engaging. There is also the opportunity to research the mechanisms of a protein of your interest, which I found fascinating and fun. In general, if you have taken AP Biology in high school, having such a background will help with studying the material, although it is definitely not necessary. The enrichment and peer tutoring sessions provide great support in that aspect.",
                "I say I would recommend this course to any student interested in the biological field or pre-medicine student as it provides a solid foundation to the concepts in biochemistry and biophysics.",
                "It is an intro series, so i would recommend it for students planning on majoring in STEM.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who is looking to fulfill a requirement for their major, but there are perhaps other biology courses that are more intriguing to someone looking to have an introduction to the biological sciences. While I enjoyed my experience, I have taken other classes in biology and thus understand the course material being taught. For someone first learning the content, it may be a little difficult to grasp with flipped classroom.",
                "If you have to take the intro bio sequence, its fine, but if you just want to learn introductory biology there are better courses",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in science.",
                "Only as a stepping stone to other classes.",
                "Yes, but only if they have to take it for their major or are very interested in bio. Otherwise too much unnecessary stress.",
                "I wouldnt recommend this course if people wanted to take it for fun. I didnt enjoy the online aspect of it.",
                "In my experience, most people who take BIOL 101 do so because it is a pre-requisite for their major. I would not recommend this course to a student who does not need to take it, because they would likely be better served by a smaller course that better suits their interests, but I would consider it a solid grounding in the fundamentals of bio.",
                "This course is a requirement for many majors so I would most likely tell other students that they need to be on top of their homework and assignments or they will fall very behind in the week. I would encourage students to take the class because it will help in learning biological chemistry and physics, but they must be ready to receive constructive criticism in class and they may not always get perfect  grades as the class moves fast and it is hard to grasp new lessons every week.",
                "I would recommend this course if you need it for pre-med. Otherwise, I do think that there are easier science courses, and you really have to be a person who works best with the flipped classroom environment.",
                "Yes if it's a requirement for your major or you're interested in exploring biology. If you just want a course for the scientific distribution requirement, I recommend choosing a different course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. There is a lot of material to absorb very quickly, but the professors and Teaching Fellows are attentive and approachable.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, but only if they have previous background in biology; I would say this course would be too hard for someone with no previous experience in bio.",
                "Yes!  It is part of the into bio sequence so it is a requirement for a lot of STEM majors and also pre-med.  It is a strong course and you learn a lot.",
                "I feel like as a requirement for future study this course is a must whether a particular student wants to take it or not, but as a course I dont think I would recommend this as it just wasnt engaging enough and any intellectual challenges that it might have posed did not prove to benefit the learning experience.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it. I think that this was a good biology introduction course and I learned a lot, despite taking AP Biology in high school.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. However, if you aren't interested in the biological sciences, then I wouldn't take this course. It wouldn't be very interesting to someone who isn't going into bio sciences, and it's quite a lot of work, especially if you don't find it incredibly interesting.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Its really conducive of learning and making mistakes and letting people grow. Theres also so many resources for help if youre ever struggling or feeling overwhelmed.",
                "I would recommend this course because I believe it is an excellent introductory course.",
                "I loved the content of BIOL 101, but I think that the structure of the course could have been much better. I would not recommend this course to another student unless the structure were changed.",
                "If you are pre-med or required to take this course, take it. If you are not, do not take it, there are easier sciences to take for your science credit.",
                "Absolutely. If you want to take bio-related classes in the future, this class is a must.",
                "Only if it is a prerequisite and they are really interested in bio, but for fun, I do not recomend this course.",
                "I would recommend if they needed the pre-requisite or are generally interested in BIO. I felt that this course was a lot of work so if they aren't willing to put the time in, then I wouldn't.",
                "No, the subjects taught were all review of things taught in a standard high school biology class and the format of the class does not foster a want for learning and engagement with biology.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. Of course, it is required for many majors and pre-med requirements to take the biology sequence (sorry!), but I do think BIOL 101 gave valuable information and a good start to the modules. I know it is possible to skip BIOL 101 and 102 without testing out, but I think the content will be helpful in the future modules, is an easy A for those who are already confident in their biology skills (not the case for everyone, though, so don't feel discouraged), and allows you to get acquainted with scientific papers and research.",
                "Yes, as it provide the necessary background for most science majors. I think it is the perfect course to start with because the workload was manageable and the overall content was not too challenging.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it offers foundations in biology that many STEM majors need to continue to higher level classes. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this class to students that don't need it for pre-requisites because the workload was very high and there wasn't a lot of extra support for tests and assessments.",
                "I would not recommend this course due to the asynchronous format of the class and the fact that it wasn't well taught. It was a lot of learning on your own for an intro class that should be setting a solid foundation for students to build upon in future STEM classes.",
                "Yes because it allowed me to learn biochemistry and biophysics in a relatively low stress way. The video lectures and course pacing were a big part of this.",
                "no i wouldnt there isnt a lot of support with this course. only take if its required if not please stay away.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student if and only if it is required for their future plans or the major they are interested in. While I enjoyed the class. I believe that if you do not need it then you should not cause yourself unnecessary stress.",
                "I would recommend this course to only students who are very passionate in biology or need this course to fulfill their major.",
                "I would, because you need it for various upper-level biology courses and several biology majors at Yale.",
                "For those who want and/or need to develop a strong biology foundation, I think this course covers a lot of fundamental concepts and laboratory techniques that will be helpful both in future classes and in any laboratory experiences that students may pursue in the future. It definitely helped me gain knowledge and solidify a lot of concepts in my head, as well as learn how to critically think about scientific research.",
                "Yes, it is great if you have minimal to no background on Biology because they teach you important foundations that allow for concepts to make sense in higher level courses.",
                "It is a lot of work because you have to watch the lectures on your own time and be very efficient in order to do well. However, if you are interested in Bio I would recommend the course as a gateway to future bio courses and you will learn a lot.",
                "Not unless it is required for your major. This will not give you a good impression of biology.",
                "Yes, I would, it isn't too hard, and I liked what I learned",
                "I would.  I think it gives its students valuable insight into not only key biological concepts but research that is being conducted in the field as well.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to other students as it is different from most introductory science courses. I had the opportunity to read research papers and discuss them like scientist with my peers. I feel that I truly utilized higher level thinking processes to answer questions.",
                "Yes. I think biology topics are really interesting. Furthermore, I don't think the workload with this course was overwhelming by any means. The ability to drop our lowest score in each category removes a lot of the pressure on how we do on each assignment/quiz. Rather than being busywork, the homework assignments and benchmarks actually felt like they forced me to use what I learned and apply it in a new way. While I didn't utilize them much, there were a lot of resources (collaborative HW sessions and peer tutoring hours) to support students.",
                "Yes - it was a good course that provided a necessary biology foundation.",
                "I would recommend this course only if a person was looking to take a higher-level science course that requires the Bio sequence as a prerequisite.",
                "Yes. I think it does provide an important and good foundational understanding of the topics of MB&B, and allows you take take more specific higher level courses. I do, however, disagree with the asynchronous format.",
                "I would because it presents basic biology material in an engaging and practical way.",
                "I would recommend this class for people at varying levels of previous Biology knowledge. The class caters to different backgrounds well.",
                "Yes, since it a pre-requisite for many majors and you can know what to expect, there aren't many inconsistencies with the format or structure of the class (assignments, sections, quizzes).",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if they have to take a biology course. I think that this course is a lot easier to get through if you like biology. However, I think this course would be harder to get through if a student did not like biology/science.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. I think it is useful for providing a strong foundation in Biology.",
                "I would because it is a good foundation for biology majors and for later biology courses.",
                "Yes sureitll be alright if you really want to begin the sequence. You learn enough and you begin to get comfortable reading scientific papers and doing research too",
                "I would, it gives a great foundation to other biology related courses you might want to take in the future. Furthermore, you the course is very collaborative and you can meet a lot of other like-minded individuals who you can share the knowledge and passion for biology with.",
                "It is a good course even if you don't want to major in anything bio related.",
                "I would because it is very student-friendly and a great course for an introduction to biology.",
                "If you want to be a bioscience major or pre-med, you have to take this course. With that being said, I would not take this with any other demanding STEM courses (ex: CS50, Gen Chem) because the workload will catch up to you!",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in studying biology-related topics! The course created a great overview of biochemistry for me by going over some topics I already knew a little about and expanding upon them. I like the fact that the class teaches students about current laboratory methods, technologies, and the lives of biologists/history of bias in science, all of which are important for future researchers to know about!",
                "Yes because I think the skills learned in this class will be very useful for any chemistry or biology class that you will take in the future.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student considering a pre-med pathway.",
                "yeah, if you like biology do it!",
                "If you need it as a prereq, its not terrible. I would try to test out using the placement test if you can.",
                "I would because Bio 101 is actually pretty interesting and is a base for most science majors I would just warn then about how different the style especially if one has only studied in a traditional classroom before.",
                "Yes, I think that this class is a necessary foundation for more courses and the material will be useful when it comes to learning far more complicated concepts.",
                "If lectures were to return to in-person, I would recommend this class.",
                "Yes if you intend to take the whole sequence.",
                "Yes. I had a few options for pre-reqs in my major and held out because I wasn't sure which would serve me best. I think this is a great class for anyone interested in learning about science/research/anything.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student only because it is a prerequisite for many upper-level STEM courses.",
                "Yes! For both pre-med or not!",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student if it is not a pre-req. I was taking this course as an economics major just to gain greater knowledge in biology as I am interested in it, but the format was very frustrating to me. The professors were not accommodating or empathetic.",
                "Yes, because it's a good prereq for a lot of majors.",
                "I would recommend to another student if they need it as a prerequisite or if they are genuinely interested in biology and want to take more advanced courses, but I would add the caveat that any students taking this course should be prepared for a considerable (and constant) workload as well as tricky quiz questions. All in all, though, I would say that it was well worth the experience and has made me more interested in the molecular workings of biology.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Not only are the professors incredibly helpful and understanding, they are also good at what they do. They teach the material in a way that I am easily able to understand, and provide many alternative resources in case you are struggling or find you want more help in an area of the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who have good discipline and will be able to find time to watch the lecture videos. The asynchronous aspect of this course is beneficial in learning because you can always go back and refer to the videos for information, but it is difficult to manage this class in one's first semester. However, it is not extremely difficult to pass this class if you put in the time and effort, which is why I do recommend this class.",
                "This is a pretty solid foundational biology course. I do recommend this course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, even if their major does not revolve around biology. I think it is a great and comfortable introduction to the sciences at Yale, and Professor Koelle is a supportive and engaging lecturer.",
                "Yes, if they want to learn biology/it's a requirement!",
                "I would recommend this course because not only do you learn about biology, but you also learn useful skills related to succeeding at yale (such as access to peer tutoring, critical reading skills, and scientific writing)",
                "Yes, I love the multifaceted ways of learning: video lectures, embedded quiz, benchmarks, discussion sections.",
                "I would recommend it only because it is a prerequisite for MOST STEM majors, but if there were an alternative to taking this course, I would not recommend it to another student. I wouldn't recommend it because, although it is possible to do well, the structure of it left me feeling more confused than before starting it (for reference I did the IB Diploma and took higher level biology in high school). The structure of this course is also extremely disengaging, and the lecture videos are hard to sit through if you don't already have a general understanding of biology.",
                "I would recommend this course because the material is very useful to know and understand to the level that was presented in class. There were parts of the course, like learning about scientific papers that were very useful and that I think I will continue to use in the future.",
                "Yes! If you've taken ap bio it will be a great review and if you haven't the material's not too difficult.",
                "Yes, I would, it is a necessary introduction to many of the biological sciences.",
                "only if a major requirement",
                "Yes, its lowkey necessary",
                "Yes, if a student was interested in biology I would tell them that this is a great and accessible place to start.",
                "Yes! This course is a good introduction to biology for students who have never learned the material before and intend to major in a biology or science-related discipline.",
                "If it's necessary, but I can't imagine this course inspiring any non-bio major or non-premed student to pursue biology. It's not that engaging, which is unfortunate because of all the introductory STEM classes, biology has the most potential to be exciting and interesting.",
                "Yes! Of course this sequence is important for pre-meds and most STEM majors, but aside from that I think it provides a pretty solid foundation in biochemistry and biophysics.",
                "Yes. Aside from being integral for many hard science careers, the professors involved in the course are kind and great lecturers. Its a good introduction to biology in general I would just warn them the asynchronous nature of the class makes it hard not to procrastinate and stay consistently engaged.",
                "Its an intro sequence class - I ynderstand its importance, and I did like the benchmark assignments. But probably not just for the fun of it.",
                "If you are planning on going into biology, then you will most definitely need to take this class. If you do not need the biology sequence, then I would only recommend it if you really want to take a biology class at Yale.",
                "Yes amazing intro",
                "I would recommend it as an entry level biology course. You get what you're asking for out of an entry level biology course. It's not going to be the most life changing course you ever take and that's ok.",
                "If you like bio, its a decent class to take",
                "Only if they are interested in STEM because I think it is a lot of work for if you are not interested in STEM",
                "If a student does not have to take this class, I would stray away from it because there are easier ways to receive a quantitative reasoning credit. However, most people in the class require the course for their future prospects so be ready to work on understanding the information.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student but only if I knew that they would be capable of teaching the material to themselves. Otherwise I do not think that a student would do well in this class.",
                "I would not recommend this course if its syllabus is not changed. The workload is unreasonably high and its asynchronous nature leads to students teaching themselves.",
                "I would only recommend this course to someone if it was required for their major. Otherwise, I would only recommend someone to take it if they are very interested in biology; if they aren't at least interested in the topic I feel like most people would become bored.",
                "I would recommend this course for any student who is interested in trying out a flipped classroom style.",
                "No, because the asynchronous aspect of it was not great and also the quizzes did not test us on material, it was more on how you were able to interpret what the professor was saying.",
                "Yes, I believe Bio is important to any student.",
                "Yes",
                "yes i would. biol 101 is a interesting introductory level course and should be taken by anyone who is fascinated by biological sciences",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if they needed to know the fundamentals of biology or needed to take it for their major. This is because of the online lecture style of the course.",
                "Yes - but only if they have previous experience with biology. If not, it might be a little more difficult to catch up or understand, when workload is already high.",
                "I would. I like how it's designed for people with less bio experience. It felt very welcoming.",
                "Yes I would. Other than the fact that this course is a prerequisite, the professors do not want you to fail, the peer tutoring sessions are extremely effective, and it is a nice introduction to future classes. If you are a first-year looking into STEM BIOL 101 is a great starting point for figuring out what learning style, note taking strategy, and studying method works for you.",
                "Yes, I would. This class is an excellent introduction to Biology for people familiar with biology. If I hadnt taken Biology classes in high school, I would have struggled in this class because it is not as essential as expected.",
                "I don't think I would. Online learning does not work for me and it always felt like there was something I was late on, making me stressed about being able to manage it all over actually understanding.",
                "Assuming that they don't have to take this class as a major/pre-med requirement, I would recommend this class to a student with a strong background in Biology who wants to understand the small-scale mechanics and details of biology in order to build on the concepts with future research. If you have no intention of pursuing research, or you're looking for a class that explores more general concepts/topics, I would not recommend the course as it is time-intensive, and not the most exciting information to learn.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. If I could have taken Bio, The World, and Us instead to fulfill a general Biology or science requirement, I would have done that instead. Most people take this class because it is required for certain majors or because it fills pre-med/pharmacy/dental requirements anyway.",
                "Yes if they want to study biology in some form.",
                "All pre-med students are required to take this course, and while it definitely isn't the most difficult biology course you will ever take at Yale, the set-up makes it so that much of the work you do depends on how much you want to learn. The online lectures were an interesting learning experience, and they push students to hold themselves accountable to finishing all there work.",
                "Yes I would.",
                "No",
                "Yes, because it is a good introduction to biology and necessary for basically any bio-related majors.",
                "yes, because I feel like an understanding of biology is crucial to understanding the world in a concrete way.",
                "I would not recommend it unless it was necessary for their major, and I would warn them about it.",
                "It's probably a requirement but if you don't have to take it I would not",
                "I would! I definitely learned a lot.",
                "Do it if you need it for your major, but it is not worth it unless you're real interested in biochemistry.",
                "No unless you have to take it or just wanna crdf. If you're only taking it for SC don't.",
                "Yes because the content of the course was good but I just didn't like the format",
                "Yes! If you are premed, then this course is a must unless you test out. If you are considering premed, it is a great course to get introduced into biology.",
                "yes, it is a great entry level course to explore bioology",
                "Except for occasionally bizarre quiz questions, this course is bearable and quite rewarding.",
                "I would not because the asynchronous manner of this course is horrible and not conducive to learning the material. Professor Koelle could have done a much better job.",
                "No because I did not like the only learning style being online with quizess that no one really felt ready for."
