            "comments": [
                "I think understanding of course material varied from section to section because of TFs. Some handed out worksheets for every class that was very helpful, others (mine) just spit balled, rambled, and got mad when the class expressed confusion.",
                "The course failed properly teach any mathematical concepts.",
                "Strengths of the course are that it is straight forward and the textbook coincided with the material taught in class. However, I did not learn from class as much as I would have liked which resulted in me always feeling behind in class and putting in a huge amount of work while not being extremely pleased with my results.",
                "A strength of this course is the organized structure. The topics are logically ordered, and you can generally tell when one unit has ended and the other has begun. On the midterms, this meant that it was relatively easy to understand which topics you were expected to know for a given test. I usually prefer this course format to one where there are no clearly defined lesson topics or units. A weakness is that the course sections are all taught by different professors, which can mean that the teaching is not fully standardized. Depending on your professor, you might have a better experience in this course than others.",
                "The problem sets were helpful and the extensive time that peer tutors were available was also great. Another strength were the concept checks and practice exams before each exam. A weakness in the course was that the problem sets were always due on Wednesday while some classes meet on a Monday Wednesday schedule and some on Tuesday Thursday. This meant some classes were teaching information on Thursday after the relevant problem set was due. This was not an  effective learning strategy because students had to teach themselves or rely on the peer tutors to teach new information when that should be the instructors job.  This would be improved by making the problem sets due on Thursday nights. Also, another weakness would be the fact that there are many different sections with different instructors but all students take the same tests. Then, the exams dont seem to test whether or not we learned the material, but whether or not our teachers taught the right material. Maybe a solution would be to provide clearer information in the umbrella course tab about the expected knowledge going into each test.",
                "The strengths were the peer tutoring and practice problems provided. The weakness was definitely the p-sets as they were much harder and more difficult than the exams.",
                "The smaller class sizes were nice to be able to ask more questions to the teachers, however this increase in classes resulted in the math professor only teaching one section, while the rest were taught by grad students who had much less experience teaching.",
                "This course was organized in ensuring that assignments and due dates were very clear and there were many opportunities to work with peer tutors/professors one-on-one for clarification. The Explorations provided a basic understanding of material that would be reviewed in class, but topics could be explored further in class. This course could be most improved by ensuring that professors were all on the same page regarding material and teaching methods (some were much better than others).",
                "I originally didnt like the idea of Riemann sums because I thought if we just had the integral we should just find the exact integral rather than estimate but sometimes its good to know the origin. I also like that presentation matters because it gets us to work neater. The module videos also help. I do wish there were more professors that were easier to understand.",
                "Lessons were not planned well, had to self-study. Review sessions were helpful. Exams were very theoretical compared to practice we had in class",
                "The exams are harder than what we are given in homework or what we do in class. The class instructor should do with us harder examples so that we know what to expect in exams.",
                "The strength of this course was probably peer tutor office hours. If not for them, I would probably struggle a lot in this class. The number of office hours with the professor, however, could have been increased.",
                "Strengths: Curriculum is well organized. Plenty of resources for students to succeed (review sessions, practice exams, peer tutor hours, problem sets).\r\nWeaknesses: Quality of learning is very dependent on your professor!! Felt bored and like I was learning out of a textbook most times but it could depend on your interest in the material."

It is also a solid course for people needing a standard math class, whereas MATH 116 is meant to have applications to biology and tends to go beyond the scope of Calc II. I would also recommend choosing your specific section with consideration for the professor teaching, if possible.",
