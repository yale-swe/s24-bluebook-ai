                "I learned how to speak in more formal chinese and how to speak on topics relating to current affairs. I also gained the ability to read a wide variety of Chinese news articles without having to look up too many words, which was a vast improvement from my ability before taking the class.",
                "This class introduced me to how to write and think in formal grammar. Other than the amount of new characters learned (we selected the chapter we learn based on events in the world in real time), I got a lot better at writing and speaking in the way that Chinese news anchors speak.",
                "You gain the knowledge of formal Chinese used in professional news: you learn the critical phrases to read and write in such settings. The Chinese terms taught are advanced, and allows for a lot of growth. It is helpful to understand this Chinese through a news setting, because students learn to read news without translation, and thus come to understand the cultural and idiomatic significance of numerous phrases. This class is also very helpful in being able to discuss current events and how it impacts various countries.",
                "How to read and write in formal/media Chinese, which is a completely different style from conversational language and one which had seemed completely inaccessible to me before this class (especially because of the different/more clipped grammar forms and phrasings). I also learned a lot of specialized vocabulary on topics like diplomatic visits, conferences, natural disasters, sports, and economics.",
                "I learned new vocabulary having to do with current events and learned to speak and write in a formal news register.",
                "I improved my reading and listening skills and expanded my understanding of formal Chinese. I previously was not familiar with stylistic differences in Chinese, and this class improved my confidence in addressing topics with formal speech, which differs significantly from colloquial Mandarin speaking. The weekly writing assignments were also extremely conducive to improving my grasp of complex vocabulary and improved my ability to write quickly and efficiently, something I previously struggled with. Moreover, the content of the course exposed me to more global issues and perspectives from Chinese news sites.",
                "This course allowed me to understand a deeper level of Chinese culture and society that I had previously never encountered. The language (tailored specifically to our usage in formal settings!) learned and sentence structures covered in the class definitely have sharpened my understanding and comprehension of Chinese language. Interestingly, because of the course's structure that emphasizes the application of the learned vocabulary over learning how to write it, I have found that my reading skills and speaking skills have improved dramatically (ie less stuttering, more fluid parsing of texts)."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: clear feedback from Zhou Laoshi, lots of opportunities to speak and read in class, very connected to current affairs which made the material we were learning more engaging and applicable. The structure of the course (choosing sections of the textbook based on what was happening in the world that week) was great. Zhou laoshi was also very receptive to our feedback, which was very nice.",
                "The course is very well organized, and well taught. Assignments every week are reasonable and genuinely help with practicing and strengthening Chinese language ability, and it takes maybe 5 hours a week to complete. The professors also tend to engage in some discussion about current events, which is cool to have too.",
                "The textbook used for this course is always updated to include the most relevant current events and phrases needed to discuss such topics. You will always feel like you are learning something relevant and will be able to apply your learning quickly. This class is good at using the most relevant current affairs topics to guide discussion and learning. A weakness is that it may be repetitive. The assignments include weekly news writing, reading, and oral reports for each topic.",
                "Strengths: Zhou Laoshi is a wonderful and knowledgeable professor who is truly enthusiastic about this course and its pedagogy -- it's clearly something he has designed and is invested in. The class is well-set up, using \"textbook\" texts that are just news articles from a year or two ago as a baseline, but choosing each successive unit based on what important events have happened in the world as the semester progresses. The homework is enough to keep you actually learning the vocabulary and material, but generally not overburdensome, and the exams are very straightforward. Weaknesses: We occasionally spent a few minutes in class at the end of units watching TV news segments on the topic of that unit, but we didn't really discuss them, break them down, or practice listening to them. As a result, I didn't feel like my ability to listen to the news (as opposed to read articles) got a lot better, which I might've appreciated. In addition, while none of the students seemed too familiar with news-style Chinese, there was a massive range in conversational abilities, including some heritage speakers who seemed to have virtually native-level conversational skills. While this is par for the course, it meant that any kind of speaking activity felt a bit awkward.",
                "I learned a lot of new vocabulary but I think the class would have benefited from more in-class discussions and listening practice.",
                "This course provides an extremely structured approach to learning about Chinese for Current Affairs, and I enjoyed that our weekly chapters corresponded with real events happening in the world. I think that the course improved students' ability to read and write formally, although I think that more discussion-based exercises could be incorporated to exercise how to debate different perspectives on the news."

                "I would, with the caveat that it's much more difficult for non-native speakers than native speakers (as is likely the case with many advanced Chinese courses at Yale). However, if you are willing to go to Zhou laoshi for help, then you can definitely do well.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this to any student wanting to speak Chinese more formally. It is a good introduction to not only current events, but other areas like academics and stuff too.",
                "If you are interested in learning this specific type of Chinese, yes!!! Students should know that this course does not cover conventional Chinese, but very advanced and formal Chinese used in news settings. If you want to understand Chinese and current affairs in a professional setting, this is the class for you. It may be a little hard at first to adjust to this type of Chinese, but the professor makes sure you get the hang of it, and students will find their way of learning in this course because the assignments are so consistent.",
                "Yes! It was mostly composed of first-year students (mostly heritage speakers) who had tested directly into 166+, a couple upperclassmen who also tested directly into it, and a couple upperclassmen who had taken the previous Chinese courses (153/159). It's a very engaging course -- more than many of the previous \"standard\" Chinese courses at the 150 level or below -- where you learn a different register of the language, with a very practical goal: being able to understand and reproduce the language in news articles. That said, this is not a current-affairs discussion or \"learn how to talk about the news with your friends\" class. It's about reading \"news-style\" Chinese. It definitely improved my formal writing in general, even though we didn't do a ton of writing; I don't think it did anything for my speaking skills, though, so if you're looking for a class that exercises those abilities, you might want to look elsewhere.",
                "I would! Zhou Laoshi is very kind and dedicated, and I think the content we learned is helpful because news Chinese is quite different from day-to-day spoken Chinese.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in expanding their formal vocabulary to gain the ability to converse on current topics in Chinese. This course improved my ability to follow fast-paced news reports in Chinese and significantly improved my written capabilities. The common phrases you will learn in this class are pulled from news articles and are directly applicable to understanding news reports in Chinese.",
                "While the course itself may prove rigorous with its weekly homework workload, it is still very much enjoyable. The finished product of learning at the end of the semester (both examinations and a video project) certainly help to summarize and allow students to reflect on what they have accomplished in the class. That said, the workload IS rigorous. Weekly presentations that are worth preparing for, extended writing assignments, and textbook problems are to be expected with every unit covered (each unit lasts about a week). As a result, CHNS 166 should be strictly for students with extensive background in the language. Students who look forward to taking this class should expect to discuss topical issues in the news cycles in unbroken and elevated Chinese."
