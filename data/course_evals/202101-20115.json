                "Strengths: Dr. Evans is very knowledgeable and passionate about comparative anatomy and it definitely shows through her teaching style. I really enjoyed her lectures and she presents information in a clear and concise manner. She's also very kind and understanding - the biggest strength of this course.\r\nWeakness: For lab reports, I feel as though I got most of my information from outside sources and felt as though the materials provided by the instructors were not sufficient enough to complete the lab reports.",
                "Overall, I feel the class was very well taught and did a good job of adapting to COVID. However, I feel like some key information was left out that could have assisted with the labs, such as the relationship between muscles and respiration in amphibians.",
                "I think given the circumstances of online learning it was as best as could be.",
                "Being a virtual lab its definitely not as engaging as an in person lab but I thought it really exceeded my expectations. I thought Id was well organised, there were clear expectations and I felt prepared for exams. I would have preferred to use the visible body software more since buying it was required and this would put more focus on the human systems (especially for premeds) or alternatively not use it at all since we already had one main mammal system (cat). It was a bit difficult to stay engaged with the early lectures when we were just drawing microscope slides so I would suggest condensing those into fewer labs if possible.",
                "The \"lecture\" content for this class was very thorough and engaging. \r\nThe course could be improved with greater feedback (whether personal or for the class overall) over the submissions.",
                "Strengths: Very organized lectures, filled in a lot of gaps from anatomy lecture course, virtual dissections were fun\r\nWeaknesses: Video dissections could be unclear at times, can't replicate in-person dissections",
                "The professor Dr. Evans was really great. Very nice, engaging, smart, answers all of my questions. The pre-lab lectures were very concise and clear.\r\nThe first couple labs were not as interesting because of the format of looking at images/3D scans and just drawing and labelling. I thought histology and microscopy could have been cut in favor of learning the digestive system, but the class got more interesting as we went."

                "Posting pre-lab lectures in the media library was the best possible practice because it allowed for flexibility and meant I could watch the lectures at my availability instead of being tied to my computer every Thursday. The overall flexibility of the course was the greatest success, and I was very grateful for the chance to have a week to complete lab reports and watch the videos in my own time.",

                "I thought the time after lecture when we could work on activities/lab reports and ask questions was really useful, but I appreciated that it wasnt mandatory for every week. I also found the synchronous lectures useful. The dissection videos and 3D models were really good",
                "I think the lab style overall worked pretty well. We had a 30 minute live lecture on Zoom, then we could log off and work on the lab ourselves. I personally preferred things this way.",
                "The visible body courseware was definitely fun to work with and to learn from, though of course, nothing can really beat in-person dissections.",
                "Virtual dissection application was useful but only for human body\r\nVideo dissections covered most things but still weren't as clear as in-person dissection could be",
                "I thought the video dissections were really clear and good because we could watch and pause at our own pace. I would have liked if instead of a separate links document, the links were all embedded in the one lab instructions document. In general, would have been nice if all resources were consolidated, honestly would have preferred a recommended textbook because often felt like I was searching in many places for information. Loved the pre-lab lectures, very helpful. TAs were very responsive."

                "Yes, it was very interesting and engaging. If you like evolutionary bio, this course is a great way to understand evolution of form and function.",
                "Yes. Most people who take the lab will probably need to for a major requirement but I found the information actually really interesting and it was presented in a more digestible way than the 290 lecture. I would definitely recommend it for someone looking for a biology lab because all the information you need is presented in the lab lectures without needing to take 290 at the same time. The focus on vertebrates also makes it feel more relevant than a general ecology/EEB lab especially for a premed student",

                "Yes, it was a good companion course to E&EB 290",
                "Yes, it is a hefty time commitment because sometimes you don't finish the lab during the lab section and you have to finish it on your own AND do the lab report. But later, when the lab reports were just one or two written answers, you get the hang of the assignment and it doesn't take as long + you learn more. Great professor, if it's taught by Dr. Evans I would recommend this course. She makes the course well-organized and is a really clear instructor."
