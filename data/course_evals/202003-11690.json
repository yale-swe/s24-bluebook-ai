                "Strengths: Plenty of resources available to help you do well. Problem sets and practice exams closely matched actual exams. Develop problem-solving skills.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The weekly exploration assignments were not as helpful as they were intended to be. The professor was not very receptive to the questions that were left on the explorations. Also, the notes at the end of each exploration generally stopped being useful after they stopped using videos.",

                "Some of the course's strengths were the sequence of units, the exploration assignments, and availability of peer tutoring and office hours. The only weakness of the course was the occasional failure to integrate textbook concepts into classroom lessons. This could be easily fixed by doing a review of the problem set concepts before class.",
                "Strengths: The schedule was well thought out and time to each subject was allocated well.\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures were not recorded so it was sometimes difficult to review past material depending on your professor's notes. Talking to other people in the class it was obvious some profs were better than others.",
                "I would have learnt better if the classes\/lectures had been recorded. I still would have liked to attend them live, but having to option to watch the class back again to catch things I missed would have been highly beneficial for me as I find it harder to concentrate when learning online.",

Something that could be improved was placing groups into breakout rooms to do practice problems. I found that oftentimes, groups would not do the problems during the time allocated.",

Essentially, people were too scared they were wrong and didnt have friendship ties that gave them the security to attempt problems. Alongside this, the absence of recorded lecture made it even more difficult to properly absorb information. Online office hours were very useful and helpful."
