These include search costs, innovation prizes, vertical integration, durable goods, leasing, and price discrimination. We also learned many qualitative aspects of innovation, such as laws about intellectual property, use cases of AI in modern industries, market power, mergers, and cumulative innovation. I also learned about many of the considerations firms must face when innovating, and how they may strategize around innovation.",

            "comments": [
                "Interesting material, very low workload -- just problem sets, one presentation, and an in-class final exam. Professor Chalioti is amazing and really cares about her students! No improvements!",
                "Professor Chaliotis teaching was the main strength of this course. She was passionate about the material and kept it interesting through less exciting topics. The course was a good chance to practice problem solving skills and offered insight into the future of AI. The main downside was that AI was not present for all the material in the class and it sometimes felt like discussions about AI were a very small part of class with the rest being focused on econ topics and problem solving. I wish the two could have been integrated further.",
                "Strengths: the material is super interesting and the class itself is very chill (meets once a week with straightforward psets for which Professor Chalioti provides office hours). If you were one of the unlucky students who took ECON 121 without Chalioti, she is an absolutely amazing professor and teacher. Many other economics faculty lack the ability to effectively communicate ideas and concepts with students in the classroom -- this has never been the case with Professor Chalioti. It is so clear how much time and effort she puts into making her course material accessible and useful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I can't really think of many, although maybe a smaller class size. In the beginning of the course, there was never really time for discussion and the course felt similar to a lecture. That changed as the semester progressed, but it would have been even better with a more intimate class setting in which people could ask student presenters questions and there could be more connection to outside readings, videos, podcasts, and other instructional materials.",
                "Strengths: Professor Chalioti and the course content. I was super engaged throughout the semester, and Professor Chalioti explained everything very thoroughly.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Chalioti did not grade the final presentation or memo before the semester ended. So every single student basically went into the final with a 100% from psets and participation. I wish she had graded these other huge assignments earlier! Its very stressful to not know these grades (theyre still not even in Canvas).",
                "A major strength was Prof. Chalioti, and the material that the course was focused around. Professor Chalioti had many interesting insights on innovation through personal experience and from interesting colleagues, and also presented our material in a very digestible manner. I found lectures very interesting, and never too fast-paced. The qualitative material covered about how firms innovate and protect their innovations was also really cool to learn about since they have many applications to the real world. A bit of a downside were that some of the math concepts didn't seem to wholly line up with what the rest of our weekly lecture covered - it almost seemed like two back-to-back lectures about entirely different concepts in some weeks. Quickly switching gears between these topics was a little difficult at times, but it by far was not a deal breaker.",
                "The course is relatively evenly split between economics concepts and the mathematical foundations of those concepts. Professor Chalioti knows both sides of the coin well.",
                "This course was very informative.",
                "The strengths of this course are both the content and the Professor. From day 1, where we discussed current trends in artificial intelligence and the digitization of many economic systems, the course felt extremely relevant to today and to the future of a functioning economy. Professor Chalioti did a wonderful job mixing economic theory and math with the real-life applications of our exercises, which made for a very interesting class both mathematically and conceptually. Professor Chalioti is also a wonderful professor who is a strength in any course she teaches."

                "definitely a great econ elective to take! It's not very hard but deals with an interesting subject matter. If you felt comfortable with the models in 121, this class will not be hard. I think the material is interesting and it's a great senior year econ seminar",
                "Yes. This is a great course to fulfill the econ senior seminar requirement. It is a good balance of qualitative and quantitative work.",
                "Entirely! If you need an Econ Senior Seminar, without question you should take it. Even if you don't need these seminars to graduate (or have already fulfilled that requirement), I would still definitely shop the class. It is not a heavy workload course, but the material is incredibly interesting and insightful. It feels like a major departure from lower-level core economics classes where the ideas seem so basic and not relevant to the modern economy. In every class, Professor Chalioti provided examples of the concepts being taught from current corporate practices.\r\n\r\nThe most challenging aspect of this course was that there was only a final exam (the midterm was a project). The final was also in the last week of classes (which helps to spread out finals work), but if unprepared this can catch you off-guard, especially given that you probably haven't seriously reviewed any of the materials before.",
                "I would only recommend this course to students that have a particular interest in artificial intelligence.",
                "I would recommend the course to any student looking to learn more about the economic ideas that may come into play when analyzing various industries and firms, as well as these firms' interactions with each other.",
                "Yes Professor is amazing",
                "I would recommend this to another student interested in learning about AI.",
                "100%. This is the best senior economics seminar I have come across and Professor Chalioti is phenomenal. This course connected current trends in AI and innovation with classic economic theories, uniting relevant examples and changing technologies with content from earlier economics classes (but requiring almost no recall from those classes, since she covers them again). Each student presents on a topic related to AI and the economy of their choosing throughout the second half of the class, so you get to learn about many different real-world trends and listen to classmates speak for half of the class each week. The industry analysis was a perfect capstone to the Yale economics major, where you apply your knowledge to an industry of your choosing and write a short briefing on how AI is poised to change it. Overall fantastic course and would highly recommend."
