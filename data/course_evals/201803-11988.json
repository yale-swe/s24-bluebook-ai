    "This class helped me develop my spanish. Profesora Len was a great teacher in teaching the material and explained the material well.",
    "I learned a lot more about Spanish grammar. The class went very into depth about for sophisticated grammatical structures such as the subjunctives and conditionals. As a result, of this, I feel like I have a better grasp of certain structures than I had before (especially the subjunctive) and when to use them."

   "comments": [
    "The work that we do for each assignment allows us to fully understand the material that we are learning. However, I think the grading at times was a little harsh.",
    "The strengths of this course was its focus on teaching more sophisticated grammatical structures in combination with vocabulary and exposure to various aspects to the Spanish culture (through the short films, stories, book, and movie).\r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course was the lack of answers to practices in the textbook, making it harder to study through practice in writing correctly.",
    "Incredibly inconsistent grading across sections",
    "This course has so much potential, in my opinion almost entirely wasted. The largest problem, aside from it being one of the most expensive courses at Yale, is the obvious differences in rigor from section to section. I had peers taking the same exact course, with an almost nonexistent workload and As nearly handed to them. Meanwhile, I struggled to complete every single assignment on the syllabus (plus more, if the professor felt like adding), and was graded harshly on all of them, as well as on my in-class assignments. Yale needs to have better communication between professors so that it's not so unbalanced in the future before this can be considered a successful course."
