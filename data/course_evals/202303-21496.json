This class would enthrall those seeking the interdisciplinary. I found the texts profoundly moving and even incorporated some of the texts on 'vulnerable collaboration' into a paper for my Anthropology seminar. I really enjoyed the classroom dynamic and culture that emerged as we continued to engage with each others' work as well as with the exciting theory. Not only was this class exhilarating in its rigor, it was also extremely FUN (heck, the final project was to host a party!); a learning environment in which the child-mind aided deep understanding of complicated material was fostered and inspiring."
