                "I think the course was designed very carefully with pre-lecture quizzes and videos. However, at points I felt like I didn't understand the material enough to do the pre-lecture quizzes, yet the content we covered in class always helped me clear up the points I didn't initially understand.",
                "I found that this course did an excellent job of focusing on our conceptual understanding and unifying themes and principles throughout the semester. We did a lot of geometric reasoning and 3D visualizations to aid our understanding, and the material was explained at a pace which really worked well for me. With regards to exams, there were plenty of review materials made available and overall review sessions which were excellent at covering the month's worth of content. \r\nSomething I found a bit frustrating were the comprehension quizzes before class. Occasionally, I wouldn't quite understand a concept the first time around, and I felt penalized for it by the reading quiz. Granted, they were worth a small portion of our grade, but it was still something that frustrated me.",
                "The course was interesting and very informative.",
                "The lectures weren't very engaging and the problem sets were super hard. Also the course moves way too fast so you don't really learn as much.",
                "The pre-class videos were definitely helpful in getting a fundamental knowledge about the topics at hand, but I often found that then lecture sections were repetitive of the same fundamentals in the videos. I would've liked to see some more complex applications within lecture. I think the smaller sections help for this difficult course material to be more approachable. Problem sets are definitely useful in preparing students for assessments, but I think the gap in difficulty between the examples in lecture and the problems in problem sets was a little much.",
                "The recorded lectures that went with the readings were very helpful in summarizing the reading and working through examples. We also had a great instructor who was very passionate and engaging in live sessions. However, sometimes it seems that the recorded lectures and live sessions were redundant as we would cover the same idea again in class.",
                "A strength is that there is a good balance between providing you with enough information to be able to the psets and making you actually think and struggle with the problems at the same time. A weakness might be that class was sometime a regurgitation of the textbook.",
                "I believe that the course was very clear about what material students needed to learn and what concepts would be tested on. The problem sets prepared me well for exams. However, I believe that the course could be improved by doing more practice problems during class and less lecturing. This is because the pre-class pre-recorded lectures are already very comprehensive and sufficient to learn the material, but a lot of those concepts got repeated too much during class.",
                "This class was amazing! I really liked the pre-class videos and how lectures could be used to cover theoretical material instead of going over the basic concepts.",

                "review of pset like questions as examples in lecture",
                "This course was not taught well. I had a lot of difficulty understanding the material and there was little help or assistance beyond my fellow classmates who struggled with me. It feels like you are constantly grasping for a bare-minimum understanding that is still not enough to make you come out of the course feeling satisfied with what you have learned about multivariable calculus. Most of the students I know who did not struggle as much as I did have already taken a multivariable course in high school. If you have never learned multivariable calculus before, Math 120 will be extremely tough and challenging. It will be difficult to find and seek help, especially with online learning.",

You could learn the course material through the lectures, reading the textbook, or the pre-class recordings, and they all supplemented each other to reinforce the concepts.

You are expected to understand material from the first time that it is taught. Although resources like the textbook are available, it still would have been extremely helpful to have recorded lectures. There also are no discussion sections that I think would have been beneficial to go through example problems together, considering that any practice problems done during lectures were not recorded. Overall, the course was frustrating to go through and extremely challenging. There was not much about this course that I would say \"succeeded,\" other than perhaps the stimulating questions on problem sets that made you realize that you did not understand the material.",
                "Math 120 is an excellent remote course. Lectures were wonderful, and most strikingly, remote midterms ran like clockwork. Every potential problem was accounted for, and the proctoring rooms were perfectly organized and executed. I did not encounter any problems during this course (unlike some other courses with remote exams).",

The concepts really flow together into an unified understanding, and I think it's provides a valuable mathematical foundation that is broadly applicable. While it might seem daunting, the class is set up to help you succeed with many an office hour and review session. I can speak for every person or professor, but I thought my professor (Professor Adelstein) was very good at explaining the material and more than willing to help students out. The PSETs were tough, but working collaboratively on them makes it much more doable.",

The instructions and expectations were very clear and the professors are all very open to answering student questions and concerns; they encourage more questions. Furthermore, the professors are very fun to get to know outside of class (which we accomplished this year through small group zoom meetings). However, the class curriculum is no doubt challenging at times, and I would not recommend the class if the student is not willing to lay down a couple of hours of time throughout the week to truly work through and understand the concepts in the problem sets.",
