                "Biggest strength of the course is the professor, who made class fun and engaging! One thing to be improved could be the use of breakout rooms, but that is an unavoidable situation due to remote learning, and won't be a problem when we return to in-person classes.",
                "I studied from the West coast this semester, but I never dreaded attending class at 8am. Professor Lim was so engaging and created a welcoming class environment. My peers were also easy-going and kind, making any breakout room a fun time. We had a variety of assignments that helped me improve my confidence in speaking, writing, reading, and listening.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lim is an excellent teacher! We learned a lot of useful grammar and vocab that would be super necessary to actually communicate in Korean. The tests are not too difficult and I liked that we had dedicated class days for reviewing what will be on each test. There was also a good amount of homework, just enough to teach us the material but never busywork. I was able to enjoy this class without ever being terribly stressed out by it, which is great for a language class. I also think the type of people who take Korean are a generally fun crowd; I really liked meeting a lot of my classmates. I'm sure this class is even more fun in person!\r\n\r\nPotential Weakness: You get assigned a Korean tutor who meets with you each week. Some tutors are better than others. (But I ended up liking the tutor I got this semester!) I think this could be improved by standardizing what each tutor goes over. It can feel like a lot to meet 6 times per week for Korean, but it is nice that the Korean department offers this resource to us for free.",
                "Strengths: Incredibly well organized! Very fun and engaging, you definitely get to bond with the class\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there were more practice in generating our own dialogue in the breakout rooms instead of practicing with scripts, but that is just my learning preferance!",
                "The course is really balanced between grammar, vocab, listening, reading, writing, and speaking.  It is a very solid language course without any significant weaknesses.",
                "The virtual format was not ideal, but it still worked well. The professor is very engaging and led the virtual discussion well."

                "This class worked really well in an online format. Breakout rooms were so helpful to practice new grammar, and ask questions to the teacher freely. I feel that the class would be even more fun if in-person, so I am jealous if you get to take it that way!",
                "I think this course went very well virtually. We met live every day on Zoom. Professor Lim would usually share a PowerPoint and go over the material with us and then we would have Zoom breakout rooms where we would practice speaking the new Korean grammar in small groups. It was easy to ask questions and get feedback over Zoom. We submitted all of our work electronically through Canvas and Professor Lim would annotate our submissions to make corrections. I can't think of much that could have been improved!",

To be honest, I wanted to take the class to understand Korean dramas better, and I feel that I have a great foundation for that. I would especially recommend taking the class with Professor Lim, if you have the opportunity.",
                "Yes, definitely! If you did L1 it is definitely worth continuing so that you expand your knowledge of the basics of Korean. Professor Lim is an amazing teacher! The class is fun and not too much work. It is very similar to KREN 110 with Professor Lim, just with new material. The tests are very fair, and as long as you look at the review questions and review vocab, you will do very well on the tests. I recommend this course because it teaches you a lot more Korean in an environment that makes language-learning fun rather than stressful.",
                "Definitely!",
                "Yes!! The whole Korean department at Yale is AMAZING and I'd recommend a class with any of them! They are incredibly well organized and passionate about what they teach and to help us as students learn Korean!",
