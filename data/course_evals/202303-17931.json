Assignment expectations, goals, and due dates were beyond clear, things were assigned in pieces so as to pace the students' writing progress, and the content was highly engaging as we were conducting our own studies in areas that interested us. The work load was also extremely manageable even though a lot was happening, as the flipped classroom model enabled us a great space to make progress on our projects while getting our questions answered.",

This was a very helpful way to get feedback and go through the process of research with support.

                "All psychology students have to take this course, but I would especially recommend that they take it with professor Kinney if he teaches it again. I do recommend this class to students outside the major if they are interested in running experiments and collecting data. Although not an easy class per se, the class is a good way to fulfill your writing requirement without an absurd amount of writing."
