                "This is an absolutely phenomenal courseif you're lucky enough to get into it. Dr. Young is an amazing instructor and you will learn so much from taking her course. While fascism is an incredibly important topic to tackle, especially when discussing contemporary politics, the real highlight of this course is Dr. Young's teaching and her engagement with her students. The class is not too difficult as long as you put in the time to do the necessary readings and if you have an interest in the topic. I would also recommend you take the continuation of this course if you're able to, \"The Geopolitics of Democracy,\" which Dr. Young also teaches. I truly hope to be able to take more classes taught by her in the future.",
                "I leaned about the historical origins of fascism as well as its defining features.",
                "I learned how to draw subtle connections between the different problems inflicted upon modern society that tell a much larger story about power structures that have always dominated the world. I also learned just how fragile democracy is and how we need to continue having conversations like the ones that Dr. Young facilitates in her classroom in order to bolster it.",
                "I learnt how to effectively discuss ans write about the development of fascism throughout the years and its implications for our contemporary politics.",
                "In this course, we learned about the historic roots of fascist movements around the world. Examining the intricacies of past fascist movements helped to provide important context for the growth of far-right organizations in today's political climate.",
                "I gained a much improved view of fascism in ideology and practice. I learned about its history and influences."

                "Strengths: super-clear feedback on writing assignments, Dr. Young can be flexible in terms of workload and deadlines, as she is focused and encourages your own learning and independent research process when assigning papers, great in-class discussions that made me want to engage in conversation, classes were very organized and it never felt as if we went through the material too fast or too slow\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it wish we had been able to cover the rise of fascism in Asia, at least for a week, even if the class is mainly Euro- and US-centric",
                "Strengths: clear expectations, manageable workload, engaging discussions\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: Dr. Young is an expert in her field, but she is also so obviously interested in the insights that her students bring to the table and she allows her students to take the conversation wherever their interests naturally lie. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish we would discuss more in depth the readings, instead of cursory history overviews. After all, this is a seminar not a history lecture.",
                "Its based on a lot of discussions. It is writing heavy.",
                "Strengths:\r\nDetailed feedback, accessible professor, super interesting topics to discuss, classmates from a wide variety of backgrounds \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nClass meets only once per week. I would have loved to have more weekly meetings.",
                "I liked the connections to the modern world and discussions about fascism and current events, it made the course feel very relevant."

                "Any student who enjoys digging into both the concrete and abstract ways in which social/political/cultural governance works should take this class. The lessons we draw from the past are uber applicable to the present day, and I think it makes you a better citizen to roll up your sleeves and dig into this content.",
                "YES! Dr. Young is an amazing and insightful professor who pushes you further.",
                "YES! Dr. Young is God's gift to the Yale political science department. Dr. Young always took the time to throughly engage with all of our written work, and I have never received such detailed feedback in a Yale course before. Dr. Young was also very accessible, making herself available for a generous amount of time before class for office hours.",
