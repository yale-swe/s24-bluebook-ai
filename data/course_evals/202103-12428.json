                "I gained extensive knowledge of the US Healthcare system and greatly enjoyed the process.",

                "I learned a lot about healthcare. It is very relevant to life, and I learned a lot.",
                "Health econ policy on topics like health insurance, physician training/reimbursement, Medicare, Medicaid. Not much econ, but a lot of qualitative information to learn that is quite interesting.",
                "From this course, I received a very comprehensive lesson on the US healthcare system. I feel like I learned a ton about different healthcare plans and how providers make money off of them  an area I knew very little about prior to this class. It was especially valuable to take this class during the pandemic, as Professor Forman spoke about many important aspects of Covid within our healthcare system.",
                "I learned SO much in this course. I learned how health insurance in the US works and how Medicaid/Medicare works. I also learned a lot about the history of insurance in the US. This class helped to demystify a lot of insurance concepts.",

Economic applications were less of the focus than simply information about how these things work.",
                "Great course on how the healthcare system in the United States works from insurance to physician work.",

                "Learned a lot about the healthcare system",
                "Learned about overview of US healthcare. Howie mentions this at the beginning of the semester, but this is more of a health policy class rather than a health economics class. You'll touch on some very, very basic economics (think intro micro or less) but that's about it. You won't be looking at economic models, health econ research, etc. so make sure that's not what you're looking for (Howie is transparent about this).\r\nIf you're looking for a good introduction to US healthcare, this is the place for you. You'll learn about hospitals, physicians/nursing shortages, the pharma industry, medicare, medicaid, and some basic economic ideas for why healthcare is broken in the US.",
                "I gained a broad base of knowledge about how healthcare is provided and financed in the United States, as well as about the structure of health insurance, and the physician and nursing labor markets. \r\nFrom a medical perspective, I gained many insights into the nuances of medical education and healthcare provision. For example, I learned about the tests that medical students take, the graduate medical education process, and the licensure and privileging processes that ultimately allow physicians to practice medicine. On the provision side, I learned about the differences between procedural and cognitive fields and incentives that exist for physicians to provide lower-value care, among other things. I also learned about the pharmaceutical development process.  \r\nFrom an economics perspective, this course reinforced many of the concepts that I had learned in previous economics classes. For example, I learned about about moral hazard, adverse selection, the effects of GDP growth, and the important role that profits play in incentivizing investment, all in the context of healthcare. In the introductory economics courses that I took, I remember that these topics were treated almost as theoretical. Thus, it was interesting to see real applications of these topics. \r\nPerhaps my favorite economics topic was \"Okun's leaky bucket\" theory, and the discussion that followed about separating issues of economic efficiency from issues of equity. I appreciated this discussion because this mode of thinking is a tool that I can certainly apply to future courses and work. \r\nFrom a political perspective, we also learned about the ways in which health policy (and particularly policy regarding health care spending) tends to develop over time.",
                "I learned a ton about increasing equity, while minimizing decreases to efficiency in Healthcare.",
                "I learned an overview of the economic/finances of US healthcare, ranging from insurance concepts to physician reimbursement and federal programs (Medicare, Medicaid, etc.)",

                "The strength of the course lies in the delivery of the material by the profesor. I believe the question answering at the beginning of class is an excellent method and it makes the class more interactive, which I enjoyed.",
                "Strengths: Well structured, clear lectures, lots of real-world application, amazing prof. Really fun Guest Speakers\r\nWeaknesses: Exams had some annoying questions that were really specific and not exactly testing knowledge of the healthcare system. Pacing was messed up a bit.",
                "Professor Howie is the biggest strength of this course. Hands down one of the best professors I have had in my time at Yale. He is so enthusiastic about the material and has incredible knowledge having been someone who has seen healthcare in the US from many different viewpoints. If you have an opportunity to take this course, you MUST!",
                "Strengths: Professor Forman's personal experiences, current data provided, and speakers invited\r\nWeakness: Unclear exactly what was needed to know for exams and no practice questions provided",
                "Strengths: almost everything: the organization, the format, the guest lectures, the content, the lecturing was interesting \r\nWeakness: I think students should have 1 discretionary discussion post skip",
                "Strengths: Professor Forman and the TAs were incredible. They were very supportive of student learning, always staying after class or hopping on Zoom to answer questions. The Q and A format at the begining of each class was also really helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Exams felt a bit unpredictable at times given the \"whatever I say is testable\" philosophy. But otherwise they were very fair.",
                "Strengths: Howie is really accessible and cares a lot about the course and students learning, exams were well written and fair, final paper was a good opportunity to learn more about a topic I was interested in class, workload is super manageable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I was disappointed that we didnt get to everything on the syllabus, discussion questions help your grade but, unless you actually had a specific question or needed clarification, added little to the class and were easy to forget about since they were due after class and didnt open beforehand",
                "Weakness is that it assumes you know\r\nAnd are familiar with a lot of terminology.",
                "In general, a very valuable and lenient course that provides interesting insights into the workings of the healthcare system + related legislation. Exams were rote memorization--often, some of the questions (typically TF or MC) were obscure facts that we had not spent time on. Long answers were all fair.",
                "No weakness. Professor Forman is the strength for sure.",
                "Although this was a lecture course, I was blown away by how interactive the class was and how much the teaching staff encouraged us to ask questions. The warm-call list was a good little push, but was never used because everyone had something to say. I also enjoyed the guest lecturers; Professor Forman has all the right connections to get the coolest people to come and give their life stories. The exams were very fair and don't test for minute details, but rather for big-picture concepts to see if you really understand how the system works.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that was slightly annoying was that the discussion posts were due within 24 hours of the previous class, which was strange timing and was easy to accidentally forget aboutI think it would be better if they were due right before the next class. I also wish we did get to more content, but it was already a lot of content that we got through.",
                "Strengths: The topics covered are super interesting, and Prof Forman is definitely knowledgeable, passionate, and really does care about the class. I really really enjoyed all of the guest lectures. Having no problem sets really makes the class less stressful than the standard econ class. Also shoutout to Arya because she seems to do a lot of work in holding the course together lol. \r\nWeaknesses: I feel like especially at the beginning of the semester but also overall, Professor Forman is kinda hard to follow because of the way he lectures - he uses a good amount of jargon without explaining it and the slides don't help.",
                "Professor Forman is a very smart person with a ton of experience in the field of healthcare and healthcare economics. This made it extremely rewarding to take a class with him, as he always has so much information to share with us. However, I was often confused as to why he would take so many tangents from the class material, as this would cause him to later rush through some of the planned content. I appreciate that we were only tested on things Professor Forman said during class, but I would've liked to be told that from the get-go, since we were only told that a couple weeks before the first exam. I really enjoyed the guest lecturers, but wished that we weren't tested on it. I noticed that everyone, including myself, were scrambling to write down everything the lecturers were saying and didn't have the opportunity to really just enjoy the lecture.",
                "I really have no idea how this class could be improved. I guess the one thing I would ask is for the lecture recordings to be posted online. I came to every class but the lectures are so information-dense that zoning out for a few seconds means you miss a ton of information. I understand the rationale against posting it though.",
                "The material is very relevant and essential for anyone that wants to pursue a career in healthcare  highly recommend this course. In terms of improvement, I feel like we spent too much time on students' questions during the lecture, which interrupted the flow of the material.",
                "The course was really interesting and I liked how we had to submit discussion posts following each lecture. This forced me to stay engaged/ review my notes following class and provided me with an opportunity to ask questions -- besides office hours which were not always at the most accessible time (ie Sat morning during my practice).\r\n\r\nOne thing that frustrated me about this class was the lack of understanding that this semester was overwhelming at times. It felt like the teaching team was somewhat disconnected from the challenges of being a student back in person during COVID. For example, if you accidentally forgot to turn in one discussion post, your participation grade would drop nearly 5%. A little flexibility is appreciated because even when people write things down, sometimes it slips their minds. By offering to drop 1 out of the 20ish discussion posts it wouldn't penalize students so severely and would create a little buffer for an innocent accident when life just flusters you.",
                "Good overview of healthcare.",
                "I thought the courses material was extremely interesting",
                "Strengths: Howie is perhaps the only person that could make this content even remotely engaging or accessible to students with no priori knowledge. He is funny and anecdotal throughout the course. Weaknesses: the course is really unstructured and its really hard to know what to study for the exam",
                "The strengths were that I think the topic itself is quite interesting and I learned a lot from having to make sure to retain everything due to the exams. However, I do not feel like it was very engaging because there was little room for synthesis of concepts or in-depth analytical thinking, more just being presented with a ton of information. I think it could be improved by being less nitty-gritty with how detailed the information was, and focusing on broader concepts/themes with deeper economic analysis.",
                "Professor Foreman is great in keeping the class engaged and interested in the material! We did not get to go through everything in the syllabus but the class engagement that resulted from it was also helpful in maintaining a deeper understanding.",
                "weaknesses: learning based on what was said instead of what was on the slides. Grading is a bit subjective especially for essays and there was minimal guidance on how to do well on this despite it being a substantial proportion of our grades.",
                "Lack of clear structure and exam expectations but not too hard",
                "I liked the in class involvement with the lectures",
                "Overall the course was really great! I learned a ton about the healthcare system and it was really cool to see how I could apply my learning outside of the classroom. I liked the idea of a paper a lot because it gave me the opportunity to explore a topic I was interested in but the grading was a bit confusing because it seemed like the grader was looking for us to elaborate on really specific subjects I didnt even think of.",
                "Pros: Howie is very knowledgable, and this is a good survey course. I think everyone should take this, even if just to learn about what medicare/medicaid actually are. Howie is very clear and understands this material well, so ask questions when you have them. Guest speakers are also interesting; some more than others. We had people come from Yale New Haven Hospital, Merck for Mothers, Fair Haven Community Health, and a biotech/rare drugs pharma company based in New Haven. Overall, interesting to hear from practitioners. \r\nAnother pro: The structure of the course is good; there's 3 exams, which keep you accountable and make sure you're not falling behind in the class. The final paper also has progress points throughout the semester (e.g. deadlines to submit abstract, lit review, etc.). Overall, good opportunities for feedback. \r\nAnother pro: Howie takes a lot of time to answer students' questions. I think this should definitely continue. Sometimes I think we end up falling behind on the lecture slides, but I think it's well worth it because it's good to make sure people understand the material the first time around.\r\nAreas to improve: Not a weakness, but one way it could be improved might be to bring in some health economist as a guest speaker if possible. It might be good to do a deeper dive into the economics of the issues, given that I assume a lot of people are econ majors or Econ-oriented. Lastly, this is super minor but if possible, please number the slide decks (their file names) on Canvas, so people can find the order that we're going on and course staff can reference which slide decks are relevant to which exams (this is just a logistical point).\r\nIf I could recommend one additional topic to cover, it'd be the ACA. We talked about the ACA at some points during multiple lectures, but we never really went in depth into its components (other than discussing the individual mandate, etc.). If the course could do an overview of ACA, I think it'd be really valuable.",
                "Strengths: 15-minute Q+A at the beginning. It helped Howie go over things that were either confusing or on everyone's mind. Howie is also just a super funny human being! \r\nWeaknesses: Healthcare is full of definitions and acronyms. I think there should be a class glossary/dictionary for concepts like PPO, HDHP, HSA, copay, etc., It was hard to keep up with all of the words being thrown out during lectures at times.",
                "Professor Forman's lecturing style was a strength of this course. In several instances, when I expected the course material to be bland, Dr. Forman's enthusiasm made the topic very engaging. I also really appreciated his use of anecdotes, to remind students of how relevant the topics in his lectures were. Finally, I appreciated that he would pose questions to the class. This made it feel as though the students were not being lectured at, but rather that they were a part of the discussion. \r\n\r\nAnother strength of this course was the support that existed outside of the classroom. The TFs and Professor Forman both held office hours, and Naomi held paper review meetings. Because many of the topics in this class were new to me, it was nice to have the added support. \r\n\r\nAt times, the course felt quite rushed. As a result, I feel like there were some important concepts that I did not fully understand or that I would have liked to have known more about. However, I understand that this rushing was a consequence of a full/rich syllabus, and of the prioritization of student engagement.",
                "Strengths: very engaging lectures, workload not super high, tests are fair, guest lectures were really great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: final paper instructions were a little unclear, but I was able to speak with a TA and get it clarified so not a big deal",
                "Course not organized well to facilitate learning, and discussion posts more of a chore than a productive way to facilitate recounting the lecture materials",
                "Really liked the question answering/discussion at the first 15 minutes of class"

Everyday I left lecture with a thorough  understanding of a new concept relevant to the US Healthcare system. I found the lecturers extremely informative and Professor Forman is a very engaging professor. I appreciated how he encouraged students to ask questions and would spend as much time as needed answering the question and any follow up questions that came with it. In addition, the assessments were very fair and even if we dove into the nitty gritty details of a particular topic in class they werent typically tested on the exam. Nevertheless, understanding the intricacies and listening to Professor Formans examples/anecdotes of the ramifications were some of my favorite parts of this class. The material is very interesting and Professor Forman is incredible. Definitely take this class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! If you are premed, this course will help you gain a better sense of how the healthcare system works and what you will be getting yourself into and have you thinking about how you can attack health inequities in the U.S. Knowledge you gain from this class will probably be helpful in your med school interviews.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend if you're interested in the intersection of medicine and economics! Although there's not much econ in this class at all, it's mostly just policies surrounding medicine and health, which I think is really interesting. It's also pretty low workload, but you learn a whole lot of useful information like how insurance works, which is helpful to literally everyone.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone, regardless of their career plans. This class is full of information that is extremely useful for the real world. Howie is also a fantastic, funny, and engaging professor.",
                "Yes -- I learned things that will actually help me when I have to make decisions about my healthcare after I graduate college and get a job.",
                "Yes it provides a good overview of healthcare within the US.",
                "I would! This was my favorite course at Uale extremely interesting and applicable",
                "Yes!",
                "I honestly would not, from my personal perspective. If you are very interested in healthcare and want to really expand the level of detail of your understanding of the history and how it works, then this might be a good way to gain that knowledge. However, I am an economics major more interested in economic concepts and thought an application to healthcare would be engaging, but I found myself having no choice but to memorize a bunch of details (a LOT of information) about US healthcare that have little to do with economics. To be fair, we were warned on the first day that this isn't really an economics class the way most econ classes are. But I think not only is it not very in-depth with econ, it's just not very in-depth in a critical thinking sort of way in general. It was very hard for me to engage with lectures because it was just simply information that I knew I would eventually need to memorize for the exams. It's very little work, which was certainly nice, but then when it came to the exams it was a very stressful few days before to commit to memory everything we'd gone over in the last month(s).",
                "YES YES YES! This class is amazing and Professor is such a gem of a professor",
                "Yes! Very interesting material for anyone interested in the field and even for those that are not.",
                "YES YES YES. So helpful for anyone considering a health care career",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! Its interesting and super useful",
                "Yes, if you're looking for a intro to US healthcare + intro health policy class. Honestly, I think everyone should take it, econ major or not. If you want to really understand what Medicare/Medicaid are, take this. If you want to be more literate about why healthcare in the US is so expensive, take this. It is a great intro to go and learn more about healthcare and all its problems. This class gives you the vocabulary and language to be able to have those discussions. If you think you're going to work at a think tank or on the Hill or in consulting/finance covering healthcare, you should take this too. Healthcare in the US is just a beast to understand, and this makes it more digestible. PS, Howie is a great prof and has a lot of interesting things to share. \r\n\r\nPS You might not agree with all of Howie's positions on healthcare, but he is very welcoming of discussion. Have those conversations where you ask questions and share your thoughts! Howie is a great person to bounce ideas off of. \r\n\r\nNote, Howie says this at the beginning of the semester, but just to reiterate, if you're looking for an advanced health economics class, no, this isn't going to be the right fit. The course touches on econ but very generally. Howie does make this very clear and is upfront about this at the beginning of the semester though, so he's not hiding it! Just keep it in mind if you're putting this on your list of classes to shop.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I would certainly recommend it to any student who is either pre-med or majoring in Econ, as this course is very relevant to either of those career paths. \r\n\r\nHowever, I'm neither a pre-med student nor an Econ major, and I still feel like I gained a lot from this course. From a personal level, I feel that I'm much more knowledgeable about the healthcare industry than I was before taking this course. I feel more confident about navigating health insurance options, as well as about understanding debates about public policy.",
                "Yes. Its an amazing course, and you will learn relevant and current information.",
                "Yes! I would recommend this class to all students. Healthcare affects everyone's lives, and this class truly has made me a much more informed consumer of healthcare, whether it be choosing an insurance plan or how I think about physician incentives. Also, as someone who aspires to be a healthcare professional, I think this class should be taken by everyone wanting to go to medical school, nursing school, etc. as it provides a very real world view into how healthcare works in the US.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. There are a few stronger courses to take to gain a similar understanding of the space",
                "No",
                "Yes, it was easy to stay engaged during Howie's lectures and I learned a ton. Also really enjoyed all the guest lectures!"
