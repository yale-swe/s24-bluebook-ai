                "Great professor. The course is disorganized however.",
                "Pascutti is a funny and engaging professor for content that would otherwise be a little bit dense and potentially uninteresting. He routinely asks for feedback on topics/areas students want to see in class and is very receptive to feedback in that way. Keep in mind that the class isn't incredibly organized in the sense that lectures often diverge from prepared content, which some people may like and others may not. The quizzes, which make up a majority of your grade, can be pretty challenging, but they're not impossible. It's a bit difficult to know where you stand in the class gradewise. Pascutti doesn't care about grades, but that can make it hard to do well/get an A if that's your goal. If that's not your goal and you just want to learn, this is a good class for you, but make sure you're interested in the content, because it's very much a finance-driven class for people who want to go into/are already going into finance.",
                "Professor Pascutti tells great stories and is extremely knowledgeable. That said, the course is a bit disorganized.",
                "Strengths - Professor kept it really. Weakness - you really had to already know most content.",
                "Weakness was that online notes were unorganized so going to class was totally necessary\r\n\r\nStrength was that professor was super approachable and totally cared about the subject and student learning. Feedback was frequent and helpful and the course was adjusted to current events and student interests",
                "I loved the free nature of the course.  I felt like the syllabus was very flexible, allowing us to focus on timely subjects.  I think that the course could do a better job of matching what we learned in lecture with the notes posted on canvas.  It sometimes felt like we were studying two different sets of notes.",
                "This course is difficult and assumes prior knowledge in finance or corporate finance. I had none of that, but I learned ALOT with spending a lot of time reviewing the lecture recordings/notes and google. I appreciated that the professor was always open to all kinds of questions and the TA, Tianhao, was always so helpful in section. \r\n\r\nStrengths: the quizzes reflected class discussion and power point notes, and overtime reflected problem sets. I liked that the professor took feedback from students and adapted classes to review difficult concepts as well as make the quizzes more representative of what we were expected to know from the psets. The quizzes were hard tho, but I think the TA was fair in grading. The psets are pass/fail which also made them less stressful. The professor is also very funny and personable, which made class enjoyable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the professor is a bit disorganized in lecture, ie. switches from class notes to powerpoint notes, to math on the board which was a bit hard to follow and use to study for the quizzes/homeworks. It would have been nice when he told us where he was switching to so we can note it down, or maybe stick to one method",
                "Strengths was that we were tested and had problem sets throughout so you knew where you stood with the material. \r\nWeaknesses were that the material didnt follow an exact path and sometimes was hard to follow because one class may not lead into the next.",
                "I thought the class was well taught. It could be improved by adding class notes of the real world current event tangents that are discussed in class to make preparing for the exam easier.",
                "I think all of the topics are taught well, but you really have to dive deep into the problem sets to fully understand the nuances of everything. There are definitely not enough examples in lecture to cover everything. I think a little bit more of a defined structure to the course would also be a benefit; the topics all sort of blended together with no real order or progression.",
                "Lectures and material on tests were often misaligned.",
                "Strengths: great lectures, straightforward exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lots of midterms (4)",

                "Yes if they want to work in finance",
                "Totally would recommend if interested in non-banking finance. Teacher is so cool and passionate and funny. Lectures were extremely fun and interactive. Easily one of my favorite courses I'd ever taken. Hearing unfiltered opinions from a pro hedge fund founder was really helpful. Gave opinions on working in finance and spoke about dark side of the profession",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in a career in finance.",
                "Yes! Definitely take this course if you have an interest in finance or plan on working in finance post grad. Its a practical course that you can apply to the real world (not many Econ senior seminars are). It might be easier if you have finance background or took corporate finance before because a lot of the information is assumed you've seen it before with the equations and concepts etc. Though if you do not have any of that experience and still want to take this class (like me), be prepared to work hard because you're going to have to do a lot of self learning and googling your way through this course because a lot of jargon is used and it gets pretty overwhelming at times. This course is also heavily white male dominated so... pls take it if you're a woman/POC and ask questions!! The prof and TA are really helpful and personable and encourage dumb questions (I asked a ton bc I was always confused). Review the psets and the handouts to prepare for the quizzes and you should be fine.",
                "Yes if youre looking to learn more about certain financial concepts related to arbitrage",
                "I would recommend this class to students who have a strong interest in finance.",
                "I think if you are interested in finance this course is taught pretty well and covers a lot of good topics. Make sure that you take notes on everything though, not just the problems but also the real world examples and conceptual ideas, because those will also be tested in addition to calculations. Also do all the readings; not only are you graded on submitting a summary, but those are also fair game for quizes.",
                "Yes, definitely.",
                "This is a great course if you want to learn more practical finance skills. If you havent taken any other finance classes though be prepared to put in a lot of work"
