                "I learned how to analyze buildings from a big-picture perspective down to the details. This is really great and has changed how I experience and view cities. I learned how to speak cogently about the lineages behind different design styles and ideas, and got a great overlook of modern design. Weaknesses-the first two papers (particularly the literary analysis of a primary source doc by a designer) were a little confusing, as I wasn't sure what to focus on in them. However, the timeline project and prospectus was fantastic and a great way of synthesizing info and exploring an idea important to you. I loved how the \"prospectus\" helped us peer forward into the project and get detailed feedback before the final.",
                "This course benefits from not focusing on the materiality of architecture. However, I do wish there was a more diverse survey of architecture with respect to gender and race\/ethnicity (though it may be a hard task since it seems \"modern architecture\" was dominated by a certain demographic)",
                "This course was easy to follow and  well organized",
                "This class was interesting and provided a broad survey of modern architecture. It traced a variety of themes throughout times to present of cohesive analysis of the trends. I think that a weakness of the class is the variability in grading between TAs and the uneven size of sections, given that some sections had as few as 5 students while others were much larger."

The papers and project were actually enjoyable to complete. I have such a greater appreciation for architecture and look at buildings differently after. Totally changed my perspective.",

It was a lot of fun, the projects were very self-directed, and I learned about modern architecture in a way that's reshaped how I approach design today. Also, some of the images we went through were truly astonishing, and their visual images will stick around in my mind for a very long time -- i can tell!",
