            "comments": [
                "Great class in that it covered a lot of interesting areas that were not mentioned in traditional classes, but the timeframe for the projects made it hard to get a lot of progress\/results",
                "Strengths: Passionate, accessible, and knowledgable professors and TFs, very interesting material covered in lectures, hands-on projects, wonderful mentors\r\nWeaknesses: Crunched time to work on final projects due to the other (slightly frustrating) class assignment for modeling and FEA",
                "Strengths: guest lectures, semester long design project, weekly office hours\r\nI loved having the design project for the whole semester -- it really gave us a chance to start from the problem and go through the actual process of designing and reiterating the design and then finally prototyping. Pairing groups up with a mentor (the person who posed the problem) was incredibly helpful and I loved being able to get that weekly engagement with Dr. Caty (our mentor). It definitely was more difficult being in the virtual environment but I am glad we were able to work together well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The failure analysis project at the beginning of the semester was definitely incredibly interesting, especially learning how to create an actual 3D image out of a bone scan and then meshing a plate onto the model. However, I believe the whole process going from creating the model to actually performing failure analysis was a huge leap and I wish we had more time to work through it. I know many groups ran into problems doing the actual failure analysis, likely because our models had a lot of parts and we probably didn't do some of the little things that could have made the program run faster\/smoother. However, we didn't have enough time in the class to truly explore all the tools in ScanIP and Abaqus to make our models run successfully. Furthermore, the project took away from time dedicated to the actual design project as it was a bit frustrating not getting the model to work. Thus, with this being said, I do believe it would be helpful to either cut down the failure analysis project (ie. already having a model for everyone and then having us do the failure analysis in Abaqus OR doing the ScanIP model building + a simpler failure analysis in Abaqus with less moving parts and thus less possibility of model failure). Otherwise, spending a bit more time on the failure analysis would likely help as well!",
                "This course was amazing! The professors are wonderful and very open to helping students learn and develop their devices. My only wish is that the course could have been completely in person, which of course was not possible due to COVID.",
                "There were a lot of assignments for this class that felt really superfluous. At the start of the semester, we were told to complete half a dozen long trainings for spaces and machines, most of which we did not need. The two primary projects, the midterm failure analysis project and final device design project could have been better laid out. Few groups could start their final project until after they started their failure analysis project, and the failure analysis project was poorly organized, with unclear descriptions and expectations. You could only complete the failure analysis project if you left things to the last minute, as it was highly likely that one of the professors would change the requirements 24 hours before it was due, or suddenly remember a crucial step that they had previously forgot to tell the students to complete. Fortunately, Professor Tommasini and Dr. Wiznia were both extraordinarily kind, kind, and willing to help, which combined with the good TA's made this class way better. The final project would have been more engaging if we had more time to work on it, instead of splitting our time between the failure analysis project. This class was a good introduction to the process of medical device design, but in its current iteration don't have high expectations for actually designing a medical device.",
                "Strengths - a lot of very great speakers came to talk and it helps prepare students for the industry rather than just more schooling. It is one of the few classes for BME majors to get hands-on experience using the CEID and other programs like Solidworks.\r\nWeaknesses - the class is a little disorganized, there was no set point on how far people needed to get with their projects.",
                "Strengths: Really cool to have a team-based project where we actually create something tangible by the end of the semester; great professor and TA availability for help with software and projects; interesting and engaging lectures; really engaging and eye-opening field trips were the highlight of the class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course felt somewhat disorganized and disjointed with all of the guest lectures; at times, when we were given guidance with the Scan IP and failure analysis software, it felt more like we were given steps to follow and memorized rather than being taught the underlying principles to understand and apply to projects going forward-- at times, office hours felt like the time that the instructors used to figure out the appropriate steps to take when using the software themselves, so following along could be confusing; we also received no grades and little to no feedback on our work throughout the semester",
                "This course was incredible. Even with all the restrictions imposed by COVID, we still were given cool opportunities, both in person and virtually. The workload was not extremely high, but all of the teams still produced some pretty cool things by the end of the term.",
                "some of the lectures about brainstorming could have been given earlier in the course",
                "The strengths are the professors, guest speakers, and projects.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are the format of the course and the semester schedule. The failure analysis project was a disaster. It required a lot of debugging and working through very laggy software with license issues. I don't feel like I learned anything about failure analysis. I just learned how to complete a specific assignment and kinda of get the software functioning. The problems with this project were made much worse by being mostly online. Unless this project is re-configured I do not think it should be included in future years. It was incredibly frustrating. \r\n\r\nThe end of year projects are great but the time allocated is way too small. If I were designing the course, I would greatly simplify and shorten the failure analysis project in order to get to the term projects as fast as possible."

This class is one of the few classes for BME majors that help with after college careers and real-world experiences.

                "I would recommend this course to a student that is self-motivated and genuinely interested in medical device design. Lectures are somewhat engaging, but the real value is in the availability of the instructors, TAs, and mentors for students who have questions and seek out help. Additionally, the process of working on the end-of-semester project will be more valuable to those students who put more thought and effort into it.",
