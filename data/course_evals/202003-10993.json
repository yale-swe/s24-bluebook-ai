                "I am SO much more knowledgeable about social welfare programs ranging from medicaid to the tax system (yes, there is social welfare in the tax code, shocker). It was interesting because I thought going into the class, my own family experiences with these programs would make the class seem repetitive, but I honestly learned so much & it's awesome to be able to bring this knowledge back home and better explain to my parents.",
                "Learned about the various social welfare policies in the United States. We spoke about their eligibility requirements for their programs, their structures, policy proposals to update these programs, etc. Was a very interesting and insightful course and teaches you practical policy in a way that other courses at Yale simply cannot. This class also provided significant insight into economic inequality and poverty in the US",
                "This course provided be with both a wide and profound understanding of the main welfare programs currently in place in the United States (TANF, SNAP, WIC, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment insurance, tax credits, etc). Not only did we learn the specific history, eligibility requirements and potential avenues for change for each program individually, but we developed a thorough understanding of how they intersect, and broader patterns in the creation and perception of welfare in the US.",

                "I developed both breadth and depth of knowledge on American welfare and poverty policy. By studying a new program (medicare, nutrition programs, etc.) each week, we were able to get a snapshot of how each program worked, how it compares to other programs, and the effect it has on the day-to-day lives of Americans. This course was phenomenal in both giving a deep look into a program and giving students a better understanding of policy and how to affect change. These are policy areas that affect every single American and yet few of us know about them. I learned so much and have been using the information in everyday life.",
                "Not only did I learn so much about social welfare programs, but as students, we were encouraged to look up various applications, find their flaws, and design a new policy to better help people.",
                "I learned about the different social welfare programs in America. I learned their costs, benefits, funding, eligibility requirements, and effect.",
                "I learned so much about policy! We went over the basic eligibility requirements for a variety of policies for low-income families, as well as how the systems work. We also learned about the social implications and policy reforms. I learned how to think like a policymaker, and gained a wide range of knowledge about the state of policy at both the federal and local\/state level.",
                "I gained a detailed overview of the various social policies that form the foundation of the American social welfare system, including TANF, unemployment insurance, Medicaid\/Medicare, Social Security, and more. I also learned what the real application processes are like for many American social services. I learned how to effectively write a policy memo, in addition to an op-ed persuading a lay audience of my policy proposal.",

                "Weaknesses: NONE\r\nStrengths: Professor O'Brien, Tom the TA, my peers, the content, the honesty of the course, the assignments. Honestly, hands down one of the more useful courses for anyone who wishes to pursue any kind of policy job.",
                "Strengths: The content is very engaging and eye-opening. This course provided significant insight into poverty in the United States through the lens of welfare policy. Professor O'Brien is also an incredible professor. He was incredibly engaging over Zoom and he really fostered an energetic, close-knit, and accepting class even over Zoom. This course has been my highlight of the semester and one of the best I have taken in the Sociology major. I also thought the assignments were structured in a way that was informative and engaging. The readings did not feel like a chore because they weren't overly dense. Really looked forward to coming to this course.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Not really any that I can think of at the moment.",
                "The courses #1 strength is Professor O'Brien's genuine, unwavering enthusiasm for the material. His investment in the content and patience when answering the nitty-gritty questions makes it impossible not to get invested yourself. The course's structure is incredibly well thought-out, where each week focuses on a specific program so that we can really dive into details for each one without it being overwhelming. Also, you're not tested on remembering specific statistics or random facts, but on how you respond critically to the material, and on the effort put into proposals for policy change. The only thing that could make this class any stronger would be the ability to meet in person!",
                "This course was amazing, I cannot think of any ways that it could be improved. The strengths lie in Professor O'Brien's way of teaching and interacting with students, which made the class engaging and enjoyable. The readings were insightful and manageable and class discussion was always interesting and engaging. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.",
                "Professor O'Brien is one of the kindest, most dedicated professors out there. he works to get to know each student and creates a class environment where students truly care about one another by the end of the course and get to know each other on a personal level. I am so grateful for this course this semester. The coursework was very well distributed throughout the semester and manageable. Professor O'Brien was understanding of difficult circumstances and showed how much he loves both the subject and creating a positive environment for students. Great course, great prof, great material, great training for so many different career\/life choices. It's very approachable for people of any academic background as long as you have some interest. No real weaknesses.",

                "NO weaknesses!\r\n\r\nStrengths: The teaching was phenomenal. We created our own community in a zoom environment, and I think that is the biggest thing to be proud of. The class readings were interesting, discussions were engaging, and Professor O'Brien was approachable and caring. I walked away a better person because of this class!",
                "Strengths: Professor O'Brien's excitement and engagement with the course content, as well as everything that students have to say. It made for Zoom learning so much better! Another strength was the variety of readings that we had, which gave us the fundamental information about each policy we discussed, as well as some readings that contextualized them in the real world. \r\nNo weaknesses!",
                "This course is a fantastic one, and it is one that I think all students should take. There are two major strengths of this course: the syllabus and the professor. The syllabus is organized very well, with each week covering a new pillar of the American social welfare system. The readings are manageable and full of extremely helpful information. Readings vary in type as well, from sociological research to policy briefs to NYT op-eds. Second, Professor O'Brien is a gem. I highly recommend taking a course with him. He is understanding and enthusiastic. He cares about amplifying student voices while also getting across critical themes.",
                "Great course!",
                "It was well taught, very engaging professor",
                "Strengths: Professor OBrien is my favorite! He was very helpful in helping students prepare for their discussion week and was extremely understanding since were struggling through a pandemic and online school. The material is important and was engaging and easy to digest most of the time. Everyone in the class actually cared so discussion was usually lively.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the weekly canvas discussion wasnt very engaging, I would only post mine and not read anyone elses."

                "Rourke O'Brien is by far the best professor on Zoom. He was the most engaging professor I had all semester. What really worked in this course was that Professor O'Brien gave us a lot of time at the beginning of class to talk about moments of joy in our personal lives. This started the class with a lot of good energy and helped develop friendships even over Zoom.",
                "The seminar format with optional office hours worked perfectly over Zoom. In fact, Professor OBrien made the best of the online format by creating a running Google Document where the seminar leaders for the week would put the lesson plan and relevant resources, and other students took notes during seminar, so that there was a record of the entire course easily accessible at all times, with both class readings and notes from that weeks topic.",
                "The Zoom format that we had for this course seemed to work very well given the small class size. In addition to this, Professor O'Brien facilitated the use of a class Google Doc that served as a source of information which I found to be very helpful.",
                "Prof. O'Brien did a great job allowing for learning during the pandemic. He used breakout rooms effectively to dive deeper into topics and get to have longer back and forth conversations with classmates and had a different student help run each class which helped with buy-in. The agenda for the class was shared with the students which made class organized, efficient, and approachable. Prof. O'Brien was quick to respond to emails and communicated effectively with the class during a time that can often be confusing. I always felt like I understood expectations and what class would look like each week. I got just as much from this class as in-person classes I've taken in the past which is high praise and can't be said for every course this semester.",

                "I really enjoyed the breakout rooms!",
                "Practices that worked well was a working group discussion document, checking in with students at the beginning of class for moments of gratitude, and the professor meeting us with where we are at! I would've liked a 5 minute break during the seminar, if possible, because a lot of students tend to struggle to pay attention during any meeting times that go after 1 hr.",
                "Professor O'Brien assigned one student per class session to fill out a discussion guide which he prepared at the beginning of the semester. These guides helped organize our discussion and provided a place for students to accumulate notes and other questions related to the content. I thought this was extremely helpful in making sure our discussions were dynamic and thoughtful.",

This course will make you a more informed citizen, especially once you're an adult who has to deal with different social welfare policies.

Not only will he make you super knowledgeable on social inequality, but he is also generally one of the nicest, friendliest, and most supportive professors at Yale.",
                "YES, regardless of your major! This is a class anyone who plans to live in the United States should have to take. This class provides information that is ESSENTIAL to understand but so infrequently shared, for political decision-making, policy decisions, and just to be an informed, empathetic person. And Professor OBrien makes it fun!",

                "Absolutely! This is one of the best courses I've taken. I felt close with both the students and professor and the class was set up to not only learn effectively but feel connected tot eh rest of the class in a time where creating that type of environment is really difficult. Professor O'Brien is one of the kindest, most thoughtful professors out there and you should take this course or any other with him if you get the chance. The other students were engaged, thoughtful, and created a positive environment. Couldn't recommend enough. I thought I had an idea of how our country works in terms of policy and poverty reduction, but this class dives deep into the flaws (and successes) of policies that affect millions of Americans and identifies trends and connections that relate policy to larger questions of race, class, deservingness, and more.",
                "Yes! Amazing course, with an amazing teacher and assistant. So knowledgable and encouraging. My class ended up making a groupme with each other because of how close we all got.",
                "YES. A hundred times, yes. Professor O'brien is the best professor I have had at Yale, and this is the best class I have taken at Yale. I think this class should be required to graduate. We need more people to understand the ins and outs of the welfare programs that exist in America.",
                "Yes! Highly recommend for anyone interested in policy that affects low-income families.",
                "Definitely! I took this course in a time critical to understanding the United States' social services. Social Security, unemployment insurance, TANF, Medicaid\/Medicare, and more are pillars of our welfare system, and unfortunately, these programs face several challenges. This course provides a strong foundation for students seeking to 1) understand what these programs are and 2) highlight feasible areas of improvement for these programs. Professor O'Brien cares deeply about contextualizing social policy in terms of race and gender to further convey the gravity of social exclusion in the United States. The workload is manageable, and the academic payoff of this course is huge. I highly recommend this course to anyone and everyone.",
                "Yes. Any student with an interest in the topic should definitely take this course. There is so much to gain from taking this course.",

                "ABSOLUTELY YES, especially if you want to to work in politics, advocacy, law, non profit etc in the future. I think everyone needs to take a class with Professor OBrien."
