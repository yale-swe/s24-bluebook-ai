   "comments": [
    "I learned thermodynamics.",
    "I learned about the principles of thermodynamics and how to apply calculus to the sciences.",
    "It's basically just three-quarters of a thermodynamics course",
    "I learned about physical chemistry, focusing on the laws of thermodynamics.",
    "Lots of thermo.",
    "A deeper understanding of many fundamental concepts to thermodynamics.",
    "This course gives you an improved understanding of the ideal and real gas laws, the 0th to 3rd Laws of Thermodynamics, etc. ; you'll also learn some derivative manipulation tricks like Euler's Chain Rule",
    "I feel like I gained deep insight into thermodynamics concepts, but not so much into thermodynamics problem-solving. Indeed, the class does a great job covering the conceptual, which is very interesting. However, the \"problems\" we were solving in problem sets and exams seemed a bit pointless at time.",
    "I learned about the chemistry behind the behavior of gases, principles of thermodynamics, and mixing. I also learned how to apply multivariable calculus and differential equations to analyze physiochemical phenomena.",
    "The only things you really learn in this course are PV=nRT (and various modifications to make it a slightly less-bad assumption) and how to manipulate multivariable calculus in ways that I didn't even know existed to derive random formulas with varying relevance to physics (and on a good day, physical chemistry). Oh, and what an adiabatic expansion is! We talked about that for a long time. And how to calculate the efficiency of a heat engine, I guess. You will do, see, discuss, read, and learn nothing of even the most vague and abstract relevance to MB&B (why was I forced into taking this course again?).",
    "We learn about fundamental and introductory thermodynamics with applications in chemistry, how to describe the real world mathematically.",
    "The whole course is a little bit like general chemistry on steroids. You learn a lot about gases as well as thermodynamics. The semester finishes off with a deeper dive into phases.",
    "This course is a thorough introduction to physical chemistry, starting with the fundamental laws of gasses and matter and working up through basic thermodynamics. This course focuses on in-depth derivations of fundamental thermodynamic equations. the course teaches how to derive and rearrange equations to come to new conclusions and insights into the material and relationships between properties.",
    "I learned a lot about thermodynamics.",
    "I learned about ideal and real gases, and the properties of gases, liquids, and solids. Lots of mathematical interpretations and derivations of equations. Lots of graphs too. Thermodynamics is THE main subject of this course.",
    "Thermodynamics, gases, solution\/phase chemistry,",
    "I learned thermodynamic concepts as well as how to manipulate formulas and partial derivatives.",
    "An in-depth understanding of thermodynamics.",
    "A quantitative and rigorous approach to gas behavior and thermodynamic processes",
    "A lot about thermodynamics. There is not really a great way to summarize the content except that it has all to do with thermodynamics.",
    "Gained extensive foundational knowledge of thermodynamics as well as general problem solving skills.",
    "If you're ChemE, a lot of this course will overlap with Thermo, but the material is taught from a more conceptual point of view. The biggest takeaway for me was understanding non-idealities and how we can use what we know for ideal systems to model real ones. I also gained insight into how the world works basically, like why smoke will diffuse in a room, or how you can ice skate.",
    "I developed the ability to think more critically about advanced topics in chemistry and physics, mainly because our professor emphasized this instead of memorizing formulas.",
    "I learned about thermodynamics and phases in FAR more detail than I had in CHEM 167. I particularly appreciated the studies of entropy, since its usually hard for me to understand but was clear this time. Note that, contrary to what the syllabus said, we did not have time to cover electrochemistry or kinetics this semester.",
    "Thermodynamics of gasses and mixtures in great detail. Nothing else.",
    "We learned to basically move equations around and derive random variables. We barely learned useful and applicable physical chemistry. \r\n\r\nNothing we learned felt very applicable whatsoever. All we do in class is derive new equations and get firehosed with a sea of variables.",
    "This course offered a great insight to many essential thermodynamic and kinetic concepts. It also covered physical states of matter through evaluation of ideal models and more realistic approximations.",
    "The class is a deeper look at a lot of the concepts covered in Gen Chem except more attention is paid to how we can understand non-ideal phenomena and use our knowledge of math and chemistry to model them. You will also get a pretty solid grasp of thermodynamics just from taking this course, too.",
    "I learned the principles of physical chemistry (a very theoretical class). Also, I was able to learn time management and work balance."

   "comments": [
    "I wasn't going to write this until after the exam but I was staring down the barrel of the cannon that is our last pset and I felt compelled to share this with all of you dear readers. The strength of this course is that 75% of it is pulled straight from the textbook. That's about it. The weaknesses....oh boy. First of all, you must know that a foreign language prereq is required for this course. Which language you ask? Whichever one that this man speaks in his psets and exams. Answer keys are also 100% uninterpretable. I'm talking hieroglyphics level bad. Don't get me started on the fact that he does not post notes, as they are kept only on reserve in the CSSSI. You cannot take pictures or anything. He does this because he says that they're his \"intellectual property.\" You...you did not discover Raoult's Law or Gibbs Free Energy or anything else that we talked about. Make the notes public. He doesn't put these notes there to help us, he does it so that he can blame us when we do bad. He had the audacity to say that he wished that the average was better on the first midterm...like me too?? I didnt want to fail the exam but I did anyway even though I studied my ass off. Speaking of the midterms, he's so vague about what our grade means that people were dropping this class left and right. Dear reader, would you like to know more about why I failed the first exam? Well I'll tell you. You will be given an equation sheet. You will stare into the eyes of this equation sheet and you will see God. You will not pass Go. You will not collect $200. This equation sheet is at least 200 equations long and packed onto a sheet of printer paper (I have to be fair, for the first exam it was around 100). You have, in these exams, one hour and 15 minutes to figure out what you're doing, and if you're lucky enough to know how to do the problem, you have to spend forever finding the equation you need and then ding time's up. However, if you're reading this course eval it's probably too late for you and you know that you're gonna have to take this class. Good luck because you're going to need it.",
    "Prof. Vaccaro is a pretty good lecturer and is good at answering questions. However, there was a lot of material, and it would have been nice if the instructor led a review session at some point. Practice tests would have also been helpful since we didn't know what to expect for the first exam. We never actually solved a problem during lecture, but the problem sets and exam questions were mostly math based and not conceptual, so doing problems during lecturer would have been helpful.",
    "This course was overall quite good - it followed the textbook well and tested students' knowledge regularly with problem sets.",
    "Powerpoint slides are very detailed and helpful, and a very extensive equation sheet is provided for the exams.  Too much time is spent on the laws of thermodynamics, and not enough on the other material (mixtures, fugacity, colligative properties, vapor-liquid equilibrium), giving the beginning of the semester a slow tone while making the end very stressful.  Lectures do not prepare you for the problem sets.  In fact, many times the material needed to do the problem set was taught a few days after the problem set was due.  Most of lecture is spent on derivations and history of scientists, which isn't useful for problem sets but may help in the exams.",
    "Problem sets are not very reflective of exam materials; making multivariable calculus\/differential equations actual prerequisites might also be good.",
    "This course is very well-structured and organized. Professor Vaccaro is incredibly well-prepared for lecture and thorough in his explanations. The workload was manageable, and exams were fair. We didn't make it though all the intended material, and I think the pacing of the class could be improved by skipping some of the more tedious or repetitive derivations in class, especially since the course exactly follows the textbook.",
    "This class is well taught, the lectures are easy to understand and at the appropriate speed. It could be improved if the psets focuses more on problems than derivations.",
    "Strengths: Whatever students say about the class, Prof. Vaccaro is an objectively good lecturer. He teaches well, and his lectures are very organized and methodical. I felt like I have truly learned a lot in this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Meeting during reading period, and the exams are just unnecessarily long. I understand why professors write difficult exams, but why write an exam virtually no one in the class can finish?",
    "I think Professor Vaccaro does his best to make the lectures engaging by including fun facts and tidbits of history behind the science which I appreciate. I wasn't a big fan of how problem sets ended up being little more than derivation exercises, which aren't helpful for a lot of the problem solving seen on exams. In addition, not providing practice exams at all made things unnecessarily stressful. I also wish that exam answer keys were posted.",
    "Not sure why Vaccaro despises the textbook so much when his lectures are almost exclusively him regurgitating the textbook's words plus 5-6 handouts that can at times make a simple concept more complicated than it needs to be. For future students, read the textbook to understand the material, but use his lectures to get familiar with derivations. Speaking of lectures, Vaccaro needs to upload his lecture notes to Canvas instead of keeping them on reserve in the CSSSI  students often can't afford to trek up the hill only to discover that someone else has checked out the one binder of notes. The material he is lecturing on is not novel; these things have literally been known for 200-300 years.\r\n\r\nProf. Vaccaro, please understand that students want to learn this class from you, and students are often physically unable to go uphill just to check notes. Please upload to Canvas to facilitate our learning.",
    "The class is taught extremely well. The pace of the class was perfect and the problem sets were very well-written. The exams were very very challenging, and we were not given great resources to prepare for them. It would have been great if we had been given a formula sheet at the beginning of the semester to practice using the formula sheet on each of our problem sets. The formula sheets were too overwhelming for us to only get them a few days before each exam. Additionally, it would have been really nice to have had practice problems given to us for each exam so we would have had a better idea of what the exam format would look like.",
    "Strengths: very thorough overview of all thermodynamics concepts, very well structured, the most beautiful powerpoints I have ever seen, very well structured notes, follows the textbook closely, problem sets are very manageable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the problems seemed a bit pointless at times (mostly derivations and plugging in numbers at times)",
    "I really appreciate Professor Vaccaro's lecture style, especially how he weaves in the history of chemical discoveries alongside the theory. It can be really easy to get lost in chalkboards of derivations, but his bright and clear slides make everything much more digestible. \r\nHowever, the exams were quite difficult and I felt that we never really knew what to expect for them. It would be extremely helpful for the professor to hand out a list of important topics covered in each section, or perhaps hold a review session focusing on what he finds important.",
    "The strength of this course is its organization. If I'm being honest, this is the most organized course I have ever taken in the chemistry department. Dr. Vaccaro really does put in a lot of work to organize the class (especially considering this was his first time teaching 332 in many decades). Every lecture had a well-annotated slide deck that was printed out in full color at the front of the lecture hall. Every problem-set was well annotated and the questions were very clearly asked. The textbook, while not a necessary read, was always cleanly referenced as we moved throughout class. His lectures were not overly fast and you can tell he pre-organized his notes to optimize them for lecture. However, this is where the strengths end. The course had many weaknesses, including content, exams, workload, and accessibility. The content of the course felt... antiquated? We basically exclusively derived formulas that were derived between the 15th and 19th centuries. We talked very abstractly and mathematically about the most mundane topics in physics and chemistry (PV=nRT, Raoult's Law, etc.). In many instances, I felt like I was in a mathematical history class and not a chemistry class. As an MB&B premed, this simply wasn't my cup of tea and I oftentimes struggled to force myself to sit down and engage with this content because it was so boring. It's literally just an exercise in writing partial derivatives over and over again. You learn almost no concepts in physics or chemistry; it's all partial derivatives and anecdotes about Lord Kelvin. The exams were only 1 hour, which was nice, but asked way too many questions to be realistically completed in the given time. I didn't finish either midterm. The final was even worse and I left an entire question blank because after 3.5 hours I couldn't even make it to question 5 (parts a - g?). The workload of this course, as you may have anticipated, is quite high. There is a weekly problem set (including EXTENDED LENGTH BREAK p-sets) and they tend to be very long and challenging. The course already meets 3 times a week + section + night exams (AND MEETS IN READING PERIOD), so coupled with the fast pace and hard homework you will be spending quite a long time each week on this course. Finally, I felt that this course was not very accessible. I started in the 161\/165 sequence and felt like I was the only one in the room without some kind of exposure to this content beforehand. During section, my TA would often say things like \"if you recall from your fluid mechanics class...\" or \"you've probably seen this in your thermodynamics class...\" which are obviously things that I would not have taken as an MB&B major. The class is solely focused on things like refrigerators, heat engines, etc. and it's obvious that it's catered to the chemE kids. I understand that this is 332 but this year the chem department HAS ONCE AGAIN REFUSED to offer 328. If your department can't get it together to offer the course like you're supposed to (and refuse to let MB&B faculty who offer up their time teach it) then you could at least make a little effort to not alienate the MB&B seniors forced into taking this horrendous course.",
    "The course was well-organized, the problem sets were fair and helpful. However, all of the exams felt unfairly long for the time allotted. I also felt like we spent too much time in class doing very simple derivations instead of talking about their implications. Also the slides should be posted on canvas, it would be really helpful!",
    "Strengths: The subject matter is exactly what you sign up for and we delve deep into it in order to ensure that you are a pro at thermodynamics by the end of it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there were more chemistry applications talked about specifically. Like The one class where we talked about efficiency of an engine and our professor brought in an engine to show us was great! I wish there were more examples or applications we could see in the lecture.",
    "The material in this course lined up with the homeworks well, but the homeworks could've prepared us far better for the midterms and the final. The first midterm consisted almost exclusively of material from the two weeks prior to it (it was the 6th week of class), and in a much different capacity than I'd expected based on the homeworks anyways. Not only did I spend 2\/3 of my study time on material that was barely touched on, but I wasn't at all prepared to draw the connections needed to do well on the remainder. I'd also much rather bring in my own formula sheet than use the ones we were given. The formula sheets, while a nice review tool, were hundreds of formulas without any variables or conditions for equality labeled. They were made impenetrable by having tons of unnecessary formulas like rho = m\/V or common integrals that we were never going to use. For it to be any more effective than just memorizing every single formula that could be on it, I'd need a priest and a dowsing rod. The resources available for the class were also inconvenient; there's a big gap in quality across the TA's, and some TA sessions were devoted to playing games to learn vocab rather than working on the homework assignments. One TA once told myself and a friend the wrong answer to a homework problem, which we then changed from the right answer and promptly received 0 points on. That TA was the one responsible for that week's grading, too. The last available resources before the problem sets were due on Friday were peer tutor hours on Wednesday, so if you get in a bit of a pickle on a Wednesday night or Thursday, you'd better seek out alternate arrangements. Prof. Vaccaro is a good lecturer, but his two sections of office hours were both held at the same time on Monday and Wednesday, which was unhelpful as they're both during the same block of class time. Everyone unavailable for the Monday session due to a class was also unavailable for the Wednesday session. It's also been my observation that the sophomores in the class were (generally) far more stressed about it than the juniors and seniors, and we also repeatedly did worse on the homeworks and tests. I don't think that CHEM 174\/5 prepared us adequately for the rigor of the problem sets and the material of this course, and it caused for most of us a distressing experience.",
    "Strengths: Course is very well organized. Prof Vaccaro clearly cares a lot and shows this by being very approachable after class and during office hours. He will also go so far as to review material multiple students asked in the next class or make a handout about the question. \r\nWeaknesses & Improvements:\r\n1) Lack of review sessions by the professor -- it would be incredibly helpful if Prof Vaccaro organized review sessions before each exam to go over the most important material and what he expects us to thoroughly understand for exams\r\n2) Lack of practice tests -- if there was at least one practice test before the midterms and finals, it would help focus studying a bit and, at least for the first midterm, allow us to know what the format is like. We went in blind which was a little tough.\r\n3) TAs all teach different things at section. It would be helpful if there was a more central lesson plan they all worked together on to create and then enact in all of the different sections. I think the section TA could have really influenced student's understanding and experience in the course.\r\n4) Posting answer keys to the exam\r\n5) The equation sheets were daunting -- perhaps organizing them a bit more by section with explicit headings could help. I went through the sheets before every exam but was always searching through them come test time",
    "One strength of this course was the in-depth nature of lectures. Vaccaro effectively explained all new topics, and went at such a pace that it was easy to follow along in his logic. The problems sets were good at  working the student through the problem without any major issues. Exams were fair in their material and difficulty.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course was the lack of preparation for exams. While new material was presented well, students had to engage with the material very little before exams, since problem sets usually walked the students through problems without requiring any major critical thinking. The problem sets were much lower in difficulty than exams, and were designed in a different manner. Also , Vaccaro went at too slow of a pace, meaning we only made it through 5 chapters, and didn't make it to kinetics or chemical equilibrium.",
    "Strengths: Professor Vaccaro is an incredible lecturer and always super helpful by email and in office hours. Weaknesses: the course is a lot of work and sometimes confusing, and the exams were rather ridiculous.",
    "Strengths of this course include learning about chemistry through a physical perspective rather than organic or other. I cannot think of any outstanding weaknesses, other than the difficulty of the course, which cannot be improved. There is a lot of information to know, specifically when to use which equation and under which conditions they are used.",
    "Strengths: only three total exams, manageable weekly workload\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n1) Organization: I don't know if the course is always like this, so I can only speak to the experience with Professor Vaccaro. Professor Vaccaro was really poorly organized. No practice exams were given and the answer keys to the exams afterward were never shared. He made students go to the CSSSI (not a typo and if you haven't heard of it before, that's the problem) just to see a copy of his notes for lecture because he didn't want to just post them on Canvas prior to exams. The absurdity of this is that students could go up to the CSSSI, look at the copy of his notes, and tediously copy them down by hand should they choose to do so. \r\n2) Exams: As stated in \"strengths,\" the fewer the exams the better with this class. Professor Vaccaro had a complete disconnect with the class in terms of how well students knew the material he thought he was teaching well. After the first exam, Professor Vaccaro explicitly stated, \"Wow, I didn't anticipate the average to be THAT low (It was a 67%).\" Furthermore, Professor Vaccaro thought he had confidently designed the final exam to give us more than enough time to finish it. Sure enough, he gave us an exam that was significantly longer than \"the length of two midterms\" and this was just another example of the disconnect he had with students.",
    "I liked how the professor and the TFs really wanted us to learn and do well. However, the final was really hard and much longer than what we were told. We were told it would be twice as long as a regular midterm, but it was at least 3 times as long as well as much harder content wise. It would also be helpful if answer keys to midterms were posted.",
    "Practice exams would have been extremely helpful.",
    "Very content-heavy course, very fast paced. Lecture notes online would help because often difficult to get everything down as instructor moves incredibly quickly.",
    "Professor Vaccaro is both the strength and the weakness of the class. He is as dedicated, knowledgeable, and resourceful as he is demanding, fast, and inflexible. The content of the lectures are never too hard to digest, but somehow they become so hard in problem sets and exams. This made preparation for exams so hard, on top of not having any practice problems.",
    "Ran through the material a little quickly which made it a little difficult to catch up on some confusing topics, but overall the pace seemed logical.",
    "The course is very well taught with great support from the TA's. Honestly, I don't really see any weaknesses.",
    "The course format is very effective. Traditional chalkboard supplemented by PowerPoint slides for illustrations is a great combo to facilitate learning. Homework assignments were never a bearing, which was both good and bad; they never took longer than 6 hours to complete, but some questions seemed to be more focused around algebraic manipulation coupled with calculus instead of interpretation using concepts of physical chemistry. The lack of practice exams was also a weakness as many students didnt know what to expect for the exam aside from the general format.",
    "Strengths: Professor Vaccaro is very organized; the handouts he gives are helpful in explaining concepts; the homework is great for learning concepts, especially since he guides you through them carefully with his instructions; the exams are fair and not meant to hurt you (the graders also give lots of partial credit); the course follows the textbook well, so you can always resort to the textbook if lecture confuses you. Weaknesses: We didnt go quickly enough to cover all of the planned topics; meets during reading week, which helps cover a bit more content, but really only a bit.",
    "Strengths: sticks to the book so you have a reference to follow when studying. \r\nWeaknesses: problem sets sometimes unnecessarily tedious (with no added pedagogical value). The calculus is very hand-wavy and could be made more rigorous (this is a problem with the book too). Did not cover equilibrium or kinetics as promised in the syllabus (the only topics that apply to MB&B if you're an MB&B major).",
    "Absolutely terrible course. MB&B majors should not be required to take this course.",
    "he just throws a bunch of information at you every week and expects you to learn",
    "The course is very well taught, the material is explained thoroughly and the lectures are very concise. Handouts are provided for the slides shown which enables easier note taking. The homework covers interesting ideas that are applied to real life examples. Though difficult the multistep problems walk through how they can be done in manageable steps. However there are few resources to prepare for the exams which account for the majority of the grade. Practice exams would assist in alleviating students stress, helping to assess more on their knowledge rather than how well the handle tests. More communication with TAs would ensure that review sessions are actually useful rather than giving contradictory advice. Shorter exams and\/or more time would again ensure students are able to truly display their knowledge.",
    "The lectures are really well taught and organized, and I think that the homeworks helped solidify concepts from the class. I would say that giving practice questions before an exam might be useful, or even showing an exam from last year just so we better understand what to expect. That being said, I recognize that the exams are often about looking at different material but extrapolating from what we already know so this might be difficult. I think that there can at least be some kind of practice to review the conceptual content, since the true-false sections test that, and it is necessary to be able to work with new equations and systems. Perhaps something like a study guide, or a list of concepts to accompany the equation sheet we get before the exam.",
    "This course was overall very well taught. Professor Vaccaro is an incredible professor and is very, very organized. However, the workload of the course is very heavy and very challenging."

Although physical chemistry was not an easy class by any means, I honestly found the information very interesting and presented in a really neat way. Personally, I found this class to be much less tedious and repetitive than organic chemistry, and it helps a lot that it relies on comprehension rather than memorization of concepts.",
    "Physical chemistry is a stain upon the sciences and I pity anybody so far gone from the light that they would consider taking this course as an elective. The workload is high, it meets during reading period on top of its already 3x-week + section structure, goes fast and hard, and is largely inaccessible to students outside of the chem\/chemE departments. If anything, you are an MB&B major trying to decide between this and 328 (assuming you are part of the lucky group of kids that qualifies for p. chem at the same time 328 is offered, which appears to be once per never). Look, I too have read the 328 reviews. I understand that it seems less-than-deal. Listen to me when I say that you will never forgive yourself for taking 332 over 328. I will never forgive the chem department for not offering 328 this year and forcing me into this course. This course was a nightmare and I hated every minute of it. Admittedly, Dr. Vaccaro was very nice and did an excellent job of organizing the course. However, this was probably the least relevant of the 26 courses I've taken for this major so far. You hardly do any chemistry, or physics for that matter. It's mainly a history and mathematics course. You will spend countless hours writing partial derivative after partial derivative. Problem sets will take you on insanity-inducing journeys through pages of pages of math only to yet again prove that PV=nRT. The exams, while short, were long and difficult to finish in the time allotted. His notes are locked way in the CSSSI and there are no practice midterms (nor does he post midterm answer keys). I came out of this course with no skills, insights, or knowledge about chemistry that I didn't already have coming into it. All I learned was that I can write the partial derivative d in a very beautiful script if I try my best.",
    "It is a necessary course for everyone taking it.",
    "I felt disappointed at the lack of big-picture discussion\/application of the formulas that we derived. It all felt very niche, and I expected more from our discussions of entropy and free energy. However, the focus was mainly mathematical, similar to Physics 200.",
    "If a student enjoys mathematics, applications of math, and chemistry, this class is just that; math and chemistry. If you enjoy those you'll enjoy this class.",
    "No :(",
    "This is a tough course, but I'm assuming that if you're taking it, it's because you have to. Prof Vaccaro is great -- go to him with any questions. Be prepared for a challenge, especially with regard to the exams. Luckily, homework sets weren't as long as PChem 2 students said they would be and the midterm exams were capped to a little over an hour. Also, the final was really long and I didn't even get to finish, so be prepared for that.",
    "I actually would recommend this course to another student interested in chemistry or thermodynamics. The course is well-organized, not too difficult, and is a fair course. Of course, this class is only really necessary for limited students, so I would not recommend this class to just anyone interested in chemistry. It really is only of value if you need it towards your major.",
    "Unless you have to take it :(",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because thermodynamics is interesting, and I think everyone in STEM should know thermodynamic relationships in chemistry. Very interesting class, but also quite difficult (but not too difficult: one of my less difficult classes this semester).",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student but, as is with other poor STEM classes at Yale, most students enrolled in these courses are required to take them. So if you are not required to take Pchem, I strongly suggest you don't do it unless you have an extremely vested interest in subject matter.",
    "Yes.",
    "Only if you have to.",
    "Yes, very challenging chemistry class for even STEM students.",
    "As most people take because of their requirements anyway, just pay additional attention to this class and you will have an above-average experience. It can sometimes feel helpless, so reach out to the TAs early if you can.",
    "If you need it for your major, take it without any qualmsif you put the work in youll be okay.",
    "Yes, as a ChemE, this is a more conceptual approach that I found to be very helpful. Because there is so much overlap between this, Thermo, and my MENG 285 elective, it was great to take them all together and learn the material from three different approaches.",
    "Take it, especially if its with Prof. Vaccaro. Extremely well organized course.",
    "Absolutely! Youre probably taking this because you have to, but if youre MB&B like me youll (normally) have the choice between this p-chem and the MB&B p-chem. I dont know what the MB&B version is like, but this version was very well-organized and well-suited to effective learning. Its probably one of the most organized CHEM department classes Ive taken at Yale.",
    "Absolutely not. Do not take this course. All you learn how to do is navigate through an ocean of equations without actually learning any physical chemistry. \r\nIf you are an MB&B major required to take this course, go petition to the MB&B department as this course feels absolutely unnecessary and extraneous to the study of biochemistry and biophysics.",
    "NO",
    "Its a requirement for some majors so yeah",
    "Due to the difficulty of the class and the high workload, I would not recommend this course if it is not needed."
