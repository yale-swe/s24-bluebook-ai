                "This course was an introduction to writing fiction, poetry, and drama. We spent several weeks reading different works in each of these three categories and had multiple small assignments throughout each unit. Each unit ended with a larger assignment. We learned about style and technique for each type of writing and had many opportunities to experiment with our writing through the assignments and in-class writing exercises.",

                "I learned about the craft of creative writing.

I also learned about workshopping pieces with my class and how to improve my own writing.",

                "I learned how to consider poetry -  from language choice and use of punctuation in editing my own work, to evaluating and understanding others' work. Through workshops and occasional partner work, I learned the creative benefit of reading other people's work and having them read yours. I also developed confidence and insight into my own strengths and abilities as a poet, from Professor Skillings' generous in-line and overarching comments. I was exposed to a world of short fiction and alternative plays that I have never before encountered (I didn't always like them, but I really appreciate knowing about them and seeing what liberties those writers take). Possibly most importantly, the regular pace of assignments and unique grading scheme (the first few pieces in each unit were ungraded) helped me realize how fast I can churn out satisfying work -- this work was often just a basis for further writing, but having those assignments and short in-class writing exercises handy when I was trying to write later on was hugely helpful, not just practically, but creatively.",

                "Strengths: It's engaging and chill, not overwhelming amount of work like some other classes do, very reasonable work load. But really build that strong foundation of creative writing. Weaknesses: nothing.",
                "I enjoyed this course a lot. I think that more writing is better-- I liked the short writing exercises that we did in class the most because they really gave us the chance to hone our skills. I didn't like as much when we were just discussing various pieces of literature for a long time-- I didn't find that to be as engaging as the solo\/group writing exercises.",
                "I cannot think of any notable weaknesses of this course. I thought the three-unit format worked really well and that the assignments were spaced out with enough time to allow everyone to think about what we wanted to write. I also liked the way workshops were structured because it was a low-pressure way to receive feedback from classmates.",
                "Wonderful course. Great feedback and source material for inspiration but also enough independence to explore my own abilities and achieve my writing aspirations.",
                "I truly don't think this class has any weaknesses. I enjoyed coming to class every day and found it thoroughly engaging every time. I got such helpful feedback on my work and felt there was a great balance in our assignments between being granted creative license but also having structure and guidance.",
                "strengths: not too time consuming, engaging, a safe and supportive outlet to explore your creativity in writing \r\nweaknesses: none are glaring out at me at the moment! this is a great course!",
                "Strengths - Professor Skillings could not provide for a warmer or more low-stakes environment, while at the same time expecting excellence and pulling it out of us. I was constantly blown away by the creativity she elicited from each person in the class, no matter the writing background we were coming from. I don't see why anyone wouldn't take this class. It is so purely about learning and improving -- whatever barrier some people feel at the title (\"Creative\" Writing) does not exist. We get to try out whatever we want, basically, whether that is imitating a specific writer, going according to her guiding prompts, etc., and get feedback on that draft, and then we can choose to continue with that draft or change it up for the graded assessment. The professor was always available to meet about our work and our writing aspirations in general. I felt that poetry was the best unit, which makes sense, because the professor is a poet, but I definitely gained a greater appreciation for writing and reading in fiction, poetry, and theater. Professor Skillings is so nice that I had to seek reassurance that my work was actually good when she would tell me it was; I thought she might not know how to say anything mean. But, once I learned how to read in-line comments, I saw that her niceness was always accompanied by really useful and practical suggestions for improvement. Additionally, the wide range of writing that she exposed us to was another sort of commentary on all of the many kinds of writing that people find \"good\" -- it seems like there is an audience for almost any kind of style (and she really helped us pursue our own styles!), and that it's just about getting a feel for what sounds good.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - While this is a great starting point for anyone looking to dip their toes into creative writing and certainly anyone who is just looking for a spark to pursue personal projects, the breadth of the course means we give short-shrift to some of the material (this obviously makes sense for an introductory class, but I was hoping to have a bit more of a \"method,\" rather than just exposure and a little bit of practice). For example, I didn't walk away knowing that I could write fiction well, but I definitely have the appreciation for it and the confidence to take another class in it - which is not necessarily a weakness, but just something I'd like to explain.",
                "Strengths: Being able to write creatively for a class is amazing, and the way the class is structured makes sure you get a chance to dip your feet into a lot of different kinds of writing. The works chosen to read are really interesting and varied, and there are three or four guest lectures, which are super informative and fun.\r\nWeaknesses: In some of the units, I wished there were a couple more (ungraded) smaller prompts given outside of the large assignments; this was done really well in the fiction unit, but I felt like there could have been more in the poetry and especially the drama unit.",

                "Because this class was a seminar I don't think the virtual class was too different from what the in-person class would have been. We still had all of our discussions and if the professor needed to show us something she just shared her screen.",

                "The small class size and live format were definitely two plusses for engagement. Flexibility with deadlines (especially not being harsh about what time things were turned in on the day they were due), as well as the opportunity to have our work reviewed before getting it graded, were huge steps for making this class accessible and engaging. Time for announcements and personal \"what's up with you?'s\" at the beginning of each class session were a great way to involve us all from the start.\r\n\r\nLive writing exercises that we did in many classes could have also helped engage us in the classes that were more about rehearsing the readings for the day, but in general the class was the perfect level of engagement.",
                "The workshops worked very well despite being virtual, as did discussion of the stories we read. I can't think of anything that can be improved outside of being in-person."

The workload is not excessive and the weekly readings are genuinely enjoyable and helpful. I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in creative writing.",

                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. If you are not intimidated by the title \"creative,\" then I would suggest this as a potential fifth class, but I know that for some people, the anxiety that the burden of creativity would produce for each assignment makes the coursework seem more than it is (also probably for people who are more dedicated to revision than I am). We all have thoughts, feelings, and occasionally, creative ideas that we should feel empowered to put onto paper and maybe even share with others, and this course definitely helps you get there. Even if that doesn't sound like you, the mindset of a creative writer is definitely a boon for other disciplines and other forms of writing as well; not to mention, reading all of these varied works and learning what can be considered creative writing opens your eyes to inspiration from the world around you. I personally think that taking one English class each semester, even for those who are not in the English major, is a must. It works a part of your brain that other classes rely on but don't necessarily contribute to. Take it!",
