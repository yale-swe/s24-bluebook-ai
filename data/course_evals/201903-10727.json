   "comments": [
    "I was able to learn the insights of Ancient and Medieval Western historians and political thinkers ranging from Herodotus to Aquinas on the role of government institutions and legislation, the proper management of a state, and the development of international relations. Given the extensive and often richly packed reading required, I very quickly developed my close-reading skills. Class discussions and three weeklong essay assignments further improved my argumentation skills. Overall, I leave the course with a strong grounding in political philosophy, a much more developed worldview, and the pleasure of having worked with my professor and peers.",
    "I have a much deeper understanding of political structures and how societies fail and thrive.",
    "I learned how to better analyze historical texts and find interesting areas to analyze.",
    "How to write a succinct and effective history paper; \r\nDiscovered my passion for Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss;\r\nGot me thinking about taking more political theory or even the Grand Strategy program.",
    "I definitely gained a greater ability to read quickly and process the reading on a deeper level. I also gained a great introduction to some of the greater works in the Western canon.",
    "In taking this course, I developed a multifaceted understanding of Greek and Roman history, thought, and culture. I learned to scour primary sources for useful information regarding cultural customs, political viewpoints, and continuities between societies and authors, developing my analytical and comparative skills. I also became significantly more familiar with different systems of government (indluding their merits and downfalls), and I learned not only how to discuss them with others, but also why I should discuss them with others. Overall, DRST 005 taught me to view history and political thought with a critical eye, consistently aware of differing points of view, bias, and context within historical patterns.",
    "This class showed me how to take treatises and histories from ancient authors and explore them to their absolute deepest. Instead of believing everything we read, I was able to explore the texts in a deeper context, offering a different narrative that the authors may have missed entirely.",
    "I loved getting to learn about different writers and how their backgrounds impacted their works, as well as how to read between the lines. Additionally, I learned how to compare different texts and their authors, and observe how Greece and then the Roman Empire progressed throughout time."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths:\r\n-Unique breadth and significance of content for a first year course on the subject. \r\n-Develops writing, close reading, and argumentation skills.\r\n-Balance between seminar discussions and content delivered directly in weekly lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Perhaps excessively fast-paced, making it nearly impossible to devote to each text the attention it deserves.\r\n-People are not held sufficiently accountable for doing the reading throughout the course. \r\n\r\nPotential Improvement:\r\n-Develop some kind of system of reading checks, perhaps administered on a weekly basis.",
    "I think that the reading load for this course was much too high for students to have a strong grasp of the material, but the material itself was often pleasurable to read.",
    "The books in this course are incredible. The course would be more rewarding if there was more guidance in linking the works together.",
    "I like the depth of in-class discussions and the out-of-box ideas that come up. That said, I wish the class activities are more structured and the professor more strict about completing the reading - there's always a handful of people who talk every time.",
    "The books themselves and structuring of both the course and overall DS program was a strength. I enjoyed the reading and feel as though everything we read was important. A weakness of this course were the essay prompts. They felt unfocused and unfairly broad (trying to bring in too many works made it unmanageable).",
    "The courses strengths lie in its ability to present various influential thinkers in a comprehensible fashion. The chronological order of the class allows students to see the evolution of various ideas and methods of writing, lending a broader importance to the class itself. The course also encourages insightful discussion, encouraging students to form claims and arguments with care and accuracy. The final exam is also structured well, and the inclusion of two essays bridging at least six different authors promotes an all-encompassing understanding of the course. \r\n\r\nThe courses largest weakness is the disconnect between the amount of material students read and the amount of material that the seminars and lectures cover. With various texts, (Augustines City of God being the most relevant example) there are many passages assigned that are wholly neglected during seminar. While it is understandable that seminars and lectures cannot discuss all of the assigned reading, it is worthwhile to consider excising the least important reading selections in order to promote a greater focus on the passages of highest importance.",
    "Pros: gives insight to higher-level study of texts of this caliber. Allows exploration of the foundations of Western rule and history. Directed Studies.\r\n\r\nCons: Tackling a large amount of text over a short period of time leads one unfulfilled over our exploration of most texts, especially if we prioritize critical thinking over general insight. Sometimes it would feel beneficial if the professor slowed down and explained what we just read.",
    "I loved this course! I found it extremely interesting to hear my classmates' opinions and different ideas on the texts. Professor Klein led the students lead the discussions, but also provided his own valuable knowledge in order to add a new dimension to the conversation. One weakness that I can think of, but that has nothing to do with Professor Klein himself, is that there were certain students in the course who always wanted to share their ideas and prove themselves. This is not bad in itself, but it did make it a little uncomfortable for students who were less familiar with the material to participate. Professor Klein did help with this issue by introducing a system where the students would write discussion questions\/points on the board and then speak on them."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it to any student with a strong sense of discipline, a genuine interest in the humanities, and an open-minded curiosity. However, because the course calls for a significant commitment, especially if one wants to take full advantage of it, I would not recommend it to anyone who does not see these traits in themselves.",
    "Yes, I think it is a good starting point for understanding how politics and history intersect and the flaws and benefits of each political system.",
    "Not with Klein. The course would probably have been fine but he is simply not a good professor.",
    "Yes. Take H&P and indulge yourself in Professor Klein slowly. You have to engage him in back-and-forth debates and try to tackle all the interesting ideas he raises to get the most out of the class. It's a little more intellectual effort on the student end, but I promise it's worth it.",
    "Compared to Philosophy and Literature, this class definitely felt weaker. Although I enjoyed the readings, the overall course still felt unfocused. I think that the works we read in Historical and Political Thought were still important for contextualizing the works we read in Philosophy and Literature.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. While not all students will have a strong interest in history and politics, the ideas, texts, insights, and conversations that comprise the course are valuable to any person who aims to be an attentive, rational member of a political system. Additionally, the course promotes productive conversation surrounding foundational ideas of culture, history, and governmentkey topics that are often neglected if one is not careful.",
    "Yes! I loved reading the different texts and being able to compare them. I feel as though I have gained such a rich insight into Greek and Roman history, and how this applies to our current political scene."
