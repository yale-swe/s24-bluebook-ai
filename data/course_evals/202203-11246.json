This course better corresponds with the organic chemistry lecture, so it is very helpful to see concepts in action. Because each student gets their own hood to work in, with occasional partnering required, this makes every student put in more effort to know their stuff before coming into lab. The TFs are also very helpful in explaining more concepts in depth.",

            "comments": [
                "My TA was the biggest weakness",
                "I thought this course was very well organized.",
                "Some of the requirements for experimental plans beforehand and note taking during the labs were a little more tedious than useful and are surplus to what is done in a real lab setting. Nonetheless, the course was structured well overall.",
                "Strengths: The class is organized well and you learn a lot from it. The instructor and TFs are also very helpful in lab. I did not feel pressured during lab or scared to mess up, the environment was very supportive. There are only two lab reports, so the amount of writing is not too high.\r\nWeaknesses: The workload is much higher than it should be for a 0.5 credit class. Also, the experimental plans are a bit annoying to do each time and sometimes it feels like they are graded somewhat arbitrarily. Also, the biweekly quizzes don't open until 5pm after lab, so if you finish lab early, it's a bit frustrating to not be able to just get the quiz over with.",
                "Strengths include the structure of the labs. Compared to gen chem lab, orgo lab seemed more organized because the goals of the lab were more specific. This facilitated better learning because I was able to better understand the purpose of what I was doing in lab, whereas in gen chem lab there was a lack of why we were doing what we were doing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses included the great variance in grading depending on who the Teaching Assistant was.",
                "The strength of the course is that the labs are very hands-on and interactive which leads most of the students to enjoy their time in the lab. A weakness of the course is that the lab assignments did not line up at all with the teachings in the organic chemistry lecture, this made some of the labs less enjoyable and harder to understand because students had not yet learned about the chemistry\/reaction happening in the lab.",
                "No specific strengths nor weaknesses.",
                "The course was very well-organized in comparison to similar chemistry labs. The structure was appropriate and the workload was manageable. The lab itself was interesting without being overbearing. There was a nice connection to lecture as well.",
                "I really liked this course. The pre-lab information and instructions provided to students were very thorough and clear. They allowed me to be able to quickly complete the labs and understand the concepts behind them. Both the instructor and TAs were very helpful, both in class and during office hours. The experiments were interesting and allowed students to gradually develop their organic synthesis skills. The workload was very manageable (especially in comparison to gen chem labs).",
                "Strengths: lab went smoothly each week, the class is highly organized, and we know what is expected of us and how to be successful. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: grading was a little unnecessarily harsh at times. I got points taken off for starting a sentence with a number, which is ludicrous in my opinion. Also, despite the workload being better than in gen chem lab, the workload is still way too high for a half credit class. I spent 4-6+ hours on experimental plans each week, plus reorganizing my notes outside of lab, the post-lab assignments, and studying and taking the quizzes. It's literally more work than my 1.5 credit language class. This lab class is enjoyable, but make it a full credit for reduce the workload.",
                "It's a solid organic chemistry course. I enjoyed that we did not have a post-lab due every week. However, some of the grading on Post Lab A and B was very finicky, and students lost up to 5% of their grades on those assignments because of minute details. Overall, grading seemed fair and expectations were clear.",
                "The overall structure of the course was good; however, the grading on the assignments (experimental plans and post labs) seem very over the top and critically harsh for no good reason, especially when this course deals with the science, grammar correcting shouldn't be as much of a priority. Additionally, some of the TAs are distanced or can be rude at times.",
                "There is simply way too much busy work and not enough actual learning. While the first week was useful in familiarizing students with the common lab practices, everything onwards felt like it could be ascertained from a 2-page reading. The EP's took hours of work and were mostly just copying and paraphrasing portions of SDSs, instructor videos, and handouts. Plus, the material on the quizzes was not covered in lab and not fully explored in the readings or review questions. This lead many classmates to cheat on the take-home quizzes and inadvertently punished students who didn't. Overall, the main problem is that this class has a disproportionately heavy workload for the material--something that discourages many non-STEM students from exploring the diverse course offerings outside their major.",
                "Strengths: the first few labs focused on practicing various techniques, which was extremely useful before starting synthesis labs. The coursework was not too demanding, which facilitated learning.\r\nWeaknesses: there were a lot of inconsistencies between what was expected for assignments between the course packet and TAs, and different TAs had different expectations. It made it confusing because you would get points taken off for something you were never told to do.",
                "Strengths: Lab sessions were genuinely fun, and I enjoyed each one.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Everything outside of the lab sessions themselves feels like busy work, especially the post-lab assignments, quizzes, and portions of the experimental plans. The grading of these assignments was also seemingly arbitrary, and oftentimes confusing. I would ask my TA why I got a quiz question wrong, and they would either be unsure as to why the correct answer was what it was or discover that the questions and answers were phrased so vaguely that it would be challenging to select an answer. Moreover, the lab did not align with the lecture, so we were introduced to subjects in lab with the expectation that we had a working knowledge of them from the lecture.",
                "more of an outline on how to do the post lab assignments. Post rubrics. We lost many points if we had a small citation error, etc",
                "All TFs and lab aids were helpful and engaging",
                "I really liked the videos of lab because they were better at teaching what the lab would be like. The grading was quite harsh, however.",
                "It was nice that there were no long lab reports and instead the focus was on actually doing the labs. The only weakness is I wish there were more partner labs because I learned more and have a better time when I could work through it with someone.",
                "Strengths: The class was very engaging and taught me a lot of practical skills. It was really valuable to apply the concepts I was learning in lecture to the real world. I thought expectations were clearly outlined and feedback was given clearly\/often. Dr. DiMeglio and my TF were phenomenal and made coming to lab a great experience each week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there were chairs. Standing for 2-4 hours straight can get really tiring.",
                "I think this course was very strong at teaching skills as we had lots of in-person practice. The biggest weaknesses of this course were the quizzes that were given each week. The time limits on the exams made them very difficult, along with the fact that the practice quiz questions were often very different from the actual quiz content. I often felt lost and rushed, and wished that the course itself prepared us better for the quizzes.",
                "Weakness: a lot of repetition: the same information that went into EP's was then expected to be rewritten in your lab notes during lab\r\n\r\nStrength: anything is better than General Chemistry Lab",
                "Strength: the assignments were interesting, and they are not just grueling lab reports. The experimental plans were fun to write. \r\n\r\nWeakness: the pace of this class was too slow. I wanted to learn more, and at least cover NMR which is so ubiquitous in organic chemistry labs that it felt like a crime to to include.",
                "Strengths: supportive environment for students, prepares students to be successful in the lab regardless of prior experience\r\nWeaknesses: quizzes can be hard because of the difference in timing between CHEM 220 lectures, additionally although there are quiz practice problems, there are no keys to consult",
                "This chem lab was more fun than past chem labs I have taken. I think not having weekly 10 page lab reports and only having a quiz every 2 weeks helped me enjoy lab more instead of stressing about it.",
                "The strength of the course lies in its ability to reinforce acquired skills throughout the semester. Most learned techniques were practiced at least twice, if not more, and so I felt like the experiments we conducted had a lasting impact on my capabilities in laboratory settings. I also appreciated the sheer level of organization that went into planning the curriculum - although the experiments got increasingly more involved as the semester progressed, never once did I feel bewildered or lost because of the course packet or laboratory space itself. \r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, my only comment would be that it might have been nice to engage more directly with primary sources and to learn how to go about collecting and interpreting them; however, I understand that time is limited and there will be opportunities next semester to do just that.",
                "Workload overall was rigorous, but well-balanced. Lab procedures were challenging, but strong guidance from faculty ensured that every student felt comfortable and familiar with the process.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of the course is that for the various assignments involved in the course (written experimental plans, lab quizzes, and post-lab assignments), it often felt as much of the information required to answer questions were hidden among the 100+ pages of the course packet, and neglected during lab meetings. Thus, students were left to their own devices to minutely scour the course packet every time. If faculty were more actively ensuring that the contents covered in every assignment were correspondingly and thoroughly covered during lab meetings or during outside sessions such as office hours, the vast majority of student stress regarding CHEM 222L would be alleviated.",
                "I thought the course was set up decently well, but grading was a bit harsh. Often TAs would take off points for very particular things. As long as you are on top of your work it is okay. I wish that there was more support for studying for the quizzes, which were hard to complete given the short amount of time for each question.",
                "Strength: coincides with the lecture so makes understanding the material much easier",
                "Strengths: the labs were engaging, there was little pressure on performing the lab correctly, supportive and engaging environment\r\nWeaknesses: the workload was very high (much more than a 0.5 credit class should be), the quizzes were very difficult, the grading was harsh",
                "The strength of this class is that it is very well organized. I knew exactly what to do each week and during each lab section. Personally, I though that the 10-minute quizzes were very time-restricting. It would be nice if there was even a 2-minute increase.",
                "Strengths: the experience of being in the lab is super fun! It feels like being a kid playing with toys (albeit much more dangerous ones) again! I was always impressed when experiments worked--it felt like magic. The profs and TAs are also really nice, helpful, smart, and friendly people who are great teachers.\r\nWeaknesses: the grading of this class was too formatting-oriented and it often felt like points were mostly deducted for aesthetics rather than content in assignments. As a result, out-of-lab work for this course often took way longer than it should have, because after finishing, extensive time would need be spent accounting for the course's formatting standards.",
                "Strengths: I think the class builds on itself very well. For instance, in the first few labs when we were practicing individual skills such as recrystallization, it felt like a lot of work. Still, by the time we got to doing actual syntheses, which involves many of those steps, I already felt much more comfortable performing them and I was more efficient as well. I also really like the video recordings of the experiments, and I think they were very helpful in giving me a solid understanding of what to do in lab. Dr. DeMeglio also gives very nice tips in them that aren't in the course packet.\r\nWeaknesses: I think there could be a little more transparency in grading, such as seeing rubrics after assignemtns, particularly the post-labs, are graded. Also, there were some inconsistencies between materials, particularly in formatting our reports.",
                "Strengths: This course is well-designed to help students become better problem solvers and independent thinkers when working in a laboratory setting. Being in an individual hood is very stressful, and at first I actually quite disliked it, but over time was able to get used to it and begin feeling more comfortable and confident in my skills. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course is extremely nit-picky with grading. Every little detail will be looked for and will be marked off if it's not there. In addition, I found that there was not much emphasis on learning the science behind what we were doing up until we were required to take the bi-weekly quizzes. I really struggled with the quizzes throughout and found them difficult to study for. We are given \"readings\" but they are from a textbook that was not easy to access or listed anywhere in required course materials (was often referred to just as \"the textbook\" throughout\"). Given how important understanding the science is for the post-labs and quizzes, it would be great if this could be emphasized more throughout the course, or gone over more thoroughly than just in the 5-minute pre-lab lectures",
                "Strengths: techniques taught in logical order and repeated in various experiments as we built upon them such that by the end felt comfortable doing a lot of them\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: doing the EPs and then rewriting the same info in our lab notebooks felt redundant, PLA and PLB assignments often felt unhelpful\/didn't learn much from them",
                "I think a weakness of the course was how picky the grading was on the EP. Sometimes something as minor as spelling or grammar errors warranted significant points off on the assignments. This was especially painful since the lowest amount to be taken off was 0.5 points which was 5 % of the total score. A strength was how engaged both the TA and the professor were with the students.",
                "This was the first lab course where I felt empowered to carry out my experiments and interpret my results more independently. The course was cumulative in the best way possible, and I enjoyed building on the same techniques throughout the semester. I felt like a pro at reflux and extraction by the end.",
                "Doing the experiments on our own was challenging but really forced us to learn. Having an example lab posted prior was very good as well as the lab description in the course packet. \r\n\r\nIt would be more helpful if there were more ir spectras and melt point tubes",
                "I think Dr. D is fun and interesting to listen to.",
                "The course is very disorganized. The course packet was full of grammatical errors, and many instructions for assignments were unclear. Having the rubrics for assignments would be very helpful. It would also be helpful if the labs were more aligned with class lectures, and if the quizzes corresponded to what we discuss with our lab sections. However, the class was very interesting.",
                "Strengths is that it is WAYYY less stressful in comparison to gen chem lab (no lengthy lab reports) and the course was organized in a straightforward fashion. A weakness was that it was hard to know where you stood at any point in time: although they released scores for every assignment within a week and a half, there was no basis to gauge your performance and this i had no idea of how much time to dedicate to it. I would suggest at least giving broad grade ranges for each letter grade to track progress and allow students to respond accordingly to receive a better grade. But in general, i learned a good amount about the applications of organic chemistry!",
                "Assignments had clear instructions, however, grading depends a lot on how nitpicky your TA is, which is not fun. I appreciated that there were enough assignments so that a single assignment would not ruin your grade, but not too many assignment that the class became overwhelming.",
                "I found it very stressful to have only 7 hours to complete the quizzes, especially because I had a required section for another class that same night. As someone who goes to bed at 10, it was really only 5 hours, an hour of which was taken up by the section, which left enough time but made me very anxious.",
                "strength: a lot of support on how to do the experiments\r\n\r\nweakness: little support on when i had points of confusion on assignments or why I got points taken off.",
                "Reinforces concepts taught in lecture. Lab and lecture material felt much more aligned than in gen chem.",
                "The structure of this course facilitated a great learning environment.",
                "You get as much as you give to this class. The EP's, for example, are easy to do well on but also very easy to do poorly on.",
                "This course has mostly strengths. Having videos of the lab available before actually completing the lab was a great addition to help me be more competent in the actual lab area and the material provided in the course packet was usually the only background necessary for the labs other than safety data sheets for the chemical tables. There are small sections from the lab handbook that clarify and go into more detail about some of the chemistry and setup behind lab procedures (more helpful for post-lab assignments and occasionally quizzes than the lab itself). Other than learning how to compose the chemical tables, the rest of the prelab and lab notes are straightforward and allow you to focus on developing skills in lab. For weaknesses, I found that the helpfulness of the post section questions in the handbook to be variable among my peers and myself for completing the quizzed. EPs were also graded with varying harshness which was somewhat annoying but ultimately not a major detractor since this is made up for in the final grade.",
                "I like this course because it was more chill than gen chem and the staff was very nice.",
                "I think the organization of this course was well-structured. There was more of a focus on learning before and during the lab. I enjoyed the fact that there were fewer stressful and long assignments, and again, was about preparation for each lab so we can apply the proper knowledge while we do tasks. I think this organization is better as compared to general chemistry lab. However, it does not always align with organic chemistry lecture (or the other way around), so there is extra effort needed. Thus, I think this course should be 1 credit instead of 0.5.",
                "Strengths: Dr. DiMeglio is an absolute gem and I would be in this class entirely for her. The labs were fun and I liked having more autonomy than gen chem lab. You become very efficient with a variety of lab skills and this is pretty cool to experience. Weaknesses: the EPs, while helpful, were long and grades often felt arbitrary or entirely focused on the format rather than the content (e.g. you lose many points for a table with a cell that stretches across two pages). While I would understand TAs pointing out these formatting errors so that EPs may be slightly neater, losing points seems harsh and unhelpful for learning the content. I spent 3x the time making sure the formatting was right as I did actually learning material for the lab. Secondly, the quizzes are fast. Like really fast. I don't know why they are. Having slightly more than a minute per question would make these much better.",
                "The labs we did each week built off of each other well and Prof. DiMeglio was very helpful. Even when you make mistakes, the teaching staff are very supportive and good feedback is given for all assignments. There are lab videos that you can watch before each class that are really helpful. I think there could be more transparency with grading beforehand and more equal grading among all the TAs.",
                "Strengths -- The course is quite organized and you know the drill before lab, during lab, and after lab. There is an EP before the lab, lab notebook writing during the lab, and quizzes\/post-lab assignments after the lab. The lab materials are easily accessible and the procedures are easy to understand through the course packet. The course packet was mostly organized and helpful towards the completion of this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- For one, there is no standardization of grading or rubric for EPs and Post-Lab assignments. I am not sure what freedom the TFs are given, but they can essentially cut off points for whatever they assume to be wrong and move on with that. For the EPs, you can be docked points for something you do this week, and then the next week you won't be docked for the same \"issue\", or vice versa. Unless there was an ever-changing rubric throughout the semester, the grading scheme in this class is a big circus. Hence, you can never know what you are doing wrong, or right, or even what the proper way of doing an assignment was in the course. At that point, the only objective assignments that you could rely on are the quizzes and maybe participation? I think Christine should adopt a universal rubric in the course for all assignments to prevent these discrepancies between TAs and between assignments from the same TAs. Additionally, one thing I've come to learn is that this course at least for CHEM 174 is not really tied to the lecture and what you learn in lecture. There are many techniques and concepts you only learn in lab that you don't learn in lecture or vice versa. I don't know if this is a curricular issue that can be fixed by the lab staff, but I thought my engagement was slightly lower because of that.",
                "The course was very well organized. The experimental plans prepared me well for lab day and the post lab assignments were manageable.",
                "I liked how this course had assignments due every week before lab rather than traditional lab reports because that made the work load more manageable than gen chem lab and helped me be prepared going into lab. What I didn't like about this course is how knit-picky the grading was and how it was very inconsistent depending on what TF you had for your section. I felt that some points were counted off for very trivial things which penalized students based off of little mistakes, rather than their actual knowledge. That being said, I liked this lab magnitudes better than 136L (2nd semester gen chem lab, it was truly the worst course I've every taken). Also the instructor was very very sweet.",
                "Strengths: incredible teaching team, classroom environment facilitated actually learning and emphasizing student safety and environmental considerations. All assignments very clearly had an actual purpose and were useful in helping to understand the material.\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "The strengths of this course were the lecture videos, readings, and office hours. Through these offerings I was able to understand concepts better and feel prepared for lab. When I had trouble with some of the lab assignments, office hours were very helpful and allowed to the complete the assignments well.",
                "The strictness of the structure of writing in this class was beyond necessary. Many times, the rules differed between the class instructor and the teaching assistant, causing confusion. It was also tedious following strict templates in general. The instructions were thorough, but I still dislike the level of repetition in this class.",
                "Strengths: Course is well organized and pace is on point. It doesn't feel rushed and the assignments are reasonable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Time for quizzes was too short. I know that the time might be there to prevent students from cheating but I think that it also prevents students from thinking well their answers in the first place.",
                "There seems to be quite a lot of variation with the TA difficulty. Although the course is curved to your specific section only, which standardizes grading, it also means that if you end up with a difficult TA, you will spend a lot more time on this course than your peers. On the other hand, you do end up learning a lot more as well.",
                "The vibes in the lab were so fun, but the grading on the EP assignments was very difficult. I understand being strict about course material, but it felt inconsistent. I would receive points off one week for doing the same exact thing that I got full credit for last week.",
                "I liked the build up of this class. Professor DiMeglio structured this class in one of the best ways to facilitate student learning in lab. She slowly eased us into more challenging labs and helped us gain confidence in our skills and abilities although at times, some of the experiments felt repetitive. I appreciated the slow dive into actual synthesis and reaction labs because it helped me understand what we were actually doing. I enjoyed this lab class a lot more than gen chem lab, and honestly would take this class again.",
                "I loved how there weren't any post labs and how we had to write the procedures on my own. I loved how the quizzes were online so you could take them at your leisure.",
                "This course is fun in the lab, but the experimental procedure assignments were confusing as to how to be highly scored.",
                "The EPs took 4-6 hours every week and the PLAs were another 6-10. This seems like an excessive amount of work for a half credit course. Not to mention the labs were another 4 hours.",
                "The strengths were definitely the independence of the lab work and Christine. The EPs were also good in planning. I would say that a weakness was that the TFs didn't seem to have a unified standard\/rubric to grade amongst them, which seemed to punish collaboration even though it was encouraged.",
                "I liked this class overall I think it was a lot of work but it was all very doable if you prioritize it and attend office hours. The weakness is being in the lab made me sad but thats just me personally. I loved my TF and labmates.",
                "The strengths were the lab material and the TA. My TA was very helpful and always available when I had any questions with the procedure. Also, the lab environment was great as there was no competitiveness or pressure to make excellent product as everyone makes mistakes. The lab material also improved my knowledge of organic chemistry as a whole. To improve, I wish the lab quizzes would open at 1pm when my lab started, so I could finish my lab and take the quiz right away. There were awkward periods sometimes where I would be done with lab, but I had to wait an hour to be completely done, which messed up my work flow.",
                "Strengths of this course include the TA and course packet being very informative in what and why we are doing a specific lab. By gaining this help, I was able to understand organic chemistry and lab techniques better as the course progressed. One weakness is the biweekly quizzes, which sometimes felt like they were a difficult application of what we were learning; however, these quizzes became easier as I learned more about this course. However, another weakness was the harsh grading of the PLA, which could be fixed if students had asked their TAs for help and assistance on their PLA.",
                "Honestly I think this course has very few weaknesses! First chem lab taken at Yale where I didn't feel incredible amounts of stress to perform well. And Dr. D is a lovely professor and the kindest ever!",
                "Strengths: very-well organized (assignments were uploaded to Canvas in a timely manner and no issues with submitting assignments every week), TFs were very attentive to student needs and questions.\r\nWeaknesses: none.",
                "This is a well organized course. My teaching fellow was very good at explaining things and Professor DiMeglio's videos that we watched before lab were also very helpful to my learning. The timed quizzes felt very rushed, although I recognize the importance of having so little time to complete them in order to see how well we truly understand the material.",
                "This course was one of the few classes I took this semester that could be applied for future research experience. Especially for this interested in working at a lab, this course taught the required necessities in entering a lab. There was a wide variety in techniques we learned in one semester and bringing techniques together in the end was exciting. In the beginning first few weeks, I think there should be a leniency in grading the experimental procedures and quizzes for those, especially the first-years, who have never had experience with doing such things.",
                "Great course.",
                "I loved all the experiments but wish there had been a bit more standardization across what information our TFs reviewed before quizzes.",
                "I enjoyed this course a lot. The experiments were interesting and connected to what we were learning in class.",
                "The course is extremely well organized (evident from the course packet!) and Dr. DiMeglio is very on top of things and wants to help each student succeed and have a positive experience in the lab. The labs were engaging and well-structured, and the pre-recorded videos were very helpful. However, because most of the labs are focused on particular techniques and building a foundation for more complex, real-world experiments, the course doesnt complement the lecture course particularly well  the only exception to this was the SN1 and SN2 synthesis experiments. The EPs were time consuming and graded harshly. Your experience in the course can be quite dependent on your TA.",
                "The course explains topics related to the experiment very well and helped me practice and build off on a good amount of lab techniques. The course quizzes should have more time because I always felt very rushed even though I had prepared for them with the practice questions.",
                "Strengths: good introduction to many different lab techniques, tries to provide the theoretical background to experiments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it can feel a bit messy at times, experiences vary widely depending on TA.",
                "The course was very well described and the team was very helpful. I felt like I was always supported throughout, and the experimental procedures made sense. The grading was a little harsh at times though.",
                "Strengths: Very manageable workload which made my engagement with the course increase and I felt very comfortable reaching out to faculty for help\r\nWeakness: Would've liked to expand the research experiments (done more abstract\/thought out experiments). Most of the experiments felt slightly redundant.",
                "Strengths: learned how to use lab equipment really well \/ got a lot of practice, ensured we knew what was happening as well as what to do, feel a lot more confident around a lab now, fun experiments\r\nWeaknesses: grading was a bit stressful",
                "This class was very well structured in the sense that each lab was built on top of the previous one. As someone with practically zero experience in a lab setting, all of the lab equipment and vocabulary that once seemed intimidating became familiar by the end of the semester. The only thing I would change about this course is the course packet that was provided because it sometimes contained mistakes and was not well-organized.",
                "The course packet was very helpful in clearly delineating what we were going to do in each week's lab. The assignments due before our lab time were helpful in preparing us for the labs. However, standards for grading (especially for the prelab assignments) could be more clearly specified. Additionally, it would be helpful if we could go over (either in the course packet or during lab) more of the material that appears on the quizzes, especially since some of it we may not have learned yet in lecture.",
                "Overall, the course was really enjoyable, however there were some weeks where we often repeated techniques and procedures done in previous weeks, making it those weeks less interesting.",
                "I think that the grading for this course was a bit harsh and did not quite reflect the actual quality of the work but instead weighed heavily on minor errors and typos.",
                "This course was very interesting and I loved the experiments but I wish the grading system was synchronized for all TFs. I was constantly worried about my grader because of the harsh grading on the pre lab assignments and found myself worrying more about that than enjoying the experiments. I also wish there was more time given for the quizzes because that was the main reason I didn't do as well as I liked was the short time given.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it teaches valuable lab techniques that apply for the lecture course."

It's a great course for anyone who is interested in lab experience, as it focuses on teaching without time-consuming assignments that take away from learning. It was overall a really positive environment that fostered learning and collaboration, and I genuinely enjoyed coming to lab each week!",
                "No, unless you have to. It was not an enjoyable experience outside of the lab sessions.",

Although the effort one must put into the course feels like it should garner more than just 0.5 credits, one walks out with a much clearer sense of how far their practical competency has progressed and how far it still has to go. That sense of accomplishment and perspective is quite refreshing and different from any other class I had this semester.",
                "For a student interested in learning important lab procedures, this course is a solid choice.",
                "If you need it or you like chem lab.",
                "Although I acknowledge the course has some flaws, I would recommend this course to other students. For those in a chem\/bio major, it's great to get into the lab with a lot of support. You learn a lot in this class though the learning curve is quite steep. I do want to mention for those whoa re considering taking it, I don't think it is quite a 0.5 credit class.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who need to take it. There are pre reqs for this class that you must have met. You do have to work hard to learn and do well in this class.",
                "Yes! The labs were super fun.",
                "Although it can be tough at times, I would definitely recommend this class to other students, particularly for those with an interest in Chemistry. For me, it was my first real chemistry lab experience and it was exciting to finally be able to use the equipment and perform the syntheses I had learned about before.",
                "Yes, please take this course with Christine DiMeglio.",
                "I only took this course because it is a prerequisite of my major, and I'm sure the same can be said of almost everyone else enrolled in it. This was not a fun class; I was stressed and worried about my grade most of the time. However, of all the prerequisites, this one is certainly not the worst. If you don't need to take it, don't. But, if you do, there's no need to dread it.",
                "I didn't personally find it very engaging, I often just did the work to do it well as opposed to being interested in it",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class. I believe that it was not too difficult and a really good supplement to the Organic Chemistry I lecture.",
                "I would recommend this course as a companion to the lecture course. They go well together, especially when it comes to synthesis and reaction pathways.",
                "Yes. There are days when you just want to get out of lab and never come back but I think its a good learning experience",
                "If required for major",
                "I would only recommend this course to a student who intends to major in chemistry or to go into medicine.",
                "yes if they are interested in chemistry and possibly working in a lab",
                "The only reason people would take this course is because it is a co-requisite or pre-med\/chem major requisite so regardless you have to take it for some reason outside of pure enjoyment. Im pretty indifferent to the course, it did its job and requires more work than a 0.5 credit course which is typical of chem labs.",
                "I would encourage them to take it if they are worried about it being like the gen chem labs. I really struggled with those, but I liked this course.",
                "Only if you have to for your major",
                "Yes! The TAs are super helpful and genuinely want you to understand the principles of organic chemistry. Definitely go to office hours!",
                "Yes, if they are taking organic chemistry lecture.",
                "I guess. Only if you need it though.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone that thinks they may want to take it. The idea of this lab may seem daunting, but I actually found it easier compared to the requirements for pre-labs and lab writeups in my AP Chem class in high school (although I understand this is a very subjective experience). This is coming from a first-year student that had not had any formal lab experience in the past. The information needed for pre-lab preparations are all laid out clearly and there are additional videos that can clarify anything from the procedure in the handbook. I also found the pre-labs (EPs) and during lab note-taking to be much more relaxed than expectation, and there were only two semi-cumulative post-lab assignments total, which were not bad at all. The TAs and lab assistants were all very helpful and care about your time (These labs most certainly do not take 4 hours and with one exception you can be done at around 3:30).",
                "Yes, especially taken simultaneously with organic chemistry lecture.",
                "I can't imagine many people are taking this course for fun, but given that you have to take it, it's overall not too difficult, you learn a bunch, and you get to do some really cool labs.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are taking organic chemistry. It's a good introduction to labwork for anyone considering chemistry research.",
                "Only if required by your major or pre-med! It can be enjoyable if you really like chemistry, but, in my experience, most people were competing to get out of lab as early as possible. The lab contains nothing enlightening.",
                "I would recommend it if it is part of a requirement or if you want to learn more chemistry lab techniques!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student that is required to take it. Other than that, for half a credit, I don't think taking this course is very worth it.",
                "Yes - if you need to take this class, you will definitely enjoy it!",
                "Yes, this lab course is one of the best Ive taken so far. The course load reflected the credit offering and we were provided the resources to do well in the course.",
                "If you want to take it for fun or for curiosity, you might not want to take it. This is not a bad course but as any lab course, it gets repetitive and boring. Although it is a good course.",
                "If you are looking to take a chemistry lab, I would recommend this lab before either general chemistry labs. The experiments and techniques were much more interesting and the energy in the lab was much more lighthearted.",
                "I would recommend this class because it's a great lab course, especially following gen chem. Orgo is very difficult, but this lab course and the TFs for lab also helped us better understand the content being taught in Orgo. For premeds and chem majors this is a required course, but even more than that, I truly enjoyed this lab class.",
                "Yes, I think it's a great way to learn how to be in a lab.",
                "To anyone who needs this course as a requirement, or is interested in exploring laboratory applications of organic chemistry - yes, I would reccommend.",
                "No, the workload is not worth the credit.",
                "Yes! It was much better than 136L in terms of workload and stress, and you get to learn much more.",
                "Not unless you need it for your major. If you do take it attend office hours with your TF, it makes all the difference.",
                "Yes, if there is a need to take organic chemistry lab, do not hesitate and take this course. It is a great way to prepare for future research.",
                "I would recommend this course because this course is the perfect environment for learning organic chemistry and lab techniques comfortably. Despite the initial intimidation of this course, Dr. DiMeglio, the lab instructors, and TFs made this course more fun and engaging that I had thought initially - especially as orgo is always thought of as incredibly difficult.",
                "It was a good lab, but only take it if you need it for premed or your major.",
                "Yes! I absolutely enjoyed this course, I learned a lot, and the workload was very much manageable.",
                "Yes. It's beautiful to watch crystals form because you made them form, or to synthesize something and create something entirely different from a starting material.",
                "Yes, if you are looking to do research in the future or if you are concurrently taking the organic chemistry lecture.",
                "Yes, if needed.",
                "yes, it's fun.",
                "Yes!  Dr. DiMeglio is so wonderful and makes the course very fun and engaging.",
                "Probably not unless its required. Like for most lab courses, the workload is definitely more than what would be expected for a half-credit course. The EPs were quite tedious and involved a lot of busy work  make sure you start them early since they can be time consuming. Depending on your TA, they can be harshly graded, with points deducted for small formatting errors. However, especially if this is your first college lab course, you will learn a lot and build confidence in a lab setting. I enjoyed the last few labs, which were complete synthesis experiments rather than just practicing techniques. Labs almost never took the full four hours.",
                "I would only recommend this course if a student thinks they need it for their major or to learn the content. It is not bad, but I think it will feel grueling and unhelpful if you are taking it just for you.",
                "If you have to take it, I would recommend it, but not otherwise. The class is a large time commitment for the day before and of your lab, and the grading is very harsh at times. But if you need to take it, it is a good experience.",
                "I wouldn't recommend unless you need to. This course requires effort and unless you're a STEM major or pre-med it isn't entirely necessary.",
                "Yes, just be prepared for a lot of work for a 0.5 credit class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they wanted lab experience.",
                "Dr. DiMeglio is great, so I definitely recommend taking it with her if you need to take orgo lab.",
                "I would only recommend this course to students interested in either majoring in the life sciences or interested in getting involved with chemistry labs at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course because it accomplished the goal of teaching us fundamental lab techniques in chemistry.",
                "Only if you need the lab credit.",
                "I would recommend this course to premedical students as it is a requirement."
