                "I learned how to read closely and write focused, detailed papers on the topics we learned about. My comparative analysis improved so much and I feel much more comfortable going into upper level English courses at Yale. In terms of content, we covered such a great spectrum of writers and thinkers over the semester and I really loved the materials that were selected for the course.",
                "Many!! I felt like I learned about the major philosophical camps in the Harlem Renaissance, as well as the artistic breakthroughs. I learned how the Harlem Renaissance still influences artistic work today and got the chance to visit the archives to explore old texts. 10/10!!",
                "I developed a lot of knowledge on Harlem Renaissance writers, artists, and figures that I had not previously learned much about. I also develpped skills to compare scholarly essays and tie older scholarly work into the climate of Black art today.",
                "This course teaches you the literary, academic, and artistic cultural production of the early 20th century New Negro Renaissance. We learn about the period's major figures through the context of their ideas, works, personal histories, and contemporaries.",
                "I got a fairly comprehensive understanding of tart from the lens of the Harlem renaissance.",
                "Ability to engage in discussions with other students and write extensively.",
                "Professor Berry challenged me as a writer through the whole course. When I thought I wrote an amazing paper, professor Berry pointed out things that I could do better. Due to this, I think the best piece of work Ive ever done was this last paper.",
                "In this course we put the stewards of the Harlem Renaissance in conversation with the stewards of our present. I learned to scrutinize mortality and legacy, appreciate the folkloric tradition of Black musicians, artists, mothers and storytellers, observe the devoted pillar of multi-generational Black collectivism and so much more. I will hold the works of Hurston, Bonner, Hemphill, Solange, Cullen, Grimke and other powerhouses close for many years to come."

                "This course is definitely demanding but I felt it was really really strong. The syllabus and course format are very well organized and provided a detailed overview of the Harlem Renaissance and modern art movements. I think some of our discussions were more fruitful than others, so maybe mid-class breaks into small groups or just general exercises that get everyone talking would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Berry's fantastic syllabus, which is chock-full of great old texts, carefully chosen complementary new ones, and a robust selection of artistic works from sculpture and music to movies and plays. Often professors will include one or two multimedia elements, but Berry incorporates many, and all of them are useful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This was Professor Berry's first year teaching this course. One of the only places where this showed was that she was a little shy to lead discussion. She could have guided it more. I'd recommend asking students not to be on their laptops, and maybe having a little section at the end of class to summarize the day's discussion and emphasize some takeaways. The other weakness is that while the syllabus was very creative, the assignments were relatively introductory English-level assignments. This works for an intro English class, but it might have more widespread appeal to vary the assignments more.",
                "Strengths: Readings were all interesting, papers were well structured and clear, in class discussion was for the most part really rich and engaging, class environment was friendly and not stressful, Prof Berry did a great job of giving us takeaways that apply to life now which made the content feel super relevant and important; another strength was the class presentation assignment, kept students engaged and was super interesting to both present and watch\r\n\r\nweaknesses: some of the longer readings got a little dense and were hard to get through, discussion sometimes took a while to pick up\r\n\r\nhow it could be improved: If a text is pretty dense, having a lower page count is helpful because you can spend more time understanding and unpacking; specific discussion questions or small group exercises could help the discussion get going faster",
                "The course was a great seminar environment.",
                "I wish I had more thoughts on this. I think professor Berry did an amazing job with this course and making all of our class schedules. The readings truly pushed us through years of black history.",
                "Strengths: captivating readings, multimedia assignments, intimate seminar setting, supportive and engaging class atmosphere\r\nWeaknesses: potential for more guided class discussion, room for more structural essay feedback"

                "Yes! I think Prof. Berry was an amazing professor and the course material is among some of the most interesting that I have studied at Yale. The Harlem Renaissance is interesting to study on its own, but Prof. Berry takes it one step further by comparing it to present day movements. I think the class is so well structured and was one of my favorites this semester! It's a lot of reading, and three papers, but if you're interested in literature/ER&M/music/the arts in any way, definitely take it.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this class to another student. The Harlem Renaissance is a crucial time to learn about and it has its hands in many other artistic and intellectual movements / fields. Professor Berry's class is great for people with barely any knowledge of the time period and for more experienced students because it is robust, but clear. The only stipulation I have is that the assignments in this class are, for the most part, basic first or second level English assignments. It is the roughly same model as you will find in American Literature or World Literature: one short analytical paper, one longer analytical paper, one long research paper. For this reason I recommend taking it in freshman or sophomore year, or if you do not have a ton of English experience.",
                "Yes. I think it is good for both students who are not super familiar with the Harlem Renaissance and for students who have a prior interest, because it focused on some foundational texts as well as pulling in relevant work from other time periods or work that was less central to the movement but reflects the mentality/life of the time in a really cool way",
                "Yes, If you are interested in tracing the influences of early major artistic movements like the New Negro Renaissance on later Black artistic movements, this course will draw your interest.",
                "Yes! The information I learned is foundational for understanding an artist renaissance whether Black or not!",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. If anyone is interested in black history, this is the class to take.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who is eager to reckon with the questions of renaissance, Blackness, Black art, Black femininity, Black queer identity, folk tradition, oral tradition & so many others facets of quotidian life for Black America in the last century. It is a class that distinctly cares as much about the past bleeding into the present as the present bleeding into the past."
