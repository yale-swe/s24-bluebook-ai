I was exposed to a diversity of perspectives that allowed me to appreciate the complexity of our place in the environment. I learned how to write with more clarity and grew more comfortable with structuring essays.",

Also, I refined my analytical writing skills by learning how to craft written arguments of various forms and lengths."

                "Very in depth and good course",
                "Strengths: fascinating readings, detailed feedback from Professor Hill\r\nWeaknesses: class discussions were a bit slow at times\r\n\r\nImprovements: I think our class discussions could have been improved if we had just a few more people. I think that watching more films would have added an interesting element to the course.",
                "This course could be improved through different types of engagement techniques in class.",
                "Strengths: Anna Hill is an amazing professor with a true passion for the subject of environmental memory. The selection of texts is fantastic and includes many genres: scholarly articles, first-person narratives, graphic novels, films, book chapters, etc., so there is something for everyone with an interest in the environment. There are ample opportunities to compare, contrast, and reconcile Indigenous perspectives with Western ones; a particular emphasis is given to how to read multiple texts in conversation with one another. The visit to the Yale Art Gallery and the New Haven walking tour were particular highlights. A particular strength is that the longest paper is due well before finals, leaving a more creative final project for the end of the semester which gives a great break from studying for other courses.\r\nWeaknesses: Not many! Because many weeks' readings did not directly relate to any written assignment or assessment, it was clear that some students did not do all the readings, making for somewhat stagnant class discussions. Often, discussions took the form of Anna asking a question and responding to each student's response rather than a more natural seminar discussion."

                "YES! English 114 is organized to facilitate significant improvement in students' writing skills, and the 8-10 page research paper is a satisfying climax of this process where you are given the freedom to research any topic you wish that is related to the course. This section, Environmental Memory with Anna Hill, provided an amazing introduction to the field of environmental humanities and taught us many new ways of thinking about the environment. From the concept of wilderness to different perspectives on the Anthropocene, each reading complemented the others in a critical, constructive, and always fascinating manner."
