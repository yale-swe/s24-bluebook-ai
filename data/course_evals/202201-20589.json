I took this as a graduating senior and Im so glad I did, it changed the way I think about curiosity and wonder and being a person",

I did like the final project and I think I developed a deeper understanding of wonder, but I don't think Prof. Keil's teaching style fit with how I learn best. It is an interesting topic and I liked the class overall, but seminar discussions were not what I would have expected."
