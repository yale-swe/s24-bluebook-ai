Also modifying biomaterial surfaces.",

                "I honestly think that the course was perfect - there were tons of real life case studies, most of which Professor Kyriakides had first hand knowledge about and which made the class super interesting, the papers mentioned were explained in detail so they made sense, and overall the subject matter was very interesting.",
                "I think the only weakness of this course is low levels of student participation and the practice exams arent recalibrated to match the actual exams so they are sort of useless.",
                "Professor is very engaging",
                "This course is well organized and clearly lets the student know what information they are accountable for.",
                "We discussed a few basic translations of the material we learned to clinical applications / current medical devices (the glucose sensing example was quite interesting) but it would have been nice to examine additional examples in more detail.",
                "strengths: the format (open book / note) of exams was really nice as it better reflects understanding of the material presented rather then how well someone can memorize something. Prof Kyriakides was also really knowledgeable about the material presented and took the time to clarify concepts or paper findings if anyone had a question. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: some of the exam questions were oddly specific and in some cases referenced portions of readings not discussed in class. while these readings were assigned and we had access to them, it was a bit difficult to figure out what exactly some questions were referring to as we didn't cover said content in lecture. Additionally, the writing assignments were a little odd; they were not difficult, but did not offer much to enhance learning of concepts in class.",
                "A lot of the class centered around being taught what was done in different papers. Interesting, but would have learned more focusing on some broader concepts and then using the papers as examples rather than the lectures explaining the papers.",

                "Most definitely - the individual papers were fun to write since we were given the freedom to choose what device we wanted. The exam questions very clearly mimicked the content of the lectures so there wasn't any guesswork. The questions were also framed in a way to assess whether we understood the content, not whether or not we could apply the material, which was really nice since there was so much brand new information I'd never heard before.",

The class was overall very interesting and it was cool to learn how the body reacts to various biomedical implants as well as how we can engineer materials to counteract or promote life processes. the exams were not unfairly difficult and the teaching staff was very responsive and helpful.",
