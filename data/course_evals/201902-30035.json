    "Harder problem solving. How to tackle a question you don't immediately know the answer to, starting by working backwards.",
    "Topics in second-level organic chemistry - many reactions, molecular orbitals, etc.",
    "Learned a lot about second semester organic chemistry reactions.",
    "I learned how to conceptually understand the reactivities of different compounds and rationalize the favorability of reactions. I also learned a lot of different organic syntheses and mechanisms that provided me with the toolbox to understand how to synthesize complex products from simpler starting materials. This course covered Chapters 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 in the Loudon Organic Chemistry textbook  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Reactions of Conjugated Systems, Reactions of aromatic compounds (allyl and phenyl), Reactions of vinyl and aryl compounds, Reactions of aldehydes and ketones and their derivatives, Reactions of carboxylic acids, Reactions of carboxylic acid derivatives, Reactions of enols and alpha-beta unsaturated compounds and Reactions of amines.",
    "I learned how to use material we learned in lecture and apply it to new problems."

   "comments": [
    "The content was presented in a straight forward fashion. The questions on the exam were in my opinion harder than the ones assigned in the textbook and problem solving sessions.",
    "Weaknesses: too rushed, classes almost always ran over time, felt disjointed\r\nStrengths: teaches a great deal of content",
    "Dr. Parr was a good instructor who taught well. We did move fast but it there was a lot of material to get through in a short amount of time.",
    "I found it challenging to keep up with the pace of the course, but I had expected this due to the sheer pace of a Orgo II class that covers all the material in 5 weeks. I think Dr. Parr did a great job providing us with a strong understanding of the material in such a short period of time. I also appreciated how available he was throughout the summer to answer all of our questions.",
    "Dr. Parr did not put a lot of effort into preparing for lecture, which made the lectures hard to follow and disorganized."

    "I appreciated the amount of material we were able to cover in a short amount of time. It felt like a successful crash course.",
    "I'd recommend to a student who needs to fulfill a requirement",
    "Yes if you want to get a deeper understanding of organic chemistry.",
    "I highly recommend taking organic chemistry II with Dr. Parr over the summer. It is a smaller class that allows for more personal attention during office hours.",
    "No, taking organic 2 in the summer was extremely stressful."
