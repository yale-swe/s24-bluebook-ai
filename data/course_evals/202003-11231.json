                "This course seemed all over the place at times, but if you're interested in neuroscience and psychology then those were interesting places to be.",
                "This course was fantastic and everything was done to make it as good as it could be for being virtual. The strengths were that the important points were continuously driven home, and the implications for findings were always brought into the picture. I can't really see any weaknesses, it is really a fantastic course.",
                "I thought the course was really interesting and I enjoyed all of the papers we reviewed. The exams are very manageable if you review the content, but the course overall has such a low number of points that single questions wrong have a significant impact on your course grade.",
                "My main challenge in this course was the wording of the syllabus. It was really confusing to have things written out as due \"48 hours before they will be discussed in lecture.\" It also sort of hurt to be told to read the syllabus carefully when I had read every word but it was just set up totally different than other classes. I've never had such confusion about when to turn things in or what to cover in an assignment for since I've been in college so I don't think I'm totally to blame.\r\n\r\nThat being said, what we were expected to know for exams was really clear and Prof Casey is one of the best professors I've ever had when it comes to making complex information really clear and understandable. I also think she was very fair with what she put on exams. What was emphasized in class was what was also important on the exams. Also, she was very very nice about the difficulties of online learning.\r\n\r\nAlso, the debate project is a definite strength. It was really fun and a cool way to summarize everything we learned before the exam.",
                "I liked how the exams drew from the lectures, but not *directly* from the lectures and allowed us to think a bit. The class was a LOT of repetition. And I mean a lot--I kept track of time once, and forty minutes into the class we were still reviewing what we did the previous class, and it wasn't even a review day. Therefore, I think the course could benefit from a little more content (although I understand research in this field is quite new).",
                "If you are looking for an easy class, this is definitely a good call. Professor Casey is very understanding of our demands and we honestly got pampered a good amount this semester. The lectures were fun and overall I would recommend taking.",
                "The course material was consistently interesting and fresh, and I appreciated that Professor Casey would highlight and reiterate key points from each lecture. The course assignments enhanced my understanding of key concepts in class, and the availability of lecture slides and pdf files of the readings made navigating the course rather simple. In terms of improvement, the clarity of test questions could be improved, though significant improvement was observed from the beginning to the end of the course. I also feel that some test questions focused on verbatim facts from the lecture slides rather than on applications of the information that we had learned, and it may be helpful to incorporate more application-based questions to test conceptual understanding.",
                "The professor is incredible & super engaging. Debate was very interesting and helped me learn more about the information. No weaknesses.",
                "I thought the lectures and slides were very engaging and easy to follow. I was anxious about grades because each point from an exam or reading response would account for 1% of the final grade. So each point lost carried a lot of weight.",
                "content was well organized and lectures were grounded in empirical studies; requirements for some of the assignments e.g. concept map were very vague, so i did not understand exactly what was expected unless i went to office hours",
                "The organization of the course sometimes made it difficult to understand its relation to the bigger picture. Teaching fear all together rather than separate may help with understanding and developing deeper understanding. Some assignments like the map seemed arbitrarily graded. Also one point = one grade percentage is something I disliked. Additionally, the odd hour deadline (turning something in two days before the stated deadline) was confusing.",
                "Strengths: the material is interesting and diverse, there are a lot of different angles to cover the issues through and Prof Casey does a good job of presenting them all.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the assignments did not relate to the material deeply, they were mostly summarizing high-level concepts from the course.",
                "I liked the in-person lectures as well as the slides, but I think the rubrics for all of the assignments were way too vague and caused them to be much more difficult than they were meant to be.",

                "Very repetitive from other courses",
                "Professor is obviously very knowledgable and gave interesting lectures. The assignments were not as good; the professor obviously enjoys creativity and asked us to draw for one and to come up with a theme for a debate in another. In my opinion, there's no room for drawing in a college level course and the debate would have been better done in a more rigorous fashion. The professor also didn't clarify the expectations for the first reading response until after it was due, and even then, I felt they were unclear. \r\n\r\nExams were fine, multiple choice, open note, and thus pretty easy, plus the professor was a lenient grader. Still, she does try to \"trick you\" on the wording of the questions in a way I didn't think accurately reflected knowledge on the first exam.",
                "I really loved this course. The topics were interesting and I learned a lot. Some questions on future exams could be worded more clearly, but otherwise it was very well taught and engaging throughout.",
                "I think the strengths were the assignments that were not the traditional test or paper (like the debate and the concept map). They gave you the chance to think creatively and differently while putting your knowledge to the test. Plus they were lots of fun! Professor Casey is also clearly a master of the material and effortlessly guides the course. \r\n\r\nI did wish however that the course wasn't at 9am (recorded lectures helped a lot) and wished the reviews were also recorded. I also wish there could have been a little more flexibility for a few friends of mine in different time zones in terms of when the test could be taken.",
                "This course was was geared toward student learning. Each lecture was well organized and the progression of topics was logical and engaging.

                "It was great that the lectures were posted in recorded versions. Additionally, Professor Casey was great about communication about limitations of the virtual setup and how to overcome them, and keeping up with how the class was doing.",
                "I really, really think the syllabus needs a serious update. Deadlines need to be laid out clearly because asking for something to be turned in 48 hours before a certain time is just asking for confusion, and is also really challenging when class is at 9 am and so all the deadlines are 9 am. Also, for reading responses, the syllabus has in bold for each week whether a response can be done for that content, which is SO confusing because it seems like that would mean that's a week that you CAN turn a response in for content that will be covered next week in order to be 48 hours ahead.\r\n\r\nOther than that, Professor Casey made it really easy to access all recorded lectures. I got really sick in the middle of the semester and was fatigued so it was really so nice to be able to sleep in and watch the videos later when I had more energy. That flexibility was perfect for this semester and made my life much easier, and also kept me from getting sicker by having to wake up early and not rest.",
                "I did not feel the urge\/need to participate in class as I did in other classes. Overall, it was very passive--I would have gained the same amount from going to live lecture versus watching recorded lectures later. However, I did appreciate that the class was short, since Zoom fatigue is very real and it kept me from going crazy.",
                "The live virtual lectures were a blessing. Course engagement is often diminished by a fully asynchronous format, so I appreciate the opportunity to meet with Professor Casey and my classmates twice each week. I would have liked to see more opportunities for discussion and Q&A in the course; though this would usually take place before, during, and after lectures in person, creating office hours or one-on-one meetings with Professor Casey would be an apt virtual substitute in addition to the small amounts of Q&A that we had during our live virtual lectures.",

                "live recorded lectures worked well; the debate at the end of the term was especially fun as people were creative with how to convey all that we learned through the semester through an online means",

                "It felt personal even though it was a virtual lecture, and I still learned a lot, so I think everything worked well.",
                "Not engaging, the aspects that were not just lecture slides , like the debate , seemed forced and slightly juvenile",
                "It was good to have opportunities for Q&A before and after the lectures. Also, broth Professor Casey and May (TA) were quick to respond to questions by email. The format of the open-book exams was well adapted to learning during Covid-19 because it meant the class remained fairly graded for all students and we still learned a lot.",
                "I loved that the lectures were recorded. It's the only reason I was able to take the class (because I know myself well enough to otherwise not take a 9am course due to my night owl nature). \r\n\r\nI do wish panpoto was used however so that the caption function could be implemented.",
                "I think the live lectures and recordings of them worked very well. This seemed like the best possible situation considering that we could not be live and in person. The only thing that I could think of that could be improved would be more opportunities for discussions between students--discussions that would happen before or after class.",
                "Virtual lectures always ran smoothly. Minor difficulties with Zoom breakout rooms at times, but other than that classes went very well.",
                "It was good",
                "I thought everything worked well and that I was able to learn well.",
                "I thought the lectures were amazing, and I liked the diversity of assignments"

                "absolutely! amazing to be able to learn from the leading expert in the field herself!",
                "Yes, as a political science major who needed a second science credit to graduate, I highly recommend this course. The course says that you need a prereq, but the class was extremely manageable without those prereqs. Also, Prof Casey and TA May were super helpful outside of class with clarifying assignments or readings. I do think that the recorded lectures really helped in being successful with exams.",
                "I would definitely recommend to anyone! I'm not the most comfortable with neuroscience, and if you feel the same way, don't let that stop you. The way this class is taught, I became so much more comfortable than I expected with the material. Dr. Casey is a great professor!",
                "If you're interested, take it. Professor Casey was a little disorganized but if you're looking for a casual class this is a fun one.",
                "Absolutely, this is a fantastic course. The psych, cognitive mechanisms, and real-world behavior\/ applications all come together in this course. If you are interested in psych\/ neuroscience\/ psych and the law\/ development, this is a fantastic course. Would definitely recommend.",
                "I would recommend this course as the content is super interesting and the course is not super intensive. Take it if you are genuinely interested though, as it'll be boring if you don't care about the information",
                "It depends. I think I didn't have the best experience with this class (mainly because of the syllabus organization) but I did have a great experience with Professor Casey. I would tell people that if they try they will do well in this class because it's really fair and organized. You come out of this class with really specific pieces of knowledge, which is the result of the course being clear. However, I didn't connect much with the TA and sometimes felt that I was bothering her by asking for help and just felt disliked in general, which I think made me feel differently about the class. I would say that someone should assess the TA and be sure it's someone they'll be comfortable with or plan to avoid office hours, and to be really really persistent in checking on their due dates since I had so much confusion with the syllabus.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you need a relatively easy class for a major requirement. Wouldn't particularly recommend it for a neuroscience major--it's probably better geared towards psych majors.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in developmental neuroscience and psychology. The level of one's engagement with the course varies from individual to individual; the most enriching experience arises from reading the papers critically, participating actively in lectures, and putting a solid effort into all of the assignments. If a student progresses through the course in this way, the experience is highly rewarding! Professor Casey does a wonderful job, and she explores a breadth of topics in an appropriate level of detail (not too little, and not too much) with great interest and knowledge.",
                "Yes!!",
                "Yes, an amazing class and super interesting content.",
                "yes--material is not too hard to understand and readings were interesting (no worries if you have trouble understanding on your own as Prof. Casey does a good job covering all the key points in lecture). assignments were not too time consuming and does help reinforce what we learned in class.",
                "Probably not unless you have few choices. If you're a neuro major looking for electives, there are easier and more engaging courses to take.",
                "Yes, if they took the Human Brain and liked it and want to learn more about the brain itself. Not if they are only interested in policy.",
                "Absolutely",
                "No. Received poor grades with few comments and not much opportunity to learn and improve. There also was not much material that wasnt pure regurgitation, but I suppose this is the nature of most psychology courses",
                "Yes. Even though I took it as one of my natural science requirements for the psychology major, it will probably end up being one of my favorite overall psychology classes at Yale. It was really interesting and was challenging in a way that was not overwhelming or unmanageable.",
                "Yes. The professor is wonderful and you learn a lot. This makes you curious about teens in all other psych classes I will ever take. It has made me think more critically about other coursework and has made me a better psych major.",
                "Yes!! Professor Casey is amazing. The material is so interesting and gives great insights to extremely relevant topics. There are also a wide variety of assignments that cater to all types of learning, so the class and assignments never got monotonous and helped me expand my way of thinking and learning.",
                "Absolutely! Would be more challenging for folks who haven't taken PSYC 160 (Human Brain), but it is very interesting material whether you are a psych major or not. The way the grading\/point system is set up leaves little room for error (1 question on an exam = 1 percentage point for the whole course), but grading was generally lenient and the teaching team was fantastic.",
                "Yes, very interesting",
                "Yes. I enjoyed the course and the exams were straightforward. Professor Casey was very engaging and easy to talk to.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class! It was not too time consuming, but was very rewarding and I looked forward to going to class. Professor Casey is such an expert in her field and is a great professor. I would take the class for her alone! I felt like the genuinely cared for us as students and as people, which I really appreciated.\r\n\r\n The material is also very interesting and I think important if you want to learn a bit about what affects a developing brain",
