                "I gained skills in analyzing primary sources, evaluating the validity of authors' arguments, contributing effectively to academic discussions, producing an analytical argument, and much more. I was able to learn much more and deeply about U.S. National identify because of it being a seminar compared to a lecture. The lecturer did a fantastic job of aiding the conversation and providing clarification when need and prompting when effective.",
                "My perception of American History, specifically about issues of race and culture, was changed quite a bit during this course. One of the key points in this class is that American History does not follow linear progress like we are typically lead to believe. There are progressions and regressions, and analyzing them is very useful for understanding who fits into the term \"American.\" There were also a few historical events that I had never heard of that we learned about in depth in this class.",
                "This course was my favorite of my semester. I am better able to question historical narratives, read/analyze primary sources, and participate in group discussions. The feedback that we receive is very thoughtful and constructive. This was my most difficult class (grade-wise), and I was seriously challenged in discussions -- but this was for the best, because I am a more capable student now.",
                "A skill that was emphasized throughout the semester was to see contingency in American history. In this course, I have a much better understanding and eye for the influence and impact of certain events on history, but also not seeing history as something that is directly linear because there are also many narratives that are excluded from what is generally taught. I really appreciated the variety of sources we read because it provided insights on not only the events, but the thinking behind them, that fostered the ability to see change and contingency. I also think I am a stronger listener and writer after this course. In the seminar format, I was able to learn greatly from ideas my peers shared, which let me learn from them and their experiences. As I writer, I feel that I am more confident in connecting events and arguing where narratives differ after our discussions in class, readings, and written assignments.",
                "In this class, I learned how to listen in a way that I had not before. This class was entirely driven by students and our ability to converse with one another. I also developed a variety of writing skills and primary source examination skills. Above all else, I was taught US history from a wider lens than my previous classes. We took an international approach to US history over the course of centuries. We read a variety of primary source documents as well as other forms of media like comics.",
                "Historical knowledge and thinking skills, thematic identification and continuity/divergence recognition skills, historical and cognitive contextualization when examining sources, primary source handling and understanding, compare/contrast and argumentation skills in writing, use of evidence and primary sources to support arguments, complex listening and discussion contribution skills. I would like to note that this class, more than any other, aided my skills of historical and analytical writing, supporting arguments, and writing academically in general.",
                "This course developed and refined my writing and critical analysis skills, and helped me more meaningfully read and critique primary source materials. Similarly, the course also helped me engage more thoughtfully with my peers on topics read between seminars.",
                "Strengthened critical thinking skills, developed concise writing abilities, and learned to approach primary source material within proper historical context.",
                "I learned how to assess primary sources and hold discussion with classmates about findings in such sources. I also learned how to formulate clear arguments and be a better participant in class discussions. Methods of argument formation I learned in the class will also be applied in future essays and presentations.",
                "Throughout this course I learned many skills, which I prefer much more to other classes in high school where we would just have to memorize facts and figures. Some of the skills are to evaluate competing narratives in history to assess bias and have educated seminar-style discussions about readings that were previously assigned. In terms of knowledge and insights, this class completely changed the way I understand the role of American identity in the modern era. I now view it as dynamic, subjective, and malleable. Also, this class taught me that nothing in history was inevitable, meaning that the people involved in any historical event have agency to determine what happens based on what they choose to do.",
                "I learned how to quickly scan a primary source to gain the necessary context for the document. I also learned how to read primary sources effectively, searching for motives and hidden meanings, as well as placing them in wider historical trends and concepts.",
                "I strengthened my understanding of American history through the lens of the title of the course: what makes an American. As the course progressed, it became abundantly clear that there isnt one definition of an American: it varies drastically throughout history and across different groups.",
                "I learned to question and greatly expand the warped and glorified U.S. history I was exposed to in past American history courses. I learned to synthesize various kinds of historical documents (whether essays, primary accounts, cartoons, or television debates) and put them in conversation with each other in class discussions and historical essays. I learned this country's present day struggles are no isolated incident. I learned to speak out thoughtfully and value the strength that comes from sharing a room with such wide perspectives.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of the class are the the professor is highly engaging and provided unique insights that were essential in moving the conversation forward. The fact that this was a seminar also is a major strength of the course and did a great job of introducing first years to the seminar format at Yale. I also appreciated the two different styles of essays assigned as that enabled me to create and complete two different essays which helped my writing in different ways. A weakness of this course is that sometimes I think it would be effective to be given more context about the events that we were learning about prior to reading primary sources as it occasionally was confusing. However, this is very minor and overall I had a fantastic experience in this class.",
                "Strengths - This course (mostly the professor) fosters a great environment for civil discussion, which is especially important when discussing sensitive issues. American history is analyzed chronologically with an emphasis on race relations and events that define these relations. One of the largest strengths of this class is just that - analyzing a history we already know through an entirely different lens, deepening our understanding of both past and current social dynamics in America.",
                "There are infinite strengths. The professor collected regular feedback, had students participate in weekly journals to encourage reflection, and made class discussions exciting. The readings were interesting and manageable, the atmosphere was constructive, and students were encouraged to learn from one another. Every once in a while, a certain opinion would dominate the discussion, but a student was always willing to push back and ensure that the discussion remain grounded; if a student failed to do so, the professor would interject (in a kind manner). The assignments were also great; very interesting means of comparing narratives and answering the course question \"What makes an American?\"",
                "A strength of this course was the open communication that was fostered by student perspectives. Coming from different schools and backgrounds across the world, we all had different analyses and interpretations of what we discussed each day, which made conversation engaging and brought the content beyond the narratives that we read or watched, but made it something we could look at in real time with one another. I don't feel there were any weaknesses in this course, as each module was very intentional and insightful.",
                "The largest strength of this course was that students had the power to drive the conversation in the direction that we found the most interesting. We do not have many opportunities at this school to engage in such an impactful way in class. Every student in the class felt excited to be there. I loved hearing different perspectives, and I appreciated the space we had to disagree. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of is that I did not always feel like the historically setting was clear before we read a primary source. I feel like a could have benefitted from spending a few minutes at the end of class discussing the sources we were about to read. That said, I struggle to think of other weaknesses because the class was so enjoyable.",
                "A strength of the course would be its discussion basis. We examined a myriad of different topics that represented every point on the political spectrum of issues and being able to discuss them ensured that every different aspect of the documents was brought to light. The percentage of our grades that is composed of discussion and other participative activities ensured that I was always focused on the content and how to most understand and share about documents that were assigned in class. The low-stress academic environment in the class ensured that I was thinking of nothing but learning as much as I could about the subject matter. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses come to mind.",
                "This course offers an outstanding opportunity to examine the ethos of America throughout its history in a collaborative and deeply engaging setting. Professor Akiboh structures lessons in a way that allows students to question the past and build upon their peers' analyses to refine their own approach to the material. Professor Akiboh also chose to engage with a breadth of topics that allowed me to more thoroughly understand America as it exists today. Having this exposure was a novel experience, and one that I certainly hadn't had a space to explore before taking this course.",
                "The strengths of this course were the format and assignments. Professor Akiboh did an amazing job at organizing each class and its readings in a very accessible way. Professor Akiboh as created really impactful assignments, designed to help students sharpen specific skills. She also gave detailed feedback and was willing to meet after class or during office hours to discuss further. I think the course could be improved by spending a bit more time on the lesser known events in American history. Days when students were less familiar with the topics discussions were much more interesting.",
                "Strengths: The teaching in this class is phenomenal. Professor Akiboh cares about both the class and the students in it, and is willing to give feedback and meet with you to look at the projects youre working on. This class and professor are both incredible. Even though it was her first year teaching at Yale, she taught the class skillfully and with grace. Also, she was lenient with deadlines to make sure that students werent burdened with arbitrary dates that happened to not fit well with their individual schedules. She made sure to emphasize the course themes and keep conversations going in a skillful and respectful way. \r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "Strengths are the level of participation and the amount of reading. Dr. Akiboh also pushed us to clarify our points.\r\nWeaknesses: it got a little repetitive with an outsized focus on Hawaii near the end of the course. I would have loved more Asian American reflection, as well as immigration of Latinx documents that didnt center white Americans opinions as much as that unit did.",
                "I thought the strengths of the course became apparent once the subject material had a more direct correlation to the present day and the class had learned to work, discuss, and push each other towards big-picture ideas. It seemed suitable for both someone who had a background in American history (like myself) and someone who had not taken an American history class in school. The sources were varied, and I particularly enjoyed analyzing cartoons, pictures, and videos. Document sets were great to get a good grasp of one specific event. The assignments were great: fair, helpful, and related to the course material.\r\n\r\nIn the first half of the semester, I didnt feel like I was getting much out of the course. Im not sure whether it was the class had not yet learned to have productive discussions (since this was everyones first college seminar) or the subject material felt like repetitions of what I already knew.",
                "The strengths of this seminar include its spotlighting of truly diverse and representative types of authors and historical works, its mix of widely known events in U.S. history and often overlooked but equally pivotal moments which we were exposed to and its engaging, honest and intellectually challenging atmosphere. The only improvement I would recommend in this course would be creating a forum to share out each of our final research projects, as I was genuinely curious to see what my peers devoted their time to in the latter end of the semester.",
                "I think it was good content wise, very interesting and covering lots of areas. I think it was hard not being the most outspoken person in the class to get involved in conversation and debate."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Akiboh is an amazing leader in seminar discussions and ensured that our conversations were respectful and nuanced. Every class period I learned something I hadn't thought about before. It was a great first year seminar and highly recommend others take the course.",
                "Yes. The course presents American history through an entirely different lens, allowing for a deeper understanding of past and present social dynamics in America. Overall a very good and beneficial course.",
                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to any first-year student interested in becoming a better writer, understanding U.S. history and inclusion/exclusion, and becoming a stronger and more independent thinker.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student. Even though I am interested in history as a major, I feel that any person interested in change in America or who has grown up observing said change (which is true for the vast majority of my generation) would benefit from taking this course. The seminar style allows students to share their personal perspectives on certain historical events, which provides not only an education of those events from the documents, but also an social-emotional awareness of history that is not as easily taught. The assignments all allowed for an expansion of thoughts shared in class, from the start of United States history into thinking about how our present will be viewed in the future. I really appreciated how this course included many different narratives from many different point of time, that most of our high school history classes did not cover.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes. Any first-year student that is interested in American History should take this course. I loved that it was limited to first-years because I was less afraid to engage. Not only was the class fascinating, it was also an amazing opportunity to develop skills crucial to the overall college experience. 100% would recommend.",
                "Absolutely. This was my favorite class of the semester precisely because Dr. Akiboh placed so much emphasis on what we did in class. Even if you're not interested in history, this is a great and transformative class that changes the way I consider our national identity, history, and reality. For those that are tired of traditional American history, this is the class for you. This class includes all the events, people, and perspectives of and on American history that high school and elementary level history did not cover. Can't speak highly enough about the academic environment and experience in this class.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Akiboh is a brilliant historian and a professor any student should be eager enroll with. This course covers a wide range of topics from throughout U.S. history that allow students to engage with the identities of many different groups over time. I would highly recommend this course to all students.",
                "This is great survey of the evolution of US National identity. I definitely would recommend this to first-years who want to learn more about American history through a thematic lens and understand the historical context for current social, political, and economic trends in the country.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. This course helped me become a better reader and writer. I would especially recommend this course to someone who hasn't taken many American history courses.",
                "YES 100 percent I would recommend to is course. This is my favorite course that ive taken so far at Yale and I cannot recommend it enough. The teaching: amazing, the learning environment: amazing, the topics: well selected and super interesting. Take this class!!",
                "Yes. Fantastic freshman seminar and wonderful introduction to yale.",
                "I think I would. Im pretty sure someone who has a less strong background in American history would actually enjoy this more, since some of the early content being new might make the course more interesting. That said, history was not my strongest subject in high school, so someone more geared towards history might enjoy the course more overall.\r\n\r\nAll this being considered though, I really enjoyed our discussions as we meshed better with each better, and I found myself being able to draw on content throughout the course to talk about overarching narratives that seem more important than the details of any one event we discussed.",
                "I would absolutely continue to recommend this course to other students. It pushed me to think critically about historical \"truth\" and U.S. national consciousness and particularly reaffirmed my belief in the crucial importance of amplifying the voices of historically marginalized and underrepresented groups. I found the curriculum to have a great base in the past and also a great relevance to our present.",
