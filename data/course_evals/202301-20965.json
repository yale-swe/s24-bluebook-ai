            "comments": [
                "Strengths: one becomes familiar with so many different techniques -- I love how the class format of each week being on a new instrument or form of analysis. The material is very clearly and straightforwardly presented, and the class has a good amount of flexibility in day-to-day activities, meaning that there will be downtime for asking questions about material, working on poster, etc. The class workload is one of the most reasonable lab classes at Yale -- there are no tedious and/or frustrating assignments, just ones that are relevant (keeping up with the notebook, quizzes on material, and working on final project)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think it would be good to up the number of weeks of final project work-time to 4. Don't know if the schedule allows it, but would help given it seems there's always a learning in curve in working on everything.",
                "I think the course is well structured to provide an adequate theoretical introduction and practical exposure to a lot of useful techniques. Professor Malaker's lectures are clear, easy to follow, and entirely relevant to the tested material. Some of the guest lectures were confusing and could have been presented better. \r\n\r\nOverall, the course is strong with the material it teaches and the lab experiments you do. Everything is well organized and the expectations are clear. The small size also makes the course feel more friendly and I looked forward to lab/lecture every week. Few to no weaknesses aside from a confusing lecture here or there.",
                "A big strength of this course is the opportunity to present a poster alongside the graduating seniors at the undergraduate symposium. Good experience for anyone who is interested in research or is planning to attend graduate school! The class/instructor also provides ample resources for designing said posters, which is nice."

                "Yes! Its a great way to be exposed to areas of chemical biology, biophysics, and biochemistry in the lab that you might not otherwise get the chance to learn about.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone. The material one learns is very unique -- this is no regurgitation of a lecture class. You get hands on experience with instrumentation and data, which is super helpful and relevant. The final project allows you to take the material in whatever direction you want, and the course is very reasonable. Prof. Malaker is an excellent and relatable professor, and genuinely cared about helping students.",
                "Absolutely! If they are interested in chemical biology, this course pairs well with the class taught in the fall (right now CHEM 419 and CHEM 420/424 but it might change) and gives a good hands-on experience doing some of the things you talk about in that class. It's useful to have exposure to actually doing some experimental work and the material is interesting.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in biophysical characterization techniques and bioanalytical methods of characterizing/analyzing proteins. This course also gives you a good cursory glance of the field of glycobiology (as it is taught by one of the foremost experts in the field). Overall, would definitely recommend, especially if looking for a lower-workload, relatively chill lab credit."
