   "comments": [
    "Reading, discussing books, essay writing",
    "I improved in my analytical reading and writing abilities. I also learned how to read a lot of pages while tracking major themes and keeping track of my takeaways.",
    "You learn how to read and think about literature deeply both in class and on your own as you write. This class allows you to explore literature through the lens of historical events worldwide.",
    "I developed a more critical eye in approaching literature, especially global literature.",
    "I became a much better writer and reader, and have become a more thoughtful thinker about the role of language in literature and the role of English in the world.",
    "An appreciation for literature outside of the British\/American canon and stronger analytical essay writing skills.",
    "In this class I learned how to analyze literature while taking into account the larger circumstances (social, political, historical) under which it was written. I learned how to construct an argument about a work and develop it in 5-10 page papers. I also learned how to have a constructive class discussion and how to carefully weigh the opinions of others as well as one's own interpretations.",
    "I learned a lot more about Irish nationalism than I thought I would. I liked that we learned about the colonial history of the other places we read literature from.",
    "This class strengthened my essay writing skills. It also helped me think about the themes of colonialism and the act of writing from a language that has been imposed on an author and culture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Good amount of reading, could be more shorter writing assignments",
    "I really liked the texts that we read, but I wish we'd been able to spend more time on each one. Additionally, my seminar felt a little large.",
    "The class has a wonderful syllabus (besides robinson crusoe...) and a fantastic professor. Professor Cleary was so invested in the ideas were discussed in class and each one of us as students. He hand wrote pages of comments on each of our essays, comments which included not only evaluations of our essays but also additional ideas to think about and evaluations of our participation in class. Our class discussion was always engaging and generally a lot of fun.",
    "Professor Cleary gives very detailed and helpful feedback on your essays which really helps you improve as a writer and thinker. The class itself is great. I enjoyed every book we read and felt that the class dynamic allowed for great discussions which pushed our understandings of the book.",
    "The books that were chosen were all strong and relevant. They offered us a wide range of topics to discuss while having enough in common that we could trace a thread throughout the course. Sometimes, our discussions felt rushed as there were only one or two classes dedicated to a story which didn't feel like enough. I also found my feedback on writing assignments to be particularly useful, however, there were not that many opportunities to showcase\/receive comments on writing. I think more smaller assignments might have been beneficial.",
    "The course was extremely educational about world english literature and also was structured well to make me a better writer. I wish discussion was led such that students could respond to other students answers more frequently, though. I also wish we hadnt read Robinson Crusoe as it didnt feel like it was within the scope of the classI wouldve preferred to have read another book by an Indian author or another book by a non-white African writer.",
    "This course had lively discussions and is a vital addition to the English department. However, in my personal opinion, some of the novels we read seemed to sacrifice a certain level of character depth for a cosmopolitan, continent-spanning sensibility. This is a minor gripe, because I did enjoy most of the books we read.",
    "Cleary is a good discussion leader who is very generous with feedback (the length of comments, I mean  hes not an easy grader!). In general the conversations were well-organized and interesting; toward the beginning of the semester there were a few times where he seemed to be fishing for particular responses or trying to guide the conversation toward a particular conclusion, but I felt that this improved as the semester progressed.\r\n\r\nClearys class was definitely more work-intensive than the other English foundational courses Ive taken (and than other sections of 128, based on my friends assessments). There are more measures in place (discussion-board posts, in-class assessments) to ensure that youre keeping up with the syllabus and not reading only the books that you plan to write papers on.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I think these measures led to better class conversations  there was generally very little bullshitting\/grasping at straws, and most of our discussions had a lot of participants. However, I did feel that the in-class assessments could have been fine-tuned: the time we were allotted \r\nfelt fairly conservative given the number of responses we had to write, and some of the questions felt too specific to be useful (whether as analytical practice or even just as checks to see if wed done the reading). For instance, I remember one question asked about the name of the town that a particular scene occurred in which didnt really help me think through the text in any new way, nor did it accurately reflect my knowledge of that book.\r\n\r\nI think these assessments would have been more useful if theyd been designed (and advertised) *either* as reading-checks OR as places for us to demonstrate our writing and thinking without recourse to tutors\/writing center. In the former scenario, it also might have been useful to make them even shorter (~5 minutes) and have us do them more often throughout the semester (maybe even one per book?) to prevent cramming and further encourage us to keep up with the material.",
    "The readings are phenomenal and the main theme of the class--trying to understand the issue of English language in other cultures that allows us to read it but prevents true culture from erectin--is very compelling. Some of the discussions I felt focused on the wrong things and in doing so missed the potential for great conversation, that was in no way fixed by our professor.",
    "Strong history. There isn't enough student charged discussion.",
    "I enjoyed discussions but wish the reading list could have been one or two books lighter, or that one or two books on the reading list could have been replaced with essays or poetry. The pace of novel after novel (excepting Dubliners and Translations, short story and play, respectively) was hard to keep up with."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! The syllabus is really unique and the professor is amazing.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone interested in taking an English class. The focus on global literature keep the course engaging, provided a thematic overview, and exposed me to new texts.",
    "YES! I really loved this course. It is a wonderful introductory English course. The workload is reasonable and I loved many of the books we read in class. The class was also consistently thought-provoking, always asking important questions about what it means to live in a globalized, capitalist, post-colonial world.",
    "Yes, I would, because it opened my world to so many new stories and ideas surrounding the English language.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. I think any student interested in literature should be educated in world English literature as, and Professor Cleary is an excellent instructor.",
    "If youre interested in broadening your understanding of world literature and the context surrounding its growth as a new literary category, I would recommend this course. Just keep in mind that because it is a survey course, you dont delve deeply into literature from  specific time or place, but hop between locations and eras.",
    "Definitely. Great use of the English foundational courses, lots of good reading, writing and thinking.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who enjoys literature, including non-humanities majors. The books are interesting and the class often has elucidating discussions. I also found the papers very manageable but engaging to write.",
    "Yes, this will broaden your horizons of what counts as English literature.",
    "Wonderful course, skilled and dedicated instructor, great reading list. Take it!"
