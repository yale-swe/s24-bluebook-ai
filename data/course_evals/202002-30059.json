   "comments": [
    "I gained a deeper appreciation for the diaspora of non-western English literature, and the ways in which it pushes at the boundaries of conventionally accepted Western literature. I also developed my ability to incorporate textual close analysis with the existing literature that every text engages with.",
    "I was able to closely analyze texts from incredible authors from across the globe. I expanded my close reading and research skills through the writing process as well as improving my discussion skills through section and online responses.",
    "Close reading and analytical skills necessary when reading any text. The texts for this course were well selected and very interesting and lended themselves toward analysis and discussion.",
    "This course allowed me to explore literature that is not often covered in traditional English courses, which was interesting and enriching. I was definitely exposed to a new perspective, which I am very grateful for. I learned how to better focus my literary analysis in order to build a strong argument. I worked on my thesis writing skills and was able to fortify already existing arguments by working with my Teaching Fellow.",
    "I deepened my understanding of what world literature means and how to analyze it. This class definitely helped me improve my close reading and essay writing skills.",
    "I got better an analysing literature and writing close reading papers. I also got better at thinking critically about a novel's interaction with its historical context and with the larger politics of \"world literature.\"",
    "I learned about world literature--that is, outside the European\/American sphere. We read 5 novels over 5 weeks and learned & discussed complex topics relating to post-colonialism, gender, & race, among other themes.",
    "I learned a lot about world english literature and the dynamics between local and global literature. I definitely gained a deeper appreciation for the complexities and nuances of literature from different regions, especially literature that pertains to colonization.",
    "An idea of what world literature is, who is gate-keeping it and its purpose. Learned how to close read and analyze text and synthesize our source text with other secondary sources to give context and greater understanding to the material. Got to read many amazing novels outside of the Western Canon!!",
    "A much broader and richer understanding of what English-language literature is than the straight white male Western canon I've been fed has even taught me before.",
    "This course gave me a good first glance at issues surrounding world literature and how they affect the text, from language to form to character. Being offered specific examples of intersections of race, caste, and gender helped me better conceptualize the political role of literature. I became aware of the relationship between the novel and the world Republic of Letters, and what themes facilitate entry into that world.",
    "I got exposure not only to wonderful novels, but to a streamlined set if postcolonial theoretical frameworks thanks to Professor Iheka's excellent lectures.",
    "I learned how to write a research paper on a literary text by further developing a close reading analysis. I, also, always found new themes or images in the books we read thanks to the guidance of Professor Iheka and TA Peter. My literary analysis improved greatly during this class; I especially realize how important historical and cultural knowledge of each literary work's context is important for understanding the true meaning behind the text. There were always more layers of the book to discover, and both the students and instructors worked together in this class to look at the book from different angles.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Due to the once a week format, the lectures tend to drag on very long. Especially over zoom, this makes it difficult to focus. I think the course would benefit from a more seminar-style format, with guiding questions and lecture but without an incredibly long, drawn out single lecture.",
    "A strength of this course was having a space for discussion amongst peers as well as having a unique, mind-opening list of books for us to share ideas. Each element of the course was formulated to show a bigger picture of what world literature is and was also very topical to the world we live in now. The only weakness of this class is that it only lasted 5 weeks and on occasion, we had to rush through books since time was not of the essence.",
    "Professor Iheka did an amazing job! Lectures were extremely well crafted and engaging. He added a level of complexity to the texts that enhanced our understanding. I really enjoyed the structure (having weekly posts and responses due on Canvas before lecture\/discussion) and felt that it again helped our understanding and level of engagement with the material. Of course, I would've liked more time to discuss the novels and to read a more extensive list of works, but this is just the nature of summer session being short.",
    "This course has a manageable and engaging format, with both a lecture and a discussion afterwards. The texts chosen by Professor Iheka are also very interesting to engage with. My one criticism would be to pare down the amount of texts in order to dive deeper into the prose. I acknowledge how this semester was different due to online learning, and I am not sure how this course looks in a regular semester.",
    "The only real weakness from my perspective was that the brevity of summer session did not allow us to consider one novel over multiple days. That being said, for the amount of time given, Professor Iheka and his TAs were able to effectively depart a lot of information!",
    "Strengths: TA sections & discussions, lectures which gave a lot of give context, being able to meet with TA. Not really a weakness, but a short 5 week session prevented us from getting too in depth about certain topics. It's hard to teach an entire book in just a couple hours. I also wish there was a book about the Middle East.",
    "I loved the book selection! Each book was impactful, beautifully written, and contributed to my understanding of the course. I think that there wasn't enough time to do each book justice, because we ultimately only spent one class on each book.",
    "I think because we only met once a week and 2\/3 hours was lecture we didn't get to discuss as much with our peers as I would have liked to.",
    "Strengths - great selection of texts, lecture was well-formatted.\r\nWeaknesses - section was fun but chaotic and conversation didn't flow well.",
    "I think this was a wonderful course in that the texts and lectures were fantastic and enlightening, but I think it was also not designed well for the format of a summer class, or for Zoom. \r\n\r\nThe class ultimately consisted of about 15 hours together on zoom, with only 5 of those being for discussion of 5 texts. Prof. Iheka emphasized multiple times in the first few lectures that he did not want to take too much of our time by having additional time on Zoom because it is the summer. I would have greatly preferred even just 1 extra hour a week of discussion, which would double our time.\r\n\r\nI didnt dislike the weekly written forum discussion, but it wasnt a replacement for conversation. My responses were stilted, for I had the impression that I was being graded and evaluated, much more so than I did when I was talking in class. Further, the posts tended to be long, ask multiple questions, and make multiple observations. The responses to those posts typically only took up one question or observation, leaving an enormous amount hanging.\r\n\r\nThey also had little bearing on our in-class discussions. Because of the exceedingly limited time, we had to cover enormous ground very quickly, with discussions which merited a whole hour being passed over in ten minutes. This created disconnected and chaotic conversation, with each person cutting in to make their (very good!) but entirely unrelated point.\r\n\r\nThe limited time also meant we were unable to adequately address questions of intertextuality, which were hinted at but not explored.\r\n\r\nI think these problems could be helped by adding 1-2 more hours of discussion a week (summer classes ought to be short and intense, in my opinion - this class was not intense) and either reducing the lecture component or including instruction during the discussion sections in a guided-seminar style. \r\n\r\nI felt somewhat patronized at times, even with the knowledge that this is an introductory level class. One example is the multiple choice question we were given to pick which one of two theses was better, with one of them beginning with In this essay I will discuss..., which everyone got right. A second example is that we were supposed to underline our theses in our final paper which - as was made clear in the lecture - was not just to facilitate grading but to ensure that we were clearly focused on one thesis while we wrote. These things might be reasonable in an introductory level course, but if so, they would also necessitate much deeper student engagement (built into the course via discussion section, not just optionally meeting with TAs) and more discussion of craft in essay writing. It was the combination of the suggestion that the students were having difficulty incorporating their theses in their papers with the strong you can figure it out yourself attitude fostered by the limited direct student engagement that felt patronizing, which made me feel slightly antagonistic when referencing my thesis in my final paper. Again, I think this problem could be addressed by improving student engagement. \r\n\r\nLectures on zoom are difficult to follow (though Prof. Ihekas lectures certainly rose to the challenge!). I find that theyre much easier to follow if everyone who is able has their mic on, as well as their camera. It creates a much stronger feeling of being in a classroom. I think this is much more important in discussion sections, where everyone was muted except the speaker, which stunted conversation.",
    "I think meeting once for lecture was wise, but perhaps section could have happened on another day.",
    "I thought it was great overall. I just wish that I could have discussed with my fellow students more about their takes on the book. Sections sometimes felt less like conversations and more like students just wanting to jump in and state their points\/interpretations.",
    "Maybe an East Asian text in addition or in place of one of the texts"

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course simply because the reading list is fantastic. Not only are each of the authors included doing incredible and distinguished literary work, but they are all beautifully written and engaging. Additionally, Prof. Iheka's approach to topics of colonization and non-western history certainly broadened my understanding of world literature and made me want to explore non-Western literature much more.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning about the world through a non-Western perspective. Anyone who claims to be an ally of the Black community should read every book on the syllabus, and in the process they will learn about the lingering effects of slavery, patriarchal systems, capitalism and communism, and social hierarchies.",
    "Yes! Professor Iheka was a very engaging, insightful, and enthusiastic lecturer. He took our understanding of the material to a whole new level that pushed us to think more critically about the works we were reading. I would recommend this course to anyone even just looking to read works outside of the western canon and discuss them deeply.",
    "I would enthusiastically recommend this course to another student, as I believe it teaches very valuable lessons and skills. Whether one is interested in literature or not, a student can take something new away from this course and apply it to their own view of the world.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I think it's very interesting and eye-opening. I think the texts we read were all brilliant and there was always so much to say about them.",
    "Yes, but not as a summer session lecture course. Five books arent enough for a reasonably good understanding of post-colonial literature. Plus, this course works better as a seminar than a lecture course. Having one synchronous lecture per week that consists of a 2-hr lecture plus only 1 hr of discussion session isnt enough to dig deep into the books.",
    "This course is for any student looking for a literature class that will is not Eurocentric in focus. It is a great option for anyone hoping to strengthen their literary analysis and writing skills.",
    "Yes! You learn a lot about non-Western literature and issues that come up as a result of colonialism. As someone who had very little background in this area, I learned a whole lot from the novels, the professor, the TA, and my peers, and I am very glad that I took this class.",
    "Yes, I think there is a lot to learn by exposing yourself to world literature; it helps you see things from different perspectives and learn a lot about cultures that you definitely wouldn't just by reading the Western cannon. There's an interesting class balance between lecture and section, which allows you to learn from more of a knowledgeable source during lecture while still giving you a space to interact with the novel and others in your class during section.",
    "Yes!! The books and teachers and TF's are amazing and you learn so much that a traditional Western literature English class would not have taught you.",
    "Yes. I think every freshman\/sophomore prospective English major should take this course before deciding upon the major, so that if they do decide to become an English major they're becoming the type of English student who doesn't think that Shakespeare, Eliot and Dickens are the only people worth reading and teaching.",
    "Yes, I would, as a fall or spring semester class. I really enjoyed this class, and I feel its shortcomings were mostly just due to its medium as an online summer class. I loved the books, I loved the lectures, and I learned about important themes. I would recommend this class to just about any type of student.",
    "Yes-- I think it's a great intro English class, including for nonmajors like me.",
    "Yes! It helps with writing and literary analysis so much!",
    "Yes, Prof Iheka is great and very engaging. Text selection is pretty good and will widen your literary world"
