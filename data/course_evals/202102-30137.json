                "I gained a lot of insight into current trends in American and British theater, and I read a lot of very interesting plays! The readings on the syllabus for this course are very engaging, and I got a lot better at reading and talking about theater.",
                "I learned a lot about what theater is and what it can look like, especially this past decade.",
                "I got better at seminar style discussion and analyzing and writing about scripts \/ plays.",
                "We read lots of plays, so I received a broad understanding of what contemporary playwrights feel the world needs to know. Through our conversations in class, I developed a better analytical eye for reading plays. I now know what questions to ask of the playwright, the director, and of myself.",
                "I gained deep insight into the art of playwriting and the performance of plays. I developed greater skill at coming up with my own theses\/arguments for paper and for careful reading and analysis.",
                "I started the class not that comfortable with reading plays. Basically, my knowledge was limited to Shakespeare, and I certainly wasn't familiar with the current theater scene. Through the class though, I gained a lot of confidence in my ability to read and analyze contemporary theater. Despite the abbreviated length of the class, I feel like my improvement was on par with the improvement I've had in some of the classes I've taken during the full length semester.",
                "I gained a broad foundation of knowledge about theatre and explored many different topics throughout the course. I also learned how to write about theater and how to critically compare two pieces.",
                "I developed insights into different types of contemporary plays."

            "comments": [
                "The 3-hour unstructured discussion format was nice for a few classes, but it would have been nice to have a bit more structure later in the course. Professor Robinson is a huge strength of the course! He is an excellent seminar leader, and he is great at responding to students' comments and connecting them to facilitate discussion. The strength of the syllabus is also apparent; the plays that we read in this class were all just fantastic.",
                "A lot of reading since it's condensed down for the summer but really accessible and interesting readings, regardless of your familiarity with the plays. Like all seminars, discussions definitely depend on your classmates and their level of engagement but we had a good group and Prof. Robinson was an excellent discussion leader. The syllabus was super well curated, it didn't feel like plays were just assigned to be assigned but that they complimented each other and aided our understanding. The assignments were super accessible and manageable, though some students struggled with the open-ended prompts.",
                "I think the strength is in the content and the Professor. Prof. Robinson includes a lot of diverse, interesting plays that make cool social commentary. He is also a great professor and allows conversation to flow very well. One thing is the class can get a little boring, especially in a 2.5 hour summer class. I think maybe shortening the lecture time or adding in more fun visual components to the class would liven it up a little.",
                "Marc is a really excellent professor who leads discussions extremely well--he also makes the material super approachable, even for students who do not have much experience with theater. The TA, Madeline, also had really excellent feedback to give and was generally very helpful. I enjoyed the format of the class assignments as well (discussion posts and two papers). I thought the plays we read\/watched were also really great, though I haven't studied theater much outside of this class. The only downside was that we were on Zoom so not everyone was engaged and it was kind of easy to get tired towards the end of the several hour long class, which made the discussion sometimes lose steam.",
                "There could be more trigger warnings. I would also appreciate a way to get to know my classmates better, so perhaps a diversity of classroom activities would be nice. For instance, breakout rooms for a few minutes is a great way to debrief with a smaller group. It also was hard to find some scripts. I actually didnt read two plays just because I couldnt find theres scripts and it was too late to ask for help. Other than that, I love the syllabus and Professor Robinson. (Side note: the last few plays on the syllabus are super heavy and discuss statutory rape. I wonder if we could read another play to lighten the mood. Or, please explain to the class the purpose of having that topic discussed in three plays back to back.)",
                "A strength of the course are the highly interesting readings. Perhaps this was due to the condensed summer nature of the course, but I would have found it immensely beneficial if we had the opportunity for submission of a rough draft for the papers, or at least an opportunity to discuss with our classmates about our topics and ideas.",
                "Hands down the biggest strength is Marc; he is excellent at leading a stimulating, productive conversation. The organization of the class is also phenomenal--each week stacks well upon the last one and the plays are provocatively grouped each class.",
                "The in class discussions are very engaging and thought provoking. One issue is that they are quite long, and can go on for a while without a break.",
                "A strength o developed was my writing skill and my critical reading skill."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in theater (or even just literature in general)! You will definitely enjoy reading all of the plays, and the workload is totally manageable.",
                "Definitely. Really loved working with Prof. Robinson and was introduced to a tons of plays that I wouldn't have otherwise read, even though I'm very familiar with this genre. Super accessible and engaging. One of my favorite English requirements so far.",
                "I would recommend this class. It's a great beginner friendly introduction to theater.",
                "Yes! This is one of my favorite courses that I have taken so far and I had a great time, even as a STEM major \/ someone who knew almost nothing about theater going into the course.",
                "Absolutely. I already recommended this class to my brother, whos not even a college student. This class was illuminating. I always thought contemporary theater wasnt as good as the classics. However, now I see such beauty in the creativity of these playwrights. I gained a new appreciation for theater in that I really want to see more shows in person and follow along with what new plays are being written.",
                "Yes, I would. It was refreshing to read new plays for every class, as opposed to other humanities courses that stick with one text for several classes\/weeks.",
                "Yes! It's seriously changed how I approach not just plays, but other art forms as well. Every class was a knockout--even when I thought I didn't really like the readings for that day.",
                "Yes! This course was very engaging and introduced me to new topics that I really enjoyed learning about. I also participated in some great discussions with other students and learned from their contributions.",
