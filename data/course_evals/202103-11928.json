                "A solid introduction to an important field, and generally well-taught.  The material is very nice, which helps.  Franco seems invested in the material and in general explains clearly.  Sometimes long proofs got tedious or dull, but I think that's just how it goes sometimes.  Definitely a good class for math majors to take.",
                "Class is barely worth going to - just the instructor reading from the textbook. Problem sets are just about impossible without help, as they really extend the material from the book\/lecture to a completely new level - while this is normal in most math classes here, it was a whole lot different with this one. Feedback from graders was little to none, and problems that took up entire pages would often be marked down 50% for a single negative sign being missing or the like. Material is super interesting, but this class is certainly not worth taking given the teaching team assigned to it.",
                "Course was excellent overall, things felt a bit disorganized near the end with the bonus content, but it was still good.",
                "Strength: the material is well organized since the course follows a decently written textbook, and the professor explains the motivation behind theorems\r\nWeakness: not too exciting in general",
                "Strengths: The content of the course sticks very closely to the Gamelin textbook, which makes it easy to review topics if you're confused. Franco and the TAs are also very accessible and hold many office hours, so there's plenty of support. Weaknesses: lectures tend to go at a very rapid pace, so it can become easy to get lost during class.",
                "The first half of this class was difficult to follow and moved incredibly quickly. Lectures were for the most part difficult to follow and felt slightly unmotivated\/structured, but if you read the textbook before class, lectures were much more tractable. This class could be improved by borrowing some more of the structure from the textbook.",
                "Subject is pretty interesting - nice things happen with functions that are differentiable in the complex plane and a lot of cool theorems pop out of it. It can be a bit tough to get into though \/ workload is a bit heavy",
                "It follows the textbook closely and I think I learned a lot about complex analysis. However the lectures are basically following the textbook so it's much more concise to just read the textbook.",
                "Course material was taught too quickly. We rushed through the first half of the topics within the first month. Then at the end, we just had extra review sessions. I'd rather that we went slower and had more time to think about the topics. \r\n\r\nAlso, the textbook (Gamelin Complex Analysis) was the main course instruction. Lectures felt a little unmotivated, but the textbook fortunately shined light on my ignorance in math. By the end of the semester, only 25% of the students actually showed up to lecture. I assume the other 75% just read the textbook (or maybe they're just math gods).",
                "Strengths: Franco is a very nice guy and extremely knowledgeable about the content; results are as cool as I've seen in any math class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class is poorly organized - lectures aren't clear which makes the psets harder since I often had to learn things on the fly",
                "The course is designed quite well. Gamelin is an excellent textbook choice for an introductory class in complex analysis."

                "Yes.  The material is very cool.  If you were ever annoyed by all the finnicky details and convergence problems of real analysis, you'll like complex more since all the stuff we study is so well-behaved.  This is also an important class for math majors and also people in adjacent fields like applied math or physics.  Franco is a good prof, although the instructor seems to change year to year.  The class isn't a *whole* lot of work - although a decent effort is definitely required -, and the exam questions com from lecture or homework so there aren't curveballs there.  In general the class doesn't have major weaknesses, although the atmosphere isn't quite as enthusiastic\/exciting as the very best math classes I've taken (like 230, for example).",
                "Not at all. The content is interesting, but you can just learn it by yourself or (ideally) with a different professor.",
                "Yes, it's a beautiful branch of math.",
                "Yes for math majors, and maybe physics majors. Not that exciting for other majors.",
                "This is probably my favorite math course I've taken at Yale so far in terms of content, and I would definitely recommend it. However, be prepared to spend a lot of time reading the textbook to try and understand what's happening - I spent almost as much time on this class as on all four of my other classes combined.",
                "Yup, just make sure to actually read the textbook. Sometimes (often?), the textbook does a better job of explaining the material than Franco, although that might just be because the book is amazing. HW problems are often taken from the book. The class is straightforward, you just get fed a constant stream of information and you do problem sets. Take if interested in complex analysis, this isn't really a gut",
                "Yes, but be prepared to work for this class. Lectures are often hard to follow so be prepared to invest a couple of extra hours a week reading the textbook and working on PSETs. PSET problems are for the most part not too difficult if you follow along with the textbook, but every pset has a couple of problems that are a doozy. I personally was not able to solve them without the help of office hours or friends, but other than that as long as you are diligent about following the textbook and starting psets early, this class is manageable. Exams can also be quite difficult but if you prepare by studying past pset problems and proofs from class, you should be okay.",
                "Yes! Franco is very organized, and his lectures are easy to follow. The homework is challenging but not unreasonable. The class follows Gamelin chapter-by-chapter, so I'd definitely recommend getting the book to follow along.",
                "Cool course with cool material - would recommend to a math major or if you enjoyed analysis \/ similar proof based classes",
                "If they're a pure math major and want to know more about the field of analysis, sure.",
                "I would if you love math and want to learn more about the amazing and beautiful world of complex numbers and functions! There's a lot of really interesting topics, and I was genuinely shocked how elegant things became. \r\n\r\nJust note that most of this class will be you reading through the textbook and doing tedious problems (there are a lot of functions in complex analysis that are not super nice). Conceptually, it's not horrible (it's actually really beautiful), but make sure to take the time to understand all the definitions in the front. It's best if you review your multivariable calculus before taking this class. \r\n\r\nAlso, people just stop showing up to lecture after a certain point, because lecture is basically a rehash of the textbook with some missing details. It was kind of sad that out of the 50 students, there were only ~16 students who regularly showed up to lecture (and no one really participates in class). This class is practically a self teaching course (which I believe most math classes to be), but just keep that in mind before you take this class.",
                "Yeah, it's a good class. Franco is a solid professor, a complex analysis genius who can be confusing at times in lecture but also extremely kind and supportive throughout the semester. I would've appreciated a few more comparisons to real analysis results, because sometimes the content felt completely unrelated to anything I've studied before. It's a worthwhile adventure for any math or math-related major, just be prepared for some learning outside of class when the lectures aren't clear and use office hours\/friends when you have to. Get the recommended Gamelin textbook because it is super helpful whenever you're confused with anything from class; the whole course revolves around it essentially. To math majors who have to take this class: as I understand it, Franco is the best of the complex analysis teachers (which is unfortunate because this version is far from perfect), but if you're gonna take it absolutely take it with him.",
                "This a good first course in introductory analysis. However, I didn't feel like I got much out of the lectures since they contained the exact same content as the textbook but were harder to follow. I would be hesitant to recommend this course to a student who did not need to take complex analysis, but I think it is a fine class if you need to."
