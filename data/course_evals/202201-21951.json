                "I learned how to read empirical economics papers critically. Although most of the papers that Gerard assigns are methodologically sound, there are some that he includes in the syllabus that have either minor or serious limitations. It can be difficult trying to identify these, but it's part of what makes the class interesting and relevant. You get the sense that you're not just being lectured to about what's good and what's bad, but asked to think like an economist and a reviewer.",
                "Good understanding of practical applications of econometrics, how to read and actually understand an economics paper.",
                "Understanding of how conflict influences society and the economy of affected areas beyond just physical destruction",
                "The ability to critique academic papers, which required more individual thought than regurgitating what the authors said. This was a challenge but also very rewarding.",
                "Research based class on how conflict interacts with economics and vice versa. New papers and theme every week.",
                "This course is perfect for any student interested in learning more about economic research and reading economic papers in the field of economic analysis of conflict. Professor Gerard is one of the top economists in this field and discussing papers in the class is very helpful to get a better idea of the challenges in acquiring data and developing econometric models in this field.",

            "comments": [
                "The best strength is certainly Gerard and his teaching style. He's dynamic and funny in the classroom, and he is super responsive. I'd say that one weakness is the lack of roundtable discussions. The course is the size of a seminar, but it's structured more like a lecture discussion. The first half of each class is spent with students presentations, and the second half is more of a dialogue, where Gerard gives his take on the reading and answers any questions.",
                "Material was great but expectations from assignments were unclear. More reading responses would have been more fair.",
                "Professor is fantastic, but readings are quite similar",
                "The strength of this course is definitely the professor. The only weakness I can think of is the length of the presentations, which I believe could be somewhat shortened to allow for more discussion.",
                "The strength of the course is Professor Padro i Miquel, who is insightful and engaging. His discussions of the papers that the course covers are generally fantastic, and you learn a lot about reading economics papers critically.",
                "Great format. Perfect for seniors. 2 respond papers, one 20 minute presentation and a 10 page paper on whatever you want related to conflict made for a pretty chill class. Professor Padro is also very understanding and flexible on deadlines for the paper which I think everybody appreciated. He was one of the few professors that I have had that was in touch with reality and working with second semester seniors.",
                "I think presenting the paper was rewarding, as well as the reading responses. Wish that the discussion on empirical topics (omitted variable bias, instrumental variables) was more formalized with slides.",
                "The course is very structured and Professor Gerard does a great job in covering many areas of economic analysis of conflict. The best part of the class is definitely the discussions in class where we are able to critically think about the research question, method, and techniques used in economic papers.",
                "The main strength is the variety of topics included in the course. The main weakness is the development of a deep discussion among students. The discussion could be improved if students can engage with questions during the presentations of the papers."

                "Absolutely! It's a great class for anyone who's interested in empirical economics. Even if you're new to conflict as a subject, this class is really about learning to think like an economist.",
                "Sure - as long as you don;t mind doing a lot of reading (which is expected anyway as this is a seminar).",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in the topic.",
                "Yes! It's a great way to develop your skills in economics, and the course material is interesting in itself. I learned how to properly read an economics paper in this course, which is a useful skill to have in the major. The material is about world events, so having a background in political science or developing countries may have made it more helpful, but it was a good introduction.",
                "Yes, its a bit grim in terms of topics discussed because they are quite sad, but its a very low stress senior seminar. Very well organized and you can choose to frontload, backload your work, or keep it well balanced if you choose.",
                "Very good senior seminar. Very engaging material, as it relates to lots of current events and has wide ranging implications.",
                "I highly recommend this course to every economics student. After taking many economics electives, this is honestly one of the very few classes where you learn about how economic research is made. Professor Gerard is so passionate about the topic and getting his insights about the papers is very helpful for those considering careers or graduate studies in economics. Professor Gerard is also always available to chat with students and students constantly receive constructive feedback on assignments.",
                "Yes. This is a great course for students looking to a) engage with the literature of the economics of conflict, or b) understand how do observational studies can be applied."
