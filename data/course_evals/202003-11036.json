                "The course material was fascinating and I enjoyed the lectures. I wish that the whiteboard function on Zoom could have been used more specifically when it came to the convolution unit. It was really challenging to learn how to solve complicated math problems on powerpoint.",
                "Lecture notes seem disparate from the lecture slides and content so it was a bit hard to follow, ended up just using the PowerPoint slides\r\nMATLAB programs were fun but doing it alone did not have the collaborative environment of a STEM lab unfortunately.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hu was very flexible and always willing to help us out. The material was really interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: The PowerPoint format of the lectures was sometimes hard to follow. I think it would be good if there were some parts of lecture (like practice problems) that were filled out on an iPad in class in real time. The take-home exams took much much longer than the suggested time. The final exam in particular took me about two (focused) days to complete, and the suggested time was 3 hours.",
                "Dr. Hu was extremely accommodating to student input, so that was a huge strength. She would ask us for ideal midterm and final dates and time frames, as well as make the homework graded for credit to ensure that we gave it our best efforts. Her feedback on midterms was also vital for learning and correcting future mistakes. She would also have a review of the past lecture at the start of every new lecture which I found very helpful. \r\n\r\nThe signals and Fourier series unit could maybe have used more walked through examples, but overall the course was strong. The only weakness was at times a difficulty showcasing examples over Zoom, it was a new switch and I understand that the technological support from school wasn't there so I get the struggle.",
                "Doing more examples after the introduction of each unit especially with Fourier d and the like would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: the material was extremely interesting, and Professor Hu was very understanding and responsive to students' needs\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the lectures could be very confusing with all the theoretical math\/symbols. It also may be helpful to have some sort of tablet to use like a whiteboard in the future.",
                "The professor was very organized and she made herself very accessible to students through the use of GroupMe. I think the course could have been improved if there was a way for the professor to write on the presentation slides during lecture."

The two formats of information, the pre-written notes, and the lecture slides were also helpful when trying to understand the material. If I didn't get a topic in lectures, the notes were there to supplement the information. I do wish the professors would have received their iPads, it was a struggle to properly showcase some of the math and examples with only a laptop.",
                "The tick based grading for labs and psets were helpful",
                "Personally, I liked having live lectures because of the schedule it created for me.  I also definitely appreciated having take-home exams, which reduced some of the stress.  One thing that could be improved would be to have a tablet and use it like a whiteboard during lecture, which would save a lot of time used to try drawing things using a computer mouse."
