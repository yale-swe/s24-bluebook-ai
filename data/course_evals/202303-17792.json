                "Very good course. Final and information could be more concise but overall good",
                "Some of the course material was really cool, but it was hard to stay engaged in the class and a notable fraction of students didn't come to lecture that often because it was a 9am and the lectures are not super helpful on the psets.",
                "One of the strengths of this class is that the topics covered and very tangible. Anybody taking the class will interact with these materials on a day to day bases. One of the weakness is the 9am time slot (sorry).",
                "I thought that the course was taught well. Jan was very good at teaching concepts from the root, and building on subjects to create a foundation of knowledge. Since this was not a math dominant course, it was not always clear what needed to be known/studied for the exams, but maybe that was the point.",
                "Strengths: Professor Schroers is a very energetic lecturer and it's clear how passionate he is about the course material. He is also very kind and understanding.\r\nWeaknesses: the content is a lot of review of high school chemistry for the first half of the class, which is kind of hard to engage with. Some of the psets and the midterm were also unexpectedly difficult (the final was adjusted to be much less confusing and more content-driven than calculation-heavy). The psets also take a while to get graded, and the grader's comments are nonexistent, barely helpful at best.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Schroers really cares about what he is teaching and knows a great deal. The material can be incredibly interesting, especially thinking about applications of everything being taught. Weaknesses: The course moves too slowly - Prof. Schroers knows a huge amount and wants to make sure everyone understands the material, but it is at the cost of missing some information that could potentially be necessary later down the road. The organization is also challenging to understand, primarily because there is a disconnect between material in the lectures, textbook, problem sets and exams.",
                "This course would greatly benefit from a revamp of the slides and more support for students each week for the pset and leading up to the exam. There is no practice exam or really any review material besides the review slides, which don't include everything that is covered on an exam. The TAs hold office hours only twice a week, and the later psets expect much more from the student than what was covered in class. I understand that psets are supposed to push students' understanding of a concept, but I found myself scouring the internet for youtube videos to teach myself how to do a problem since we didn't go over the concept in class.",
                "strengths: it was a very comprehensive overview! as a non-MENG major, learning curve was steep but manageable\r\nweaknesses: class size was rather big, and I wish I got to know and learn from my fellow classmates more. I wish that lectures were recorded so I could replay them and revise material since I'm slow to catching onto the content given my lack of heavy science background.",
                "Very straightforward curriculum.",
                "Strengths: Required for mech e majors.\r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Schroers is a very nice guy, but his accent was slightly difficult to follow at times. The lectures/presentations were extremely disorganized. It was very difficult to find out how to solve problem set problems, as the presentation notes did not go over them in detail. Consequently, it was extremely difficult to prepare for the midterm/final as there were no practice tests given."

                "Yes! This class will teach you a lot about why so many materials are the way they are, and their uses/properties.",
                "Yes. It's a fairly easy course in the hellscape of the MENG major, professor Schroers is excellent, and the content is fairly interesting and very current and relevant to today's engineering.",
                "Do not take this course as it is, unless you need to. It is very unorganized, and does not help the student at all. There are no notes, homework solutions,  practice exams, or anything that powerpoint slides with only pictures uploaded to help the student study, or prepare for exams. It is an easy class, but I still feel I underperformed, because I wasn't sure how to get the most out of eat.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless you have to take it for your major. It's poorly organized nature makes it difficult to stay engaged in the material, and there is barely any support from the TA. Jan is a perfectly kind and well-meaning man, but his lecturing style is not the most conducive to effective learning.",
                "would recommend if you are interested in materials science! even though I have a background in social science and i'm not going to be a scientist, i felt that the content was approachable enough that I could understand it and communicate about science with others.",
