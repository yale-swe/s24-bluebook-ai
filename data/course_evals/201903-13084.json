    "I became much proficient in the language and most importantly, I became much more confident in my speaking since class was led in a way that encourages every student to participate as much as possible.",
    "I improved my knowledge of French grammar and practiced speaking, writing, and reading French.",
    "This course is a great way to improve your reading and listening comprehension in french. In this course, you learn a lot of new vocabulary and can really improve your communication and comprehension skills in this course if you are willing to commit to practicing.",
    "I improved my French in all aspects, including reading, writing, speaking and listening.\r\nMy French is much better than last semester when I finished FREN 140."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A strength of this course is the emphasis put on participation in class since practicing a foreign language through speaking it is extremely important for becoming fluent. A weakness would be that there is too much focus put on grammar which takes away from other objectives such as enriching one's vocabulary of french words.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it is well organized, and you cover ground very quickly. I wish we engaged more with modern Francophone culture though because some of the readings were archaic.",
    "Most of the materials (texts and films) are very interesting and appropriate for our level. And we were a small class so that everyone speaks a lot during the class.\r\nI personally do not like the book \"Tout le matin du monde\". There might be better choice?"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to finish their studies in French with a high-level course or build their knowledge in grammar and improve their reading skills before taking one of the upper French courses.",
    "I would recommend this to a student if she were very serious about learning and practicing French. It's not an easy or low-workload course though; you have to be really self-motivated to learn.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who loves the french language and wants to improve their communicative skills. Mme Schneider is a great professor who dedicates a lot of time and energy to give good feedback to students and really help improve their language skills.",
    "Yes, I recommend everyone having taken FREN 140 to continue learning French, and FREN 150 is very helpful."
