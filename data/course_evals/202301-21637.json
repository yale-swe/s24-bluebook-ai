                "The course is presented via interesting and informative lectures, and the homework assignments reinforce the concepts.",
                "Strengths: Prof Manohar is a great, engaging lecturer. Labs are pretty relevant to the content we cover in class, quizzes were a low stakes but meanginful way to keep in check with the ongoing content. Weaknesses: seems to be designed and catered to Engineering students, pure CS students who had no engineering background had to catch up on some ideas on their own, somewhat unclear expectations for the final project (compared to the other labs that had very detailed deliverables that were centralized on the course webpage)",
                "The labs were fun and helpful in solidifying the concepts from class, lectures were very interesting and easy to follow if you come to class. Professor Manohar is a great lecturer, if you're interested in embedded systems or just want a fun upper level CS class I would definitely recommend.",
                "Rajit Manohar is this course's greatest strength. Beyond his clear expertise in and passion for the course material, he used humor and anecdotes to make long lectures engaging.",
                "The projects were pretty hands-on and taught me a lot. I had a lot of fun working on the final project too. The quizzes were good to keep in loop with the course material but were a little annoying (and not always easy). The exam was hard and sometimes the project specs would lack enough context. Overall I learnt a lot and would recommend the class still!",
                "Maybe less of a coding emphasis, especially as it is only an elective for Cs and it is a requirement for EE....",
                "Strength: this is a great class. Very rewarding. \r\n\r\nWeakness: oh my god the assignments were difficult. They GREATLY overestimate EE students ability to code in C. The midterm was horrible for the EE students as it was all software. I wish there was more of a hardware focus in this class.",
                "Very hands on course where you actually apply what you learn in class in the systems you build.",
                "I really enjoyed the labs although I recommend having a partner picked out. I found the lectures were a bit complicated if you havent taken 323 and it may be hard to follow. Lots of information though and final project fun. Midterm was ridiculously challenging",
                "Strengths: Manohar is one of the best lecturers I have had in the cs department. His knowledge and ability to explain complex concepts is apparent in lectures and you can tell that he cares about our understanding of the topic. The labs were very connected to the course material, and I loved the open-ended nature of the final project.",
                "The structure of the class is good, and the content gives a good overview of how computers and microcontrollers operate. The weekly quizzes are a nice addition: they are not too hard and can be answered without too much difficulty if the student pays attention in class.\r\n\r\nGrading for this class can be improved. The grades come in quite late and so it's usually not possible to obtain feedback in time to improve on the next assignment. The midterm exam was also quite a difficulty spike compared to the quizzes and the assignments, and I think more could have been done to prepare students.",
                "Major strength is Professor Manohar. He makes lectures engaging and paces them just right. The labs are also really interesting and some push you conceptually while others are more classic arduino projects. The only criticism I have is that some sections of labs or questions on the midterm were phrased in ways that appeared far more complex than what was actually being asked of you. What is actually expected of you is very reasonable, but this can sometimes make coursework seem daunting. f.e. there were times I thought I had to design entirely new protocols, but the reality was I just had to modify old ones. Overall an incredibly strong class though, and one you will be grateful to have taken.",
                "Strengths: Professor Manohar is an engaging lecturer with a lot of knowledge about his field. Expect to learn not just how things work but why people build them the way they do, and the history of how we arrived at current designs. The labs are reasonable workload-wise, and extremely helpful for understanding the material discussed in lecture. In the last lab, I implemented concurrency, using an interrupt to context switch between different processes, and as a result I have a good model of concurrency in my head. In a different lab, I needed to get accurate input from a rotary encoder, and now I have a mental picture of how rotary encoders work, down to the wiring.\r\nWeaknesses: Feedback could have been more detailed, and grading was a little slow - I wish we'd gotten feedback on the first lab before submitting the second. Office hours were sometimes less helpful than they could have been - I remember showing my solution for part of a lab to a TA, the TA saying it worked, and then subsequently losing points for not doing the assignment properly.",
                "Strengths definitely included the Labs and Final project -  both were fun and felt much more like cool projects than homework. I think the lectures themselves could be weaknesses, especially with topics such as concurrency which were the most conceptually difficult. More practice or time spent learning actual implementation in C would have made the lab easier.",
                "Overall, I really enjoyed this course and its content. I do think it would be better if it was taught somewhere else (not in the basement of hillhouse).",
                "If you are an EE major, be prepared to get screwed. You are entering computer science land. First of all, you can't just go to class and do fine on the quizzes. That was a total lie. Also, there's a lot of figuring things out yourself on the labs, so be prepared to take more time than you think with those, and honestly for the harder ones it is not worth trying to do on your own - definitely consult solutions for those. The midterm was simple in theory in its questions, yet I didn't know how to do anything on it because I feel like I did not gain an intuitive or concrete understanding of the inner workings of the computing machine as he laid out for us in lecture. Like I could not tell you when a flag is used, what functions do in the machine code, the current process, the stack pointer vs the normal pointer, which is kind of sad, because I feel like I got close to knowing what everything does, but I just had no framework to put all of these things together because he only ever talked about computers in theory, and he never showed us examples of how stuff might come together in a real computer. And all of the queuing stuff was interesting, but again I feel like we never used it for anything and I don't really know if my implementation of it would ever really work. And I never really understood why accessing a critical process would fail during some implementations and not others. Idk maybe I should've asked more questions in class but I just always left class more confused about everything and never really got it all sorted out. Manohar's a good professor and he cares, but if you're stupid and are going into this blind like I was, know that he will assume you know much more than you do and that you have way more time than you do."

                "Definitely, it's a great course to get some hands-on experience with a unique branch of computer science.",

                "I've taken 3 embedded classes at Yale, and I should have taken this one first. Mobile and Embedded Systems with Lin Zhong is another great class, but I would recommend taking that after this and potentially Operating Systems. Creative Embedded Systems is much more about practical embedded in the context of art, and is very fast paced\/project based. This class is a good introduction to those less familiar with embedded concepts such as digital and analog signal's (GPIO), interrupt and polling based design paradigms, general principles of embedded systems, specifics of communication protocols and how to interact with various components. I would also recommend taking this after 323 if you want to grasp these concepts from a lower level.",
                "This was my favorite course of the semester and one of my favorite courses I have ever taken at Yale. I looked forward to working on our \"labs\" (problem sets), which is more than can be said of the work for almost any of my other classes.",
                "Yes, it is very useful",
                "If you are an EE student, I am sorry to tell you that this class is a requirement, and yes, unfortunately the class has many CS students who have the unfair advantage of having a great deal of C background. Your best bet is to get someone really good at coding to be your lab partner. You handle the circuits, and your CS friend can handle all the codes.",
                "Yes!!!",
                "Yes, but maybe wait to take it after 323 or take it credit d",
                "Yes. I learned a lot and I think it is important to understand how hardware and software interact with each other. I feel as if I can pick up an arduino and make any project I want, given my experience in this course. I thought it was a good balance between making circuits\/small projects and coding.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. The difficulty and workload is just right, the content is interesting and the professor is engaging.",
                "Yes Yes Yes. This course is one of the best CS courses offered, and do not worry about the prereqs too much. The course expects a solid understanding from students but there is plenty of room given to \"catch up\" and ask questions about parts you may be less familiar with. Conceptually, it will push you but you come out with such an improved understanding of digital systems. There are so many cool protocols and concepts covered you genuinely will be excited for lecture. Professor Manohar does not simplify the concepts too much and gets you to the place where you can understand them at a fairly high complexity. This may seem daunting at first as it may feel like things are going over your head, but if you ask questions and are consistent with the course, you will learn so much. I cannot emphasize enough how much you should take this course! Professor Manohar is also one of the best professors in the department, and Yale is lucky to have him, so take advantage of it by taking the course.",
                "Definitely, especially if you're interested in EE\/CS but not planning to major in either field. The material is interesting, the professor is engaging and super knowledgeable, and the course is very well organized. After taking the class, I can look at electronic devices and ask \"what's going on in there?\" in a way I couldn't before. \r\n\r\nI don't think I would take the class without any coding experience. I took it without first taking any other CS or EE courses (except EENG 202, which is really just a math class), but I had enough coding experience to teach myself the C and C++ I needed. Maybe you could get away with it if your lab partner who was good at coding, and willing to explain things to you. I don't think you need any circuit knowledge. All the circuits built for the labs are fairly simple, although I would expect to spend some extra time on the first few labs if you haven't seen any circuits before.",
                "Would definitely recommend, pretty fun and not too demanding. The only really challenging part of the course was the midterm, and the rest was pretty relaxed and fun. The final project also made the class worth taking.",
                "I would recommend this class if youre looking for an introduction to arduino \/ embedded systems. The content builds off of 323 very well. The course load isnt too overwhelming for a CS class, and there is no final which is nice (only a final project). That said, start all the projects early because they might take more time than expected.",
                "Excellent class. Even for people who have lots of experience with Arduino, this class dives into the inner workings of microcontrollers and the design of embedded electrical systems. Great for any EE CS or EECS - or anyone interested in low power \/ embedded design who has some background in C programming. Professor Manohar is excellent - take this if you can!",
