Im not exaggerating when I say we covered a unit in 3 days.  We also did not hear about the oral exam until the week it was happening.  Overall lovely professor but the class needs major restructuring and possibly a different textbook.",

                "Strengths: the class is fun and lighthearted. \r\nWeaknesses: at times I felt very confused and did not know the direction of the course. The assignments / what was expected of us was very unclear. It was a lot of memorization and less putting those skills into conversation practice.",
                "Professoressa Egan was great at teaching the material and very kind. Also, the assignments, projects, and exercises helped to cultivate learning. The tests are pretty fair.\r\n\r\nI guess the main weakness of the course was that it was a bit disorganized as it didn't strictly follow the course syllabus. It was hard to know how to prepare for class ahead of time because of this. Despite that, it was still a good class.",
                "The introductory courses are paced way too fast. Unless you are a language whiz there is just no way to adequately practice and actually absorb this much material in this little time. Even the profs admitted that some topics were skimmed just because they had already written the syllabus and were rushing to keep up."

I believe Italian is a beautiful language and with the right structure would be a pleasure to learn however I feel like for me this class was too fast paced.  Also if you can Cr/D this class because the grading was harsh to me.",
