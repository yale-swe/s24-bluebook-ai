                "Strengths definitely included the weekly discussion and presentation. I also particularly appreciated the use of Canvas discussions for some added writing practice. The professor is also really interesting, knowledgeable, and willing to challenge students. Contrary to a lot of reviews, I didn't find the material so shocking or offensive as to be unable to do the work. An Andalusian Dog and Pink Flamingos have some gross scenes, sure, but this doesn't make or break the course! \r\n\r\nThere are a few weaknesses that do deserve discussion, although I know the professor has resolved to make most of these changes next time. They all revolve around grading and assignment clarity. The first is that a midterm paper was sprung on students three weeks before it was due despite not being put on the syllabus. We also were not told how this midterm would be accounted into our grade, which was not specified as including it on the syllabus.",
                "All the material on the syllabus was highly interesting and exciting. We read plays and novels (Euripides' Bacchae, Peter Shaffer's Equus, Nikos Kazantzakis' Zorba the Greek), watched movies (Pink Floyd's The Wall, John Waters' Pink Flamingos), and analyzed visual, musical and performance art (The Garden of Earthly Delights, The Rite of Spring, Bolro). This course showed me how many possible interpretations of Dionysus exist and the complicated legacies of Dionysus in modern culture.\r\n\r\nThough I really enjoyed preparing for class (reading\/watching the material and writing a reading response on it), class time was not always used efficiently. Typically, a student was supposed to present on the material, but expectations were unclear regarding length and scope of the presentations. Professor Syrimis often intervened and directed the discussion, which helped us cover more of the material but also meant that we didn't hear that much from the student presenter."

This course didn't give me an answer to the question \"Who is Dionysus and what is his legacy?\" However, I don't think it was supposed to  instead, Dionysus in Modernity offers glimpses of many facets of the Dionysian or what has been considered Dionysian. It's a particularly interesting course for someone curious about the construction of the Dionysian and its role in modern culture. I was very inspired by everything we read and the reading was pretty light compared to other humanities courses. If you want to gain mastery over a topic, though, it probably isn't the course for you.",
