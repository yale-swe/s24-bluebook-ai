                "I learned so much about banking crises that have occurred in the past (US and international), banking regulations over time, and the systemic risks of the banking sector.  We learned about crises that have occurred, how they can spur crises in other countries, crises patterns in various types of economies, policy responses that have been effective an ineffective, and international and domestic regulation.  I loved how this course considered emerging economies and how Sigga emphasizes that these economies are important and should not be looked down upon by international agencies (like the IMF).  Also, Sigga is immensely successful and shared her own experiences.",
                "Tons about how regulation of the banking system works, as well as how various banking crises emerge and spread",

                "I definitely learned a lot about how the banking system works, and also various case-studies of crises globally.",
                "I learned about Financial Stability in both Advanced and Emerging Economies. We discussed how asset-bubbles, leverage cycles, and liquidity spirals precipitate Financial Crises and how governments can fight them and prevent this dangerous procyclicality in the first place. I learned that there are so many more Crises than just Banking Crises, including Currency Crises where a country's Current Account balance, FX-mismatches, and monetary policies interact in dangerous ways. In general, there was also a lot of economics about International Finance and currencies, which I realized is superbly important but about which most people do not know!",
                "I learned a lot about systemic risk and how macroprudential authorities handle crises.",
                "This course has given me a much greater knowledge of and appreciation for different forms and causes of financial crisis. It is particularly useful for giving me tools and explanations for economic policy, which I may now use to analyze the world around me.",
                "Just like the course title implies, I gained a much better understanding of historical financial crises and how banks manage risk\/capital today. This course felt like a combination of history and finance as we went over various case studies of historical financial crises to understand how these crises began and how they we're solved. There is also a great focus on modern bank regulations and how banks currently balance risk and profits.",
                "Learned about various case studies that deal with systemic risk and other banking crises.",
                "I developed a much clearer understanding of financial stability and its derivatives, with a focus on the role of both central and commercial banks in the world economy.

                "Strength - Sigga is a great teacher! She is always super positive, supportive, and ready to teach us in class. She is also very clear and is an engaging lecturer. \r\n\r\nWeakness - I was expecting more case studies \/ history and economic models. Although we did cover the asian financial crises, the mexican peso crisis, and the Icelandic banking crisis, I thought we would cover more peripheral economies crises \/ case studies. Also this is very much a lecture course, not really a senior seminar. I think that was mostly because the class was conducted over zoom.",
                "Sigga is an amazing professor and has real-world practitioner experience to share. I wish the course had been more engaging, but I guess that's also just a product of being on Zoom. One huge weakness though is that this course assumes you have A LOT of background information on financial policy. This is definitely NOT a beginner course, and though its cross-listed with Global Affairs, if you're a Global student without Econ experience, you probably won't understand much. This is not a course where you learn what concepts are, but how those concepts are applied in various financial policies.",
                "Strengths: Teacher and material was fantastic, very well organized and thoughtful, teacher was reasonable with all deadlines and accommodations. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses but I really like when the lectures are recorded - makes synthesizing material much easier",
                "Strengths: Sigga is an amazing instructor.  She is very personable, meets with students often, and knowledgable about the material.  Sigga is the best.  The material is also super interesting.  The readings are not too long (3ish hours), interesting, and relevant.  The only weakness is I wish there had been more grading throughout the course because we have had no assignments graded up to this point and I wish I knew better how I was doing in the course.",
                "All strengths, especially in amount of reading assigned. Most of the reading is covered in lecture. I highly recommend taking notes on a laptop.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have not received any grades in the course until the final, which isnt too annoying, but sometimes I wish I had a progress report",
                "COVID seminars are generally difficult, and this was more of a leminar, though Sigga does make difficult topics far more engaging than they have any right to be. Still, especially given the audience of the course being overwhelmingly filled with bankers, a far more sociological angle on what bankers do to make things go wrong in banking crises would be far more interesting\/fruitful for who is in the classroom, which we did a bit in the first two weeks but never came back to. I feel as though the course ended up allowing many of the bankers in the room excuse themselves, in the end, of failures of the system because of our focus on the economic theory.",
                "Strength: Sigga is amazing and the assignments dont make this a stressful course Weaknesses: because there are no constant exams of quizzes, learning is really what you make of it, you can choose to engage with the material as much as you wish",
                "Strengths: engaging, thoughtful lectures. Also loved how open ended the final paper was. \r\nWeaknesses: Honestly none. Very well designed and executed course.",
                "Pretty much no weaknesses. There were not too many assignments, and the prof. always wanted to hear from all of us individually about what we are planning to do with the presentation or final research paper and prospectus. The Final Exam was quite straight-forward, but looking back, I would not have been able to do it which means I learned a lot. The weekly readings were manageable and varied, from theoretical research, policy notes, and even recent stability reports considering the COVID-19 Pandemic, and they were usually quite interesting and informative.",
                "It is definitely more of a small lecture than a seminar (so participation is sometimes hard) but Sigga is an amazing professor.",
                "One aspect of the class that I've really appreciated is the accomodation of personal areas of interest within the context of the class. Though class presentations and final papers, this class allowed us great freedom to write and present on topics that are personally interesting to us, within the framework of the material and concepts studied in class. This class did suffer, however, in the shift to an online format, as I'm sure seminar discussions would have been more lively in an in-person seminar.",
                "The strength is definitely the professor. Sigga is a wonderful lecturer who cares deeply about her students. She is one of the kindest professors I've met and she will work her hardest to ensure that every student has a great experience in her course. I also thought the material we went over in this course was very relevant, especially if you're interested in finance and history. I greatly enjoyed the case studies on financial crises that we went over during the course. The assignments and grading were very fair, which made this course not too stressful. I guess one small weakness of this course is the fact that being virtual eliminated many interesting discussions and debates that could've occurred in-person. This is nobody's fault and future iterations of this course will probably be in-person, which such make it more immersive.",
                "Strengths: very relaxed environment; content is very easily digestible.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no idea what your grade is throughout the semester.",
                "The course was very well structured and Sigga was always an engaging lecturer. The material wasnt particularly hard to understand and I thought all assignments were interesting. My only comment is that sometimes we covered too much material in each lecture."

This was partly due to the larger size of the seminar this semester, which made it easier to get lost in the crowd.

This course does come with its inevitable self-selected student group-- ie. bankers-- so that can be intimidating\/a toxic environment for non-bankers (I found myself glad that we weren't in a physical classroom, at times). If you're interested on hearing about some of the economic no-nos and common failures in economic systems that make financial crises happen, the class material is reasonably interesting.",
