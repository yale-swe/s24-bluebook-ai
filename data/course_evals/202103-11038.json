                "I learned French grammar structures, vocabulary, and culture. After this semester, I believe that my French reading skills have improved.",
                "I made great progress on my speaking skills in particular. \r\nMadame Schneider taught an incredibly organised and well-rounded course that challenged all of our skills whilst providing us with the support necessary to progress. \r\nAt no point did I ever feel overwhelmed by the course but neither did I ever feel unchallenged. \r\nI absolutely loved the course.",
                "I learned a lot of new French vocabulary, and I got the chance to advance my knowledge of the Francophone world and its different cultures as well as the relationship between France and its former colonies.",
                "Skills especially in speaking and formulating live responses in french. Lots of reading",
                "My French across the board improved, from grammar to vocabulary to speaking ability. Although this class was very much focused on reviewing grammatical concepts that you have likely encountered before, I definitely solidified my knowledge of these concepts. I also learned how to read French texts at a moderate pace without sacrificing comprehension, which was very useful. Finally, Mme Schneider was very helpful in teaching us how to write well in French.",

                "very high workload but if not very familiar with french then it's necessary to learn",
                "Strengths: This is a pretty good way to get through a lot of French content that you really need to know if you are going to go on and do more French. Strengths are a lot of structure and it's generally hard to fall behind because the pace is pretty constant. Weaknesses: There's not always enough support or consistency as one might be used to in an L1-L4 class. It can also feel hard to get a comment in during class.",
                "A large portion of this course is based on participation. While that offsets pressure on exams, it strongly motivates students to constantly participate even if they may not have clear thoughts. For each question Madame asks, there seems to be at least 3 hands trying to answer and it does get a bit exhausting trying to \"fight\" with other classmates in an effort to answer questions sometimes.",
                "Assignments were always well sized and never took too long/too little time. \r\nThe only weakness with the class was that I wouldve liked it if Madame Schneider had posted our grades on Canvas so that we could monitor our progress and recognise when we were falling back.",
                "The strength of this course is that there are a lot of resources available. At the same time, these resources can be overwhelming, and they can be hard to access since the pertinent resources for a day's homework might be located across three or four different sections of the course packet and it's hard to flip back and forth through such a large volume repeatedly. Also, I felt like there was a lot of busy work.",
                "Strengths: small number of students in class makes it easier for discussion, professor making the material fun and engaging\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "Strengths: great if you've taken french at yale and are entering at L5 level. Solidifies some past learning while putting it into practice\r\nWeaknesses: Not a lot of room for you to be learning any of this material for the first time",
                "Strengths: I really loved how there was a lot of speaking involved in this class, but it was done in an environment that wasn't stressful at all. I felt comfortable trying (and potentially failing) when expressing my thoughts in French, which was very helpful. I also loved the variety of assignments we did, involving writing, speaking, and more straightforward grammatical homework assignments. The books we read were super interesting and Prof. Schneider really put in a lot of effort to make every class engaging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only weakness I can think of is that the grammar quizzes are relatively difficult, but not impossible if you study for them!",
                "This course was extremely well-organized. There was a great balance of grammar, vocabulary, and reading in the homework. Watching the cinematic adaptations of the books we had just read in class also was helpful for listening and entertaining. The three compositions were great at consolidating grammatical concepts and integrating new words into my daily vocabulary."

It would definitely be important to take it in a less stressful semester, especially if you're not that naturally good at French. Also, just make a lot of time to find outside help. It's really not that bad, but do try to make sure you're only doing it if it's something that is furthering one goal or another.",
                "I would. If they would like to improve their French and they have just finished L4, this course would be perfect for them.",
                "Yes! It will help you become more confident at speaking French and conveying complex ideas in the language.",
                "Yes,",
                "I would recommend this course with one caveat. If this is your first French class at Yale (i.e., you're an incoming first-year with just an AP French background), I would expect to spend a lot more time at the beginning of the course reviewing all the grammar you need to know. Some AP French classes in the past might not have drilled grammar as intensively as this course requires, so definitely take some time (and go to office hours, Prof. Schneider is SUPER helpful there) to give yourself a good foundation! Otherwise, this class is really fun and not super difficult, so definitely take it if you need an L5 language credit/want to go deeper in the French department.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to improve the comfortability in communicating in French."
