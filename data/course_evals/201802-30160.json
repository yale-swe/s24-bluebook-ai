   "comments": [
    "This class covered a lot of important tenses (future, conditional, etc.) and moods (subjunctive, imperative) that are needed to further your understanding of Spanish grammar. There was a useful review of the past tenses (imperfect vs preterite) and other grammar topics, and a lot of the lessons were practiced through speaking activities, analyzing short Spanish films, readings, and even songs or games.",
    "I was able to further develop and improve my spanish skills, as we honed in on certain concepts we learned in Spanish 2.",
    "I learned and reviewed a lot of Spanish grammar, learned a lot of new vocabulary, and greatly improved my reading, listening, speaking, and writing.",
    "Spanish",
    "SPANISH S130 through the Bilbao Study Abroad Program helped strengthen my understanding and use of all verb tenses and grammatical knowledge from Yale's L1 and L2 courses -- present, imperfect, preterite, and present subjunctive -- in addition to learning new vocabulary.",
    "I learned extensively about a culture other than my own and how to communicate with those that have different norms and way of interacting.",
    "Gained more confidence and ability in Castilian Spanish",
    "By taking this course I was able to review the topics that I had previously learned in Spanish classes, improve my listening\/writing\/speaking skills, and learn some new topics in grammar.",
    "Basic Spanish grammar and vocab. L3 is effectively a review of everything from L1 and L2 with an emphasis on being able to employ the language through speech (more quickly and with fewer errors).",
    "I improved my ability to speak, read, and write Spanish.",
    "I was able to immensely improve my proficiency in the Spanish language"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed that my understanding of Spanish language was improved through various activities, but especially conversation. Taking this course during the summer, before the trip to Bilbao, Spain, is the best opportunity to practice the language and strengthen it before diving into another country's faster-paced conversation.\r\n\r\nI think some of the readings can be difficult, but in a good way, as that pushes you to look up words that you don't know, and try harder to understand the writing and find the grammar\/structures that you learn in the class.",
    "Strengths: There were a lot of worksheets, a lot of opportunities to share in class, and great teachers. \r\nWeaknesses: Nothing in particular",
    "This course is very quick and the grammar and vocabulary builds quickly, but the book exercises and homework help.",
    "Strengths: intensive\r\nWeaknesses: class is very early",
    "The professors for my section, Sebastian Diaz and Maripaz Garca, are terrific. It is clear that both professors care about their students' development and learning. Office hours were very accessible and plenty, as this summer course goes quickly through material. I believe the textbook presented the present subjunctive poorly, however with the help of Sebastian and Maripaz, one was about to workout issues and confusions.",
    "The strength of the course was the passion of the teachers and their honest desire for the students to do well. The weakness was probably the amount of homework outside of the classes that made it much less desirable to be engaged because it was just too much to enjoy it.",
    "Strengths: Variability of lecture materials and resources\r\nWeaknesses: Severely less effective then the 140 Abroad Counterpart. I would consider adjusting the itinerary of this program to more closely resemble that of Portuguese or Russian language programs, with 5-weeks abroad, or even mirroring Italian, with the full 8-weeks spent in Bilbao.",
    "The strengths are that it reviews things from previous levels of Spanish, allowing for a nice transition into this new course. The only weakness I encountered was that there wasn't quite as much writing practice as I would have hoped.",
    "I love how we were able to review everything from the previous two Spanish courses (building comfort with the use of the language) before going abroad to Bilbao, Spain. Well organized and appropriate difficulty.",
    "The strengths of S130 during the summer program is that class is every day for a long period of time, meaning the level of engagement and learning increase much greater than probably during a semester. The professors were great and made class enjoyable. Their knowledge on the subject and their ability to communicate effectively allowed my classmates and me to learn Spanish very quickly.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this course could be that class is a little too long, and if we do not get a proper amount of time for a break, then our level of engagement could decrease.",
    "The strengths of the course include vast vocabulary and grammar taught throughout the period and great support from the professors"

   "comments": [
    "This class is very fun and very important to the understanding of the Spanish language. I took the class having placed into L3, and it was the perfect review of material I learned in high school that I needed to refresh, and it was a great extension into new information.",
    "Yes, I would. I would especially recommend it to a student who wants to greatly improve on his Spanish skills and have more practice with Spanish.",
    "Yes, it is all necessary grammar and vocab that are useful in everyday life and you will use all the time.",
    "I would definitely recommend the Bilbao Study Abroad program as a whole. One truly improves on their Spanish through the direct placement of oneself in a Spanish speaking world. Bilbao (and Pas Vasco as a whole) is truly incredible.",
    "I absolutely would. I learned a lot of grammar in a short time and with dedicated professors.",
    "YES! This program is incredible.",
    "I would. Very straightforward. If you study a lot you can get 99% and if you don't study at all you probably will struggle a bit on exams.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student. I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about a foreign language and I loved my professors.",
    "Yes, I would because of the amount of Spanish I was able to learn within such a short period of time and the great classroom environment"
