                "This course is a good introduction to the major however problem sets seemed to not correlate with the lecture.",
                "I think the major strengths of this class are that learning some of the theoretical frameworks of CS is interesting and some of the problems we covered were kind of fun. Overall though, I don't think Yale's Intro to CS class should be taught in Racket (which seems to be a common opinion) and I think that is a fundamental weakness of this class.",
                "I loved that the instructor went over the problem sets in the class, it really helped us get a good start and actually understand what each question was asking. My one issue this that some problem sets were due the day after the midterms and that made it challenging to prioritize studying for the midterms.",
                "Strengths: The recorded lectures were key because I could watch in 2x speed & place bookmarks in the video for every topic, which I later returned to for specific homework problems and reviewing. Problem sets were graded relatively speedily and made it clear what tests you passed and did not & for what reason. Usually the psets were well-designed. Lots of ULA hours, both in person and online.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: You only know if your code is right, not if it's is good. No one looks at your code and tells you if you have bad form, are re-writing functions that are built-in to racket, overcomplicating things. Still, I don't see a way around this in a course so large. Also, Professor Slade is a very slow talker (maybe watch the lectures in 2x speed if you can keep yourself on top of it).",
                "Problem Sets and exams, though they cover the same material, implement the material in very different ways, and so bridging the gap between the two was often difficult. Lectures are super slow - much better off watching everything in 2x speed later.",
                "Very organized and tied in many big concepts together through the use of a relatively unpopular, but useful language (Racket). Teaches a functional language, compared to the popular imperative languages. Weaknesses: there was no incentive to show up to class and watch the material, so lectures were often sparsely filled with people.",
                "Lectures didn't really address topics in class completely but peer tutors were amazing",
                "It was incredibly disorganized and it was very difficult to see why we were doing certain things. However, it was also really rewarding if you want to learn material on your own.",
                "I think the lecture format can be unengaging sometimes.",
                "Strengths: Psets are like very satisfying puzzles, though one or two of them were very frustrating. Weaknesses: slow lectures that really drag, many of the ULAs dont seem very invested in being a ULA.",
                "I think Professor Slade is a strength of the course, even though I did not prefer his lectures. He is interesting and knowledgeable and wants to see his students love computer science. The course content is interesting and enjoyable as long as you are not expecting this to be solely a programming class. I thought the lectures were a weakness of the course as it was often difficult to follow along because the notes are presented in long documents. However, everything is available online and recorded, so this was not too much of a problem.",
                "Psets were very clear and useful to assist learning the content. However, some midterm assessments felt a bit odd because of the occasional question asking about edge cases. I think its valid to assess those but they dont really represent how much Ive learned and grown in the course.",

                "Could improve resources available for additional learning.",
                "I think that the structure of the class is quite nice. However, I wouldve appreciated it if we had more TAs at office hours. Also, I wouldve appreciated a more comprehensive final as opposed to one that primarily focused on topics from the last couple of lectures, which I did not at all expect.",
                "The strengths are the ULAs that are 6 and help immensely. The weakness is the content of the material that can sometime feel useless in the grand scheme of computer science.",
                "Fantastic PSETS, interesting material.  I found it difficult to justify going to lecture, but great course overall.",
                "Strengths: well-formed curriculum\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: hard to engage in class, psets were poorly explained, difficult to see the value in learning Racket so in-depth",
                "Strength is that the classwork is interesting, but the weakness is the timing of the class. In lecture, we would go over material for the next week's pset, while several of us are still working on the current week's assignment.",
                "I think more time on the problem sets due every week could be extended for the course.",

                "Racket is actually pretty cool but the testing/debugging features are very outdated.\r\n\r\nSlade is a bit of a slow lecturer and most people did not come to class.\r\n\r\nThe p-sets are very thought-provoking and the class topics are super interesting.\r\n\r\nThere was only one good ULA  (Ben) - the others wouldn't show up to office hours or would just be less than helpful.",
                "This course has some really amazing TAs who are always willing to sit down with you and work out the problem sets.",
                "The strengths are that all the resources I need were available, and the Problem Sets were very good at helping me learn the material. In terms of weaknesses, I wish there was more engagement in lectures.",
                "I think Professor Slade did a good job of trying to keep the class interesting. The psets were interesting and fun.\r\n\r\nI think the practice exams could be much improved as they were from nearly ten years ago and also in the final there were questions about topics we had only glossed over in class.",
                "Lectures could be more engaging but problem sets make you learn materials",
                "I would want more practice material for the exams. We only got like one practice test for each exam and I felt like I really wanted more actual prep.",
                "The strengths of this course are its topics. I think that the topics chosen are meaningful introductions to computer science, and provide a new student with a thorough recognition of the concepts upon which CS rests. The ULAs are also one of the strongest parts of this course, and were integral to my experience with the course.\r\n\r\nI believe it could be made better through a lecture style that incorporates more walkthrough tutorials. One of the most effective parts of the class for me is being walked through basic functions with the ULAs.",
                "Strengths: flexibility with submission deadlines, class recordings made available, lots of office hours opportunities. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "There is so much support in this course. There are ULA office hours at all times throughout the week, and the homework is extremely helpful for learning the topics discussed in class.",
                "The course is very intense and needs a lot of office hours. Although there are many office hours available, the availability of ULAs should be increased during weeks with really hard assignments because the queue gets very long and it is sometimes impossible to get help on time.",
                "I think that possibly more emphasis on programming would be helpful.",
                "I like how this course was a launchpad into the world of CS.\r\n\r\nI think the homework testing software was sometimes a little confusing to understand because of the line spacing. Perhaps doing a new line so that each OK is immediately visible would make it more readable.",
                "Soooo much work on the psets. Really time consuming but you do learn a lot.",
                "The online notes and recordings were very helpful because I could not go to the lectures",
                "Better supporting matetials",
                "- strength: going through psets with the professor before writing them, this helps answer questions and misunderstandings we might have\r\n- weakness: l still find it hard to practically implement some of the theoretical stuff l learnt",
                "Although many say that Racket is not a useful language, it does have its uses as a basis for understanding higher-level programming languages and functional programming is well-suited to the topics covered in the course. The material is interesting, but lectures arent a great use of your time (hence why they are so poorly attended) and the last problems on later p-sets can be extremely time-consuming and are not even tested on exams.",
                "Strengths  well-crafted problem sets and (with the exception of many UNIX principles), genuinely interesting material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses lectures can be very slow and not quite calibrated with the class's level of understanding (slow in places where people seem to understand, fast in places where people are confused). When many of the lectures take the form of following jupyter notebooks or going through the homework problems, it's understandable that the vast majority of students don't go to class. In addition, the material feels disjointed at moments  like we're learning a lot of unrelated principles at once, and none of them with much depth. Since I don't know too much about computer science, I could be wrong about this last assessment.",
                "One strength of this course is that the TAs for office hours were very helpful. They were very available and were there to help us answer all of our questions. I also appreciated the review sessions that they offered for our midterms and final exams. However, one weakness was that lecture was not very engaging (we just went through the online notes). It would have been more helpful if we had more content review in class as opposed to only learning through examples. Also some of the PSETs take much more time than others, and considering that one of them was right before a midterm was stressful. I also wish this class wasn't taught in Racket. It may be hard to get used to this language during the first weeks of class, but you do get used to it over time.",
                "Strengths: lecture notes, psets are very fun and manageable, Professor Slade is very kind and knows what he's doing since he's taught for so long \r\nWeaknesses: the lectures can feel a little long or slow sometimes, but they are recorded which is really helpful. I didn't enjoy all of the topics (TC-201), but there were so many of them that I found some I liked a lot too!",
                "The problem sets for this course were by far its greatest strength.  Though they could be challenging, they always helped reinforce the concepts and were often enjoyable to complete.  Most of my best learning in the course derived from doing the problem sets.  By contrast, the lectures were often not very good at enforcing material.  I think sometimes they were just not engaging enough to really get me to understand the concepts versus just sitting in the classroom and hoping I'd absorb them."

                "Yes, if they are a beginner coder and want to understand more foundational computer and coding concepts. Professor Slade is also very kind and wants you to succeed. He gives a generous curve and emphasizes that this is not a weeder class. However, most of the things we learn, given that Racket is not widely used, are not very useful for industry careers. If you have more coding experience then skip this class.",
                "Not unless required or you are really interested in the more theoretical side of CS. I took this to fulfill a requirement for the Cognitive Science major and I personally thought the topics were kind of meh except for the strings pset which I really enjoyed. Exams are very fair, but the hand-writing code takes some getting used to. Slade is a nice, funny guy but not an engaging lecturer. Definitely a huge downgrade from CS50.",
                "I think this is a great class for students who plan to pursue more computer classes in the future. The content is not very applicable to students who are not very interested in computer science, and for that reason, a more programming oriented course would be more suited for them. Otherwise, this course introduces many topics that are important to the field of computer science and are built on in later courses.",
                "Yes if they are interested in theory.",
                "Yes very useful skills",
                "If you want to learn recursion from the basics and are curious about the workings of computers, its a good introduction course. Itll take time to get used to racket but once you get comfortable, it gets far better.",
                "Only if u have to take it",
                "I surprisingly really like this course. The course work, grading, and exams were fair. While the professor was a little dry at times, I enjoyed the actual content we were learning about.",
                "Only if you need it; there are many other CS courses that will give a better overview/introduction",
                "No, only if required for major.",
                "Yes! If you know how to manage your time, youll do extremely well in the class. Also, Professor Slade is an amazing teacher who really cares about his students. Youll learn a lot and be in a very cool environment in doing so.",
                "If you are interested in majoring in Computer Science, take the course.",
                "Yes, really changed how I understand computation.",
                "No. Skip it, even if you have limited programming experience.",
                "Yes, if you haven't done much programming and want a solid base to continue with programming.",
                "Yes I would, it is a very interesting course.",
                "No you learn superficially",
                "No.",
                "Yes - recursion is SO fundamental in programming!",
                "Yes, I believe this course is fundamental to any students learning.",
                "Yes. This course is great if you want to learn about recursion and if you want to get started in Computer Science and Yale.",
                "Yes. I think you learn a lot of interesting things and it would be fun even if one wasnt a computer science major",
                "yes, I believe this class helped me understand recursion and other topics that should help me with other classes.",
                "I think I would. It's tough, but you'll learn a lot if you aren't familiar with CS already. That being said, I don't know how practical some of the topics are and how much you really need to know them in the future.",
                "I would only recommend it if you have taken CS50 or another introductory CS class. If this is your first CS class, even if you are capable of doing math/science/other QR courses, it is rather difficult to keep up, and will end up consuming far more time than you are willing to give. Even if you are experienced in QR, CS201 as a first CS class will end up making you sacrifice more than you want.",
                "Yes! It really made me think and improved my logical skills.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot in this course, and the course was very doable (even for someone like me, who hadn't previous taken a CS course at Yale) and was designed to facilitate our learning.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, if they want to learn about recursion, computer architecture, and Boolean expressions.",
                "Yes! It is a great way to get into the field of CS and it demonstrates the wide range of possibilities.",
                "Not particularly. Just soooo much work for concepts that you could easily practice on your own and a lot of specialized language for just CS201. However, the course is a great opportunity to hone in recursion skills and learn basic science of computers if you dont have an ability to learn it yourself, or typically learn.",
                "Yes if they are interested in computer science",
                "Yes if youre interested in computers",
                "I actually liked 201 as someone who has taken APCSA and APCS Principles. The course does cover some concepts you likely will never use again, but the experience you get sitting with concepts and problem-solving/troubleshooting is good practice in my opinion. It will get frustrating sometimes, but it is rewarding in the end if you keep trying. It did give me a very strong foundation in coding recursion and learning a completely new language. Racket is really not all that bad. The TAs are a little hit-or-miss, but go to office hours anyways if you are struggling. You will find a good one eventually. Or make 201 friends! As for the lectures, they are long and boring, no lie. But sometimes they are worth watching on 2x.",
                "Yes, cause it opens your mind to different ways of writing computer programs to address the same issue",
                "Only if you are pursuing the CS major or certificate or have a strong dual interest in CS  unless you have an extensive background in CS, there is some benefit to taking this before 223 and 323. Dont take this course just for fun or to try out CS though, there are better courses for that! Lectures are entertaining but not necessarily that helpful for your learning, but the course material was interesting. Some people spent 20-25+ hours on later p-sets, so be prepared to be devote time to this course. Midterms werent too difficult if you know what to expect; the final was more challenging.",
                "Yes, if you're a CS major or deeply interested in the theoretical components of computer science. If do not have to take it or are not naturally drawn to computation, there are better courses to take.",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if they are planning to declare the Computer Science major! If you want to learn programming, I would reccomend taking CSPC 100 (aka CS 50), CSPC 112, or CSPC 110 instead. This is not a class that teaches you about programming (even though we do learn Racket), but more so core concepts in computer science theory (such as the runtime of programs). However, half of students in this class do get grades of A and A!",
                "If you are a computer science student who wants to learn more about computer science, then yes! This class wasn't my absolute favorite, but I enjoyed it! I think you do need to have some coding/programming experience before taking 201, or else you would feel very lost. The course is very manageable and I did learn some applicable skills to improve as a cs student (recursion!). I debated moving straight to 223 instead of 201, and I'm glad I took 201 to learn some of these more basic elements of programming before moving to 223.",
                "If you are doing Computer Science, I would recommend taking this course for obvious reasons.  Otherwise, I really would not recommend doing this course if you only have passing interest in Computer Science or want to take an intro CPSC course.  What it teaches is helpful for computer science majors only for the most part.",
                "Yes. Take this course because it teaches you a lot about the fundamentals of computer science."
