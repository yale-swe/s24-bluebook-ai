                "In this seminar, I studied all of Austen's works, and learned how to think critically about what I was reading. It was really fun to analyze literature because there is always so much to talk about! I had also never analyzed film before, so our discussion on \"Clueless\" forced me to consider all of the motives behind the director's decisions and the effective result from them.",
                "I learned all about the most important themes that run through Austen's oeuvre, including the importance of mortification scenes, the relationship between the Bildungsroman plot and the courtship plot, the importance of narrative conventions, etc. I learned how to clarify my writing and my word choice.",
                "Definitely improved my close reading and analytical skills! And my writing.",
                "Through this course, I learned how to write and think critically on a much deeper level. Professor Markovits's teaching and guidance completely changed the way I approach, write, and edit my papers. I learned to consider themes and ideas in very different ways when analyzing and reading Austen's works. I feel appreciative of this experience. My mindset changed significantly about the writing and editing process, which I now understand as a journey of rethinking and rewriting. Austen's nuances and messages have provided me with insight far beyond the course, especially the importance of recalibration.",
                "My writing skills improved significantly throughout this course, and I was able to read all of Jane Austens works  something I never imagined I would be able to do. Looking back, this course has been a really positive and impactful experience that has shaped my first year at Yale.",
                "Knowledge of Jane Austen's work, useful insights on the essay writing craft.",
                "This course will make you an amateur expert in Jane Austen. You will learn to read actively with great attention to detail and to write and speak precisely about what you read.",
                "I feel that I fundamentally understand essay organization and flow better because I took this course. I have insight into Austen's novels that I never would have gained had I read her works on my own  her novels are filled layers and layers deep with meaning, and I walked away from every class buzzing with what I had learned. (Northanger Abbey: Austen is thinking about language and the ways women acquire knowledge! Pride and Prejudice: Austen is thinking about happiness and judgement!)",
                "This course truly showed me how to analyze texts and look beyond the superficial level in order to find hidden meanings, deep themes, social critiques, and messages from the author. Due to the high workload, I also became a faster reader and learned how to look for important sections in each novel that would most likely be discussed in class. The essays also helped me become a more critical reader and writer, following a specific argument and finding passages in novels that supported the points I wanted to make."

            "comments": [
                "I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this class. Our class discussions were always engaging, and my peers would interpret things in ways which I hadn't considered, or sometimes disagreed with; this made discussion very fun and interesting. I think the pacing of the novels was perfect for the semester, as well as the timing of the essays. I did have to remind myself not to forget the 10AM/12 PM deadlines on assignments, just because the time cutoff of assignments is different from the midnight deadlines I was used to.",
                "Strengths - The discussions in this class were some of the most fascinating I've ever had. I loved the way that Austen never became repetitive in our conversations, we were able to track recurring themes without the discussion becoming boring. The writing assignments gave me so much feedback on how I could improve as a writer. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The class emphasized one perspective on each interpretation of the text, and Professor Markovits was not very open to new, personal interpretations of the text that had not been backed by highly acclaimed critical sources. There could be more room for encouraging students to take unique and original interpretations to the text instead of just changing their views to agree with Professor Markovits.",
                "This is the best class I have ever taken! Professor Markovits is an incredible professor who is knowledgeable, prepared, thoughtful, and passionate about the material and teaching students. Short of adding an experiential component of traveling to Jane Austen's house in Chawton, England, I see no path to improve  it is amazing as is. The volume of the course material is manageable, with reasonable time provided to complete assignments. The class discussion is guided well by Professor Markovits, and allows students a safe space to share their thoughts and discuss complex analyses. The reading responses provided an informal way to think deeply about each book in preparation for class discussion.",
                "Professor Markovits provides extremely detailed feedback, unparalleled to what any other professor provides. The opportunity to write drafts for feedback and rewrite the midterm was also very helpful and encouraging. It is very clear that Professor Markovits aims to help her students grow as writers throughout the course. However, I was discouraged at some points in the course when it felt as though Professor Markovits had a very specific interpretation of the novel and only wanted to hear that interpretation reiterated.",
                "Strengths: very thorough and useful feedback on essays, interesting class discussion with very interesting people, well led by the professor, the professor is really invested in and seems to enjoy teaching and is there to help you understand and improve, the format of the three essays over the course of the semester is well thought-out.",
                "This courses strength is its depth. It is a unique opportunity to read the entire body of work of an author over the course of the semester, and it is really fun to get to know the author so well. Professor Markovits is another strength of this course. She leads great, engaged discussions and asks a lot of her students. The weakness of the course is how much reading there is. You should be prepared to read about 500 pages a week with no breaks for writing essays.",
                "Strengths: The discussions were outstanding. Professor Markovits guides but doesn't dominate, and the class covered an amazing range of topics together that blew my mind about whatever we had read. The novels themselves are remarkable  so masterfully done and so entertaining that reading them never felt like homework. (Austen's Emma is now my favorite book of all time. ) The workload is significant but absolutely manageable; I felt like I got out just as much as I put in. Professor Markovits reads and offers comments on full drafts of essays, which is incredibly helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Our classroom was 90% women and 90% white people (probably because it's Austen), which can be a trend throughout the English department; I wish we'd centered race a little more in our conversations about Mansfield Park and Sanditon. I also wish we were able to spend four lessons on some the novels instead of three  Emma and Persuasion in particular felt truncated.",
                "This course had a lot of strengths. For one, there were only 10 people in the class, which allowed for much discussion to take place and also allowed each student to participate many times during each class. Another strength was Professor Markovits' very well-organized discussion plans. Though there was time to bring up topics that had not been addressed, our instructor had a lesson plan that addressed the most important topics and passages in the novels, helping as a strong point to begin meaningful discussions. I liked the order in which we read the novels, so we got to see how Austen's writing and ideas progressed and we were able to talk about this. Another strength in the class was the complementary readings provided, which gave a lot of context to the readings and understanding of Austen's writing in general."

                "If you love Austen, or really want to become familiar with her work, absolutely! The timeline of the class is perfectly structure to get through all of Austen's works, including her \"Teenage Writings.\" You read a novel each week/week and a half, so there is a considerable time commitment for reading ~100 pages between classes, BUT it is totally worth it. Trust me, I would not be saying that if it were not true. If you are truly invested in the class, the reading is fun and doesn't feel like work at all. (This is coming someone who skims their readings sometimes.) You don't need to be an English major or Yale's most talented writer to have the best time in this class.",
                "Yes, if you love Austen, this class will allow you to see her through a million different lenses: the novels themselves, movies, critical sources, discussions, your own essays, and even Austen fan fiction. This course never felt repetitive, and we approached the modern applications of Austen and studied the Austen phenomenon at large through the merch, spinoff movies, and fan fiction that has been created about her. This class is a real gem!",
                "Yes. Was fantastic. Super fun, we had great discussions. Everyone taking this course was super excited about Jane Austen and that created a really nice, lively environment. It is a lot of reading. Almost a novel a week. But I found that super fun and refreshing, a nice break from doing psets. Would highly recommend if you like Austen or if you've never read her but think you'd like her! We read everything she's everrr written, which was very cool.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! I was hesitant to take this seminar (because I am not planning on being an English major), but I feel so happy I did. Moving forward, I hope to take more English classes, and also hopefully classes taught by Professor Markovits. This course has changed my life and made me love and appreciate writing and Austen.",
                "If you take this course, be prepared for an extremely high workload  but, it is very rewarding. The readings and preparation for class discussion will take up the majority of your time out of class, but you will feel extremely accomplished and grow as a student at the end of the course.",
                "Yes. Professor Markovits is great and has a very rigorous approach to literary criticism which is great to learn from.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are w willing and excited to put a lot of effort and time into the class. You really should be prepared to do a lot of in-depth reading and writing, and Professor Markovits expects a lot from your work. The class is fun! And seminars feel sort of like a book club.",
                "Yes yes yes yes YES. If you are interested in Austen, if you are interested in reading at all, if you've heard of Pride and Prejudice but that's basically it  take this course. This class made me become an English major. It was the highlight of my first year at Yale. I am a better reader, writer, and thinker because of it. There's a lot of reading, but the novels are phenomenally smart and funny and complicated and romantic, and reading them never felt like homework. I looked forward to this class every week.  The syllabus covers Austen's juvenile writings and her full-length novels alongside her unfinished works, and even makes room for literary criticism and a few movie adaptations, which I loved. Professor Markovits is outstanding. Her mastery of these novels was a joy to witness. Her feedback was incredibly detailed and she engaged with our essays, discussion posts, and comments in class so deeply.",
                "I would completely recommend this course to any student interested in literature, history, and Jane Austen. Though I had read some of Austen's novels before the course, my perception and understanding of them completely changed after reading them closely, discussing them in class, and writing argumentative essays about them. Though students must be prepared for a high workload as every book is supposed to be read in about a week, the readings were all interesting and the discussion that stem from the reading are all truly engaging and interesting."
