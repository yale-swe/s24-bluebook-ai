                "This course was filled with non-synchronous group activities, which took up time that could have been used conversationally signing. Grammar lessons and culture discussions also could have been signed, but we were required to write them instead. Additionally, though we only met for 50 minutes three times a week, we spent more than half the time in breakout rooms.",

                "Strengths: frequent meetings keeps the language fresh in your brain, our small groups were amazingly helpful, and the amount of content presented visually on canvas was great. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it was hard to understand signs I didn't know or were variations of signs previously learnt and fingerspelling is still difficult. Signing a bit slower would improve this.",
                "There were so many strengths! Casey was one of them - the only reason this semester was as awesome as it was is because we had a great professor! The weekly 'vlogs' completed with our groups as well as our ENP's were open-ended, allowing us to sign about things that interested us - which definitely aided in my ability to understand the material. There were plenty of opportunities for practice\/instruction, whether it be from our 3x-week Zoom meetings, our group Zoom meetings, or even one-on-one meetings with Casey. The class was super organized, which is always great in a language class, as the work can often get confusing and overwhelming. One weakness was the amount of work. Although the smaller, weekly vocabulary and grammar assignments weren't long or difficult, they sometimes felt a little tedious to complete every week."

                "I really appreciated that this class wasn't every day as it would have been in person. It was really nice to have less time on Zoom, as well as the additional time to do coursework in the empty time slots. Casey was also super flexible about attendance and late assignments and was constantly making class time to check-in with everyone and see how we're doing.",
                "I think ASL is always going to be challenging to teach over the internet and not in-person.

                "DEFINITELY! If you ever get the chance to take ASL 130, especially with Casey, DO IT! You will not regret it! Casey is a great instructor who took the time to both teach AND have fun with us - whether it be directly related to the class or not. I was excited to go to class every other day, and I looked forward to getting to work on my video assignments every week. If you are dedicated to getting your work done and paying attention in the Zoom meetings as well as the asynchronous work, this class will be very manageable, and Casey always provided clear feedback on what I was doing well and what I could improve on. It was a vast difference from ASL 120, where I often felt I didn't understand what I was getting points off for. Long story short, 10\/10 would reccomend!",
