                "Strengths: The lectures were very clear, and I think the material selection was very good; I didn't feel like we were doing anything just for the sake of doing it - as many of the ideas are essential.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This might be a weakness of me and not the course, but I feel like I still don't understand some of the material we covered at a very deep and intuitive level, as the pace was quite fast.",
                "Strength: the problem sets were very well designed and probably ended up being responsible for ~85% of the actual learning. Also the instructor was very good.\r\nWeakness: I actually thought that doing commutative algebra and category theory in a single course worked fine, but the algebraic geometry portion somehow felt unmotivated even though it was supposed to be the application of the material we learned up to that point. I would also say that more intuition\/examples can never really hurt.",
                "Professor Loseu's lectures are very clear and his psets solidify your understanding of the material. He pauses frequently to give students opportunities to  collect their thoughts and ask questions.",
                "Strengths: Lectures were extremely clear and well-organized. Grading was timely, and comments on assignments were helpful. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "Overall a very solid course. My one complaint is that sometimes I felt like I would've benefitted from more examples for certain concept\/definitions when trying to understand them.",
                "The lectures were clear and well-paced, despite the large amount of material to cover. The homework was time-consuming but not unreasonable, and generally involved interesting extensions or examples of what we saw in class. If I had to change something, I'd want more time to be spent discussing tensor products, perhaps focusing more on specific examples; that was by far the most confusing part of the course for me."

                "This is certainly a higher-workload class, but I would still recommend it if you want to come through with a good understanding of commutative algebra. It takes a more categorical approach, so you will end up seeing things that you might have already seen in the language of category theory and how it all fits together. The material here is essential for anyone who wants to dig deeper in algebra. I'd say the problem sets certainly took a lot of work, but if you're willing to put in the hours, it is definitely worth it to do so.",

The course deals with a lot of abstract concepts, which are sometimes hard to nail down. If you liked abstract algebra, it's like that but more so. Abstract algebra is my favorite area of mathematics, so I definitely enjoyed this class; take from that what you will."
