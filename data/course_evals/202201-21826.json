You cover much less material than ECON 159 and the problems are less fun but you really get to understand the material in a new way.

Was excited to learn game theory, but instead mostly learned a lot super theoretical equations and these were not very well connected to their practical applications which made it incredibly difficult to learn. In lecture the prof just repeated the notes verbatim and offered no additional insight, so it was not worth it to ever attend.",

This included discussion of a variety of solution concepts for a variety of different types of games (e.g. Nash Equilibrium, dominance, rationalizability, zero-sum games, repeated games, Bayesian Games, etc.). Learned a little bit about auctions and mechanism design at the very end, and covered some methods to model-knowledge (which I thought was pretty cool).\r\nReally, though, this class was just as thinking class. It stretched you in providing non-trivial proofs of several important and sometimes surprising results in game theory, and the HWs were often exercises in just creative problem solving just as much as they were in understanding the material from the lecture notes. This means the course generally was valuable to build skills in tackling problems both in general and in game theory.",

                "This course was superb for anyone willing to put in the time. It does require a strong math background, and a fair level of engagement, but the results are well worth it.",
                "Strack is a nice guy but not a good lecturer. He is very smart so he goes quickly and skips over confusing aspects of proofs and struggles to correct for this when people ask follow up questions. The psets are very challenging and often there isn't an example of a solution even for the easier problems in the lecture notes so it is very hard to even begin homeworks.\r\nNonetheless, this makes sure you really learn the material and after each problem set I felt confident in what we were doing. Just getting to this knowledge was very challenging. Some problem sets had problems that nobody solved the answer to and the TAs said they didn't know how students could even be expected to do so. The lecture notes are very well written.",
                "It's not very organized and sometimes it was really hard to get help",
                "I believe this course was taught well, but there should be an explanation of the connections behind lecture content, pset content, and exam content. All three of these areas felt like completely different courses.",
                "Strengths: I cannot think of any, this course totally sucks haha. The TAs were helpful but there were not many office hours and section times were inconvenient. \r\nWeaknesses: class was sooo boring. Material that could have been very interesting was made extremely dry and near impossible to sit through. The problem sets were extremely convoluted especially given the exceptionally poor teaching. There are also very few mathematics prerequisites, so for someone like me with not much mathematical background",
                "Strengths: Really cool material. Really good problem sets: Yes, these problems sets are often quite difficult and/or frustrating and without a single approach to solve some problems, but this also means you genuinely feel accomplished when you solve them (also this year they let you work in groups on the PSETS, and this made it manageable and collaborative, so this was great!). A strength of this course is that it didn't shy away from formal arguments and proofs, which made it challenging but also made it feel much more like a formal analysis and clearly helped me build intuition and a deeper understanding of what was really going on. Also excellent lecture notes, and I thought Strack, though sticking close to the lecture notes, actually added a lot of value beyond the lecture notes in his presentation in class! Also exams and grading felt fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The main weakness was just how disconnected the lectures were from most of the PSETS and exams. In class we often would cover more complex or one-off examples of how to solve stuff, but this meant that we really didn't know basic techniques until either figuring stuff out by trial and error or going to OH with the TFs where they would show us canonical ways of solving certain sorts of problems (a good example of this was solving for all correlated equilibria). One way this might be mitigated would be to have TF sessions cover these problem solving methods for the NEXT WEEKS PSET, instead of going over the last week's solutions (we would have to go over these solutions ourselves, but I think this is a worthy tradeoff).",
                "The course was initially reverse classroom, then the professor just went over notes in class.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: Some lectures were very dense and heavily mathematical",
                "Strengths: the material is interesting. Probably a weakness is that in the first few problem sets there are some questions that arent so immediately related to material covered, but that I think is partially because you havent done so much yet.",
                "PSETS are ridiculously hard and have nothing to do with the exams. Too mathy for CS, and definitely people that don't have a Math background like myself struggle a lot.",
                "class boring, don't learn real game theory just prove useless stupid stuff, don't gain insight on how to solve problems",
                "The course lectures were a little confusing at times and the pace was a little fast.",
                "really hard and not well taught!",
                "This course was interesting and has great applications. However, it was not well structured in that the psets, exams, and lectures were not cohesive or related to each other. I think it would be helpful to do more examples in class, relevant to the psets and lectures. It would also be useful to have more office hours throughout the week.",
                "This course was challenging in its workload.",
                "Strenghts: rigorous, well taught\r\nWeaknesses: there is a discrepancy between problems sets and class material, which stems from the class structure. Nothing too bad, and it would be hard to address it without significantly increasing the difficulty of the problem sets anyways.",
                "Strengths: the material is very interesting and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios like auctions and negotiations. The professor was always open to answering questions and really cared that you understood the material. The TFs were very helpful during office hours.\r\nWeaknesses: The professor didnt hold office hours.",
                "Some of the topics like those towards the end got a bit complicated, but the professor tested fairly based on the examples we had worked through in class and through psets.",
                "strengths: detailed instruction at a reasonable pace; weaknesses: math prerequisites didn't align with level of math used in the course, very challenging homework problems",
                "I'd enforce separate writeups on psets. You inherently know the questions you wrote up better which can hurt you on the final.",
                "Strengths: the material was fun and challenging\r\nWeaknesses: it moved too fast",
                "I think that more office hours should be offered each week. Instead of the TA's switching off each week for office hours, each of them should both host office hours for 2 hours a week. This is difficult information to learn and if you are struggling 2 hours a week is not enough because during those 2 hours you have to focus on getting the pset done for that week. I think this course should also account for the fact that people come from different math backgrounds, for example people who are majoring in Econ and Math have a lot more experience in writing proofs and with higher level math as compared to people who major in computer science and economics.",
                "The lecture notes are relatively well written and detailed enough for students to learn from.\r\n\r\nThe reverse classroom structure of the course at the beginning was not effective for learning. However, when we changed to normal in-class lectures, I thought that the material was taught sufficiently well. \r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of the course is how the lectures, problem sets, and exams basically do not relate to each other at all. It is extremely frustrating to spend so much time on problem sets only to have them count for 10% of one's final grade. And then, when it is time for the exams, one needs to learn a completely new set of problem-solving skills. It is also extremely frustrating that exams often require you to see the \"trick\" to solve that particular problem. If one does not see it, the problem is not solvable. Furthermore, the lectures sometimes become so theoretical and mathematical that they don't really apply to homework or exams. There needs to be more continuity between class, homework, and exams.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are pretty solid. Weaknesses: Homework are sometimes just research results, so not super helpful as exercises. There isn't a textbook; the lecture notes are pretty good, but still has some holes--so you definitely have to go to lecture to get a full understanding.",
                "I think the link between lecture notes, the actual lecture, and the recorded lecture early on in the class could have been done a little more consistently",
                "HORRIBLE class. Do not take this class unless you have to. In class lecture is almost entirely proofs and the professor seems to not care much for if students are actually picking up what he is teaching. The entire lecture is him writing lecture notes that have already been given to you on the blackboard, not to mention the notes are incredibly dense, notation heavy and hard to follow. Problem sets in class are also extremely difficult and only manageable because you can do them in a group. Compared to lecture, exams are more drill questions which end up being quite challenging since you see no examples of these problems in class given that the professor is so focused on proofs and theory. I question why this class is even a requirement especially for CSEC as it seems to incorporate little to no CS and the professor never acknowledges that his students are coming from different backgrounds to understand a pretty complicated topic.",
                "The course is very mathematically rigorous. Various important proofs such as Brouwer's fixed point theorem are introduced as background in order to prove different properties of games. The course surveys most of the fundamental types of games, providing a solid foundation for future research.\r\n\r\nSome of the weaknesses of the course include a disconnect between in-lecture material, the questions on the problem sets, and the questions on the exam. Lecture material is oftentimes very theory-heavy and focused on high-level concepts about games. The problem sets are based on the lecture theorems, but often involve creative twists that makes them difficult to solve without OH help. The exams are primarily mechanical-type questions for applying specific solution concepts, a skill which is not directly practiced by solving the problem sets.",
                "This course is really hard. The class is taught very poorly and the lecture notes are very difficult to read if you do not have a strong background in math. This class is the worst in the econ/math major and if you can drop the major before its too late, you should. It definitely helps to take a game theory course and introductory analysis before this class to know how to solve the problems and better read notation. The class could be improved if the problem sets were not done in groups, if there were practice problems done in class, and if there were a better way to learn the material than from dense lecture notes.",
                "Not very well organized or taught",
                "Overall decent course with cool material.\r\n\r\nFlipped classroom at the beginning of the year was terrible, glad that was changed.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a huge disconnect between the professor, the TAs, and the students as far as expectations for problem sets, solutions to problem sets, and exam material. The lack of communication made it confusing to know what material we needed to study."

Familiarity with mathematical notation is also important, although it can be learned on the fly if necessary. Do not take this course expecting an easy Ait requires work and engagement. The results are resoundingly worthwhile.",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in graduate school, with very strong math backgrounds, and interest in solving small game theory problems. The material is too challenging to apply any of the cool applications that game theory has so a survey course like ECON 159 would be much better if you are just interested in learning game theory.",
                "Definitely not but sadly it is required for some majors :/ It is taught very poorly and the problem sets are way too hard for the poor teaching of the material. It is honestly easier to teach yourself and go to the TAs to beg for help rather than sit through the painful lectures.",
                "(If it is required for your major then you have no choice, but otherwise read on...) Yes, if they enjoy or want exposure to proof based approaches to game theory and enjoy or want experience solving demanding problems which require clever ideas. I found the class super rewarding, with interesting material while still being pretty approachable if you have some proof based math background (if you don't have the background then I imagine this would be quite challenging and potentially disorienting) and I genuinely enjoyed solving some of the HW problems, and seeing some of the cool results covered in class.\r\nPotentially the most rewarding part of the class is just now being much more confident in seeing some problem which seems super complex and isn't at all formulaic, and still being able to make a genuine attempt and make progress on it which I know I wouldn't have been able to make before the class.",

If you think you would be very interested in game theory and are good at thinking mathematically (eg you did well in analysis) then this course could be fun for you. It is easier if you take it with friends because having groups for psets makes it much more doable.",

                "Only if you need to take it. I was really scared about this class (the reviews from previous semesters were quite scary). Coming in I had only done CS 202 so the math was overwhelming and I felt some imposter syndrome when the professor would do these proofs in class that I struggled to follow. It wasnt necessary to understand everything in each proof to do the exams and homework, and sometimes the professor would explicitly say they werent exam/homework material. Overall the class went alright. The psets had tough questions but youre allowed to work closely in groups so that helped a lot (and TF office hours made them more manageable). Theyre also graded generously. For the exams, I did the practice ones which prepared me well. The final was tough. If youre like me and dont have a ton of math in your background you can do well in the class. Just dont skip class and read the notes.",
                "Yes, I would recommend, especially if it is with Philipp Strack. He takes the time and effort to make the class reasonable and well-organized.",

I feel like this class should be an elective to the CS/Econ and not a requirement since game theory is an application of economics. Also for the Computer Science Major and for the Economics major game theory is not a requirement so I do not think it should be a requirement for the CS/Econ Major.",
                "Eh, not really. Unless you need the course for your major, I don't think learning the math and theory behind game theory was useful or helpful. Sometimes, we would get so bogged down in the math that the main takeaways get lost. Also, the discontinuity between lectures, homework, and exams is extremely frustrating. It's almost like taking three different courses. Although you spend many hours a week on homework, it only counts for 10% of your final grade. It seems like a few people I've spoken to really enjoyed the normal game theory and thought that course was eye-opening. I cannot say the same for this more \"advanced\" game theory course. It really does not satisfy one's intellectual curiosity because I just had no clue what we were trying to do. I'd much rather learn more about deeper insights and takeaways.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn about game theory. Even though it's \"mathematical\", the material is still pretty practical. We do cover some general results, but some of the them are pretty far removed from the actual homework/exam problems.",
                "I would recommend it to anyone who is actually interested in game theory and is willing to put in the effort to figure out how certain rules and game mechanics work by rereading the notes",
                "NO. Only take if you have to for the major. This class is extremely challenging and you have to be good at math and already come in with understanding on how to read proofs/dense notation to do well.",
                "I would recommend this to another Computer Science & Economics major because it contains important material at the intersection of both subjects. However, if you are not interested in the subject or do not have a fair background in economics/statistics, you may find it difficult to engage with many of the challenging questions and concepts in the problem sets.",
                "Not unless the student is very proficient in math and wants to go to graduate school. The material is definitely interesting, but the class is not worth it. Take another game theory. Please do NOT take this course for a social science credit.",
                "No, not a good course",
                "I would not recommend this class. The class was rather poorly organized and lectures were often difficult to follow, even if the material being covered was relatively straightforward. I had taken ECON 159 previously, and at least for the first half of this class, the majority of the content was stuff we covered in ECON 159, except it was taught better in 159 in my opinion. Additionally, problem sets in this class were only 15% of the final grade, and so the majority of the grade comes from the midterm (35%) and final (50%). The psets often required a considerable amount of time, and would usually have a few difficult questions on them, which meant I had to spend a lot of time every week doing something that affected my grade disproportionately little, which was disheartening. In my view, I don't see any reason why this class is a requirement for the CSEC major. We didn't really even cover anything related to CS - it was all math stuff. Furthermore, there was a significant enough overlap with ECON 159 for me to question why this class is even required."
