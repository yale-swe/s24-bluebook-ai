I learned more political philosophy than I'd ever learned before and also gained exposure to comparative international politics. This course definitely pushed me intellectually in many ways.",
                "In this course, you primarily study and think about the lives and careers of Nelson and Winnie Mandela. Through that, you touch upon a ton of different interesting debates and subjects: the challenges of biography and studying people's lives, apartheid  South Africa, the anti-apartheid movement, philosophy related to these things, debates about political violence, decolonization, and South African culture. While many topics are not covered so in depth, I definitely feel I left knowing much more about South Africa, the Mandelas, and some interesting debates and philosophy that their lives interact with. Additionally, you write two papers in the course which you have lots of freedom/license to decide topic on, so you can also learn about other topics through them.",

                "This course covered fascinating content and was able to look at the Mandelas from so many angles. I loved reading Prof. Steinberg's unpublished book throughout the semester. At the beginning of the semester, seminars were very unstructured (sort of tutorial-style, I think), but I noticed that Prof. Steinberg incorporated more structured framing throughout the semester, which I really appreciated.\r\nThe papers were exciting in the freedom we had with them; I did feel like I needed to meet with Prof. Steinberg to get a more defined idea of what I wanted to write about, and those meetings ended up being really fruitful and helpful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Steinberg is a really intelligent, and insightful Professor. When he talks in class, it is always super valuable. Additionally, many of the readings were really fantastic, both those about the two people, and those related to them (Fanon, writing about Gandhi, writing about the apartheid negotiations). The main book of the course (Professor Steinberg's book) is also really engaging and insightful. I always read it first and it didn't feel like work at all. Also, Professor Steinberg is a super interesting primary source in himself, he was an anti-apartheid student activist during apartheid, and a part of the Afrikaner community. I really liked the freedom we were given with the papers. Steinberg was super available to help, but very much wanted us to write about what we wanted to, which I appreciated. Finally, Professor Steinberg is just a really lovely, interesting person and was always kind to me.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish Professor Steinberg would \"lecture\" more. The students had interesting points, and discussion was definitely stimulating, but he just had so much knowledge about intellectual debates about the subject and the period itself, I would have loved to hear more. Additionally, I think the course could have used a little more background context about apartheid itself, I felt that I learned about it as I went along, but I could have used a little prior knowledge before diving into Nelson and Winnie's lives. However, overall, the course is very good and I felt I learned a lot about Nelson and Winnie, and the context and debates that surround them."

                "Yes! I was interested in so many aspects of the course, and I hadn't ever taken a class with so much focus on political leaders and philosophy. I learned a lot from my peers as well.",
                "I would recommend it. I learned so much in this course, and actually took a lot more away from it than I thought I would. For example, the course is focused on the Mandelas, but I also came out having learned a lot about decolonization, the politics of resistance movements and Gandhi. I would caveat this by saying to only take it if you have an interest in South Africa or studying political leaders, as even though it is broad, much of the course centers on these two subjects. Also, the workload is not too bad and many of the readings are narrative history, and thus actually enjoyable! Also, Professor Steinberg is a super interesting, intelligent person, and worth taking a class with."
