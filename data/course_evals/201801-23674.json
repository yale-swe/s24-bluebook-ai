    "Great course. I enjoyed it much more than L1 and L2 (although that may just be due to the instructor). Felt like my reading and writing skills improved a lot, speaking somewhat",
    "If the year want to learn Spanish then yes",
    "Yes! Especially with Profesora Reymundi. The course definitely improves writing, listening, and speaking skills. It picks up from L2 and not only does it improve these skills but challenges them and dives into more advanced topics.",
    "Yes-- but only to fulfill the language requirement.",
    "No, very boring.",
    "Yes, but be prepared to check several websites and booklets for homework assignments each night.",
    "I would be hesitant to recommend this course to another student unless they had a strong background in previous Spanish courses. The workload is quite high, considering much of it doesn't bring about a lot of results."
