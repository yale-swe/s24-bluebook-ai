It is broken up into different modules, each of which cumulates in a project. \r\nThe course offers little more than practice\/comfort speaking. You do not do grammar exercises or receive much instruction, and the discussions are pretty surface level and quite obvious."

                "My favorite part of this course was speaking with a student in Peru for an hour every week fully in Spanish through the intercultural dialogues that this course facilitates. We talked about our lives, and I significantly improved my ability to speak Spanish casually and connect with others through Spanish.",
                "I think the amount of work required outside of class on projects is a bit much. Professor Leon says she does not expect \"that many\" hours spent on the projects, but I don't believe she understands the amount of time actually required for each project. I believe her expectation is that each will take ~2-3 hours but in reality it can reach close to 5.",
                "The course is very interesting and the breadth of topics was nice. However, there is a lot of homework and resources are a little bit complicated to access via the man extra links and google slides.",
                "The discussion format was conducive to learning. \r\n\r\nHowever, the size of the class meant that the Prof didnt have time to correct people when they made mistakes in their speech, meaning that there wasnt much room for growth. \r\n\r\nThere was also no teaching of grammar pr vocabulary whatsoever overall the course was light on teaching and heavy on testing, a combination which made the class feel quite meaningless. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the quizzes tested nuances in the language which would not have even been apparent to Spanish speakers, and meant that we might have to do them 10 times before getting anywhere close to full marks. \r\n\r\nThe grading for the projects was also somewhat inconsistent  the projects which I thought were the worst got the highest grades, and there was little explanation for why the grades were given.",
                "Strengths was having the conversation partners that really improved my speaking \r\n\r\nWeaknesses include the course site and information are kinda unorganized, the topics are a bit redundant, as are the projects",
                "The workload of the course leaves you no option but to consistently interact with the material and improve your skill with the language.",
                "My Spanish definitely improved and I really liked the structure of different themes throughout the course. I just wish the projects were not so involved. Definitely more work than I was expecting",
                "The strengths: \r\nThe course is designed so that students have the opportunity to practice Spanish multiple times each week. You can speak in class each day (3x a week), with your conversation partner weekly from Peru, and in office hours if you'd like.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses:\r\nThe class is SO confusingly laid. There are three different places to access homework\/classwork, and it is very hard to tell which assignment is posted where\/due when\/etc.\r\nThere is very little feedback. We had several grammar quizzes on subjects we had only been given a review sheet for on canvas. However, her grading is quite severe despite a lack of in class preparation."

                "100% If you want to improve your ability to speak Spanish by... actually speaking it, then YES. However, it is up to you to participate both in class and through the weekly intercultural dialogues outside of class. I feel more confident in my ability to speak Spanish now, and I thoroughly enjoyed immersing myself in a Spanish-speaking environment three (four with the intercultural dialogue) times a week. The work isn't overwhelming, especially because you can retake quizzes, and Profesora Len grades quite nicely.",

                "If you want a place to practice spanish and don't have the willpower to do it yourself, this class will force you to speak regularly. That is great. However, if you have any other way to practice spanish, use this credit for something else. Thematically and technically, you will not improve."
