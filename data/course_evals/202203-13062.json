He is great!\r\nWeaknesses: the organization of the class took a while, and the grade breakdown/ whether we had a TF was in question pretty far into the course which left many students confused on the expectations of discussion participation. There is also no feedback on exams which is not helpful in studying for the final.",

                "Strengths: interesting and relevant material with important applications in daily life. Great balance of humanities (art, literature, etc) and science. The assignments were creative and enjoyable (term project, discussion posts, term paper), and the lectures were easy to follow.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the two quizzes/tests were tricky, the class felt a bit disorganized at times with only one weekly meeting lasting an hour.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Content of the class was interesting\r\n- Professor was very nice\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Organized but ended up somewhat disorganized (although this wasn't the fault of the Instructor because Yale did not assign TAs soon enough)\r\n- Powerpoints were good but very big\r\n- Exams always had issues with the questions",
                "strengths are the professor's knowledge, given that he has been in this field for many years and have done a lot of research",
                "I think the strength of this course is the variety of expert lecturers that came during the semester to speak to us about a plethora of subjects related to sleep.",
                "The course was extremely disorganized. The syllabus changed about 5 times throughout the semester, which was very disorienting. Grading standards were unclear. The exams were unexpectedly difficult-- we were told they would only cover material in the lectures (not from optional outside readings), but this often was not the case. There was no guidance on how to prepare for exams, and we had no study materials. There were not set office hour times. The workload was not well distributed-- we had almost no assignments throughout the semester but had a final exam, paper, AND project at the end.",
                "Interesting content, hard to do with a medium sized class. I'd say either make it a big uncapped lecture without discussion or a smaller seminar.",
                "Super great organization, but I think the beginning of this course could use some streamlining. I felt like the first few lectures were much more repetitive than the later ones.",
                "Good science credit. Lots of ways to get points but also kind of boring lectures and wayyyyy too many final assessments (test, group project, AND essay just over finals period).",
                "Strengths: super interesting content, great rotation of instructors who shared their expertise with us. Weaknesses: class format did not encourage much engagement with the course content, and weak connections between the readings/outside work and the content from class.",
                "Strengths: allows for student creativity, discussion. Weaknesses: structure and lecture slides were at times confusing",

                "The course exposed me to a wide variety of topics related to sleep. Although this is a science credit, it was more than just a basic sleep science class. Indeed, we learned about art works and historical depictions of sleep, as well as modern examples of accidents caused by sleep deprivation. \r\n\r\nThe course was mostly lecture-based, and I sometimes felt there could have been a more interactive component to the course. We did have discussions, but they were held online on Canvas. I would have preferred a more interactive class.",
                "Classes could be a bit repetitive at times, but I enjoyed the slides.",
                "The content in the class was well-explained, but I wish it was more organized. I also wasnt a fan of the discussions on Thursdays; I felt like I didnt really learn much. I would have rather had class on those days. Also, it was really overwhelming to have to worry about 3 major assignments, especially in the midst of other finals and projects in my other classes, towards the end of the term, and I know other students feel similarly.",
                "Class was somewhat disorganized, but enjoyable. I appreciated that half of classes were replaced with online discussions.",
                "The instructor could not be nicer, but the difficulty of this class is that not much material is presented and its not difficult lesson to lesson, but the tests are then somehow extremely difficult and may include five questions nitpicking on a single topic that wasnt a big focus while skipping some of the major topics that you likely studied.",
                "I think a strength could be to be more specific about what will be on the multiple choice exam bc the questions were supperrrrr broad from all classes and since lectures werent recorded sometimes thered be questions where it was something the prof said not something on slides. Also if we arent able to see what we got wrong which seems counter to learning as we cant actually learn from our mistakes and what we got wrong. All in all i would suggest taking out the multiple choice all together and swapping it with short answer questions instead",
                "The strengths of the course are the variety of guest lecturers, quality of the material, and little to no workload.\r\n\r\nA weakness would be no online recording of lectures, so something unclear may not be addressed until the next class.",
                "There are too many final projects",
                "Strengths: Prof Kryger is amazing! He has an amazing handle on the information and is so available and enthusiastic about his students. Also, the material is super interesting\r\nWeaknesses: There are a lot of guest lecturers, with some much more engaging than others. I would prefer to hear more from Professor Kryger than a lot of the guest lecturers.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- spans the mystery of sleep across different disciplines with a focus on science - gave good background and context \r\n- interactive with discussion boards and in-class discussion\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- sometimes difficult to distinguish quiz material from additional knowledge\r\n- difficulty practicing for the midterm/exam, no practice material given",

This course is of course a great science credit, but there are lots of STEM majors in the class as well who just want to learn more about sleep because either they or someone they know has a sleeping problem.

                "I took this as a non stem student for my science credit and i would say it is not a gut and is not an easy a. Only a few students get as, the class is curved to ensure this, the multiple choice being 50% of grade it being timed pretty harshly and the questions are pretty complicated makes it so you must go to every class to do well and even then its not guaranteed. The material is definitely super fascinating and professor kygeir is super kind and if you get him to talk about his experience or ask a specific question you can really see the depth of his knowledge. Hi",
