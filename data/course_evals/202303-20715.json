                "Sometimes the lectures didn't completely align with reading materials, but other than that it was very interesting and engaging.",
                "Strengths: Professor Frahm is a great thinker and an expert in his field, and it's really fun to hear him think out loud about Mesopotamian history and different understandings. \r\nProfessor and TA were easygoing and grading was lenient\r\nInteresting readings which were a good complement to the lecture\r\nExpectations were clear\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nLectures could sometimes have too many tangents\r\nProfessor Frahm would sometimes try to get class participation but it never felt so natural, more like he was lecturing and then would just suddenly ask for thoughts without so much warning or something to base the question of comment off of\r\nI think sometimes Professor Frahm would present tentative theories (especially around Biblical literature) as if they were conclusive"

You cover three thousand years of history, and although you don't go crazy in depth, you learn a meaningful amount about each major time period over these three thousand years, and you leave with a feeling like you really learned something. The workload is extremely manageable and Professor Frahm is a good, thoughtful guy.",
