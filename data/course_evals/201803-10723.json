   "comments": [
    "think critically, pull several concepts together and over multiple texts, close reading\r\n-as a perspective philosophy major, this class cemented my intent to major in the field",
    "I learned how to think more analytically, I learned how to write a philosophical analysis, and I overall got completely new tools with which to see the world.",
    "This course was my first ever philosophy course. Despite my initial trepidation, I learned how to identify discrepancies in an argument, how to construct my own logic in a far sounder way than I had been able to before, and how to follow ancient philosophers through their digressions, flights of fancy, and circumlocution to understand what they meant.",
    "Skills of argumentation. David's general policy of (as charitably as possible) laying out the arguments of the thinkers so we can focus on the logic, reasoning, and premises themselves was very helpful. It made us much sharper in dealing with and objecting to arguments. In addition, we also learned the arguments and thoughts (at least at a surface level) of everyone we read, even if we chose not a write a paper on that philosopher.",
    "I learned how better to formalize and critique philosophical arguments and understand how different ancient and medieval philosophers comment and build on each other",
    "I learned how to reason more clearly and how to evaluate philosophical arguments.",
    "In this course, I learned how to analyze a philosophical argument, write a philosophy essay, and critically discuss and compare philosophers' theories. I also learned how to participate in a seminar setting.",
    "Through participating in the Directed Studies Program, I developed my reading and writing skills as a whole. In Directed Studies Philosophy, in particular, I learned how to write a philosophy paper, as well as read and analyze philosophical arguments of the Western Canon.",
    "Knowledge of Ancient Greek and Roman Philosophy.",
    "As my first philosophy class not only at Yale but as a student, this course helped me grasp a level of comfort with authors such as Aristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas. While the knowledge itself was new and experimental to me, the skill of argumentation and analysis of argument were deeply developed and tested. Not only did I have to understand someone else's arguments, but I had to then make my own argument criticizing and analyzing that author;s understanding of the world and why he believed that.",
    "A truly deeper familiarity with logic - a precise, and rather artful ability to dissect an argument into \"moves,\" and a (rather brief) acquaintance with a great many of the moves that have shaped western philosophy."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: covers the major thinkers up to 13th century, a wide variety of questions to raise for both personal interest and paper topics, learning how to learn\r\nWeaknesses: spends too much time on Plato, why did we read Ibn Tufayl as opposed to Avicenna?, lots of dense reading",
    "I loved discussing each of the texts, and especially the helpful handouts we were given related to each work. I can't think of any way I would improve the course that comes to mind at the moment.",
    "I particularly liked how much we were invited to analyze each argument we were presented with, and, in a quasi-skeptical way, to never take anything on faith. The experience of starting a class was also very valuable sifting through the reading and determining what was important or deserved further scrutiny. Your comments on essays, and office hours, were incredibly helpful. The amount of reading, particularly with Platos republic and Aristotles politics, was difficult to do well.",
    "Strengths: the focus on argumentation is strong and informative. It's argument boot camp and it's great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We could do a bit more with trying to extract the arguments from the texts themselves? Since we focus so much on what the arguments ARE, we don't spend quite as much effort, I believe, on dealing with the words and sentences on the pages themselves. We do it for our papers, but not as much in everyday class",
    "The discussions about \"the big ideas,\" like if we have free will, if God can do evil, or if we can ever truly know anything, were incredible. The philosophy essays were, in my opinion, the most interesting Directed Studies papers to write because you could pick a topic that was interesting but also seemed to be really important. On the flip side, some of the reading was extremely dense; obviously, you have to accept that when reading some philosophers, but it would have been easier if we did fewer readings or smaller excerpts. Also, some of the discussions and readings focused on topics that appeared important, like the nature of perception, but were not particularly interesting to discuss. Focusing more on some of the aforementioned themes may make the class more engaging.",
    "Strength - I loved the seminar style of the class, as well as the discussions we had in class. My professor and classmates were very knowledgeable, and I learned much from them. \r\n\r\nWeakness - I wish there was more in-class guidance on the first assigned philosophy essay. Before this course, I had never taken a philosophy essay before, so when assigned the first one, I was a bit daunted. One potential improvement to this is if students were given one sample philosophy essay to read before starting their first paper.",
    "Excellent material and organization. Id prefer if we didnt read Maimonides.",
    "Though ancient philosophy is foundational in many ways, it often deviates sufficiently from accepted modern thought that one finds oneself trying to understand and even support arguments for things which are clearly absurd. Why isn't there one Unmoved Mover? Why doesn't \"the soul\" work like Plato imagined? These sorts of questions aren't really engaging - they don't mean much to the modern student - and yet study of them (along, yes, with much more interest queries on the good life and the nature of happiness) is inextricable to D.S. Philosophy."

   "comments": [
    "The course is a great introduction to philosophy; you are able to explore many philosophers, focusing on arguments within each text that intrigue you. The class setup is such that students can engage with communal points of interest, glossing over other arguments which they find less fascinating. The author selection is phenomenal and the professors are profound and extremely smart. Great class.",
    "Yes. It is a fascinating course where you can learn a lot about the way people think about how we live, what makes things how they are, and the world at large.",
    "I would recommend this course. Even if you havent taken philosophy, I dont think it should scare you off from DS.",
    "Yes! Emphatically so. It is not for everyone, but it becomes clear very quickly whether one will enjoy the course or loathe it. Anyone interested in arguments, and the humanities more generally, would benefit from taking this course.",
    "This is an excellent way to get a foundation in Western philosophy while learning how to write about and discuss philosophy in this intertextually connected course. There is a lot of reading, but if you manage your time, it will be worth it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Firstly, I found it invaluable to read the philosophy works of the Western Canon and enjoyed taking the course with Professor Charles, who is very knowledgable and kind. Secondly, I learned how to write a philosophy paper, which exercises different skills than that demanded from an English course. I'm grateful that my philosophy course taught me to focus on argumentation and organization.",
    "Yes! It's a great introduction to the practice and foundational works of philosophy.",
    "Yes, its a great class and DS organized the classes very well.",
    "D.S. Philosophy will both hone your ability to think and acquaint you with a good portion of the ancient world's most influential thoughts. You'll analyze, argue, and engage more abstractly than ever before. The bitter side of this magical pill is an at-times arduous wade through outdated bits of esoterism, but even this contributes to a package I find well worth the effort."
