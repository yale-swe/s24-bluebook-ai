The top down approach completely discouraged engagementnot only were the assignments tedious and sometimes disrespectful but they oftentimes contained grammatical errors and mistakes in writing. Most of class time was completely unnecessary because the department feels that most of the learning should happen outside of it. However, what is then the point of having in-person sessions when most of our learning can supposedly be substituted by an electronic dude speaking to us from the computer? This class seriously discounts the benefits of in-person learning and does the opposite of facilitating classroom engagement.",

                "Strengths are that because its a set curriculum, its pretty organized. Weakness is that for that same reason, the professor has very little authority in adjusting things for the class, and also the set curriculum is sometimes not the best and it can feel like you're learning more from the online VHL than in class.",
                "I enjoyed the Linguameetings, which helped me practice what I learned in class. I thought the VHL was extremely helpful in introducing the concepts the day before we learned them, and the practice problems on VHL were useful. The only thing I think can be improved is more conversation in Spanish during class."
