                "Think it moved a bit fast.  Great TA's\/a lot of office hours.",
                "I like the breakout room format over zoom and I really don't have much to complain about for this course",
                "I think it could be improved if we spent more time on materials that are newer to the students, such as relativity. Meanwhile spending less time on contents everyone is familiar with, such as Newtonian mechanics.",
                "It would be so much better if it was in-person but unfortunately, that is not possible during the pandemic. It was a great intro physics course, even though it was online.",
                "i cant think of any problems",
                "This class was really interesting and provided an in-depth look into some great topics. You learn how to solve a lot of problems, and the professors were really dedicated to helping you perform to the best of your ability. Also, the peer tutors and teaching assistants were outstanding. They cleared up every doubt you had from lecture and facilitate the learning process. The in-class problems were a great strength to the class, and I do not think there were any weaknesses.",
                "One strength of the class is that we got plenty of practice problems during class and good feedback on homework. The professor also took polls to see how everyone felt about problems after we did them in class,  which I found helpful. I think the pacing could have been a little better, but this was not a very big issue.",
                "Strengths: Almost everything professors were very good and consistent about soliciting feedback and actually implementing it, checking in with us during class to make sure we're understanding the material and providing additional in-class and out of class support if we didn't, abundant office hours and TA assistance, moving exams according to students' availability, and being overall flexible and adaptable\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe getting better clarifications on corrected slides everyone makes mistakes and that's okay, also maybe better organized descriptions of slides on Canvas (like by topic instead of number\/date so it's easier for us to go back into the slides to review areas of weakness)",
                "Strenghts - almost constant office hours with TAs\/grad students, enjoyable course material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes the lectures can be a little disorganized, but part of this was likely due to zoom issues",
                "The strengths were the engagement of the material and the ample help provided through office hours and study sessions. The only weakness I can think of was the lack of practice questions in preparation for the first midterm",
                "The psets were excellent, but the lecture notes were a bit confusing and the lecture itself seemed to mostly consist of reading from the lecture notes.",
                "I felt that the special relativity section was difficult to understand so I would've liked more practice with that.",
                "This course is good at giving students a survey of many topics, but at the same time it can go so quickly that very important conceptual points are almost left in the dust. In my past physics education, there were concepts I discovered as very useful for insight into future concepts. This class very often made no effort to make those things clear to students. Unless a student had enough experience to know what questions to ask, they may have been learning more just how to use equations rather than the meaning and significance of those equations to their physics education as a whole.",
                "All new concepts came with very little explanation and few examples so I kind of had to just.... figure it out through problem sets and office hours. I didn't really find this to be an effective way to learn because we moved on so abruptly in our lectures that there wasn't really much time to build any sort of intuition or answer conceptual questions. It would have been better to focus in on a particular topic for a few lectures and explore all of its aspects instead of jumping around.",
                "A strength of this course is that the problem sets prepare students well for the exams. Many of the lecture materials are more complicated than what students should know, which makes it sometimes confusing but overall, the course is good if you understand and do well on problem sets.",
                "Using PollEv and requiring that students work with each other to solve in-class problems was very enjoyable. It made the class a lot more engaging, even in the break-out rooms.",
                "I think because of the fact that lectures were conducted via zoom, the content felt rather rushed. I always found myself revisiting lectures some point after attending them, because they went by so fast that my notes were either incomplete or not thorough enough. However, I felt that this course did have to cover a lot of material, and that although it felt rushed at times, I liked the fact that it reviewed nearly every topic I had come across in years prior. I think maybe shortening the time spent on deriving equations (since these derivations are more insightful than practical in solving problems) might make the lectures feel less rushed while maintaining this course's breadth.",
                "The professors provided the lecture notes before every class, which I found very helpful. However, I think that occasionally the pace of this class was very fast, and so especially with entirely new topics it could be difficult to properly follow.",
                "STRENGTHS: Plenty of opportunities to get help on homework from TFs\/ULAs at study sessions and office hours. Even though the professors hadn't taught this class in a few years, they designed accurate test reviews for us from scratch (per our request) and were generally very understanding (moving the second midterm because of the election, etc.). The homework wasn't too time consuming, and the difficulty level of the tests was reasonable (lower than that of the problem sets).\r\nWEAKNESSES: Lectures focused on deriving formulas, and it was often unclear which material was important to understand and which was superfluous\/supplemental. As a result, I usually felt underprepared for the problem sets, even after paying careful attention during lecture (however, this did not end up being a huge issue because, as I stated earlier, there were plenty of resources to help with psets).",
                "The course had very helpful office hours with the professors, but the way the class was taught was not very compatible with the virtual aspect of the class, and it was difficult to stay engaged sometimes. We spent a lot of time skimming over derivations, but as we were not expected to know them, it sometimes felt like they muddled up the line between what we did and didn't actually have to know. It also felt like there was no middle in the progression from in class problems to problem set questions, so it never felt like we had enough practice to really feel comfortable with using what we learnt.",
                "good questions during lecture to keep students engaged.",
                "The questions and resources provided were very useful in helping to understand the topics.\r\nThe lecture could have been more interactive and would have been better if it was not just reading off a lecture slide.",
                "The course material was very interesting, but it was exceptionally difficult to learn in the virtual format.",
                "Strengths: Lots of examples during lecture after a large amount of material was covered allowed the students to not lose concentration and focus, lots of office hours and study sessions available to review concepts and ask any questions we have had. Weaknesses: Zoom break out rooms to discuss questions usually weren't the most interactive.",
                "Strengths:\r\n\r\nThe problem sets were regular, orderly and at a consistently rewarding difficulty.\r\n\r\nPractice exams reflective of the real ones were provided for the 2nd mid term and final exams.\r\n\r\nFormula sheets were clear and informative\r\n\r\nIt was helpful to have the lecture notes available on canvas to reread.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nThe lectures were too chaotic; important information was sometimes glossed over too quickly and consecutive topics were occasionally totally unrelated and in a confusing order.\r\n\r\nThe first mid term did not have sufficient preparatory material available.",
                "The course did an admirable job of maintaining student engagement, and the problem sets were very well put together to teach the material."

                "I wish there was more interaction but the class was structured well for what was possible during this time.",
                "I thought the lectures made great use of break out rooms. As the year went on, we did more problems in class. These breaks from pure lecture helped keep everybody interested. Also, the seemingly infinite supply of office hours at all times made the learning process much better and allowed you to work with other students more than you may in other online courses.",
                "I really like the polls the professor did to see how students felt about practice problems. I think breakout rooms could be improved through having assigned groups, as often times students wouldn't talk when we went to breakout rooms.",
                "Good: Recorded lectures were very good, collecting remote feedback about the class, breakout rooms for synchronous problem-solving time during class",
                "I think this class did as well as it could with COVID going on. Online lectures are always more difficult, but Prof. Tipton made it more interactive with polls, questions throughout the lecture, etc",

                "I often made use of the many office hours that were hosted, but even then I would sometimes find that I needed more time for some questions. It would have been helpful if this course had made it easier for students to receive, or even ask for, one-on-one help during office hours. Often there would be more than one teaching assistant or student tutor, but only one of them would talk. Having at least one person take one-on-one questions would likely have expedited the online office hours process and better helped students understand the content. Unlike other classes (which I was happily surprised by), polls were sometimes taken of the students' feelings about a certain practice problem, yet there was no coherent effort to provide students with targeted help on concepts the professors admitted were very difficult. My math class would hold review sessions before tests which were helpful. An effort could have been made to hold something like this, rather than having students try to drag what they needed out of office hours.",
                "I thought that the office hours were pretty successful. Having them on zoom made it really convenient to just pop in and out. I think that the lectures weren't very engaging since they were essentially just powerpoint presentations. For me it is more engaging if the teacher is writing down the material as if  on a whiteboard, because it helps pace the class and gives the students a better idea of the relations between different ideas. In a powerpoint, this all gets a bit lost because there are just so many words in front of us that we don't exactly know what to make of any of it.",

                "The break-out rooms were actually advantageous in this class. I don't feel as though I got to know any specific classmates well, but it was fun working with them and gathering their insights on certain questions.",
                "The many study sessions and opportunities for office hours made learning in this course during a pandemic much easier. I also liked the fact that we had opportunities to talk and work with students in breakout rooms during lectures. If anything, more opportunities to work together with other students would be really helpful, as I always found problem sets to be much more doable while working in a group. Again, I also felt like the lectures could have been a little less rushed at times, which is hard given the fact that this course covers so much material.",
                "I think the use of live quizzes in lecture was good for maintaining student engagement and simulating the feeling of being in a classroom together.",
                "I thought the professors were good and they gave us opportunities to participate and interact with other students, such as through breakout rooms and regular polls\/informal (anonymous) quizzes.",
                "SUCCESSES: Lectures were recorded, and lecture notes were always posted to Canvas, making reviewing outside of class much easier. Digital submission of psets and exams was never an issue.\r\nNEEDS IMPROVEMENT: Nothing; this course was well adapted to virtual learning.",
                "I do not think that breakout rooms were very useful as people rarely interacted with each other in them.",
                "recorded lectures. very crucial.",
                "The course did well despite the restrictions imposed by covid-19.",
                "The quick availability of lecture recordings was great. Perhaps writing the notes along with the lecture rather than using slides would have been better for learning.",
                "Zoom break out sessions to discuss how we approached solving problems assigned during class could have been more interactive and lively, but as the semester progressed that initial impression improved.",
                "Use of canvas to host learning resources proved successful. An improvement in this area however could be to label lecture packets with their topics, in addition to their numbers.\r\n\r\nUse of polls in lectures was engaging.\r\n\r\nVirtual lectures could have been more structured with a more coherent topic progression.",
                "The lecture was pretty good at maintaining student attention. Regular survey questions during lecture helped highlight the relevant concepts, and the accessibility of course materials was excellent."

                "Yes- it was enjoyable and informative.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in general concepts in physics and want to get a more comprehensive introduction to them.",
                "Yes, it developed my physics knowledge in an engaging and unique way",
                "I would recommend this course to physics students who are willing to take a challenge for the exchange of great intellectual development!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. You learn so much about physics in just one semester. The work never became burdensome as the problem sets were really manageable. You are offered a great deal of resources to help you improve on any skill you want to. I think it is an overall outstanding class with outstanding professors dedicated to helping you become the best student you can be. Special relativity is definitely the highlight of the course despite how confusing it is when you first see it. However, you see it, and other topics, so much that you learn to understand all of the subject matter.",
                "I would certainly recommend this class to another student that is interested in physics but doesn't have the math background necessary for Physics 260. The class was very interesting and engaging and we covered a lot of interesting material.",
                "Absolutely, I recommend this over PHYS 180 by far\r\nI took it as a requirement but I'd still take it even if it wasn't because of the sheer amount of peer\/TA\/professor support and kindness in this class",
                "I would recommend this course to first year physics students with a fair background in math and physics.",
                "Yes it was a challenging yet not impossible introduction to college physics so I would recommend it to anyone considering majoring in physical sciences or engineering",
                "Yes, it's a great way to learn Physics thoroughly.",
                "I would.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is a good course, but one needs to be willing to work extra to excel in it. I find this is not because of the material, but because of the attitude with which this course was taught. It is fast-paced, with less regard to students' needs for review than I have experienced.",
                "Not really. Obviously for someone wanting to major in physics, there's no way around the intro courses. However, I came into this course expecting to enjoy physics and even major in it, and now I have decided against it. It just turned a bunch of concepts that can be really cool into a long, confusing, surface-level experience. Because of the way the class was taught, I had to spend so much time just trying to figure out semantic stuff and how certain concepts fit in that I really couldn't enjoy any of what I was doing.",
                "Definitely take this class if you did well in Physics C in high school. This class does a great job of reviewing that material and expanding on it.",
                "Yes. You learn a lot in a small period of time, which is good depending on how you view it. As far as the intellectual challenge, the large number of TAs, and office hours make this course very manageable.",
                "Yes. Definitely for someone who has had a strong background in physics in high school. It's more challenging than 180, but not impossible and unnecessarily challenging. I think its the perfect balance for an intro course for someone who is thinking about majoring in physics, since all the intro courses basically lead to the same place. I seriously recommend buying the textbook for this class and doing practice problems--the course is mostly lectures, so to apply all the information you learn you have to do problems on your own. Also, the textbook can help you review topics that are discussed very quickly, or topics that may be confusing.",
                "Yes, for students who have taken physics in high school, this course will push you to understand previously-learned concepts more deeply.",
                "If you have a relatively strong physics background from high school but may not have done much with calculus, I would recommend this intro sequence. It covers a lot of interesting topics but the professors are careful to explain any new concepts\/maths.",
                "If that student is interested in pursuing physics at a higher level, yes. However, if they are less interested in the origin of formulas and theories and more interested in learning about the applications of those topics, an introductory course like 170\/180 might be a better fit (though I honestly don't know much about those courses). A student who is taking this class as a prerequisite but does not actually have a strong interest in physics should also consider taking one of those lower-numbered courses. I personally found that the topics which were more difficult\/frustrating to understand (such as special relativity) were not necessarily relevant to my interests or path of study, and so I had a hard time motivating myself to put the time and energy into wrapping my head around them. However, the TAs\/ULAs were incredibly helpful (special shoutout to Rosie and Giovanna!!), and I never felt hopeless.",
                "Yes. a good physics course. Like AP physics C.",
                "Yes. It is a great foundation to the world of physics.",
                "Yes, depending on their background in physics. There is a more advanced and less advanced course.",
                "I definitely would. The material was really amazing. Far beyond anything I ever thought I would learn in a freshman introductory physics course.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are going into a STEM major and who have had a relatively good knowledge of both calculus 1\/2 and physics in high school .",
                "For anyone choosing to study physics at Yale having taken an advanced high school physics course this class is essential, so I recommend it. The clarity of lectures would need to improve for me to recommend it to students not inclined to major in physics.",
                "As physics courses go, this definitely exceeded my expectations. The problem sets were manageable, and the exams were pretty straight forward."
