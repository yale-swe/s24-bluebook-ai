                "The course is asynchronous, which makes it a great course to enroll in for the summer. It can be challenging sometimes to stay engaged with the recorded lectures, however. The homework assignments and exams each were overall fair. The unit quizzes were low-pressure and keeps everyone accountable to stay on track in the course. JDRS is a great professor and is always very approachable with his many office hours hosted by him and each of the TFs. The TFs do sometimes make mistakes in grading, so it is important to utilize the regrade requests on Gradescope.",
                "I love that there were so many hours of office hours available each week and Prof. JRS was always available to help.  It can be a bit tough actually staying on top of all the recorded lectures as its a bit tough to stay motivated when the class isn't live, but it certainly was convenient.",
                "strengths:\r\n1. excellent course structures\r\n2. very clear explanations and homework greatly helps in understanding the knowledge learned in class\r\n3. the video and audio is in very high quality\r\n\r\nweakness:\r\n1. maybe to provide more feedbacks on students homework",
                "Its very fast paced",
                "Great course all around! No complaints. Two major strengths were: how clear and engaging the lectures were and the availability of office hours.",
                "Strengths: JDRS and organization of course! I found that the course was very well organized, which helped me stay on track during the faster pace of summer session. JDRS is awesome - super helpful and great at explaining new concepts. I also found it very helpful that there were so many office hours."
