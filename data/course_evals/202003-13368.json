                "Strengths are the material and the discussion section format. Weaknesses are the quantity and usage of reading assignments.",
                "This course seemed all over the place at times. The readings never connected well with any of the lectures. Often times the lectures seemed confusing, especially with the jumping around by the instructor to certain bullet points on the powerpoint. There was also no clear communication going on between the TF and the instructor so every time we'd ask the TF a question they couldn't answer because they didn't know what the instructor wanted. There was also never a clear outline to how the professor wanted assignments done, and the person grading them we didn't know so we couldn't go over how to improve them because try limited comments were given on assignments. It was also not clear what we were supposed to be learning or taking away from the assignments so at times they didn't make sense. The quizzes were pretty difficult because there was little information given on how to study or what to study, and the amount of time given to take them with the requirement of them being essays was not good because it felt like a huge rush and I was't providing my best possible work or understanding of the quiz question. The 20 minute tutorials every week also seemed pointless because that is such a short amount of time barely anyone really anticipates because theres not enough time for every to delve into a topic our idea. The topics that were brought up barely covered the main point of the weeks lectures or even readings, so it just did not help facilitate any learning for the course.",
                "Overall, it was a fantastic class. I wish there was more time in the discussion sections but other than that, it was great.",
                "sometimes assignments were unclear and changed closer to the due date; synchronous lectures and guest speakers were interesting, but didn't relate sometimes to the unit; also didn't really get much use out of the twenty minute \"tutorials\" since they were so short",
                "Strengths: The \"lecturelette\" format was super nice and really helped break up screen time for students with strained eyes. Also the material was engaging all around and I appreciated the mix of academic theory and writing with op-eds and online articles in the readings for the week. Assignments and quizzes were few but clearly structured to further understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Reading each week was over 100 pages and oftentimes a lot of it did not seem as \"necessary\" to understanding the week's topic as others. Additionally, reading seemed to be kind of a waste because section was only 25 mins long, which was not nearly enough time to talk through even a quarter of what was read.",
                "I liked how we reserved class time for discussions with Professor Simon and our peers because our debrief of the readings and lectures allowed for me to gain a better understanding of the learned material. I wished we engaged with more African professionals because I feel as if we should give them a space to voice their own opinions and stories in a class based on the African identity (I really loved the Evan Mawarire class!). I feel as though storytelling is really important in African culture, and when we bring African professionals to tell their stories we gain a better understanding of the topic at hand.",
                "Lots of content which was good and interesting. I didn't do much of the reading, but that was fine and I guess overall made me less engaged in the course. For a fairly broad lecture during COVID, it was about as good as it could have been.",
                "Great course, but I think a lot of pod time was spent just rehashing material because the readings\/lectures\/guest speaker topics were never quite congruent with one another",
                "Prof never posted lectures we'd have to watch for class on time. Had a lot of late nights just because he would post them hours to the class the evening before and expect us to have seen them by the time we met the next morning. Even after we asked him to, he didn't change this much.",
                "The strength was that it was a good amount of assignments that were not super difficult. I believe there could have been less, but honestly not an overwhelming class to take. It was a bit redundant at times, but it's a good fifth course to take.",
                "strengths: amazing lectures, great guest speakers, readings were extremely informative and captivating \r\nno weaknesses",

                "A great course overall. The concentrated focus on aid in the beginning of the course was kind of dense, if it was more broken up it may have been easier to take in."

Also, having shorter recorded lectures was soo helpful, especially when students are burned out from Zoom and online learning.",

Both Professor Simon and the TFs were incredibly flexible and understanding and were not stingy with accommodations or with extensions (and I still learned a TON). This class was a great example for how classes SHOULD be taught during a pandemic!",

I also really enjoyed the speakers and believe they were highlights of the course!",
                "I think the mini-lectures were very helpful because watching hour-long lecture videos is difficult.

He made sure to keep recorded lectures short, assign papers and quizzes instead of a big final, and even hold a 20-minute discussion section during class. I feel like I learned so much without being overly stressed from this class, which doesn't happen often at Yale.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Simon is a wonderful professor (and the TFs were so great as well)! The class is a great intro to understanding both International Relations as a whole, but certainly as it pertains to Africa. I was afraid the course would treat Africa as too much of a monolith, but was pleasantly surprised with the amount of specificity and nuance with which the continent was addressed with. Great class all around!",

If you struggle with writing, I would suggest going to office hours to understand how to prepare for the in-class essays, and maybe look for a writing tutor to help improve your writing skills before and after writing assessments. Your experience in this class depends on how much work you put into it!",
