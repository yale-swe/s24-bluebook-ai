    "More of the work could have been done way earlier in the semester to avoid last minute cramming. The team really bonded when we invested time to make the project great - that could have happened at the beginning of the semester if people knew ahead of time to block out certain meeting times outside of class.",
    "Strength: you are working with a great professor to try to resolve pressing, real world issues. Is inspiring\r\nWeakness: so much of the experience depends on external factors beyond the control of the capstone.",
    "the team certainly took on a lot, as Prof. TS was well-aware. that said, we got it all done. i think in the future sticking to one task may be nice though!",
    "Strengths are the responsibility and ownership that the students can have with the work and the mentorship of Professor KTS. One weakness is the  pressure to get things done"

    "Definitely the best capstone project just because it's so tangible. There's been a long history of working with CHAI in Liberia and a strong working relationship. The deliverable was clear in its impact and people in the capstone were super talented individuals.",
    "Yes!",
    "The senior capstone project is one of the best parts of the global affairs major. Although in practice, it can feel like you are on a consulting team, you get the opportunity to do real work and \"make a difference\". Kristina Talbert-Slagle (KTS) is absolutely wonderful. I could not have higher praises. While she does push her students quite hard, she is caring, mindful of classroom dynamics, and wants to make sure everyone succeeds. Additionally she is incredibly knowledgable and only has great things to offer.",
    "Yes I had a great overall experience!"
