I also learned the muscles and ligaments that originate from or insert into each bone, as well as veins and arteries that go through the concavities created by skeletal structure. I also learned how to determine sex and age of specimens based on their bone features, and Professor Sargis provided various practical purposes of the materials that we learned in class.",

                "Interesting lectures and straightforward grading",
                "I really enjoyed it when Prof. Sargis talked about the practical values of bone features. I could try moving a joint and see exactly how bone structures play a part. I think the only negative was how it was online and not in class (not Sargis' fault).",
                "I think the pace of the class went pretty well. The labs were great because we were given a chance to try and work out the lab on our own before going over them together and since they occurred the class before the quiz, they were a great review. I definitely feel that in-person, labs would be even more engaging,",
                "This course was awesome and they did a great job of formatting it to be virtual. Prof. Sargis provides many resources to succeed. The class uses a great textbook.",
                "Professor Stargis is very passionate about anthropology and it showed during lecture. He is very attentive to students and answers every question they have. The labs were helpful for review before quizzes.",
                "Strengths include the volume of material taught. In the beginning of the semester I never wouldve thought that I would have been able to memorize every bone in the human body in 14 weeks, but the class structure and Professor Sargis make it easy to learn. \r\n\r\nOne weakness was that it is hard to not just memorize the photo and what the bone is. Because we were not in lab with different specimens, we were looking at the same photos for the same bone when in reality the same bone looks different on different skeletons.",
                "The professor is very knowledgable on the topic which made for a great learning experience but the online nature of the course, given that it is usually an in-person, specimen-based science lab, there were times when I definitely wished I could learn the material by actually seeing and experiencing the specimens rather than simply memorizing images of them.",
                "I think that this course would have been fantastic had it been in-person, but it's very hard to study bones when you can't see them in real life.",
                "Professor Sargis' teaching style makes this class very engaging and interesting, and I'm sure it would be even more so under normal conditions in which we would have actually gotten to examine bone specimens. A major strength of this class is that the grading policy and assignments are all very clear and simple- 4 labs and 4 tests, and a clear grading scale based on the percent average of these grades. Having a very clear rubric and grading policy was very helpful. I would say one small weakness might be that the content was very memorization heavy. But as long as you're willing to put in the time to memorize all the bone structures this shouldn't pose a problem!",
                "This is a course that would be extremely interesting in person! However, it was challenging to identify bones through images alone.",
                "It's very clear, well-taught, and fascinating! My only constructive feedback is to show us the bones on camera more. We had lots of excellent images, but when professor Sargis picked the bone out of a box and showed it to the camera, I was able to much better understand the shape and structure of the bone (especially for more complex bones). I recommend doing this for more boneswe can turn on speaker view so professor Sargis takes up the majority of the screen, and then he can show us the 3D bone and point out the same features we saw in the 2D images.",
                "For a live virtual lecture, I thought the slides were pretty comprehensive and having them available during prior to was extremely helpful so you could keep track\/take notes. Of course, this class would be more engaging if it were in-person but I think the professor adapted pretty well to an online format (the websites\/resources and study guides were great for exam prep).",
                "No weaknesses. Amazing lecture by Eric all the time.",
                "Strengths: Clear and to the point, concise\r\nWeaknesses: My own attention span for online lectures is not quite as long as the class not really the course's fault",
                "Given that the course was online, when normally it is a lab, it was a great class and handled perfectly.",
                "A strength would be the content of the lectures and how well-organized the course was!\r\n\r\nA weakness would be that I never got to know any of the other students and, of course, that we didn't have the labs in person-- but I'm sure this is just because the class was virtual."

Because we were relying on images from the textbook and other sources, it was a lot harder to visualize the bones in 3D space. This isn't really Prof. Sargis' fault, but I do think that I would have been able to grasp the concepts easier in person.",

                "The virtual labs were good, but I wish we had more training on strategies to study bones using those labs and how we would go about analyzing the bones in real life. Maybe like in physics lab, we could be each sent little bone kits to study on our own.",
                "The online lectures ran smoothly and the recordings and powerpoints were all posted in Canvas, making the course material easy to find. All tests were administered through Respondus Lockdown Browser to prevent cheating, and this program also ran smoothly for the most part(with a few issues with student's tests freezing up, but I believe all issues were resolved).",
                "It was pretty successful! Clear lectures, and expectations were modified given online learning (i.e., fewer features\/bones we needed to know\/side). My only feedback is above in q5 (i.e., showing 3D bones on camera).",
                "I'm not sure if the professor knows this, but Yale specifically has a rule that says, \"Exams should not use both Respondus Lockdown Browser AND a remote proctor on Zoom for the same assessment. Doing so will present significant technical complications. Instructors must choose between Respondus Lockdown Browser OR a remote proctor on Zoom.\" Each exam, however, had used both lockdown browser and zoom. I luckily had a phone with a front-facing camera and a laptop so this type of proctoring wasn't a problem, but I do think the professor should be aware of this and how it may impact future students if this course is taught online next semester.  Other than that, the way the course ran went pretty smoothlythe study guides and slides were very helpful for labs and quizzes.",
                "Could maybe find a way to make lectures and labs more interactive? Recording the lectures would've helped me a lot because the explanations were good and I would've appreciated having them available to look back at to review",
                "The lectures and labs were definitely less than ideal but still really good considering the pandemic! I think in the beginning that Professor Sargis mentioned that in past years students would have received a model of the skeleton to take to their dorms... if I'm remembering that correctly, it would have been helpful if on-campus students could still pick those up. \r\n\r\nAlso, if we could have access to images of skeletal material from more individuals that would have been really helpful as well. Sometimes the lab or quiz was the first time I'd seen a certain bone outside of the textbook and I realized I had learned what the textbook's bone looked like, but not what that bone actually looked like across individuals.",

Your final grade is made up of 4 labs (where we go over the answers at the end, so a guaranteed 100%) and 4 quizzes (basically the same as the labs but closed note). I really liked how there was no final (awesome if you're taking other final-intensive classes)",

It is a pretty straightforward class where you are told exactly what you need to learn and when you need to learn it by. The best way to do well in this class is to study regularly and attend the review sessions which are a great way to do an overall review with peers before the quizzes.",

Make sure to use all of the resources available and try to memorize the features in chunks instead of the night or two before the quiz. Quizzes were pretty straightforward",
                "Yes!! Professor Sargis is awesome. This class however is strictly memorization, but very rewarding when you finish the semester knowing you studied every bone in the human body. I am not a STEM major and I really enjoyed this class, and I didnt feel at a disadvantage not being a STEM major",
                "Yes, definitely, especially if you are pre-med. It helped me learn new ways to memorize large amounts of content and information, which would likely come in handy you're going into the medical field. It was also great to learn about human anatomy, something that is not offered by too many Yale courses.",

It provides a very comprehensive learning of the skeletal system as well as associated muscles, ligaments, veins, arteries and nerves. Professor Sargis is an excellent professor and I would readily take another course taught by him. The requirements of the class are very clear and a comprehensive study guide was provided for every test, so there are no surprises when it came to what was on the tests.",
                "Yes! Take this course. Very well taught, helpful in your life (knowing bones makes you look smart and cool!). Also very good if you need a science credit.",
