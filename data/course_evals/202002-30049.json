    "I learned a lot about the history of free speech in this country and abroad, and I gained general knowledge about writing.\r\nAlso, due to the midnight deadlines of our papers, I found that it is better to work during the day (as opposed to writing papers at 3am like I did in the past).",
    "I have developed and improved the following skills: my critical thinking skills, how to identify problems in different texts, significantly improved my vocabulary, and I have become a better writer and reader. In addition, I have become a more confident writer and speaker, and I have gained skills that have empowered my writing style that includes the following: being persuasive, engaging readers, making definable claims, supporting claims with evidence, and warrants.",
    "I learned how to structure an argumentative essay and write in a stylistically pleasing way. I also learned how to close read texts for evidence and possible lines of analysis.",
    "This helped me develop my writing and analytical skills as I had to write a lot and analyze a lot of readings.",
    "I learned how to dissect different academic texts, along with using evidence to support claims in argumentative writing.",
    "Argumentative writing and literary analysis",
    "I learned how to refine my writing to make it more concise and focused."

   "comments": [
    "I think the course overall was great, and it was in many ways exactly what I hoped for. Everything we did was relevant to the topic and usually pretty interesting (for an english class), and the readings and class material were presented with a clear structure.\r\n\r\nI only wish we could have gotten more feedback on grades during the course. The instructor gave us annotated comments on a draft for each paper but did not return any of our final drafts, and even now, I barely have a clue how I did. It was clear that she had to do lots of reading and preparing to run the class as well as she did and the course was also compressed into one month, so maybe this cannot be helped, but ultimately grades are still important and the lack of feedback was worrisome to me as well as some others students. (In the future, maybe add a TA for summer session to help grade?)",
    "The strengths regarding this course were Prof. Ranks engagement and informative feedback and the variations of teaching techniques. The size of the class was great, which gave everyone a chance to participate. The assigned readings, the various assignments, and overall content were excellent, relevant, and engaging.",
    "The course was structured in a good way, with each writing assignment building upon the last. Skills learned earlier in the course were applicable later in the course. The readings were interesting, the workshops were extremely helpful, and instructor conversations were insightful. The only complaint I have is that the course moves at an extremely fast pace, which may be necessary for a summer course but the final writing assignment felt rushed. I don't feel like I got anything out of that last assignment, and that time could have been better spent working on\/receiving feedback on our P3.",
    "I think it was a well organized class, especially for how fast paced the class was. I think some of the readings were bit dense though, which made discussing them very hard.",
    "The organization and content of the class were especially enjoyable.",
    "Strengths: it was a small seminar, and even though it was online, Prof. Ranks did a great job navigating the class. She also put so much thought into her curriculum, and it shows. I will be using tools I learned in this course in my writing overall.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes dry, but I think that comes with the subject matter. I personally don't enjoy English too much so I think that's the reason. I did like the topic -- Sedition and Dissent",
    "This course required a lot of time outside of the class meetings. The readings were long and dry. I also never received a grade throughout the whole course, so I have no idea how I was doing. However, the conversations were enlightening and challenged my views."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Initially I just took it to get a writing credit, but it was actually a decent experience and I learned a lot from it.",
    "Absolutely! Everyone should take this course with Prof. Ranks. This course is relevant and useful in all different contexts and can be applied to both one's profession and academics.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this course. The workload can be rather high since there's a lot of reading and writing, but this is an excellent course for mastering the fundamentals of argumentative writing. The skills and experience I gained from this class will be very useful to me in the future.",
    "Yes, it was interesting and there were some very good discussions in class.",

    "Yes! Would recommend any Engl 114 seminar to any Yale student looking to improve their writing",
