                "Strengths: \r\n- Fun, enjoyable, and not a ton of work. Nice 5th class. \r\n- I learned a lot\r\n- Professor was genuinely interested in the subject\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Kind of disorganized at times\r\n- Class wasn't super engaging\r\n- Didn't get feedback in a timely manner (for essays)",
                "The strength were that it was very engaging class. It was more of a leminar format, but it was very entertaining to listen to him talk and explain lots of these aspects of Inca culture. He would also share artifacts he's gotten over time. I think it could be improved by weighing in more on student engagement and participation. there were times when he would talk for the entire time slot and no one else would contribute anything because there wasn't really space for it.",
                "Strengths: Richard Burger is supremely knowledgeable about the Inca empire (and Peruvian archaeology in general). He is an absolute legend and, frankly, there are very little scholars in the world who are better to learn from. His lectures are engaging and I always leave feeling like I have learned something new. The class is super interesting and finds ways to connect the story of the Incas and their archaeology to current Peruvian life/culture. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I actually have no idea what my grade is currently in the class. Burger also does not use slides with text written on them so you really have to pay attention and type quickly to take notes (this is fine but something to note if this is something that historically bothers you). It is hard to figure out what to read for a given class or to know what assignment guidelines are sometimes (for example sometimes you will find three different length requirements on canvas for a given assignment; however, this can be easily remedied by simply asking Burger yourself)."
