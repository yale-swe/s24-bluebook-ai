    "Many basic laboratory techniques needed in a common biology laboratory (i.e. PCR, spectrophotometry, running a gel, learning how to use a dissecting and compound microscope); a good crash course in the range of model organisms that one could use in a biology lab",
    "I learned a lot about how to write reports, present data, and design experiments with a variety of model organisms.",
    "Learn a variety of useful biology lab techniques that can be used in the classroom! INCREDIBLY helpful and practical for anyone wanting to pursue research and have no experience."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: learned so many new lab techniques in a relatively low-stress environment, built a nice community with the other students in the lab section, Dr. Moreno and the TA were really helpful and approachable in class and cared about every student's learning. Lab handouts and report instructions were really clear and helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: could be a little more organized sometimes, in terms of streamlining the lab time and having clear due dates\/expectations for what is due but mostly none!",
    "For a lab course, this class was great. The lab experience was a lot of fun, but the lab reports and notebooks could definitely be a lot of work.",
    "Great to see so many different model organisms being used; super chill lab environment; very understanding and helpful and kind teaching assistant, Professor Moreno was very understanding and funny as well; sometimes the course felt disorganized\/we were thrown into something unknown but reading the lab manual 100% helped and was a great guide in the writing the lab report and knowing how to do the experiments; lab reports just took some time getting used to when writing",
    "The TA and professor are both super helpful and only wish for us to learn! Some weaknesses may include the lengthyness of the reports but I also feel as though the work you put in is worth it."

   "comments": [
    "Yes take this class! This is a pretty relaxed, non-stressful introduction to so many bio lab techniques, super useful and a really fun environment!",
    "I think this is a great lab experience for anyone who just needs to take a lab or premed no matter your experience or class year. It is also possible to understand the course material even if you are concurrently taking BIO 101\/102.",
    "Anyone who wants to do research in a biology lab should take this course early on, but even if you're already in a lab and doing lab work, this is also great since it gets you outside of your usual lab setting and your usual model organisms; should be taken with introductory bio if you have the chance before you go into a lab",
    "I would one hundred percent recommend this course to another student so that they may get an introduction to lab techniques and a variety of fields before deciding to do research in a lab.",
    "Absolutely  in fact, I wish someone had recommended it to me much earlier in my Yale career as a biology major. I think this course should be viewed as an analog to Chemistry 161\/165 and General Physics lab courses, that is, as a complementary lab course which is necessary in order to demonstrate the applications of theory learned in the classroom.\r\n\r\nTAKE THIS COURSE if you intend on going into biology labs during your undergraduate years at Yale.",
