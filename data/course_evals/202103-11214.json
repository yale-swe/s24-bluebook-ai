                "Ability to analyze and interpret semantic and syntactic changes given a set of word samples from different languages.",
                "Learned how historical linguistic data is analyzed and interpreted to analyze lineage as well as reconstruct proto-languages.",
                "What felt like a comprehensive introduction to linguistic change in its various forms: phonological change, semantic change, syntactic change. In the process, the course presented a clear framework: there are types of changes as well as pathways of change. We went into substantial detail about the various types and pathways for each of the broad categories (phonological, etc.). The course also introduced the method of comparative reconstruction and gave us practice at working with datasets to reconstruct the historical development of a language (or linguistic structure).",
                "Strengthened general linguistics skills, I.e. identifying and describing phonological rules, identifying syntactic phenomena, etc. also learned new skills related to describing language change. Gave me insight into how languages change",
                "I learned about various methods of diachronic change in languages.",
                "I developed some skills, such as determining phonological rules and correspondence sets for phonological sounds. Other than that, I can think of no concrete thing that was taught to me in an efficient manner. Information was sort of thrown at you and, through practice, you were expected to learn how to do it. I would have greatly appreciated some more tutorials and informed instructions to make what we learned more accessible. Having previously taken Introduction to Linguistics was the only reason I was able to do most of the work in this class.",

            "comments": [
                "This is a very strong course, I think some more guidance on PSETs would be helpful though!",
                "It did not have any prerequisites, but with no background knowledge on the subject, I struggled to grasp some of the concepts. It should be recognized as a course that may not be the best to take as someone's first one in the subject area.",
                "Strengths: Combination of in-class assignments that are explained in detail and the corresponding problem set that applies the same skills as the in-class assignment.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were long and mostly un-stimulating.",
                "Strengths: Consistency in lectures, covered a lot of ground, helpful feedback on the homework, useful balance of theory in the lectures mixed up with application problems both worked through together as in-class exercises, as well as on the homework. Weaknesses: The course topic seems like it has a lot of potential for being presented as an exciting search for lost knowledge, an \"archaeology with words\". Occasionally I got glimpses of this in lectures, but largely it felt more like a very functional primer in historical linguistics specifics and methods, with less attention paid to addressing the fundamental question of any intro class: \"why should you find this cool?\". This is great for students already interested in (historical) linguistics -- they learn exactly the necessary grounding in the subfield that they'd have wanted to have learned as the next step in their linguistics education. It might not be as great for students who are more unsure. I think part of the result was that class sometime seemed a bit dead -- not as many people as I would've hoped engaged with questions, even when we were doing in-class exercises.",
                "Class was generally well taught- with lectures and in class exercises once a week. No complaints! Assignments were clear and were easy to do provided the exercises were done. Material was very engaging. Professor was very comprehensive with feedback",
                "The lectures were pretty interesting and the in-class exercises helped make sure I understood the material.",
                "This class has few strengths, which is disappointing as the field of historical linguistics has so much potential to be incredibly interesting. I found myself often disengaged, confused, or bored. This class did not excite me, though the subject matter did. The lectures could have been more concise and effective. The class environment could have been significantly more engaging.",
                "Expanding beyond the traditional lecture style of the class could have been helpful in engaging more.",
                "Strengths: All the material covered in class is extremely interesting (be prepared to have a bunch of mini-epiphanies about words and phrases youve been using your whole life), and adds up by the end of the semester to a broad understanding of how languages change. Prof. Sanker gives detailed feedback on in-class exercises and homework, so you always have a pretty good idea of how well you understand everything.\r\nWeaknesses: Because of the breadth of topics covered in class, lectures often go at a rate that is difficult to keep up with. There were quite a few sections of my notes that were blank because I hadnt had time to write down what I was hearing, and without recordings of classes, it was difficult to fill those gaps."

                "LING 112 was a good lower workload course. I went into it without any linguistics experience, so at times it felt like I was slightly overwhelmed with information, but other than that I enjoyed the course. I would recommend LING 112 to another student.",
                "Yes! It was fantastic! It was a great intro class to get a view into what linguistics looks like. I enjoyed doing the problem sets and recognizing concepts from class in everyday conversation. Highly recommend!",
                "Yes if you are interested in linguistics this is a great class to take. If you are looking for a humanities class for your distributional requirements, I consider looking elsewhere.",
                "Yes, I didn't really know what linguistics was until this class.",
                "I would recommend this course for someone who wants to gain a strong foundation in both theoretical and methodological knowledge about linguistic change, but doesn't especially need to be convinced that linguistics is exciting. It's an especially good introductory course for someone who has already looked at linguistics a bit and knows some of the basic terminology\/concepts but hasn't gone into depth yet. Prof. Sanker and Marisha are very supportive, the work is completely manageable, and as long as you're at all interested in the subject matter, you'll leave feeling like you learned a lot. That said, it wasn't always the most lively or automatically engaging class out there.",
                "Yes! Its a great introduction to linguistics and the material is very interesting- if youre gonna take a single linguistics class this should be it, since its basically a little bit of everything",
                "Yes if interested in linguistics.",
                "I would not recommend this course. It needs to be reevaluated and restructured to be a better learning environment. The material was difficult, but it did not need to be this way. The best intensity and harshness of the grading did not reflect the relaxed attitude of our professor during practice exercises in classes. Ultimately, this class was not great. I do not recommend it.",
                "Yes, the course was a good course for first-years interested in learning the basics of linguistics.",
                "Yes! Not a linguistics major but this was a very fascinating course. It was taught well and all the assignments were fun and interesting.",
                "Yes, I would. Though its often flown through for lack of time, the material is really fascinating, and I dont look at or hear words the same way anymore  I feel like Ive gained a much better understanding of how languages have changed, and a curiosity for how the languages I speak have come to be where they are. Realising just how malleable language is (which, if you take this course, you cannot fail to do) is a liberating experience that allows you to engage with the languages you speak in fresh ways.",
