                "The seminar format was extremely helpful in fostering productive conversation.",
                "All DS classes move very quickly. This allows for excellent breadth with some sacrifice in depth. The pace can also be stressful, and the removal of Madam Bovary from the syllabus was a relief. I suggest making the shorter syllabus (or some version of a shorter syllabus) permanent.",
                "I loved this class!  We learned to explore a variety of texts throughout time and place them in dialogue with one another.  The course showed me the value to close reading.",
                "I think that the course picked up as we went along, but I found the quality of discussion for the first few texts slightly lacking. This may have simply been a drawback of the length and scope of Hamlet and Don Quixote, but I was somewhat disappointed by how little I felt we delved into those works. However, I thought that the quality of our discussions was very good overall.",
                "Professor Levin is an excellent instructor. She lets students guide the discussion and really makes an effort to hear what everyone has to say. She also gave extensive feedback on essays. The only weakness was that the nature of conversation meant that some parts of books were covered in-depth whereas others seemed almost neglected entirely; but this is perhaps an inevitability in DS."

We developed an understanding of the trend of literary influence from Ancient Greece to the modern day, which is certainly not easy to do, or to achieve with a course that is not specifically directed towards it.",
                "Yes. From Milton to Shakepeare to Woolf the syllabus is absolutely fantastic; unlike in other DS courses where you feel like your reading parts of sections and getting fragments of a theorist's ideas, we read most of Lit books cover-to-cover. The experience is satisfying.",
