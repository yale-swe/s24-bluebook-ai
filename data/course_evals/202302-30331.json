And I also challenged myself to draw with acrylic paints. I devoted myself to drawing with charcoal, which I really loved. Visual Thinking made me realize that there are numerous ways for us to appreciate and find art. Everyone has access to create art in daily life. Art can surpass classes and differences and discriminations.",
                "I learned how to view art and observe the compositional choices artists made, and how to describe those decisions in writing as well as articulate them in discussion. Previous art classes I have attended have been focused heavily on making art, but in Visual Thinking, I got to  experience a class centered around creating a community that seeks to discuss visual art in more abstract ways. I learned a great amount of new skills for printmaking, which I knew very little about. I learned how to be comfortable while interpreting art, understanding that it may not necessarily have \"meaning,\" but more simple value in the emotions evoked in the viewer. I also learned about performance art, and how art can be integrated seamlessly into society. I learned about how to access\/utilize the Yale visual arts resources, such as the YUAG and the Haas Family Arts Library."

                "Strengths: Students can enjoy their class in many different places, which means the studying resources are pretty abundant and useful. The teacher and TA are knowledgeable and kind. The contents of this class are various and colorful.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think the duration of this course is a little bit long (3h). But that's comparatively okay for me.",
                "Strengths were the hands-on art projects that we were able to do, as well as the field trips to visit art resources around the campus. Weaknesses were in the class discussions on readings. It could be improved with class activities (rather than discussions) that tie into the readings. Also, it is a tricky curriculum to fit into the abbreviated summer sessions structure, so perhaps more regular classes would have made the course better."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to every student, regardless of their interest in art. It provides an amazing baseline knowledge about interpreting and creating art, which is beneficial to all who are open to a liberal arts education. It helps everyone develop a sensitivity to the visual arts, and an appreciation for deliberation in work, as well as surprises that can come out of it."

I will use these skills to improve the art I hope to make, as well as be conscious of using my improved thought process in my studies in other subjects, even science. I will also be more keen to visit art museums, and to use my new skills to better interpret visual art, and share\/engage my thoughts with others."
