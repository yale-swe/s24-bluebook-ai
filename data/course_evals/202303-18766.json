A lot needs to be improved for this intro-level maths course.",

With this rhythm, I was able to craft a solid homework and study schedule that had little to no surprises. My professor did an excellent job of answering questions and covering material with great clarity despite the depth of the content and the natural rapidity of the course. There were instances when our class would fall behind schedule, thus leading to inconsistencies in the assignment of work. However, this would be remedied."
