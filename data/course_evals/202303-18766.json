Things from forming study groups and study plans, which this course encouraged through various assignments, provided me with strategies to navigate my academic life beyond mathematics."

As much as the explorations, etc. are supposed to help teach the material, many of my classmates who didn't even attend class did fine because tests make up 85% of your grade. A lot needs to be improved for this intro-level maths course.",

                "The course is incredibly well-structured, with daily assignments called explorations which previewed course material to problem sets expected at the end of every week. With this rhythm, I was able to craft a solid homework and study schedule that had little to no surprises. My professor did an excellent job of answering questions and covering material with great clarity despite the depth of the content and the natural rapidity of the course. There were instances when our class would fall behind schedule, thus leading to inconsistencies in the assignment of work. However, this would be remedied."
