                "I learned a lot about law, technology, and Brad's personal life.",
                "I learned all about areas of privacy under the law and how it relates to tech. Specifically, we discussed the 4th, 5th, and 14th amendments and various Supreme court cases. We also discussed social media and data brokers in relation to privacy.",
                "Gained a much stronger appreciation of how strange privacy law and policymaking really is: how much privacy governance shaped by individual idiosyncratic preferences; how strange\/shaky the constitutional underpinning of a privacy right is; and how awry things can go when entities fail to respect norms around privacy (and the pernicious ways entities do violate those norms without the general public realizing that).  Also lots of generally interesting legal and policy arguments.",
                "If you loved 183, take this. It's a great extension of the material and also taught in a very different way. You'll enjoy the seminar setting as it's very interactive and full of dialogue.",
                "Learned the ins & outs of privacy in the digital age.",
                "Brad does the best job of smashing information into your brain without realizing youve been bamboozled. I love the information that Ive learned + the way Ive learned it. I appreciate professors who are real and who give information in a way that is raw",
                "I learned about the legal basis for a lot of relevant issues like data privacy and social media regulation, and how the 4th and 5th Amendments are being applied to modern\/technological settings. I developed a lot of skills in reading and analyzing court cases and thinking about potential legal solutions to current issues.",
                "I learned a lot from Brad about privacy law, and the many constitutional inferences it requires. I gained a greater understanding of privacy in the legal tradition.",
                "much knowledge of the law and the privacy and what brad deems to be the only perks of Scalia and Thomas",
                "thinking critically about the law of various fundamental privacy and control issues, being actually challenged to think in not so straightforward (or gayly direct) ways. Lots of practice reading legal articles, cases, and blog posts. Learned how to challenge the typical Yale Liberal opinions in ways that better or completely derail the opinions with actual legal prudence rather than ignoring it. This course is great for future law students and beyond. To be fair, you must actually do the readings and such to get the most out of this class, which I highly recommend. Participation was made fun and effortless as a result."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Brad is fantastic and hilarious - a one-of-a-kind professor. The material is fascinating and Brad really pushes you to think critically and not just spout dumb bullshit like Yale students are wont to do. The class environment is laid-back - and frequently crazy - but also conducive to learning. Weaknesses: the Friday meeting time can feel like a drag, and the reading responses can be a pain to write. If you don't like Brad's teaching style, just don't take the class.",
                "Brad is an obvious strength. The course can be as intensive or nonintensive as you would like; however, you'll get much more out of it if you actively do all (or at least most) of the readings, keep up with reading responses, and pay attention during classes. If you do get behind in the course, there's no one to really hold you accountable but that could be a strength if you are looking for a very chill writing credit.",
                "Brad is a stupendous teacher and person--insane raw brilliance, deeply kind, interesting ideas and arguments, great sense of humor, deeply invested in us and our learning.  The community he has created around 183 and 185 is unusual, warm and special.",
                "I wish we had a little bit more structure to the discussion sometimes. Even if we spent the first 10-15 minutes just having a targeted discussion about one topic, I think that it would keep everyone really focused on the matter at hand. Just a thought!",
                "There are no weaknesses. Any class with Brad is absolutely amazing.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is Brad and his passion for all of these issues! We had such lively discussions in class that often drifted into topics that weren't related to the readings at all, and every single person in class was engaged. The readings were a great balance of relevant cases and news articles that we then tied together.",
                "Brad is a fantastic instructor that makes students feel truly listened to. He does an excellent job of encouraging organic discussion and unique contributions.",
                "strengths: amazing lineup as handpicked by brad, strong instillation of knowledge\r\nweaknesses: I only found out how cool everyone was during the last week of school when we were doing our final projects, mayhaps brad could incite more intermingling prior to the last week of school (during class)",
                "feedback is kinda unclear but the class is epic, Dinners with the class afterwards, class always had an entertaining and valuable discussion, brad is a king. brad has made Yale 10x better for me this year. So with that said, take the damned class and stop looking at Coursetable you sweaty Yale student. you'll do fine and you will love your freaking life if you let go a little and take the class. This should be a no-brainer after 183. You need to think more critically and brad will AGAIN help you do that. Don't be afraid to push back on brad in discussions even though he is a dominant force. Don't be a stranger to him or you'll miss the best part of the course. \r\nHe has been the light of my Yale career (and I've been here for three years already). He challenges the way we think about things (not just the course material) and is so helpful as an inquisitive human. He is gayly direct and will not BS you in the slightest which is invaluable. He can get you excited about\r\nanything. He had so many great learning moments with us in and outside of class that I will forever cherish this course in my Yale career. The final project was super fun for us as well."

                "Yes, I would. I highly recommend taking 183 first, as I was one of the few students who did not take it and felt quite behind\/frequently confused (but this was, of course, completely my own fault).",

                "Absolutely. I could not have asked for a better semester.",
                "YES! If you enjoyed 183, you should definitely take this, especially if you enjoyed the search and seizure\/privacy content more than copyright and want to learn more about it. Seminar discussions were really great and engaging, and it's interesting to hear everyone's opinions on a lot of controversial issues. I definitely have a better legal and ethical understanding of a lot of current topics and this class changed my perspective on how we can fix a lot of things going forward.",
                "Yes yes yes! Brad is one of the best professors I've ever had, and honestly this might be my favorite class of my entire Yale career. The workload is extremely manageable and Brad's attitude towards the class really makes it worthwhile. I was definitely one of the more quiet ones in the seminar, but just being able to sit at the table and hear from everyone and learn from the discussions really makes the class enjoyable.",

                "Yes. Absolutely. after 183, of course.   (the full brad experience is a necessity before you graduate), but on one condition: you must send a variation (or copy) of the following passage to brad when you apply for the class. Don't ask questions, just throw it in there...\r\n\r\nOMG ! thank you so so much Mr. Dr. Professor Rosen, Esquire. You made my Christmas wish come true early. thank you thank you so much, Santa  . I literally cant wait take this gut and not do any of the readings. It will make my life so much better and contribute so much to my Yale experience . The juxtaposition of me being put in this class just synthesizes such a profound dichotomy. I know that we will talk about so many problematic  topics that I hope to offer my nuanced unbiased and highly-valued Yale student  opinion on how to stop society from being so ignorant and uneducated. Again OMG  thank you  thank you"
