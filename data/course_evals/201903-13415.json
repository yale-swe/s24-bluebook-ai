    "I have improved my ability to read academic writing and have meaningful discussions about the content. Through classwork and individual meetings with my professor, I have a better idea as to how to confidently write.",

    "How to improve my academic writing and effectively make it more accessible and lucid.",
    "How to write more insightfully, think more critically, and look at food differently",
    "Essay writing, critical analysis",
    "Gained a solid foundation of writing skills and knowledge of the implications of our consumption",
    "I learned how to write so that I clearly elaborated and explained evidence I was using, such as quotes. Additionally, I learned strategies to structure a paper as well as how to clearly communicate a thesis statement\/topic sentences.",
    "How to write well and how to form a coherent argument.",
    "EVERYTHING!!! This course was incredible; I now know salads represent misogynistic ideals. It really taught me how to synthesize information together and form coherent arguments, especially about a topic that I love (FOOD!) I can really communicate what I want to say, and with a lot more confidence as well.",
    "Eng 114 taught me how to integrate sources properly, how to analyze a text to its fullest, and how to take strong feedback on papers.",
    "I was able to develop important research skills as well as critical thinking skills."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are the small class sizes, the chance to have meaningful conversations with peers, and the thorough feedback received after each assignment.",
    "I enjoyed how this couse can be adapted to focus on specific concepts and ideas.",
    "Very interactive and engaging; lots of one-on-one meetings with the instructor",
    "Strengths: great articles to read and plenty of time to write the essays",
    "More time to work on drafts",
    "Very intriguing, everything tied together nicely between readings, discussions, and real life",
    "I think having four papers throughout the course of a semester was super balanced and never led to the feeling of too much work. In terms of the course and the curriculum it follows, I think the types of paper we learn to write are helpful and having enough time for drafts was also helpful. I do think that some of the readings that are done, such as the super academically challenging pieces are unnecessary.",
    "Its is a bit sporadic and relies heavily on class participation.",
    "Strengths: everything! Every aspect of this course was just absolutely fantastic! I always felt engaged, and the readings were always related to the overall ideas that Scarlet was trying to engage with.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: were there any?",
    "Strengths: Amazing collection of readings and discussion topics. Such an enjoyable class. Learned so much about writing. \r\nWeaknesses: None",
    "I think the strengths of the course was how well taught this specific course, but I don't know if the same can be said about other English 114 classes. Another strength of this specific course was how diverse the topics were in regards to the assigned readings, though they all revolved around food and\/or consumption of food. The assigned readings varied from authors' accounts of how food played a role in their lives to analyses of how food is the manifestation of societal norms. A weakness of this course, though it may be seen as a strength to some, is that the course exposes you to very different forms of writing -- close-reading essay, controlled-research argumentative essay, research paper, and reflective essay -- forms of writing that some students may have zero experience with at all. This is a good thing if you want to be prepared for any future writing assignments in other classes, but if you lack experiences with the structure or prose of these different types of essays, you may struggle a lot along the way."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course. I was very interested in the topic before the course began, and that interest only grew. I am grateful for the opportunity to be in the class.",
    "Yes! I highly recommend any student to take this class regardless of there interests, because writing is such an important skill to have.",
    "Yes, your writing will definitely improve by the end of the semester.",
    "Yes, the class was a wonderful experience",
    "Yes. Good introductory English course",
    "Yes, gained a new outlook on consumption and actually learned how to write with great feedback from professor",
    "Looking for a writing credit?  Yes\r\nLooking to improve your writing leading into your Yale career? Yes\r\nLooking for a gut? Prob not, there are better ones\r\n\r\nIf Scarlet comes back to Yale to teach this course, then yes",
    "Yes. I am a better writer because of this course.",
    "Yes, because it was absolutely amazing! The thing is is that Scarlet is moving away after this semester, so I suppose it doesnt really matter anyways...",
    "It is a good idea for students to take this course, and this specific Eng 114 I would definitely recommend. You will learn heaps about writing and just enjoy the curriculum so much.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in analyzing the meaning of food beyond our typical surface-level understanding of the topic, and more importantly, if you want to improve your writing skills. You will be exposed to various forms of writing that will likely prepare for any future writing assignments in other classes. However, be prepared for the amount of writing you will have to do, though not to the degree that you might see in the Directed Studies program, because once you are done with one essay, you are immediately assigned another one."
