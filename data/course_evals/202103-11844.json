            "comments": [
                "The first strength is that Professor Steinacker is incredibly kind and fun to talk to. Additionally, you can do test corrections and the test is graded with a curve which is quite nice.\r\nThe main weakness of the course is that after the first exam, the course seemed to go way too fast. I felt that in the first couple of weeks we covered just a few topics in a few weeks, but in the second half of the semester it felt like we were learning a whole new topic each day. Also, the PSETs felt unnecessarily long, I think they would have been better with just 4 questions a week rather than 6. If you go to office hours though, the peer tutors are great at helping you with the PSETs.",
                "Strengths: Professor Steinacker was a great professor who was approachable and always went out of her way to ensure we were not lost in the material / psets. Her ample opportunities for office hours and the exam makeups made us feel less stressed about the course and helped us improve our learning. Also the peer tutors were incredibly helpful and their study group sessions were a great way to receive individualized feedback and help. Weaknesses: the exams were very difficult and the psets took up most of my semester (they could take anywhere between 8 and 15 hours a week). I wish that the exams could have been take-home or allowed collaboration due to the amazing collaboration we were able to have on the psets which greatly improved my learning in the class. The exam make-ups took off an immense pressure, however, it was still deflating to go to class and find out that the class average was a 50%. In addition, while the peer tutors and ULAs were incredible resources that went out of their way to help us in the course, I cannot say the same about the TFs.",
                "Strengths: the prof! love Steinacker and her office hours are infamous. super helpful and clear feedback and the lectures are very enjoyable\r\nWeaknesses: not many at all, psets never super overwhelming but you definitely need to go to office hours",
                "Weaknesses: Amount of math background necessary - a calculus review sheet or recorded lecture would be extremely useful. Overwhelming PSETS's that demand you to go to office hours and study hall. \r\nStrengths: Peer tutors get the answer keys to PSETS, so I feel like I can learn from the peer tutors much more effectively when they explain concepts compared to peer tutors from other classes I have taken (they did not give the answers, but by having the answers were able to teach very effectively); Steinacker is sweet; test corrections lead to actual learning instead of mourning of grades; weight of PSETs on grade help to reflect where the actual learning takes place in the class.",
                "The class is well organized but it's really a lot of work.",
                "The course was wonderful! Professor Steinacker is a wonderful professor and the lecture notes she posted after each lecture were extremely helpful.",
                "Strengths: Lots of resources/office hours/study halls to work with others and complete assignments. Steinacker's lectures were easy to follow and pretty funny at times. Weaknesses: The material/types of questions didn't always line up with what the focus was in lecture, so averages tended to be low.",
                "Strengths: PSET practice problems were great for learning material \r\nWeakness: exam questions were significantly harder than PSET problems, specifically the finally exam. Also content taught in course was very disorganized and all over the place",
                "Strengths: Steinacker really cares about teaching and loves physics and this class though it really tries her patience. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the challenge of this course was much greater than I anticipated and the workload is exhausting. It moves at a rapid pace and, due to the amount of time spent on PSETs, there is very little time to catch up on rewatching lectures or getting behind in any way. I learned so much but that was because I sacrificed everything fun to make it to daily office hours and study halls just to stay afloat. The amount I learned was never enough and it made me question whether I really wanted to pursue STEM at Yale.",
                "A big strength was the consistent and frequent availability of the professor, peer tutors, and TAs for assistance. Review sessions were also great!",
                "Overall very well taught. One issue though is that each week I am so focused on finishing the pset that I don't actually understand the material. The psets take forever and are stressful in the sense that you are trying to get as much TA help as possible. Because of this, I didn't have much time to actually go over the material.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Steinacker is wonderful: kind, fair, reasonable, smart, and a clear and helpful teacher. The PSets also teach you a ton about physics, even though they are very challenging. Curves on tests are generous. Real-life demonstrations of concepts in class are normally very fun and entertaining.\r\nWeaknesses: lectures can sometimes be boring, as they normally consist of a new concept being introduced/derived which is then followed by working through several example problems (this can become a bit boring if you feel comfortable with the new material). Also, the best way to learn is to actually do those types of problems yourself, rather than just watch someone else go through them.",
                "I really tried to be engaged in class. I wrote everything down and attended all lectures but I could not understand the material and no one else I knew did either.  I think Professor Steinacker is very intelligent but I think she taught as if a lot of concepts were assumed even though no prior knowledge was expected out of students. I wish the class had discussed more conceptual aspects rather than deriving equations all class.",
                "Professor Steinacker is a fantastic professor. The problem sets were challenging, but possible, and all problems served to further my learningnothing felt like busywork. Additionally, the substantial selection of study halls, office hours, and review sessions made the information much more digestible and helped a lot with solving problems that initially seemed extremely difficult.",
                "Strengths: the posted videos and lecture notes were helpful\r\nWeaknesses: the exams were often unreasonably hard and did not exactly reflect the review content",
                "We delved into each topic pretty extensively which made it more interesting because we saw more real world applications, however, sometimes it felt unnecessary  how difficult some of the problems were because it didnt feel like we needed to know about all the little details that could impact a problem.",
                "The course was very well thought out so that concepts built on each other very naturally. It made the class material flow together.",
                "WEAKNESSES:\r\n-insane amount of work (you will need to go to office hours and study halls to complete PSETS)\r\n-unfair exams (the exams are harder than the PSETS even though we were promised they wouldn't be. insufficient time, confusing wording, typos, and unfair grading made the exams unnecessarily difficult)\r\n-if you aren't on STEINACKER's good side, you're screwed-- she would act very nice at times, but the second you ask for accommodations or explanations that she deemed unnecessarily or asking too much of her, she would make you feel like shit and degrade you. so many people would ask questions in class to clarify what was just taught and she would make them feel stupid by saying that we already learned it\r\n-lack of transparency-> there should be a piazza or ed discussion for this class because Steinecker would barely answer email questions and if she didn't like you, you wouldn't like her responses\r\n\r\nSTRENGTHS:\r\n-exam corrections and curves-> tho these wouldnt be necessary if the exams were actually fair!!!!!!",
                "Strengths: lecture notes and recordings were extremely helpful for learning; plenty of assistance during office hours for problem sets; engaging and fun in-class lectures for delivering the material. Weaknesses: some exams and problem sets were unnecessarily difficult; major, major time commitment.",
                "Honestly, there's a part of me that wouldn't mind a \"section\" for the course.  It's a good amount of material every week, and although that might only serve to increase the time commitment of the class, which is already quite high, it may help with understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nA strength of the course is the amount of office hours. On most days there were at least four hours of office hours / study hall, with more hours available the closer the pset was due, which made all the difference.\r\n\r\nA weakness was the students, we were not worthy of professor Steinacker.  \r\n\r\nMaybe one thing the class did not do as well was keep perspective.  Although I understand that it is classical mechanics, and it is rather a dispersion of various concepts, I wouldn't have minded more foreshadowing throughout, and where we were going with things.  My mind sort of wanted to be able to put the entire picture together as soon as possible, and I would have appreciated more/stronger signals of how a particular example differed from real life.",
                "As much as it would stress me out, making the homework worth 30% of my grade forced me to put the effort in, go to study hall multiple nights a week, and understand the concepts. I did almost all of my learning in the homework because it forced me to apply the concepts we learned in class. However, the weighting of the homework deterred me from spending more time studying for my other classes that are specific to my major.\r\n\r\nI really appreciated the opportunities to do midterm revisions. Those forced me to go back and figure out what I did wrong in the exam and understand the right way to approach the problem. They also, of course, helped my grade in the class.",
                "The workload is definitely way too large, however there were adequate resources for students to go to which made it far more manageable.",
                "I thoroughly enjoyed the teaching staff. Professor Steinacker is very kind and patient with her students, and tries to make sure that people understand the concepts she taught before moving on. The TAs and peer tutors were also very helpful during study sessions and were a huge part of the reason why I did well on the homework. My biggest gripe with this class was with the psets. The questions were beyond the level of the examples Professor Steinacker gave in class, and often featured hefty calculations that aren't initially intuitive. I often spent 15+ hours working on the assignment, which was frustrating since I was highly familiar with the concepts and I was already struggling with other classes. Either cut down on the amount of questions per pset, or reduce the difficulty of the questions. Also, Professor Steinacker, despite her best attempts to slow down, teaches at a fast rate, so often she would write things on the board and then start to erase before students could fully comprehend what she just said.",
                "Professor Steinacker was the biggest strength of this course. She was always available to answer any questions and to explain concepts. The study halls for this course could be improved. During most sessions, it seemed that it was the first time that the peer-tutors or TAs were looking at the problems. This made it very difficult to have questions answered. Additionally, there was one night of TAs in particular that would mock the students, which made me avoid that night of help sessions.",
                "I really enjoyed this class! It was a lot of work, but there was so much support that it felt very manageable.",
                "The course went over materials with a large amount of details and a relatively slow pace, which made it easier for me to learn. It would be better if the workload can be lowered to avoid overstressing the students.",
                "strength: anyone can do well if they put in effort. I appreciate that there were recorded lectures and lecture notes on Canvas. Lots of office hours and peer tutor hours! \r\n\r\nweakness: TOO. MUCH. WORK. The amount of work Professor Steinacker requires is completely unnecessary. I understand you need to put in effort to succeed but this class requires anywhere from 12-20 hours of homework on top of your other classes. I know people who had to drop other classes or extracurriculars to make time for office hours. It's a lot to ask of pre med people--we don't care about the actual physics, we just want to pass.",
                "Daily study hall was a huge strength of the class. Psets were doable with help of the peer tutors and other classmates during study hall. A weakness of the course was the difficulty of the psets. They seemed unnecessarily difficult and didn't prepare me for exams. In other words, I would spend all my time completing the psets and had no time to actually study for exams.",
                "strengths: taught well, a lot of leeway given so you can get a good grade in the class\r\nweaknesses: difficult content",
                "Strengths: there are plenty of office hours to reinforce learning the material.\r\nWeaknesses: Given that this is an introductory physics course, there should be some more clarifications on assumptions we make as we are looking at systems and",
                "Strengths: You learn a lot, the conceptual base it provides is extensive, you are challenged, the course is very organized, lots of office hours and study halls each week for support.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Did not always feel like an intro course due to the pace at times, I would have enjoyed many more simple question examples to learn skills before attempting the complex PSet questions or the types of questions on exams, rarely did I feel like I was keeping up in the course (despite putting more work into this course than any other course I was in). I think, overall, I understood all of the concepts and topics very well, the questions used to apply the topics were just too hard for me to grasp them practically/mathematically.",
                "I do wish the problems from the PSets were a little bit easier, since for me, I had to go to office hours in order to fully complete most of them. That said, I think the overall grading policies were very fair and the exams were fair as well.",
                "Strengths: The office hours are very helpful. Professor Steinacker does a good job of explaining concepts and giving students her notes.\r\nWeaknesses: Fast paced. There aren't many practice problems to prep for exams.",
                "Strengths: The professor, Adriane, is great and she clearly cares about her students. She is very passionate about teaching from what I saw, and she does her best to make sure her students understand her lectures. If you want to be challenged, this is definitely a good class because you will struggle. The peer tutors and TAs are also super helpful and wonderful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class is extremely difficult and very very hard. It is an \"intro\" class but even people who had taken multiple years of physics thought it was difficult. As someone who basically had no physics background, this class caused me a lot of stress and the only reason I and others like me could stay afloat was thanks to office hours and relying on each other. Her problem sets take a ton of time and are virtually impossible to complete without the help of herself, TAs, or a peer tutor.",
                "great introduction to the basics of physics\r\n\r\nwould honestly love more of the translational content such as with the orbital section of the course - really love seeing physics applied in the real world like in medicine or space exploration",
                "Strengths: many opportunities to receive help during office hours and study halls, Professor Steinacker makes herself very available; difficult but very fair exams with fair grading; hard work is rewarded, and you can do very well in this course if you are willing to put in the time\r\nWeaknesses: PSETs take about 8-10 hours per week and are very difficult. There wasn't a single PSET I even bothered attempting outside of office hours because they are basically impossible to do without help or without collaborating with other students",
                "Strength - organized class \r\nWeakness - insanely hard exams with not enough review time",
                "The class covered a lot of difficult material and exam averages were always low",
                "The course is very well taught. There is definitely no weakness to this course other than the fact that Dr.Steinacker is not teaching next semester.",
                "Strengths: lots of office hours opportunities, professor was very responsive to email. Weaknesses: after attending class, it was necessary to spend hours each week in office hours to complete the problem sets. Although there were ample office hour opportunities, they did not always align with availability making it extremely difficult to be able to complete the assignments at times. It would have been nice to have had assignments that aligned more with lecture material to allow us to complete them on our own time without having to rely on office hours every single week.",
                "The amount of time this course requires you to put in is very intense",
                "The course is overall well taught, however, it is extremely difficult. The Professor and teaching staff do a good job of making resources available on Canvas, however,",
                "The lectures were useful. I could rely on the notes I too to solve the homework problems, and the provided lecture notes were useful for an even more detailed review. The homework problems were difficult by design, which was a strength, but the class has such an emphasis on office hours that I think it would be better served by including a discussion section devoted to the problem sets. If the expectation is that we attend a few hours outside of class every week, it might as well be official.",
                "Well taught",
                "strength: the professor is a great lecturer, there was always help available, the psets were very engaging\r\n\r\nweakness: a lot of material to cover, the tests were very hard granted I never took physics before and probably didn't do so well due to my study methods",
                "Sometimes the class moved a bit fast with examples but really appreciated the in class experiments and showcases. \r\n\r\nThe study halls were a great resource for me personally and I was able to receive good feedback from the tutors. \r\n\r\nThe midterm revisions were also good review for me since it gave me a greater understanding on the things I needed to catch up on from the midterms.",
                "this course had a lot of peer tutor hours and resources, but felt kind of rushed during lectures.",
                "This course offered information on a wide range of physics concepts and had numerous opportunities for help and office hours that were very accessible to students.",
                "the course really challenges you to think outside of the box and includes so much practise that you shouldn't have any problems with the material. However, despite the countless hours I spent each week doing the homework and understanding it, I never really felt confident. I think that even though a lot of practise and help was included, the level of the course is not for everyone, but only for peiple who really get physics.",
                "The course was very well structured with lectures and various office hours and peer tutor hours for extra help and guidance. The only thing was that since the lecture was so large, the peer tutor and office hours were almost necessary in order to fully grasp the concepts.",
                "the psets take very very very long to complete. But the professor was excellent and a joy to be around",
                "Difficult problems sets- made you think (good). Good support from instructor and lots of office hours and available yelp was nice.",
                "The level of support is this class's biggest strength. There are office hours and study hall to help with homework and any question you may have. It could be improved, however, by looking for more questions throughout the class from students.",
                "A strength was that the topics were all well taught and the problem sets were helpful to understand the concepts. A weakness was that the later topics seemed very disconnected with each section being very self contained.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Steinacker is a wonderful person and definitely knows what she is doing. The examples are done very thoroughly, and the psets go well in-depth to each concept. There is also a lot of help available through office hours/peer tutors. Weaknesses: I thought some things were taught too mathematically/formulaically rather than conceptually. I wish that she helped us gain an intuitive understanding first for a concept before diving into formulas and equations.",
                "The problem sets challenge me to think of new ways to approach these concepts as well. The structure of the class was well organized, and the expectations were clearly laid out. The one thing I would comment on is that the exams were quite challenging in that it was very hard to prepare and the amount of time given was sometimes not enough for the depth of the problems. Other than that, this course was very well run and fun to take.",
                "Strengths: There is loads of help available in this course for psets and general understanding. Steinacker!! She clearly cared about how her students were doing and was enthusiastic about the material.\r\nWeaknesses: In lecture sometimes we spend a lot of time on individual practice problems and I lost the big picture ideas we were supposed to get from each problem. I think a summary of the big ideas covered in lecture at the end would be helpful to not get lost in the details.",
                "It was a good course, and well organized."

                "I would only recommend this course if you absolutely must take it for your major. It is a pretty heavy workload and stressful course, so I would only take this class if you have to.",
                "Yes, but only if you are taking a light courseload, since this class is VERY time-consuming if you want to do well.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in physics or if it is a major requirement. Personally, I am a mechanical engineering major and took this over 200 because I wanted an easier transition to college. I stand by my decision; all of my friends in 200 are incredibly stressed and struggling whereas the grading scheme and content here is a lot simpler and makes my life easier. While the content in 200 might be more interesting, I do not believe it is worth the extra effort and headache.",
                "only if you have a strong calculus background",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course unless you have to take it or are really interested in learning to puzzle out complex problems.",
                "Yes, great for premeds especially those preparing for the MCATs",
                "If you are looking at this class, you probably need to take some form of physics. 180 seems to be the best move considering it is accessible for people without strong physics backgrounds and has a strong support system in place for its students. The workload is pretty heavy but manageable, and the material is never too challenging, even if it is rushed in class.",
                "No, unless you're a physics major or pre-med, or you love math",
                "Only if you love physics, have to take it, or are a complete sadist.",
                "Yes. As someone who came in without AP Physics or any other big physics background, I was able to get the assistance I needed to enjoy the content and do well in the class.",
                "If you have to take it or are interested in physics.",
                "If you're really interested in physics and developing a strong foundational skillset in the discipline, then I would recommend the course. If you're just looking to fulfill a requirement, though, then you should probably look elsewhere.",
                "I would recommend this course if they have already taken some sort of physics. I took this course to see if I had any interest in physics and still did not get my question answered because I felt like it was more of a math class.",
                "If you can take it with Professor Steinacker, definitely. She is a great professor who loves the material, and makes it very engaging. If you are able to give sufficient time to the course and don't take shortcuts, you can take a lot out of each problem set and lecture and really develop your general knowledge about the world and your problem solving skills, even if you don't want to continue on in physics.",
                "No, only take it if you have to",
                "Generally I would recommend this course but would warn of the workload because you have to think and work hard to understand topics unless physics comes easy to you.",
                "Yes! Course was well taught and organized and gave a great introduction to many physics concepts",
                "if you can take 170 you should, if you're an engineer, good luck",
                "Yes, but take it with caution! Expect a major workload and time spent understanding the concepts.",
                "I heard the professor's changing, so I can't say.\r\n\r\nIf it's Steinacker, go for it, but be warned, it's quite a bit!",
                "Absolutely. If you need or want to take a physics class, take this one. It's super challenging and you might hate it in the moment, but it is so rewarding when you realize how much you actually understand and learned throughout the semester. Plus, Adriane is a fantastic professor.",
                "If you need to take it then yes, but if not then choose another class for the science credit.",
                "If you're interested in gaining foundational knowledge of physics, then sure, take this class. Just watch out for the homework load.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if you want to get better at problem solving. I think the concepts taught in this course and form of thinking can be helpful in many other fields.",
                "This class is a lot of work, but it is super well organized and very interesting. I don't think I would recommend it to non-stem majors necessarily as it takes so much time, but from what I have heard from other students, it is the best intro physics course at Yale.",
                "Only if you absolutely have to take physics.",
                "No, the psets were unreasonably difficult and time consuming.",
                "Only if you need it for your major or grad school.",
                "Yes, while this course was one of the toughest introductory courses I've taken, I do think it was also the most engaging. A good portion of students taking this course are premed, and I do believe that if you are, I would take this course over other options.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in physics. If not, it'll be a frustrating semester.",
                "If you have to take it for your major then obviously yes, but know that it is very difficult and time consuming. I can say you will definitely feel like you have grown, though.",
                "Yes, key core course and steinacker knows what she's doing while also very accommodative and loving towards students",
                "Yes, but only if the student is very passionate about physics. You will learn a lot in this course, and if you can take it with Professor Steinacker, I would highly recommend her because she is very nice and a great professor. However, the class is a lot of work because the PSETs are very time-consuming and exhausting, so I'd only take 180 if you really like working on physics problems and you don't mind going to office hours every week to work on the PSETs. Also, even though this is advertised as an introductory physics course, I could not imagine understanding most of this class without at least a little background in physics",
                "I recommend 180 over 170. You know what the expectations are in 180, but it was terrible with how hard some of the psets were. I would spend around 5-10 hours in study hall every week. This adds up over the semester. It will take up your time. But, it is the lesser of two evils since you know what is expected and the TA's are very helpful. Yet, the final was online and made harder bc it was online. Super unfair in my opinion which is annoying when you have studied your butt off for a whole semester, but only my personal opinion. Yes take it if you have to which you probably do.",
                "You should take this if needed for your major. However, if you want a science credit take something else because this class is very challenging.",
                "No. I would suggest taking PHYS 170 instead. I really wanted to like this class, but the inability for us to be able to complete assignments on our own was a major downfall that I cannot look past. Lectures were mostly straightforward, however, the homework assignments usually covered the topic from the past week which was a drawback in my opinion. When it came time to complete the homework assignments, the questions were typically designed in a way where the lecture content only allowed us to complete a small portion of each problem, if even that much. I found myself spending at least 6 hours per week in office hours learning the concepts necessary to complete the problem sets, on top of class time and time on my own to study the material and time to actually complete the problem sets. Exams were mostly okay; they were different from the PSETS, but the instructor-led review sessions beforehand gave good examples of what we were expected to know. Overall, I found it difficult to learn the material in the course and wish that the time spent in lecture was used to teach concepts necessary to complete the work on our own. This would have made for a more enjoyable experience, especially since exams (which were worth the majority of our grade) were completed independently.",
                "No, it's a lot of work and while the instructot is a very lovely person, it can be hard to understand the lectures. A lot of the learning has to be done outside of lectures",
                "If it is necessary for your major, yes. Otherwise, it is extremely difficult.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. My major is in the humanities. I took Physics for a science credit. It was hard, and probably not great for my GPA, but really pushed me and improved me in ways that a \"gut\" science class wouldn't have. Sure, learning physics may not be central to my life plans. But the problem-solving, attention to detail, resilience, and work ethic it demanded will be transferable. More non-STEM students should take this class because it asks us to do things and work in ways that our other classes just don't.",

                "I would recommend this course even though it was ver challenging.",
                "I would only recommend this course if it is a prerequisite for another student. It is a fast-paced class and is a lot of work",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the information learned is helpful to understanding every day events and the organization of the class is geared towards helping the students learn.",
                "i would; i think it's a challenge. it is not easy and I probebly didn't get the grade that equated the amount of hours I spent studying, yet I think it's a challenge to the soul, to your persistance, and maybe the hardest course you will ever take. I think it thought me to not care so much and that asd long as I try, I will be okay.",
