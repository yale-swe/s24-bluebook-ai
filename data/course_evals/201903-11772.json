    "The strength of the course is its texts. The books we are assigned to read are amazing and bring up so many great points! I would say the weakness of the class is our discussions. I wish we had more fruitful discussions about the texts AND about current events that are happening to\/in the black community that could relate back to what we read. If we had done that, this class would have been incredible. I also would have liked to know about the midterm paper earlier than the week before it was due, as I had a lot of other assignments due at that time and didn't even have the time to figure out how I would be able to fulfill all the assignments."

   "comments": [
    "For the books we read, I would recommend this course to another student. However, I would ONLY recommend this course on the whole to another student if discussions were changed to actually actively involve the students in the conversation, hear their stories\/experiences, and apply those to the texts at hand. The one time I did hear about my classmates' experiences in\/with African American communities, I was blown away. And we still found a way to connect the conversation very well to the book. I would love to see this be done every class!!",
    "Yes, this course was very informative and exposed me to many experiences."
