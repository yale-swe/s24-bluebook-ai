                "Writing essays of multiple different genres, creative writing, close reading of literature",
                "I became more confident in my tone and artistry as a writer. By reading selected essays from so many celebrated authors, I was able to recognize the elements that I found the most compelling, effective, or beautiful. In my own work, I focused on the element of craft and how to write a piece that keeps the reader interested. As we wrote, workshopped, and read more, I was able to see how my voice is different from my peers and authors whom I admire. From this course I take with me an understanding of how I communicate and how I express stories with nuance and personal flair.",
                "I learned the importance of rewriting. I hadn't really written second drafts of papers before, but this semester, I made extensive changes to each first draft, and my papers almost always improved.",
                "My close reading skills definitely improved. I definitely notice myself reading things for pleasure with more of a critical and discerning eye than before taking English 120. My writing also improved a lot, especially my eye for what should go into an interesting and successful essay.",
                "This course was incredible. My writing has improved significantly and I feel more confident speaking up in class. By reading short stories, we learned to write short stories - this method was so effective.",
                "I learned how to write about myself, my world, my life, and things that I care about! This is truly the best class to learn how to make sense of the world around you. I genuinely learned really valuable writing techniques from the readings that we were assigned. I also just really processed some things in my life and got to engage with people and places at Yale in totally new ways through writing about them.",
                "How to write five different types of personal narratives and further develop and refine my personal writing style. We also read a lot of interesting personal narratives and essays from a wide range of authors.",
                "This course taught me how to convey my thoughts powerfully through writing. The most important skills that I learned, and which the course emphasized, were writing with a distinctive authorial voice, improving writing craft in general, and writing structurally sound essays that maintain relevance and interest for the reader.",
                "I learned how to read for craft and became a much stronger writer",
                "My writing improved dramatically throughout the semester! I learned how to be a more intentional and confident writer. I recommend this course to everyone I talk to (who hasn't already taken it!)"

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The sheer amount of time spent writing the 5 English papers will improve your writing. The different essay genres force you to acknowledge the nuance of each one and contemplate what a good essay in said genre looks like and why. The assigned reading comes in handy there. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course really facilitates your improvement as a writer. But if you actually want to get better, you have to take your own path. Find someone to read over your essays (a really smart friend or the Poorvu center) and discuss things with. Find people in the class to brainstorm with, etc. \r\n\r\nSometimes I also found that the in-class discussion got a little redundant. Possibly more guidance from the instructor on the nature of the discussion would help.",
                "One strength was the class environment. I really enjoyed getting to know my peers.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was immediate feedback for my writing. One way this could be improved would be to have peer tutors where each student partners up to read each others works and give them feedback on them. It's an easy way to make sure every student has had someone else look at it.",
                "A strength of this course is the sense of community it builds among writers and students. In most English classes I have taken, writing (especially creative non-fiction) was treated as something so individual, and while the content is individual in English 120, the sharing of ideas and workshopping allows students to see the process of other students and receive a variety of feedback. The essays chosen for my class to read were all great fits for each of the five units, and the open participation was really great, too. I cannot think of much that would improve the course, aside from maybe more time for early workshopping or the sentence-level analysis we did in the second quarter.",
                "Professor Saraceni is a strength. She is incredibly kind and gives a lot of detailed feedback on papers.\r\nThe course is also organized well. We write several types of essays. At the end of the semester, when other classes are cramming information for finals, we had a shorter humor essay.\r\nI think it could be helpful to name more of the techniques we discuss, since we usually talked about things the author did well, and I sometimes didn't know how to apply those things in my own writing.\r\nI know some people find workshops great, but I never felt that I had much expertise to advise my peers on their essays, so I didn't always think I was helpful in workshops and didn't always find workshops super useful for myself.",
                "I really loved every aspect of this course: the structure worked so well and made it easy to learn from the essays we read, our discussions were lively and engaging, the essays themselves were wonderful, the writing assignments felt meaningful and fulfilling, and Professor Saraceni was just such a delight. \r\n\r\nHonestly, it's hard to think of weaknesses!",
                "I loved the organization of this class! The five units really helped us narrow our focus and work on specific skills. I love that we had to submit a first draft and a final draft  this made us learn from our mistakes! We got such specific feedback and really knew what we had to work on to improve. Additionally, the selection of short stories were incredible and I always looked forward to reading them.",
                "Prof Saraceni is so sweet and positive and gives incredible feedback - she really creates an amazing class environment. I was so intimated by the idea of workshops, but they were the coolest part of the class. It was really cool to hear what people thought of my writing and I got so many great ideas from my classmates. The workload is heavy in that you have to turn in a draft for an essay every week so you are alwayssss writing, but I thought that was the best challenge of the class. I didnt always keep up with the readings but they were always interesting and more fun to read than any other classs readings.",
                "Strengths were definitely my professor (Prof. Saraceni) and her infectious excitement as we read essays, wrote and revised our drafts, and workshopped our peers' essays. Also the wide range of essay topics that we got to cover and her encouraging us to challenge ourselves. Weaknesses are that sometimes there doesn't seem to be enough time for breathing room between essays, but she is so kind about extensions and genuinely cares about her students.",
                "I thought the organization of the course was one of its greatest strengths. In my opinion, learning by example is one of the most effective ways to improve one's writing. Reading and discussing works by great writers helped me a great deal both in honing my craft and finding inspiration for my own writing.",
                "The class was a warm and tight knit community which helped me learn and made class lovely. The feedback I received on my writing was detailed and very helpful.",
                "Strengths: Passionate professor who leads an engaging discussion that was sometimes the highlight of my week; terrific readings; easy bonding with the other kids in the class because everyone is super into it; clear course structure (the syllabus you get on the first day of class details each subsequent class meeting's agenda!)"

                "Definitely. This was truly one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and Prof. Saraceni made it that much more enjoyable! You will learn so much about writing the personal essay and get to see your writing improve greatly throughout the semester.",
                "I would recommend this course if you truly have a love for writing. I would not recommend this course to someone who is just in on it for the writing credit. Most students who take this class love writing and are already amazing which makes it harder to get a good grade if your taking it just for the writing credit. If you do want to take this class because you like writing, it's best to take another writing course before this one for some practice.",
                "Yes!! It was a great class and made me a much better writer.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. I learned a lot about the craft of writing rather than just presenting an argument, and looking at an essay as a piece of art with individual stylistic elements. After this course I feel that I have further developed my own recognizable voice and traits in my writing and my knowledge of that makes me a stronger writer and thinker. I think all Yale students can benefit both from the creative element that allows for reflection and the structure that teaches us how to read for craft instead of just content.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Most of the essays we read for class were a lot of fun. The best reason, however, is the detailed feedback we got from our professor. I had never gotten such detailed feedback on essays, and the feedback really helped me improve them. Be ready to put a lot of time into essays.",
                "Absolutely!!! Please take this course. It is not too intense while still teaching you so much. You will learn to write.",
                "YES this is a must take class at Yale. It will improve your college experience greatly because youll literally think about your life at Yale in new ways as you write these essays. This class made me love reading and writing in a way that I havent felt in a long time. And dont think that you have to be a first year to take this class! Youll get so much out of it regardless of your class year.",
                "100%. I think that even STEM students not interested in the humanities would enjoy this class. I certainly did, and this class makes me want to take another English class soon. Try to get Professor Saraceni, she is one of the best writing teachers I've had in my entire life.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to other students. Writing powerfully is a skill that everybody should learn, and this course does a fantastic job of teaching it. It is immensely satisfying to be able to look back on the writing that I produced throughout this course and see how my writing craft has improved over the semester.",
                "Yes definitely! This course made me consider majoring in English it was so fantastic. You learn a lot, make friends, have interesting discussions, and gain confidence as a writer.",
                "YES!!!! And I do to anyone who will listen (and who hasn't already taken it!!!) This was my favorite course of the semester. I became a much more confident writer and also looked forward to spending time in class with the other students and Prof. Saraceni.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was a great course for people wanting to better their writing, particularly creative writing, and the class size made it so that everyone felt comfortable and created a very positive environment. The instructor was very kind, understanding and put a lot of effort in making sure that we were excited about the material and the assignments!"
