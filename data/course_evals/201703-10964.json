    "We learned how signals are received, analyzed, and synthesized and then applied that theory to create a speech synthesis program.",
    "This class teaches you how to analyze signals by calculating their power spectral density and autocorrelation, performing linear prediction, and employing least-squares modeling and random searches. The final project this year was a speech analyzer and synthesizer that read in recorded sentences, extracted their poles and pitch periods along with other information each of us decided on, quantized the information into bytes, and transferred them over to our synthesizer program, which then recreated the speech. We each designed our own speech analyzers and synthesizers and presented them on the last day of class. The project (and intermediate MATLAB homework assignments) put the theoretical knowledge about signal processing we learned in class into practice and also taught us about the trade-off between synthesized signal quality and the amount of information transmitted to create the signal.",
    "Great introduction to practical signal processing. Professor Kuc's is engaging and knowledgable, and the class tends to be small which 1. forces you to pay attention and 2. makes it easy for Professor Kuc's to get to know you personally. Some of the math may go over your head, but overall you'll get the gist of all the techniques, especially when you apply it all in the final project."

   "comments": [
    "The subject material is very interesting, but it is also not very intuitive, so I had some trouble wrapping my head around it. Professor Kuc is a great lecturer and a great teacher; he was very receptive to questions and was very quick to help on homework or on the material when asked. The workload wasn't overwhelming. I think that one thing that could help conceptually would be to introduce topics as a part of the larger picture instead of just on their own; one thing I had trouble with theoretically was that I started to grasp the individual concepts but I couldn't always tell how the pieces fit together. The speech analysis and synthesis project was very interesting though, and did really cement these topics for me. I liked that the project was individual and open ended about how we implemented it, that really encouraged me to try new things with the material we'd learned.",
    "This class was excellent at providing a chance to practice and understand digital signal processing techniques, both with intermediate projects and a final project that combined and connected much of the theoretical material discussed in class. It had a great balance of theory and practical applications and provides skills with clear applications for signal analysis.",
    "Challenging concepts to grasp, but easy code to implement. Very interesting final project (speech synthesis) which tested a lot of the material in the class. Good structure in class. Helpful notes on canvas.\r\n\r\nWhat I didn't like was that the final was an oral exam instead of written. Additionally, even though we had homework, we didn't get any feedback on it. It is unclear how the grade percentage distribution is going to go if it is all on the final or if midterm and homework also play a role."

    "I would recommend this course to another student; it's really interesting material, and making a computer learn how to talk as the final project is really cool. I found it difficult conceptually, but the workload isn't overwhelming, and because the material is fairly specific I don't think you have to come in with much knowledge about the field.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. You will learn theory and how to apply it to practical signal analysis, meaning that you'll come away from the class with a lot of practical skills with diverse applications. A lot of the final project is about trying to improve speech quality and\/or reduce bitrate after you have the basics of the project working, which makes it so you have a chance to develop a project you can be really proud of.",
    "While the course helped to clarify a lot of the topics from EENG310 in a way that didn't get bogged down in the theory and proofs, the class itself was very disorganized in regards to how we would actually be graded. Homeworks were assigned but didn't count toward the final grade (unless they were deemed necessary to evaluate for your grade in particular). Other than homeworks, there was one midterm exam, a final project, and an oral final exam. Overall grading seemed much too arbitrary for me to feel comfortable with. The content of the class, however, was very cool and eye-opening when it came to realizing signals processing concepts in the real world. I would definitely recommend the class for any EE or CS majors interested in speech synthesis\/analysis.",
    "Yes, Kuc is one of my favorite EE professors"
