                "strengths: simulation-based learning. Professor Collins frequently asked us to assume the position of historical figures in discussion, which was intellectually stimulating. the reading load was very manageable. I also liked the way Professor Collins had us connect the themes and readings of the course to our own ideologies. It felt like an intellectually curious and honest environment and it was interesting to see mine and my classmates' views change over the course of the semester. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: I felt that discussions sometimes focused too much on summarizing the readings, and I wish we would have been able to get more into intellectual applications.",
                "The syllabus is well-organized, and I especially enjoyed learning about the contemporary applications of the intellectual foundations of liberalism and conservatism. The main weakness is that discussions, which mostly stayed on the surface level, were very mediocre.",
                "We went through too many thinkers in the last few weeks. We spent too long on the proto-liberals and conservatives before getting to Burke, I think, though they might have been necessary. I wish we could have studied a few in detail, but this is a survey course.",
                "Strengths: Reasonable load of readings; great course organisation and structure that is chronological and puts the thinkers in dialogue with each other; instructor explanations in class were good; class discussions were lively and intellectually insightful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Midterm essay prompts were given only one week before deadline, it should have been longer. Sometimes, the class discussions continue on to the following classes which leads to less time for that week's readings - pushing everything back"

                "Probably not; prof is quirky and nice, but intense grading makes things not as fun",
                "Yes, I would totally recommend doing this with Professor Collins! Youll touch on some interesting and deep ideas in political theory (though if you want to do a deep dive, youd have to do some digging by yourself.) It is a relatively easy survey course.",
                "Yes - it really helps to contextualise the political divisions we see today and helps us understand each other better, as well as how to argue against opposing views better. Even if political philosophy isn't your main interest, the relevance of this class to the modern day is very helpful as general good-to-know knowledge."
