I gained useful tools and terms to articulate my views on international relations and engage more thoughtfully with IR theory on a range of subjects. The varying theories about how democracy spreads and the definitions of different schools of thought (realism vs liberalism vs constructivism) were especially useful for me. I definitely learned new angles and approaches to considering topics like the nuclear revolution and inter\/intra state conflict. I was introduced to the overall debate\/struggle between empiricism and theory in IR. This class was full of frameworks and interesting notions that I feel a need to come back to in order to really understand. I'm coming away from this course feeling like I actually know something about the overall landscape of international relations. Definitely not an expert on any one thing, but I feel like I can claim to be a Global Affairs major with more confidence now."

                "Strengths: The amazing TAs and Professor Monteiro, the content and breadth of the course. Weaknesses: Tries to cover too much sometimes",
                "As someone not super interested in security coming into the course, I think I was able to engage with it more when more current events were involved.",
                "This is definitely not a topic that I thought I would be engaged with (I am a development-focused GLBL major) but I thought that the course was very well done. I did enjoy the 'lecturelets' portion of the course but I do wish Professor Monteiro would post them before Monday mornings.",
                "The strengths were the readings and the sections. The weakness was the lecture mostly because there was not a lot of incentive to participate.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- Professor and TA actively sought feedback from the students to improve the course in whatever way they could.\r\n- Most readings were well selected and engaging\r\n- Lecturetes were of great value in explaining important concepts in a succinct manner\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Some weeks there were more readings than could reasonably expect of the students to read. Moreover, these readings were barely engaged with in class.",
                "The course provided a broad overview of a number of important topics in international security and allowed students to discuss the topics which interested them in a relatively open setting. Discussion was usually highly engaging, although at times Professor Monteiro would need to speak and provide his own thoughts when conversation entered a lull. \r\n\r\nThe only weaknesses of this course were that the weekly readings were at times overwhelming in their scope and density, and that Professor Monteiro posted the pre-recorded lecturelets late several weeks as a result of personal reasons.",
                "Strengths: well thought-out syllabus, engaging teaching, learn how to write response papers, fairly flexible for focusing on the readings that were most interesting to you. Solid theoretical and methodological grounding\r\nWeaknesses: too much focus on WWI, WWII and Cold War, which aren't really applicable to modern conflicts. Even the thematic weeks used examples from these conflicts. For instance, the lesson on \"military occupations\" focused on the example of occupied France in WWII, even though we had already spent multiple weeks on WWII for the historical content and there are more recent and similarly significant military occupations (ex. Iraq) that would have been more useful. Focusing on more recent conflicts would also be a convenient way to address a concern voiced during the semester that the syllabus is lacking in female authors and authors of color. Also, although the flexibility of the course this semester was definitely beneficial, it did result in my not retaining everything",
                "Professor and Tfs were outstanding. Course material and discussions great, too.",
                "The lecturelets were good ways to introduce the material and increase student engagement, the once a week leminars were super effective at encouraging student particpation. Occasionally, the readings were too long or not super relevant. Felt like we lost the overall structure of the course at points in the middle",
                "I was honestly a little bit skeptical about international security before taking this course, but it opened my eyes to the field and really piqued my interest. The lecturelets were easy to follow, even for someone with limited experience.",
                "A major strength of the course was how warm and open-minded Professor Monteiro was. With such a heavy topic, it was helpful to have a professor who was able to truly invite us into the conversation. Professor Monteiro is a wonderful and brilliant teacher, who always challenged us to think more deeply while also respecting our views and our voices. I think that one weakness of the course was that it often required us to read far more than what seemed necessary to grasp a certain topic. Especially during weeks where we had to read 8 articles, I was somewhat confused why so many were necessary to gain a strong sense of that week's subject matter. This was compounded by the fact that we often read articles that took 40 pages to make a pretty intuitive point and that went through long lists of ideas and concepts that were far less complicated than the scholar seemed to be making them.",
                "This course is required for Global majors. A major flaw of this course is how the peer students in the course go unchecked when they sometimes state incorrect\/overly sweeping\/offensive thoughts, as Global majors at times do-- ie. very colonialist mindsets, overgeneralizations that verge on xenophobia\/racism, and somewhat concerning imperialism (I left many digital classes stunned by the mindsets of some of my peers and how their thoughts were allowed to dominate the classroom). I think the Professor, Prof. Monteiro, and his lecturing is actually pretty engaging, but I am personally pretty disinterested with the material and that was my primary struggle. I think the course could inevitably be improved by tying in some elements of what development-minded Global Affairs majors are interested in, as well as BRINGING SOME DIVERSITY TO THE LITERATURE READ IN THE COURSE.",
                "The only strength of this course is Cole DeVoy. The weakness of this course is that it requires an unnecessary amount of boring work: reading esoteric and terribly written academic papers and writing far too many response papers to them.",
                "Strengths: helpful videos before discussion, interesting discussions with a very knowledgeable and supportive Prof, and thoughtful assignments (I enjoyed writing our response papers SO much and our lit review was fascinating, while challenging, to work on)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The weekly virtual discussions could be better formatted, at times, to highlight main take-aways at the end of lecture. I found myself often asking my TF to share main take-aways with us, which was helpful in digesting SO much content on a week to week basis. I also think our syllabus needed more representation from non-male and non-white authors, to better represent scholarship and research in the field, but we talked about this quite a bit this semester, and it seems like Prof Monteiro will be working on diversifying the literature read in the future.",
                "This year's format definitely sounded easier than having a final exam, but, since we were not forced by an exam to study the material, I do not feel I have as strong a grasp on all of the various topics and theories we covered. \r\n\r\nHowever, professor and TA's alike are the best I've had at Yale--super smart and really engaged with the material. I found the material really interesting, so it was easy to engage.",
                "There is a lot of reading and writing so that could be a strength it weakness depending on the person. Another weakness, for me personally is that virtual seminars made participation in discussions less appealing and I was less encouraged to do it and I think it was the same for my peers",
                "Strengths: interesting content, engaging discussions, encouraging professor and TAs\r\nWeaknesses: LARGE reading load!!",
                "Strengths: Instructor was extremely exciting and the course was well-organized in terms of content diversity. Recorded lectures had good slides with comprehensive materials. Enjoyed the questions posed in class for review. Section was great in terms of size and leadership. Weaknesses: Some class periods had little classroom participation - may have been exogenous to the course, but could be due to the questions being not inclusive possibly or interesting. Thought that there was a good balance in terms of reading for each week, but some weeks had an extraordinary amount (150 pages) to which we then failed to cover adequately in class. Wish that there was a smaller class size.",
                "The course included readings from debating perspectives on each week's designated topic. This was a strength of the course as it allowed students to critically examine these weekly topics. However, there are several scholars on each side, so the weekly reading load was heavy. The assignments at the end of each unit compensated for this high reading load as it allowed us to decide what articles to include in our responses.",
                "I really enjoyed this class, especially for being a required course. I thought the assignments were very reasonable and the topics are thorough and broad. Some of the readings are a bit long\/repetitive and I would've liked a bit more discussion of human security which was only studied in the last couple of weeks.",
                "Strengths: well organized, great professor and tf\r\nWeaknesses: response papers repetitive, grading felt somewhat subjective",
                "It's a broad introduction lecture, so it's going to have its shortcomings. I think that the biggest issue is that most of the class material gets bogged down in the early 20th century and feels useless for our papers.",
                "Strengths: The class talks about relevant topics in international security with just enough granularity to avoid overcomplication. Compared to other editions of the class, it has an appropriate amount of workload and is structured really well in the middle of a pandemic. Weaknesses: The class feels a little bit outdated and sometimes hard to follow. It is funny because at the end of the semester, Professor Monteiro told everyone about how other countries would look at the class almost as an imperialist apologia and how they would have delved more into postmodern theories of power, and I felt like that was exactly what was needed for the class. So much of the class focuses on conventional security threats and nuclear warfare, both of which I could not grasp the relevance of studying even if I understand the class materials.",
                "At times the discussion sections, particularly with Professor Monteiro, were very broad in scope, which made it difficult to relate them to that week's readings and recorded lectures. Section meetings were most helpful when they began with a focused discussion of that week's material, before expanding to large-scale topics.",
                "Strengths: very well-organized, TFs very helpful and engaged, sections were engaging\r\nWeaknesses: class discussions could have been better served to review and understand course materials\/be less lecture-esque; recorded lectures were posted too close to class time; it was sometimes unclear what students were supposed to take away from readings (i.e. big ideas or also minute details, etc.).",
                "I was honestly very disappointed with this course. If anything, it should be called a WWI-WWII history class with some focus on nuclear deterrence. Though I wholly acknowledge Prof. Monteiro is a gifted researcher and has contributed greatly to the field of international security, this course did not feel like a survey course of the field, but rather a course where Prof. Monteiro could explain to us the areas of international security of which he was most interested (those being WWI, WWII, and nuclear weapons). The course felt exceedingly dated and largely inapplicable to today's threat landscape, and when we raised this concern to him, Prof. Monteiro simply stated that he would not change the course materials or focus, which did not put my mind at ease as a student truly interested in the field of international security. I understand the importance of learning about the foundations and historical debates in the field of international security, but Monteiro seemed to completely focus on the wars of the early 20th century at the expense of teaching us about current threats (like, why did we discuss railroads in Vichy France as an example of guerrilla warfare when there are so many more recent, pertinent examples that are more relevant- especially when a European war is more unlikely than wars elsewhere in the world). Additionally, some students raised the valid criticism that the course only used scholarship by men (and predominantly white men). At this concern, Monteiro simply stated women in the field of international security are hard to come by (which is true), but he was exceedingly dismissive at the valid concern and honestly  as a woman interested in international security  I felt dissuaded and patronized by his explanations as to why he would not find more research conducted by women to include in the syllabus.  Overall, I would only recommend taking this class if you need to for the global affairs requirement.",
                "Professor Monteiro is so knowledgeable and really cares about his students.",
                "The sections and the Professor's pre-recorded lecturelets were the highlights of the course. In section, we got to debate the readings and challenge each other's views on security matters. The mini-lectures were concise summaries of the week's material and distilled all the major lessons from each topic. I would say that the live-lectures were limited in participation to a few student's participation and there were many students who did not participate at all. This was quite disappointing because discussing the topics and disagreeing on issues was the highlight of the course. Honestly, maybe cold-calling students in the live-lectures would have increased participation. Additionally, Professor posed very broad, challenging questions to his students which could have dissuaded participation. Offering the questions in advance helped participation but at times it was still lacking. Perhaps students should be required to submit questions before the lectures?",
                "Strengths: Professor Monteiro is amazing! The course is extremely well-designed and the Prof has clearly put a lot of time into arranging the syllabus readings & topics in a framework that I found facilitated my grasp of the material. The recorded lecturelets are extremely thorough (to the point where if you miss a reading--or a few--you'll still get a solid understanding of the main ideas), and I found it particularly helpful that Prof. Monteiro focus on big ideas but would also briefly reference which works these ideas came from (again, helpful if you missed a reading). \r\n\r\nCole (TF) is without a doubt the best TF I've ever had. His section was my 4th Zoom class of the day last semester--typically a recipe for me zoning out--but Cole was always super animated and brought an awesome level of energy to class. He's genuinely excited to discuss the material and is above all just a great guy. If you take this class, make sure you get Cole as your TF. You'll thank me later.",
                "Strength: Nuno does a great job making a lot of complicated ideas seem intuitive\r\nWeakness: The length of the reading list led to a lot of skimming",
                "Overall it was a very strong course with good instructors. The recorded lectures made it easier to rewind and go over things I maybe didn't understand the first time, but it was also hard to ask questions in the big class discussions because it often felt like students were meant to only inquiring about things they already knew the answer to, or had formulated an opinion on, rather than to clarify things that we didn't know what to think of yet. Of course it may be the by-product of student made atmosphere, but it felt reciprocated.",
                "Strengths: Range of readings, genuine effort to present multiple perspectives on the topics we covered, course format, genuine effort and engagement from Professor Monteiro & Cole DeVoy. I really liked the final assessment as well. I actually learned a lot doing my literature review and I think that it was much more realistic to ask us to consolidate knowledge on a topic than to come up with an original critique of something that we had covered in the semester. I felt a little nervous starting out since the format was unfamiliar, but once I got going I really got into my topic. I feel like I got an opportunity to apply the tools of analysis (if not the specific concepts) that we had spent all semester covering. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think I got as much out of the reading responses as I could have. They kind of happened in a vacuum and I wish that I'd gotten more of a chance to discuss and engage with other students or gotten more feedback on them. I did think that it was useful to organize my thoughts in writing rather than just speaking in class though. Maybe a good change would be to have a couple of longer reading responses in the form of a paper (on any 2-3 modules that a student wants) but also have the option for written engagement on a discussion board. Or one student could pose a question to another that requires them to engage with the reading, for example: \"Which theory about how democracy spreads do you agree with the most? Why?\" Or we could choose to answer the discussion questions in written format and then have an opportunity to read responses from other students to see what they think about the same question.",

                "GLBL 275's pre-recorded lecturelets and weekly synchronous virtual discussions were an effective adjustment to online learning. Class assignments were all papers, avoiding the potential issues inherent to taking exams in an online format.",
                "Although the lectures were often late, making it more difficult for the Monday class, this was very understandable given the pandemic and Prof Monteiro's own family struggles with COVID. I thought that the 20-minute lecturelets were a good length, and uploading the slides was very helpful. I do think that there was too much demanded time (more than there would be in a regular semester), given the combination of minutes spent watching the lecturelets, in section with the professor and in section with the TFs.",

                "I really appreciated Prof. Monteiro holding the synchronous sessions with us, but sometimes it felt hard to participate. The introduction of discussion questions ahead of time helped, but it was hard take a stance when I was still trying to absorb the material.",
                "I think Professor Monteiro's seminar-styled lectures were really great, but I would have liked the schedule of the \"lecturelets\" to be more flexible. We were expected to watch all of them by my Monday lecture, but they were often released on Sunday.",
                "generally I'm very disengaged with COVID courses, this one may have been the worst of what I took this semester because of the lecture format. That could not necessarily be fixed through methods.",

                "I enjoyed my live virtual discussion section each week! Even though we were not in person, my TA made the conversations engaging and made sure to loop all of us into the discussion. However, I did not enjoy the format of watching recorded lectures beforehand and then also having to meet once a week in a small lecture & discussion setting. I did not gain much from these live virtual small lecture & discussion settings.",
                "The recorded lectures before the discussions both during the live virtual classes and sections were helpful in understanding the weekly material. This structure as part lecture and part seminar was great for this course's ability towards teaching during the pandemic.",
                "Very good job adapting to Covid-19. The lecturelets were great (loved the shorter format, with more). I also liked the group discussions with the Professor, though sometimes it was the same students talking. I realize that is not the fault of the professor.",
                "I thought this course adapted well to the pandemic and I appreciated the weekly live meetings with the professor. The only negative, in my opinion, is that I sometimes had trouble understanding lecturelet concepts and felt they could have been more thoroughly explained as they may have been in a live setting.",
                "I think that it was the best option for a class this size.",
                "I think the way the class is structured with prerecorded lectures, optional live lectures, and mandatory live seminars is really effective for the class. Professor Monteiro's pre-recorded lectures are really well delivered.",
                "The recorded lectures were executed well and the formatting of them was very conducive to learning. Meeting twice seemed redundant at times, although both Professor Monteiro and the TFs made each meeting very engaging.",
                "I think the set-up worked really well! My only suggestion would have been to have a more organized discussion in the live sessions with Prof. Monteiro.",
                "The course consisted of 3 components: asynchronous lectures, synchronous class discussions led by the professor, and synchronous discussions with a teaching assistant. I felt all three were incredibly redundant, and frankly, a waste of time. Even under the difficulties of teaching and learning under the pandemic, the course was way more time-intensive than it needed to be, and was honestly disrespectful of the student's times and learning situations. Adding up the total lecture times amounted to nearly double the time that two synchronous lectures should have been, and that is not taking into account the fact that we were expected to ALSO go to an in-class discussion with our professor and then another one with a TA. The lectures were frequently uploaded late (many were uploaded late Sunday or on Monday, when the first in-class discussions took place Monday early afternoon) and were incredibly lengthy. As a result, Monday's class was frequently unjustly underprepared, and many times Prof. Monteiro would complain or say backhanded comments about Monday's class having a less lively discussion than that of the Wednesday class. Uploading late lectures inherently disadvantaged the Monday class most always, as there was little time to prepare the excessive lectures and reading materials before the synchronous discussion, yet Prof. Monteiro rarely acknowledged how it burdened us. Moreover, I found another problem in the fact that it was hard to foster a class discussion on the same material twice a week. In essence, Monteiro's discussions was a glorified version of the TA-led discussion section, so there is only so many students can bring up if the readings and lectures are approached in the same way. There was no clear delineation about what differentiates the Prof-led section from the TA section, and it was hard to predict what either was going to discuss. Lastly, especially given the constraints placed on students by the pandemic, having us watch four 20-minute (or more) long lectures and attend 2 superfluous discussions, I found that Monteiro frequently assigned around 8 different readings amounting to over 35 pages most usually, which frankly is ridiculous and grossly excessive for any lecture course. I would have a different opinion if each reading contributed a different valuable insight, but most were exceedingly similar and totally unnecessary... again disrespectful to students in any semester but especially during a pandemic with learning restrictions and non-traditional learning environments.",
                "The TA discussion section was really engaging and helped me to understand course material. However, he gave us way too much class time (with 2 discussion sections).",

                "Online learning sucks. There's no way around that. I do think, however, that Cole and Professor Monteiro made the most of a bad situation. The combination of live vs recorded lecture + readings + live section really worked for me. This was the best format of any of my classes. I could watch the lectures and do the readings on my own time, but the section and live sessions kept me accountable each week to stay on top of the work.",

The sections were the shining light of this course and truly strengthened the insights and learning of students.",

Prof. Monteiro removed the midterm and final examinations this year, so the workload was not nearly as bad as it seems to have been during previous years. The reading is a LOT, but most of it is really interesting and rarely repetitive. Prof. Monteiro is very transparent about which theoretical paradigms he subscribes to, but makes a deliberate effort to teach other paradigms as well (assigning the foremost scholarship in those areas and discussing them in class, etc...) and explicitly notes time and time again that there are very smart people who disagree with him for very valid reasons.",
