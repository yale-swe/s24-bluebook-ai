                "Strengths: engaging, discussion-based",
                "Strengths: Scope of material you're exposed to (seminar covers so many different fields - physics, chemistry, meteorology, environmental science, human history, etc), engaging discussions that foster participation, interesting readings, very knowledgeable and encouraging instructor.\r\nWeaknesses: Organization\/use of Canvas website.",
                "The discussion and presentation mix was a diversified way to design the classes and I found it highly effective. I see no improvements that could be mde for the course.",
                "One strength is the emphasis placed on student participation. Everyone was able to share their thoughts, and this led to very interesting conversations.  One weakness is that I felt some of the readings could have been shortened or otherwise adjusted so that they were more relevant to the class discussion. I also think that some classes would have benefitted from having more structure instead of just being free discussion."

                "I would recommend this seminar to other first-years as a way of trying something new.",

                "I would recommend this class. I thought the content was fascinating. It's the kind of class where you get out what you put in, so I would only recommend this course to a student interested in the topic. I learned a lot about climate history."
