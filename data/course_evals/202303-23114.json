                "One strength is the emphasis placed on student participation. Everyone was able to share their thoughts, and this led to very interesting conversations.  One weakness is that I felt some of the readings could have been shortened or otherwise adjusted so that they were more relevant to the class discussion. I also think that some classes would have benefitted from having more structure instead of just being free discussion."
