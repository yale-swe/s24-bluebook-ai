The class environment is welcoming. \r\n\r\nThere could be more clarity around projects and homework assignments. It wasn't always clear what we were supposed to be doing. Additionally, class often ran late so explanations of homework and projects were rushed.",
                "There were virtually no strengths besides the ELCs. I thought the ELC options were fun and engaging and I'm ultimately glad I was forced to do them, but they were also a great source of stress.\r\nThe course material and the way this class deals with topics like race is a huge weakness. A lot of the material was very focused on white Hispanic people, and when anything was focused on Indigenous people or Black people, it was in a negative way. The short \"La Noche Boca Arriba\" was, frankly, awful to watch. There was an Indigenous person in my class who visibly was uncomfortable with the short film, and I later learned from her that our professor had used the word \"indio\" to refer to Indigenous people, which is apparently a slur. Our professor didn't even mention this until we watched \"Tambien la lluvia\", which used the word in the movie. I can't remember a singular time we talked about Afro-Latine culture in class--it was completely focused on the white aspects of Latin America and Spain.",
                "One of the weaknesses is the lack of support for the completion of ongoing projects to ensure that students are not heavily penalized for their earnest attempts.",
                "This course had a wide variety of topics and content which were all very interesting and informative. I appreciated that the course also had Wednesdays as asynchronous learning as I think it was helpful to learn and engage with the language in a different light. However, the daily workload often took much more time than expected."

                "I would not recommend this course if you are not white. The course material in itself tends to at best leave out POC and at worst demean POC. Of course, if you're taking this, you're probably taking it because you are trying to fulfill the language requirement that Yale has. In that case, I would recommend not taking it with Juliana Ramos-Ruano, because she is not a good communicator and will make this class harder than it needs to be.",
