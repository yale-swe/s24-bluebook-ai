   "comments": [
    "I learned the math behind cell systems and how to use Matlab to model cellular dynamics.",
    "I learned how to model a variety of biological situations, as well as the general skills necessary to extend this to other contexts.",
    "I think that this class was a useful introduction to techniques used in modeling biological phenomena that will be useful in my scientific career.",
    "I learned a lot about the dynamics of biological systems. I feel more prepared to tackle matlab analysis and programs. This formalized a lot of intuition biologists might have about how the systems work and added on a lot more.",
    "I learned some coding in Matlab and lots about writing differential equations for modeling basic biological networks",
    "I learned the mathematical principles behind modeling systems such as gene expression and how systems can be altered to induce things such as irreversibility, switch-like behavior, etc.",
    "I learned mainly about biological processes and how they work in the process of computation.",
    "Good overview of ... i mean  modeling biological systems. It really is in the name. Worth taking if you need a class that shows you have a basic grasp of math and against all odds (though I wish they had done more to make it a focus of the class early on because I feel like I didn't actually understand it until about November) I actually learned matlab.",
    "ODEs, MATLAB (but not much), modeling gene expression and ligand-receptor binding using math, Michaelis-Menten dynamics.",
    "This course was very useful for analyzing speed and movement through biological systems. It explains a lot of the math behind many models used for enzymatic processes. Both professors were very friendly and helpful in explaining the material. The problem sets were interesting and relevant and definitely reasonable in workload and difficulty.",
    "I somewhat learned about how to code in MatLab as it relates to modeling biological systems. I also learned a little bit about various models for biological systems and situations commonly studied. Most of the class was on systems talked about in other biology classes but with math\/modeling introduced.",
    "Honestly, I didn't learn any biology, I didn't learn any matlab, and I didn't learn any math, so I don't know what I learned.",
    "I learned about the thinking process that goes into making biological models. Particularly, I learned how to transform biological problems into ordinary differential equations, and use those to model systems over time, both deterministically and stochastically. I solidified my MATLAB coding skills and practiced simplifying complex problems.",
    "I developed foundational understanding of modeling biochemical reactions and particularly, of undertaking quantitative analysis of basic network motifs widespread across molecular biology (e.g. in gene expression, signal transduction pathways, particularly enzyme kinetics, and of modeling noise and stochasticity in these networks).  I developed some familiarity\/skill with MATLAB (although the course is not a programming course). Really, as a neuroscience major, this is one of the most useful courses I took this semester -- I really appreciated learning the mathematical basis for different network motifs involved in pathways I study, implications of these for executing different assays, and being introduced to MATLAB and BioNetGen"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "KMJ's part was very nicely taught. TE's part was not clear and difficult to follow. Additionally, it would be nice to give practice questions since the final is going to essentially be an in class conceptual\/math exam.",
    "It was quite difficult to follow the content of the course a lot of the time. Easier with KMJ, but overall still a challenge. The actual concepts were interesting and not actually that complicated when things started to click.",
    "The biggest weakness of the class was that sections were essentially the TAs going over the answers to the problem sets and not reinforcing class concepts through other methods.",
    "Kathryn Miller Jensen is fantastic. She explains things very clearly, is eager to help students, and clearly knows the content well.",
    "The second half of the course could be improved by spending less time on derivations of various equations, and instead, devoting more time to more clearly explaining the conceptual aspects of the systems we modeled (for instance, I found that the lecture on ultrasensitivity focused too much on the math, such that I didn't walk away with a good understanding of what can actually cause a system to exhibit ultrasensitivity).",
    "I feel that it would have been better had we had practice problems available to us for the final exam- the exam was very different from the rest of the class.",
    "One strength of this course is that I was able to learn about something that most basic biology classes do not expose people to: the mathematical basis behind biological systems. It was a good introduction for biology majors who have not been exposed to the more quantitative side of biology before. One weakness is that the different parts of the course can seem very disconnected at times. Another weakness is that the course is sometimes not at all engaging. Since much of the material is deriving equations, some classes will just be spent watching the instructors do algebra on the board, which is probably the most boring class-time activity possible. I often left these classes feeling I hadnt really learned anything as any broad concepts were lost in the mess of constant manipulations and derivations of mathematical formulas on the board.",
    "you may not understand the course material and still do well",
    "Strengths: professors, content\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it was a little tough just having a final with no practice questions or context for what it was going to look like, and the TAs, while kind, were not the most helpful.",
    "Strengths: KMJ is a pretty nice professor and her notes were helpful \r\nWeaknesses: Almost everything honestly. Lectures are generally very boring and muddled, the psets are overly complicated and vague (the TAs would end up giving answers to everything to almost the entire class), the final exam was fairly atrocious and the presentations felt insignificant in the end. The course also boasts that you learn MATLAB, but there is no dedicated teaching time to it and the class exercises don't make much sense.",
    "The course was initially advertised as a MATLAB focused class that would teach the basics of MATLAB and enable students to use it to develop models. I do not feel as though that was the case. MATLAB was not taught but was expected for a lot of problems so as a result, students gain only a select knowledge of specific models. Even then I am not sure I would be able to reproduced the code, only analyze it. I'm sure this is less of an issue for people with programming experience but I was a little disappointed that I did not leave the class with a sufficient knowledge of MATLAB.",
    "The strengths of the course was that KMJ is an amazing professor. I enjoyed the content overall, but the class seemed a bit random at times, particularly the switch between the two professors. I don't really feel like I learned that much in this class, not because I knew everything, but rather just because it seemed a little scattered. Since I didn't have any coding experience going into the class, I particularly didn't like the fact that all the MatLab stuff was taught in section, which was hard for me to go to. A large number of students in the class had coded before, so the class was essentially a piece of cake for them, which was very frustrating for anyone who had not coded. Also, since the homeworks were almost all MatLab based, the final was really hard to study for since there was no expectation or practice final given. I did worse on the final than I should have mostly because there was no expectation of what to prepare.",
    "One source text could be super helpful, as well as more time dedicated to making sure key concepts are fully understood. The posted notes were nice, but I was never sure where to turn to if I didn't understand something. It felt like most lectures were just derivations of a bunch of math behind a model that got 3 minutes of explanation at the end of the lecture so we never actually got the core concept. The psets were the only grounding thing in the class, but even they were mostly matlab based and we were never even actually taught matlab. Overall, this course needs to make sure its assignments actually support each other in understanding. The final was also brutal, as there were no practice problems and we all signed up expecting a take home. There was no easy way to prepare, so everyone was in this awkward position of having a near-perfect on everything else but then practically failing the final. So, we'll see how these grades go.",
    "Through this class, I could really get a sense of what it is like to build biological models. We spent a lot of time going through mathematical details and thinking about the biological meanings of our mathematical models. The class read several foundational papers that supplemented the lectures, and the models we built for homework were interesting.\r\nThis course was challenging mostly due to the math involved. It would be really helpful if the two instructors on the same set of notations, especially for gene expression. Also, we were often confused by a jumble of similar letters (for example, k vs. K vs. Kd vs. kappa). Perhaps they could be made more clear. There were some parts of the class that assumed previous knowledge, such as lambda phage and null clines. Those concepts should be explained a bit more thoroughly (especially null clines, which is a new concept for someone who hasnt taken multivariable). Perhaps a reading could be assigned that explains what these are.\r\nHaving a final exam (as opposed to a final project or a take-home) presented lots of stress to students. Personally, I think it makes more sense to do a final project, because it would allow us to actually apply the knowledge learned to real-world problems.",
    "Some strengths -- foundational material was presented in a clear way in lecture+ lecture notes and a coherent cumulative trajectory overall. The pset questions (particularly the derivations and experimental assays) tested and thus encouraged development of rich understanding.",
    "strengths: discusses real world examples, and makes use of practical knowledge that student will definitely use in the future, assignments are fair, the weight of grading is fair \r\nweaknesses: one of the worst courses I have ever taken at Yale, much of the material is far off complicated examples of the systems and models we are trying to learn, much of the time students are lost instead of receiving clarity through such examples, very rarely are students able to ask questions because THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO ASK BECAUSE THEY ARE LOST during the lecture, there is NO support in learning the technical parts of the modeling software used, the course claims that students \"learn to model using MatLab\" however students are expected to know how to use the software and have a background in coding in order to succeed, following assignments I received little to no feedback or explanation of my grade \r\nimprovements:\r\nspend more time explaining the models, even if it is repetitive instead of (or at least before) using harder more complex models to explain them, provide more MATLAB support (considering the majority of assignments require it), make professors more accessible in their approach to students"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class if you have an interest in computational biology. It was pretty cool to learn how MAPK works in terms of ODEs.",
    "As it's one of the only Matlab classes offered, yes I would. Especially if sections could be better, I think it is a very useful class.",
    "Yes, I think it's an important aspect of biology to be familiar with.",
    "If youre taking this class because you think you will learn matlab, think again. Although this class is advertised as having a large matlab component, a relatively small percentage of the class was dedicated to coding, so if you have no prior coding experience, you definitely will not walk away feeling competent in matlab. I would probably not recommend this class to anyone unless they are truly interested in this topic (for instance,  modeling a MAPK cascade or lambda phage or chemotaxis of e.coli). Prof KMJ's half of the course was significantly better taught than TE's half of the course, so be prepared that what you see during the first 2 classes during shopping period is not what you should expect for the entirety of the course. Lectures were often pretty dry, with a lot of math derivations. The workload is low (a pset every other week) but as a result, when it came time for the final, I felt pretty underprepared. I think this year was the first time students had to sit for a final (as opposed to take home final), although we were allowed a note sheet. The final was challenging, but fair-- make sure you make a good note sheet.",
    "I would recommend, but not if you really want to learn coding. You won't get that out of this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if theyre interested in the math behind how biological systems function. For those seeking a broad introduction to systems biology, this is a poor course for that.",
    "yes, if you want to learn the computation behind biological models",
    "Yes! If nothing else, do it for the professors. They're both great teachers and very passionate and knowledgable about the content. Also they're nice and patient and understanding.",
    "Absolutely not. This is not a required course and therefore you can take another option instead of this, so please do it. I can't really see who this course would truly benefit. There is too much math and programming for bio\/neuroscience majors to enjoy it, but not nearly enough for math or CS majors. The MATLAB felt more of an after-thought than anything else. If they want this course to improve, they need to devote teaching time into the programming aspects of the class instead of just relegating it to pass\/fail exercises that don't teach you anything. The final exam was also a difficult mess in which there was no guidance given. I guess it isn't that much work overall, but I would still avoid if possible.",
    "I think that this is a very good course for students interested in learning more about biological system dynamics. The math is very well explained and expectations are incredibly fair. I always found the lecture material interesting and engaging.",
    "I ultimately regret taking this class because I feel like I never really got comfortable with MatLab and that the final really hurt my grade, which was good up until that point. KMJ is really great, but Emonent's section was a lot harder and less clear. The class was full of people who had done everything before, so there was kind of no chance to succeed if you weren't from a background that would've prepared you for it. This class was definitely the best out of all of the MB&B electives, so the other options were much much worse, but if you are MCDB, Neuro, or anyone else, I wouldn't really recommend this course just because you won't really know what's going on until the very end.",
    "No. It has potential, but there's no continuity in theme and between the two different professors and lack of textbook, I'm not sure how it's worth it. At least both professors are actually nice people who care though, even if they're sometimes too smart to comprehend that undergrads haven't studied these things for years and years and probably aren't following (@Emonet)",
    "Biological modeling is an essential skill to have for anyone interested in research. The content taught in this class is valuable and important to learn. However, it is not an easy elective. If you have never coded before, you will find problem sets difficult, especially in the beginning. This class provides guidance on how to use MATLAB, but it is ultimately up to you to put in your own effort to learn how to code. Keep in mind that this class relies heavily on the quantitative. Every class will involve some level of applied math, ranging from algebra to solving ordinary differential equations (the math involved is not actually that difficult; but there are so many variables to keep track of, so you need to keep your notes organized). I would recommend some level of exposure to multivariable calculus before taking this course. The prereqs are single-variable calculus + intro bio sequence, but I think you should take a couple of more advanced courses (e.g. biochemistry) before taking this course. The professors tend to go fast, so be ready to be proactive and ask for clarifications. Its really easy to become lost in this class, because you have to follow every intermediate step in deriving mathematical models. Overall, this class can be pretty challenging and classes can become bogged down in details, but its not too much work. Studying for the final exam was the only real stressful part of this class.",
    "Yes! I loved the course and really appreciated how it complemented my other neuroscience courses\/ enriched my understanding of essential network motifs and quantitative analysis. I often felt frustrated\/unintelligent during it when I struggled to fully understand what seemed like basic concepts, but the professors were supportive, the lectures organized, and the course well-structured to promote student learning. The course is interdisciplinary, practical, and made excellent by supportive and engaging instructors.",
    "No, the professor is scary and unsupportive of students, the type of class where the professor acts like theirs is the only important class or the only one you're taking. Very difficult if you have no background in coding, as the professors provide no support in teaching you how to navigate the program. Biology background is helpful, but not required. Although it sounds like a biology driven course, it is not, biology is merely the stage or lens through which you are learning mathematical models. You will feel alone in this course if you do not have peers around to help you. Unless you are the type of student that has a very extensive background in mathematical modeling, this course is not fun."
