                "Strengths: I felt very prepared for the final exam Weaknesses: the class felt very disconnected, like the concepts we go over in p-sets was different than what we learned in discussion sections which was different from what we go over in the exams. I also felt like the communication in the class wasn't great, like we really didn't have the material to prepare ourselves for the final until the last minute. You can get things out of this class, but it will have to be mostly self-taught.",
                "While the content is very interesting, it is extremely badly taught. Both professors made mistakes in recorded videos without ever acknowledging them and appear to have cared very little about the course. The TA, on the other hand, is wonderful, and having the choice of when to take midterms\/exams was very much appreciated.",
                "The strength of the course was its breadth.  I felt exposed  but not overexposed  to a number of relevant linear algebra concepts, and capable of carrying them forward into future work and applying these techniques to different classes of problems.  The pace and depth of the course were both good.  The homework assignments were largely enjoyable  most problems that were assigned were of appropriate rigor and corresponded to notes and examples from class.  There were always one or two problems, however, on each homework assignment that seemed completely unrelated to the techniques or examples shown in lecture, forcing me to email a ULA to get clarification.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses included those certain, frustrating homework problems as well as poor instruction from both the professor and TA.  The class was co-taught, with Ofir and Yariv alternating weeks of recording the lectures.  I felt that Yariv was marginally better at explaining concepts than Ofir, but they were both subpar.  Students would be well-served by going through the textbook alongside lecture in an effort to catch any omissions in instruction, cross-reference poorly explained concepts, and connect the various theorems and concepts to each other.  The professors did quite a poor job on this last point.  In the course of studying for the exams, I came to realize just how interconnected many of the class concepts were.  The instructors did not emphasize this or elucidate these very clear, concrete connections; I only understood their relations to one another as I went through the textbook",
                "I wish the answers to homeworks and exams were posted after grading so that I could have improved as the semester went along instead of waiting until the final exam",
                "Strenght: ULAs are helpful \r\nWeaknesses: Course is super messy, lectures are basically just three examples and then they give all types of weird problems on PSET\/Tests, professors are super vague about grading and material",
                "Weaknesses - extremely disorganized and lectured were incredibly hard to follow",

A lack of explanation, weird notation, poor handwriting, and no time to ask real questions.",
                "The course featured two prerecorded lectures that we could watch on our own time, which was helpful for integrating the class into a schedule flexibly.  The ULAs were willing to answer questions via email, which was of great use in understanding how to approach many homework questions.  I only attended a single discussion section with the TA.  Failures in virtual learning included lectures that often exceeded the normal amount of time wed have been in class under normal circumstances.  Additionally, there was no Zoom link posted for the final exam review session.",
                "The recorded lectures were done very well which was awesome but many of the live sessions repeated the same exact notes. It wouldve been more helpful if the live session had different examples. This started happening toward the end of the course which was helpful",

                "It's a good introduction to linear algebra, which is an essential skill for most engineering and science disciplines. If you're not a fan of proof based math, take this over 225. Don't expect to learn things with direct applications to your field, however. Most of it is relatively abstract math but if you're taking it alongside classes for your major you'll be able to see strong applications.",

                "No.  I took this course because I was excited to learn more about linear algebra, a fascinating and useful field of study.  The material in this course is not too hard or mind-bending or anything of the sort.  I would recommend learning about linear algebra, just not through this course.  Students who take this course wont have too difficult a time working through the homework or studying for the exams, but by the end of the semester theyll become tired and frustrated at the poor level of instruction.\r\n\r\nThe professors and TA dont seem to care about students or their learning  I understand that things are virtual, but they seemed more unenthusiastic, distant and disconnected than they could have been.  Lectures were unimaginably dull, and the instructors didn't seem to hide their disdain at teaching us. Youd think that Yale would assign engaging, charismatic professors to teach fundamental courses such as this, but the instructors for MATH 222 (and many other lower- and mid-level MATH classes) serve as evidence to the contrary.  \r\n\r\nAnother irksome aspect of the course was the instructors aversion to posting clear, thorough solutions.  I did well on the all the homeworks and, fortunately, didnt need to consult the solutions very often.  But exam solutions were largely cursory, failing to explicitly show all the steps involved in arriving at the answer.  If those solutions had been turned in on an actual exam, I find it hard to believe the submitter would have earned an A, so incomplete was the work.  Furthermore, midterm solutions were posted a whole 48 hours before the final exam was due to begin.  So much for learning from our mistakes and using prior assessments as study tools.\r\n\r\nFinally, please know that if you are looking for a course that demonstrates concrete examples of how these tools can be used in science, medicine, machine learning, or anything else, then this isnt the course for you.  This wasnt too much of an issue for me, but students should be warned that there isnt much to the With Applications part of Linear Algebra With Applications.",
                "Only if you have to take linear algebra. This class is so poorly run though. To illustrate this, here's an example. The professors did not mention anything about final format until the day before the final. The professors did not communicate anything about grading until the day of the credit d fail deadline. The professors did not post any homework solutions and only posted practice final solutions on day of final.",
