                "The course if overall organized, but the professor was always rushing, trying to finish all the course material. Either the material should be simplified, or the professor should find a way to manage the class time better.",
                "The course was well-organized, with clear lectures, homeworks, and projects. I felt that I got a lot out of the assigned Python practice, that the tests were fair, and that the class itself was engaging.",
                "strength: very illustrated\r\nweakness: overlap of class and reading material makes me think we can go a bit faster?",
                "More exposure to Pandas and make adjustment to the course contents",
                "Good at teaching though problem sets, could have a more engaging class",
                "The only weakness was how short the class times were. Strength was how much I actually learned and how hands on it was.",
                "The course could be a little less wide in content and allow us to engage with topics with greater depth.",
                "I really think this course is better off being taught in an all-virtual setting, either over zoom or as an asynchronous class. The lecture style does not fit this course well at all. If it is in person I think it should be in a computer lab or some other smaller setting. Only a core group of like 20 or 30 people ever went to class at a time anyways.",
                "Exam could be replaced with more practical project.",
                "I appreciated the live coding very much. To hear Professor Meyers speak through his thought process as he was coding was very helpful.",
                "Strengths - lots of material covered, combination of lecture and showing coding helped me learn really well\r\nWeakness - material was sometimes covered very fast; simply working through the concepts at slower paces would help decrease need for extra google searches",
                "Content was good, could be a larger focus on the coding aspect though.",
                "Strengths: it is well catered so that you do not have to go in person if you dont want to. The resources available for students (tutors, Ed Discussion) were all very useful too.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we worked with a real python package like pandas instead of using the pedagogical data science package.",
                "This course goes at a good pace and does a great job of getting you to a solid level of comfort both with Python and basic statistical analysis. The projects really help you cement your skills, they are what I found most fulfilling from the class.",
                "Exams were too hard and beyond abilities. Averages would be really low and didnt capture our learning. Also often more than one assignment a week. Too much",
                "The biggest way this class could be improved would be to use pandas instead of this weird custom data science package designed for the course.",
                "Good class. 3 days a week is a little much though. Also it was a ton of material and the exams were way harder than psets (study guides didnt give an accurate representation)",
                "Great survey of data science topics. I think tests should not be handwritten, as we never get to code without our computers in real life.",
                "The pacing was good for the most part. I didnt feel like any of the assignments were overly complicated or impossible.",
                "Lecture being recorded was very helpful with sickness over the semester. I wish there was a section though to really hammer in topics from the course.",
                "This course has a lot of information available online which is good. Office hours were easy and very helpful. However, the course was very difficult. YOu could do all the homework correctly and still perform poorly on the exams which felt unrelated and fairly difficult. There was not a lot of teaching how to code or what the logic behind sequence and order in command lines should be.",
                "Amazing course, no weaknesses!",
                "Weaknesses: Didn't know what to expect on exams, the exams were not like the practice exams at all",
                "I think the syllabus could have been organized a little more clearly (especially the bootstrap topic). I also wish we could have used Pandas rather than the datascience package for more of the course. In addition, I would have appreciated a practice midterm and final exam that more closely resembled the exam that Professor Meyers intended to write. However, this may only have been a problem for our cohort, since it was Professor Meyers first time teaching the course.",
                "The course was a great way to formalize a random smattering of knowledge I had. It wasnt particularly engaging, but Im not sure I wanted it to be.",
                "Really nice to have recorded videos of lectures. The homework and projects were very good. The midterm/exam was kind of odd, because it was handwritten.",
                "The online material for this course was well organized, and the homework assignments, practice problems, and projects assessed our knowledge well. This course could be improved by setting more realistic goals for the amount of material that can be covered in a single lecture. We often did not get through all of the planned material, and I found myself juggling half-empty sets of lecture notes. Since we have so little time allotted per lecture, it would be best to spend less time on redundant/repeated slides at the beginning of each lecture.",
                "overall pretty good",
                "This course had a lot of support built in which was extremely helpful.  There were always office hours to attend and all of the ULAs and TFs were very helpful and cared a lot about students' success.  The lectures were structured as follow-along programming practice which was helpful but could be a bit boring at times.  This course did not have section and instead had three lectures per week -- I think I could have benefitted from a section in this class but office hours were helpful in place of this.",
                "This course could be improved by adding a review session each week were a TA goes over the coding specifics in more detail and slower which would offer more practice for those who have never coded before.",
                "Strengths, the work on homework assignments matches what is learned in class\r\n\r\nWeakenesses, the work learned in homework and lecture is not a great reflection of what is in the exams",
                "The class is pretty repetitive and the lectures are very bland, not a lot of engagement but the content is good to learn through the problem sets. Should not be paper exams though.",
                "I think the fact that Yale and Berkely both teach the course is a huge strength because it allows us both to use each other's resources. For example, Berkeley's Data8 page has a ton of practice exams and video walk-throughs that are really helpful! I also think the fact that Prof Meyers recorded lectures was really helpful, especially when I got COVID! Lastly, the teaching staff did a great job providing office hours and matching us with project partners. Everyone was clearly very well organized, so thank you!\r\n\r\nWe often jumped between powerpoints and coding in lecture, which made it impossible to finish most topics in 50 mins. Also, I didn't realize that the topics (esp when we moved into statistics) were pretty heavily connected to one another until I actually sat down to review for the final. I think this is because the class moved just so incredibly quickly. I feel like it would be better to alternate between content days and coding days to maximize understanding. Also, the exams in this class were all coding-heavy. This made the midterm and final high stakes and honestly so stressful. I felt like I would've benefitted much more from a heavier focus on statistical understanding than having to memorize syntax errors to nail questions tricky questions.",
                "This course was so great and really straightforward to follow the lessons.",
                "Strengths: organization, engaging lectures, well-paced, committed professor and teaching staff, interesting and relevant applications of course content in assignments and projects, extra practice and many TF office hours, recordings of lectures\r\nWeaknesses: some weeks, when both a project and assignment were due, it was a little overwhelming.",
                "Strengths: The homeworks and projects were very well written and thorough. Materials were easy to access.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes exam questions were oddly specific/box you into coding an answer in one particular way",
                "Lectures were very helpful. PSETS cemented material. Exams were more difficult than expected.",
                "The lectures are clear and comprehensive, covering basics of statistics and data science coding using python. The class would benefit from more preparation for the exams and time per class",
                "I really liked the course, however, I don't think it was necessary to include the participation component. Also, there were too many homeworks and projects.",
                "strengths are recorded lectures and a lot of office hours, helpful tfs, frequent practice and hw/projects",
                "strengths: uploads lectures so you don't need to go in person if you learn better that way\r\n\r\nweaknesses: assigning psets during midterm/finals",
                "This class teaches the coding of Python principles very well.",
                "A major strength of this course is how accessible it is for those without a background in statistics, computer science, and data science! Prof. Meyers and the teaching fellow team were definitely extremely helpful, and having class comments on EdStem supplemented learning even more. A weakness might be the distribution of the 3 major projects (which essentially are larger psets); we had only one project in March and then two in April, right around the time for midterms, which led to class feeling slightly rushed?",
                "writing code during exams was quite challenging, having been typing code in python the entire semester.",
                "Love the online resources and the availability of practice questions.",
                "STRENGTH: The structure and calendar of the courseed discussion posts, regular homework assignments, partner projectsalways kept the material in the back of your head, even if you put zero effort into the coursework. On the weeks when I had to sacrifice brainpower from one class to put it towards another, I never felt like I was falling too behind in this one. \r\nWEAKNESS: This is a computer science class, yet the midterm and final exams were mostly free response, written code. As a student whose introduction to coding was taking this class, I learned throughout that coding is less strictly formula-based and more trial-and-error. So then why are we being asked to memorize an entire textbook worth of code that could possibly show up on the final exam? This class would make much, much more sense if its final assessment was in project form or online exam form instead of being hand-written.",
                "I liked the lecture recordings and the ability to re-watch and go through the slides, but I wish there was a little more freedom on some of the homework assignments. Sometimes I was just doing exactly what the directions transcribed, but would not have been able to repeat it on my own without the directions.",
                "Strengths: I adored the variety and range of the PSETs and the class exercises  we covered so many cool things, like pandemic data, basketball stats, and even mapping ASL movements! I really appreciated the availability of office hours as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the paper exams. this is a programming class, and it makes no sense that the exams wouldnt be on a computer where youve actually learned the material",
                "strengths: psets are easy to follow, lectures are recorded, projects are manageable, can work with partners if undergrad\r\n\r\nweaknesses: too much overlap in lecture content",
                "It is very slow paced and a gentle introduction to the steep learning curve that is programming languages",
                "strengths: it is delivered in a clear manner; the workload and the pace is good\r\nweakness: sometimes it is hard to see the code and follow to type the code in the classroom",
                "this class was very scattered, from the content, the teaching, and assessments. for example, the practice exams were completely different than the actual exams and also what we learned in class/the type of work we were doing in homework, projects, and even the midterm -- the professor even told us that the final practice exam was totally different than the actual final and that the final was going to be really different from the midterm"

                "Yes, it is not only an interesting class and serves as a good introduction into concepts of data science and programming, but it is also an important subject, as it teaches us how statistical conclusions we read about are formed.",
                "yes",
                "Yes",
                "yes",
                "Yes. If you want to learn how to code, this is the class to take!",
                "Yes. Still good to have a general understanding of coding",
                "Yes, for those who want an introduction to data science and analytics.",
                "Yes, it is great introduction to fundamental programming and stats skills.",
                "I would, the workload is manageable and the skills are applicable across multiple different fields.",
                "Yes as an alternative to CS50. However, this class was not well facilitated to help students learn all the material and when the project and the homework assignments were due, the class felt a little overwhelming. Finally, there was little feedback until the midterm and by then it felt like it was very late into the semester to relearn all the material.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it teaches you the basic skills needed in this technology-focused world. Professor Meyers is great!",
                "If you would like to learn introductory python and stats together this is a great way to do so",
                "Yes, for a varied introduction to data science",
                "If youve never coded before or only have informally or not in a relevant way, itll be fun. For anyone with coding or stats experience, its a megagut, so if thats what you want, go for it.",
                "Yes, great intro to data science and python.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in statistics and are looking for an introduction to Python. This course is a good starting point for people with no coding experience (like me). That being said, all of the work we do with Python is within a course-specific data science package, so not all of the skills and commands we learn will generalize to Python used in other settings.",
                "yes, great intro to python",
                "Yes -- this course was the right level of challenging and I learned a lot.  It's a good applicable intro stats course and gave me a great intro to Python programming that I can transfer to other programming languages.  It's a good diagnostic course to see if you want to take further programming or stats courses at Yale.  I am planning to take further stats courses after this course.",
                "Not currently, but if changes were made I think the class could be helpful!",
                "I probably wouldn't recommend this course to another student, especially a humanities student. I had never taken stats or coding prior to YData and often felt incredibly behind my peers (who all seemed to have at least some sort of prior stats knowledge). If this course wants to be an introductory course, it should truly limit enrollment to students who are new to stats/cs. Again, the midterm and final were unnecessarily high stress because of their heavy emphasis on coding by hand (like, not being able to test your code and handwriting it instead). There are obviously multiple ways to code a given problem, so I'm curious as to how exam grading worked if the answer keys presumably have one coded solution, despite the fact that there are often multiple ways to code any given problem.",
                "Yes I love it and its easy to follow.",
                "Yes, if you're looking for a general overview of Python",
                "Yes, it is great for an intro to coding",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. I had no experience with programming, statistics, or data science prior to starting this class and now feel very confident in my ability to take more S&DS classes. The lectures were engaging and the course was well-organized so that the assignments, projects, and practices complemented the lectures. There were many opportunities to get extra help and to practice.",
                "Yes. Great intro to data science, pacing is very good.",
                "Yes, it is a great easy way to learn Python and to become familiar with statistics concepts.",
                "yes!",
                "Yes, if you want an intro to data science.",
                "I'd recommend this course, yes, but especially to students with little or no background in statistics and computer science. This class' material issss accessible but do NOT expect this to be a gut/easy A!!!! Only doing the psets and watching lectures probably will not be enough; to really grasp the lessons, you should go to office hours and complete practices and read the textbook chapters, too. But you will come out of this class having learned a great deal about data science!!!",
                "Yes. A great course for anybody interested in pursuing data science or data analysis in future. No previous background in python coding is necessary.",
                "Yes i think it is a great introduction to data science and the capabilities of the field.",
                "I loved this course! Ive never done any python and I had a very minimal state background (Im a humanities student), but I found it engaging and I learned so much!",
                "this is a good course to take to learn a bit of database manipulation, not the best intro course if you want to learn how to program",
                "Yes, this is a great introduction to programming course with lots of resources and applicable examples",
                "Yes",
                "no, not if you just need the qr and it is all python -- all you do is code"
