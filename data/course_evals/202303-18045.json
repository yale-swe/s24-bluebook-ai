                "How to understand and question statistics. How to understand historical impacts of race, ethnicity, and immirgation and how they affect contemporary life.",
                "I learned about the rabid topics around race",
                "I learned overall trends with respect to whites, Asians, and Blacks within the United States. I learned about migration patterns over time and how to assess articles for scholarship. I also learned about various sociology experiments performed to determine the trends in race migration patterns.",
                "I learned a lot of information about basic statistical analysis and also how numbers actually do lie, a lot. Also learned a basic demographic profile of the United States which was super helpful.",
                "very practical skills about politically correct terms in present day society. Also, we learned a lot of history behind immigration policies.",
                "Introduction to ER&M but with a more statistics-based approach. You don't have to know anything about computing statistics-- the class just studies demographics and very numbers-based data more than other sociology courses I've taken.",
                "I learned more about the history of migration to the U.S. and how different racial identities were constructed in the context of this migration and U.S. political climate.",
                "Basic knowledge on immigration in the US, \r\nWhat sociological research is like",
                "I think as a Sophomore this class was not too groundbreaking for me in terms of skills. I think it was valuable in that you learn a lot about american culture and society in terms of pure facts\/statistics. However I found that the pure breadth of the class sometimes made it hard to feel truly knowledgable about any of the specific themes in true depth. I do think this is a good starter course though to expose you to a bunch of fields of study in order to help you decide what truly interests you. Sections were honestly a bit lacking in terms of rigor and depth of conversation. I felt like so much of the literature exposed you to interesting and important conversations and research practices\/angles yet instead of truly engaging with them it just felt like we got a brief overview or look into this discourse. Such as debates around race, culture, and outdated forms of research. Professor Kao would often make comments like \"this is what [enter group] think but I'm not endorsing or saying this is right\", which while I understand, often felt limiting in terms of what we should take away from the course\/lecture. Instead of thoroughly exploring some of the contentious issues we just got bullet points to write down. I think it would have been ore interesting (while adding work so I understand if this is unwanted) to take notes outside of class on the pure facts\/statistics of american social composition in order to leave lecture time to rigorous exploration of issues.",
                "I learned how ethnicity, race, and immigration topics are intersected with sociology. The class focused on interpreting graphs and charts that had to do with Census or Pew Research Data. In addition, we learned how to interpret sociological papers.",
                "This course gives a broad overview to topics in race, ethnicity, and immigration in the United States.",
                "you learn a lot of mental frame works of society, policies and social patterns. Definitely a good introductory class if you are interested in the matters of race, class, gender especially the statistics. I would not say it's super nuanced that you become super well read. However, as you touch on each topic briefly, it is paired with readings and you can deepen your knowledge the way you like and consulting with the TFs or professor."

                "Strengths: I felt like I learned a lot with a very manageable course load. I really loved Professor Kao and the TFs. Lectures were engaging. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the course felt a bit disorganized.",
                "I prefer discussing readings in lectures but by the end of the course, we were more focused on reading graphs which I find to be less helpful",

                "Good lectures and section helped to clarify questions and discuss readings. Readings were generally helpful to my understanding. I enjoyed the essay questions as it gave me the ability to show my understanding and reference readings. Reading responses were not difficult but helped me prepare for section and quizzes.",
                "Many of the readings for this course seemed out-dated, and while it was useful to read those papers, I think it would be beneficial to also include recent papers on those same topics.",
                "be more specific in lessons",
                "A strength is Professor Kao's enthusiasm towards teaching. She always showed up prepared with great lecture slides and would lead an engaging class. However, I do think a lot of the material and readings were outdated. I think the course would very much benefit from more recent and more complex material. I understand that this is an introductory level class but there were definitely some nuances to trends that we didn't analyze. I also think the course could be extended by eliminating the last 3 weeks which were dedicated solely to student presentations. I don't think it was necessary to give presentations, but rather each student could have written a summary of what they were working on for their finaly presentation.",
                "Strengths of this class is that it assumes you don't know anything before hand, weakness of this class is that it assumes you don't know anything before hand. Kao is fun and honest though so overall good class.",
                "strength: very structured and straightforward lesson plan\r\nweakness: unfair extra credit given out",
                "The calss was slightly disorganized at times but overall was a very good intro\/ survey course.",
                "This course was very interesting and talks about very important realities of the world.",
                "The strengths of this course was that readings were fair and engaging. The expectations for the course also seemed fair given the content. I would say the weekly reading summaries helped me prepare for writing the final paper although it was difficult at times. What could be improved is more guidance through the final research project.",
                "The course content is interesting, but the course needs to be more organized. Clearer instructions on what the readings for each class were and how they related to the lecture, as well as clearer lecture slides would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: not at lot of work, will learn a bunch, flexibility with tfs and professors\r\nWeaknesses: recorded attendance was hard for me, borders on boring, wished the weekly summaries were discussion posts instead, wished quizzes were more spaced out",
                "The course is very well structured with readings directly intersecting what we went over in the lectures. However, I felt that the discussion sections were very repetitive of what we went over in class. I wish we would have used that time to discuss other topics more deeply rather than go over the same material.",
                "Strengths: Low stress, relevant topics. Weaknesses: surface level content",
                "Learn plenty of vocabulary and graph reading skills if you're new to statistical data and studies. You also gain historical context of American societal structures without having to do too much historical research or analyzes. It is definitely a class that builds on prior knowledge."

                "Yes, if you want a very basic introduction to sociology. As a STEM major, this was a nice break from my other classes but if I were a sociology major, I would probably have taken a different more interesting course. This course covers a lot of broad topics.",

                "I would recommend to anyone looking for an introduction to the subject",

This course gives an integral overview of different migration laws and helps inform why certain demographics fall under certain trends with the combination of history and data. This course also encourages you to engage critically with data used to inform different opinions or statements that actually may not be true.",
                "Maybe to a first-year trying to get a sense of sociology or ER&M as a major, but for the most part, no. The course was extremely disorganized and the assignments didn't feel like they were helpful to my learning. The lectures often had nothing to do with the assigned readings, and I didn't feel like I was getting helpful feedback at all. However, the freedom in choosing topics for the last research paper was nice and the readings themselves felt like topics everyone should know when living in the US.",

The workload was manageable and the readings were very interesting and insightful.  The class was well organized and well taught. Professor Kao added lots of great insight and personal anecdotes that helped students understand the topics better.",
