Professor Peterson has high expectations for his students, and I appreciated when he pushed us in discussion to be more precise or thoughtful about our comments.",
                "I was able to develop my research skills early into my first-year which has allowed me to write comprehensive papers for my other classes.",
                "Thinking about historical events in the context of the underlying environmental conditions that set the limits of what is possible",
                "a comprehensive introduction to environmental history, from pre-colonial times to 1700's or so. Learned about how colonists interacted with Native American, animals, plants, and the land more broadly. Extremely insightful and encompasses a good amount of perspectives.",
                "I learned about early American history with a specific focus on climate as a means of driving and influencing history. This improved my understanding of how climate conditions and land use shaped indigenous practices, colonization, and the development of the early American state. The class does not exclusively focus on climate, instead looking at how various forces intersect and influence one another, including agriculture, economics, war, politics, and religion.",
                "The most valuable skill I learned during this course was time management of the weekly readings. This was a comprehensive history course that provided me a wide range of perspectives on the environmental history of Americas.",
                "I got a broad overview of how people used natural resources in early America and learned how ecological changes and pressures shaped politics. I also got practice reading and analyzing fairly technical primary sources."

            "comments": [
                "At times our reading load of one book per week felt unnecessary; we could have read a few select chapters from each book and then discussed those more deeply.",
                "Strengths: Engaging material, rigorous classroom expectations, kind and supportive professor. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes inconsistent classroom leadership from Professor Peterson, sometimes low engagement from students (not the professor's fault, really), too much reading (I hate saying this, because in theory it shouldn't have been too much reading, but some weeks I felt that so many pages were assigned that we were unable to productively talk about it).",
                "I feel that this course was very hands-on and introduced me well into the history department at Yale. I definitely considered becoming a history major while taking this course as the material engaged me so much.",
                "I think this was a good course topic on an often neglected subject. For the most part, the reading list was great and interesting, but it felt hard to discuss the reading in classProf. Peterson always wanted to give a lot of background information, which was helpful but turned half the seminar into a lecture and took away a lot of time that could have been used to discuss topics students found interesting in the reading. This course may work better as a 50 minute lecture plus discussion section in the future.",
                "Strengths: professor very good at giving context and highlighting important points while also allowing for student input, cool content, I looked forward to going to class every week; weaknesses: I generally prefer being given a shorter reading to read in full rather than being assigned a full book a week and being told to skim it, but that's a personal preference",
                "Strengths included relaxed seminar setting, felt comfortable to talk. Also papers allowed you to explore topics you're interested in. Weaknesses were a ton of reading which made arriving to class fully prepared difficult.",
                "I think this course was designed to facilitate conversation and it led to interesting class discussions. The selection of materials was thoughtful and covered a wide array of topics that allowed students to pursue what they found most interesting. In that way, I think the scope of the material covered was realistic and successful. Personally, I thought the structured conversations were more engaging than fully unstructured discussions, and the debates/alternating summaries were a strong part of the seminar. I think an issue with the course was that it picked up on different levels of prior knowledge, leading to some content mismatches among students. I found it helpful when it was a hybrid lecture and seminar, starting the class with some important contextual review.",
                "Strengths: discussions. very engaging and professor Peterson was an amazing discussion leader. \r\n\r\nWeakness: weekly reading length was extensive.",
                "The course covers a totally different type of history than you learn in high school and sometimes the readings can be really thought provoking. The course shows that there's no such thing as \"environmental history\" because every history always relates to the environment. You start to thinking about topics like the relationship between the US and Native Americans, and the industrial revolution, in a much more nuanced way. \r\n\r\nI also liked the flexibility of the final paper. Professor Peterson is also very good at making seminar \"active\" and setting up debates that are a lot more fun than standard discussions. \r\n\r\nOne weakness is that, because this was a new course, the syllabus isn't perfect. Some of the books were fairly dense and it's hard to read 300 pages about forest management policy. I liked the books but, if you're not really interested in the content, it's easy to get bored. It seemed like engagement with the readings was mixed, although the canvas discussion posts helped.\r\n\r\nI think the best way to improve this would simply be to intersperse longer readings with shorter books/papers. I also really wish that looking at primary sources was more emphasized throughout the semester. The final paper was all about analyzing primary sources but we didn't have any practice doing that beforehand. Maybe some of the primary sources that were informally presented in class (e.g. the Domesday book) could be part of our assignments."

If you are taking this out of interest in the environment or early America, they yes-- but be prepared to devote a lot of time to readings in order to properly engage in class. Professor Peterson is very knowledgeable and helpful-- use him as a resource!",
                "I absolutely would! I loved Professor Peterson, he was always available to speak regarding the material and your papers. He was definitely my favorite professor this semester.",
                "Yes! It's a very interesting course if you're interested in the subject matter, and the professor has been doing this for a long time and knows how to run a seminar",
                "Yes, very great environment to learn about environmental history!",
                "I would recommend this course if the student already has a preexisting interest in environmental history and a solid understanding of early America. The material is interesting but fairly niche, and this would not provide a sweeping review of the period. That said, if these are subjects of interest, I think this class explores the topic of environmental history in an interesting way and can change your understanding of the major forces at work throughout history.",
                "Yes! Be prepared for a lot of reading but you will come away with an influx of knowledge!",
                "Yes. If you are genuinely interested in the way that climate/environment impacts society, this class is solid and the professor is very energetic. But you need to be self-motivated so that you do meaningful research for the final 15-20 page paper -- you'll need to spend a lot of time doing outside research. \r\n\r\nFor that reason, this is probably best for history majors (and maybe environmental studies majors too)."
