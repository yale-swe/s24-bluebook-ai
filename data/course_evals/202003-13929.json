                "Strengths: Class was very well organized and very thorough. Problems sets were very comprehensive and ensured you really understood the material. \r\nWeaknesses: The problem sets were very long and some problems just felt like a waste of time. It was also annoying when there were mistakes in them. Breakout rooms during live class was also very awkward.",
                "Professor Uyanik was a terrific instructor. He explained concepts clearly, was patient with student questions, and always gave helpful answers. He was also always enthusiastic and energetic. The only potential weakness I can think of is that a number of the problems discussed in class were exactly the same as those in the textbook. This is a little bit of a double-edged sword; while it reinforced the concepts, it sometimes was a little repetitive. It was also frustrating that problem sets frequently had corrections made in the middle of the week, as I had already done them some of the time and thus had to redo my work. But that is understandable.",
                "Strengths: it's so hard to do poorly if you reach out when you are struggling! I mean this. There are so many peer tutors and the professors are all willing to meet during office hours (or schedule another appointment) if you find yourself not understanding something. I really enjoyed feeling like I always had a solid support system. The videos were always uploaded early, along with problem sets, so I enjoyed the promptness of those. I did find myself struggling at some times to complete the pre-class quizzes on time because it's a lot of constant work, but the videos are very well made.\r\nWeaknesses: it was really hard sometimes to reconcile the idea that I was in a huge class (lots of sections!) and also in my specific section. I felt a little shut-away from all the other MATH 120 students except during peer tutor office hours, where people from various classes would congregate. Again, I occasionally found myself struggling to make the pre-class quiz deadlines since it's such a constant (but small) workflow.",
                "The strengths of this course were the resources available to help the students understand and master concepts and succeed in the class. The instructor and the course director were always available to talk to or email regarding unclear directions to assignments or ways to improve in the course. There were review sessions, peer tutor office hours, and supplemental resources that helped me understand difficult concepts that I struggled with understanding at first. The weakness of this course was the fast speed at which material was covered, which at times, made it difficult to truly understand concepts that were taught. More time could be allocated to difficult topics while less time could allocated to less difficult topics to help with the struggles I have had with the speed at which the material was covered at.",
                "The breakout sessions were boring and often nervewracking, as usually no one spoke and it was very awkward. The problem sets were fine and could be done especially if you had help from another student, but if you didn't know anybody else in the class it was hard to get help unless you went to the peer tutors (which is scary). The second and third midterms were not really like the practice midterms in my opinion and they should have been more like the first. I loved the final project, and I hope they continue to implement the project even after virtual learning is done.",
                "Strengths: the course was well structured and the material was straightforward.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it was hard to get to know Professor Uyanik due to the online format.",
                "Strengths: very organized, clear textbook and lectures, dedicated teaching staff, lots of support\/office hours\r\nWeaknesses: given both the virtual and live lectures, it felt like there could be a lot of repetition of the same topic.  I often felt like I was just doing busywork to get through reading the book, watching the videos, and going to live lecture.",
                "The recorded lectures were very informative and helpful. Actual class felt slightly repetitive, but helped reinforce the ideas. The exams were fair but the graders are very nit-picky, and the anonymity of graders encourages this.",
                "It is very straightforward",
                "Strengths: The material was very clear and well presented in the the pre-recorded lectures. There were many opportunities to get help on things I didn't understand. I also thought the material presented was pretty cool.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The live sessions weren't super engaging.",

I also think that we were able to be engaged in class in asking questions and responding to his questions. I also enjoyed the breakout sessions where we worked in groups, although there was often not much discussion in those groups (although this might be the same dynamic even if in-person). If I have one suggestion, it might be to have more anonymous polls, so that students can participate more without being afraid of answering incorrectly. There were a number of them, particularly towards the end of the course, but more could be utilized.",
                "The pre-recorded lectures are helpful! I really like how well the videos are made, even if my professor reviewed many of the same concepts in class. I also appreciated how we were put into breakout rooms (encouraged to turn video and audio on) to do worksheet problems. I think the biggest con of COVID-era learning is that it's sometimes a little hard to find all the other people who are also taking MATH 120. I feel like I could've met a lot of other math-loving (or math-struggling) people if there was more unity across sections.",
                "The live virtual lectures succeeded. The concepts were taught by the instructor in a way that was both engaging and helpful to my learning. The breakout rooms during class time helped me communicate with peers and work through problems assigned by the instructor. The pre-class recorded videos by the course director were also very helpful in the understanding of concepts in this course. More poll questions could be assigned during the live virtual lectures to facilitate more engagement from all students in the class.",
                "The fact that the last midterm for this course (that has a majority first-year population) was two days before move-out during a pandemic is disgraceful. It put so much pressure on 18 year olds to decide whether to prioritize their housing situations and moving out or the midterm. The online midterms are already stressful enough because of the strange format and being required to keep your audio on, but forcing first-years to take an important exam while they are coming to terms with the end of their first real college experience is upsetting to say the least.",
                "The prerecorded videos were clear and easy to follow, but the live lecture felt a bit repetitive afterwards as we mostly covered the same material.",
                "I did not really like having both recorded and live full-length lectures.  It felt like I was doing the same thing over again 3 times for one topic, and watching the videos in addition to reading the textbook and going to class took up a lot of time.",
                "The recorded lecture videos by Prof. Hall were very helpful. Class could have been more engaging.",
                "I thought learning via pre-recorded lectures was really effective because I could pause and re-watch difficult bits that I didn't understand at first. Class participation was pretty hard in the zoom lecture format because it felt kinda awkward, but there was nothing really you can do about that. I liked that the live sessions used breakout-rooms to solve example problems, I thought that was the most useful part of the class. The lecture before the breakout-rooms sometimes was a bit repetitive of the pre-recorded lectures and was a bit boring because of it."

                "Many people who take this course do so because it is a pre-requisite either for their major or for a course they wish to take. To that end, I would certainly not not recommend the course. It is certainly challenging--even for someone who has taken a high school course on the material--but the concepts that are covered are pretty important and fundamental. So for someone who wishes to take further mathematics or courses which require a solid mathematical foundation, I would certainly recommend it. But if someone simply wishes to obtain a QR credit, there are probably easier courses with lower workloads that people can take.",
                "Yes, do take it! Some people will say it's really fast-paced and difficult, but so long as you go to peer tutor\/instructor office hours, you will be just fine. It's a good kind of intellectual stretch. I think it helps if you have some familiarity with multivariable calc before entering, but I'd say that a good number of people who take this course don't have that. Also, the frequency of the exams (3 midterms!) may seem daunting, but I found studying for each to be manageable, given the resources they provide. If you're looking for a review on Caglar, I 100% recommend: super clear lecturer, very patient explainer, and all-around very likable and technologically-adept (go screen-sharing except when he occasionally forgets, you should just remind him if that ever happens).",

The intellectual challenge of this course was definitely greater than any other course I have taken during my first semester at Yale.

It is difficult, but with proper preparation and attendance, a good grade should not be out of reach. The professors, especially the course director Prof. Hall, are very helpful and answer questions and care greatly about teaching.",
