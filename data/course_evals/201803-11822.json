    "Continued progress with the Italian language",
    "This class really complemented L1 and L2. While I did not fully learn or comprehend the material in these classes, this class tied everything together, and I feel that I am actually conversation in Italian now.",
    "I learned new tenses that help me capture a better sense of time in my speaking. I got better at fluently speaking Italian and understanding it.",
    "I  learned better communication skills. I  also learned more of Spanish because of the similarities between Italian and Spanish.",
    "I. Particular I familiarized myself with different tenses and felt more comfortable both speaking and understanding Italian.",
    "I improved my Italian conversation and writing abilities.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: The focus of this class is speaking and comprehension. We spent a lot of time watching films, reading stories, and talking with each other. This really improved my speaking and comprehension skills. Weaknesses: I wish this course reviewed the material a little more because I did not have a solid L1 and L2 foundation, so I had to make up for lost ground.",
    "I think one of the strengths is the mixed structure it has: introduction section with new vocabulary, a short film that gives you a preview of the main themes you are going to tackle, a passage on an interesting aspect of Italian culture, then grammar. I really like group activities since this makes sure every student can practice both the newly learned material and speaking. Oral presentations help build confidence. One way the course can be is if the movies we watch are an easier to understand dialect for our level. Because when it has a heavy Southern accent and jargon, it's really hard to understand as an L3 level student which inevitably makes me focus on the English subtitles.",
    "Very simple worksheets and exercises that reviewed information at best, but was never really challenging. L3 was literally a recap of L1 and L2, nothing more, nothing less. So I didn't feel the need to dive into this course.",
    "I really enjoyed the speaking exercises we did in class as well as the workbook problems. I wish we had more lengthy conversations or acting scenarios.",
    "The class is very dynamic with many different activities. It would be nice to get the opportunity to converse with different classmates besides our direct neighbors and also read more Italian literature.",
    "I love how much we spoke and interacted in class. I improved my speaking and listening so much.\r\n\r\nI wish we could have more chances to have cultural activities as a class! Maybe making food, going on a trip, or something like that."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Italian is a great language and the Italian department makes it even better.",
    "Chances are, you have to take this class for the distributional requirement. Simona is extremely kind, so I would recommend taking L3 with her if you want to actually learn and push yourself to improve. If you do not have a solid understanding of the language already you may find this course to be a bit challenging, but if you have a solid understanding of the language, then this is a perfect continuation of Italian.",
    "Yes! I am fond of the Italian language and I think Yale has a strong Italian department. The staff is very nice and focused on students' individual growth and development.",
    "Yes; please do the abroad program and then go into L3. It's much more fun that way.",
    "Yes!! I learned a lot and the environment is very welcoming",
    "YES! Take Italian! One of the best departments at Yale and perhaps the best language! Very fun and engaging classes, caring professors, and a manageable workload.",
    "Yes. It is a well organized and engaging language dept.",
    "Definitely! This course helps to reinforce Italian knowledge as well as provide lots of fun."
