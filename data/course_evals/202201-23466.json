                "This course explored the intersection between poetry and politics in a fascinating way. I learned a lot about the poetry of the period, but also a lot about the English Civil War and the political movements and philosophies that underlie its many conflicts. We were able to read poetry as shaping and responding the political climates of the monarchy and the parliamentarianism that succeeded it, which was a fascinating historical way to read poetry that I am rarely exposed to.",
                "I learned much about the poetry and political world surrounding the English Civil War (17th century).",
                "I learned how to read and interpret mid-17th century English poetry. This required becoming familiar with the language used by these authors while also learning about the political events of the time periods that they often referenced.",
                "I strengthened my critical writing and reading of 17th century poetry.",
                "Learned about the English Civil Wars",
                "I learned a lot about the time period that I hadn't before.",
                "Before taking this course, I had not studied literature in the period of the English Civil Wars. This course allowed me to explore the connections between the democratic experiment of the short-lived English Commonwealth and the on-going democratic experiment of the United States. I learned that philosophers, writers, and leaders began thinking deeply about the merits and flaws of monarchy and about new forms of representative government as the American Colonies were in their infancy. Ultimately, I was exposed to the rich body of critical literature about the poetry of revolution in the English Civil War period."

                "The class was well-structured as a survey of early modern political thought. It was excellent in that regard.",
                "The course lacked direction and structure. There was no 'arc' to it, there was no sense of what was to be learned from each text, or how one text led to another.",
                "This course was at its best in our studies of Andrew Marvell, who is such an excellent and politically-complicated poet. We had to read his various poems against the previous few months of constitutional and political study, which made it all the more rewarding to get to the end of the course and be confronted with the various interpretations of the \"Turncoat Poet\" and his shifting beliefs. In many ways, this course felt like it was built around Marvell, and I say that as a mark of praise, as that's when our discussions could really shine.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Mohamed is incredibly knowledgeable about the period and enthusiastic about teaching it.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I felt that the course, at times, felt a little bit unaccessible. And monotonous.",
                "A strength of this course is how it zeroes in on a specific era of English poetry and allows you to take a deep dive into the authors and works of the period. One weakness is that class often felt slightly disorganized; I would have preferred a more methodical breakdown of each poem, especially since there were often only a few assigned for each class.",
                "The strength was definitely our professor, who was knowledgeable, patient, and kind. The material is challenging to learn and understand fully.",
                "Material was extremely boring, class discussion was not set up for high engagement",
                "Strengths: professor was very engaged \r\nweaknesses: sometimes difficult to straddle the history with the literary analysis",
                "The strength of this course is its connections to history. While other English classes may provide a light focus on the historical impact and context of their course readings, this course was dominated by a semester-long discussion of the strong relationship between history and literature. The poetry we read was influenced by the history we studied, and vice-versa. This was invaluable to our studies. I will admit that this approach sometimes, albeit rarely, felt more like a history lecture than an English seminar, but this did not happen enough to negatively affect my experience in the course. If anything, I have grown to appreciate the course's intense focus on history."

                "Yes, it is an excellent class.",
                "No, it wasn't particularly challenging or interesting. I took it to fulfill a major requirement",
                "I highly recommend this course to students who think they may not be interested in Early Modern\/Renaissance literature, especially since most of the students in the course said they initially wanted to take it just because of the scant amount of courses offered this year that filled that requirement for the English major. This course was enriching, its political themes and questions perennially relevant, its history plainly fascinating, and its poems at times perplexing in the best possible way. These are works that beg for interpretation, rather than offering easy and simple answers, and the historical distance allows students more freedom in truly thinking through politics and its relationship with poetry for themselves, instead of being burdened about what is right to think in our contemporary political situation. If any student is interested in political theory and history and wants to learn more about poetry, or enjoys good poetry and wants to dip their toes into a more historical and political study, this course is the perfect intersection of disciplines.",
                "Only if this is a period that excites you. The material is niche enough that if you dont give it the time it deserves it will fade into the background of your courseload.",
                "Most of my classmates were taking this course for an English major requirement. However, as a history major who just found the subject interesting, I would recommend Lyric and Revolution to others who are curious about the time period. Even for someone with little experience reading and analyzing poetry, the class was accessible and interesting.",
                "Literally only to get the major time period requirement. Otherwise, it's a pretty unenjoyable class",
                "I took this course mainly for the renaissance requirement, as did others in the class. For that requirement, it's a fine option, though I struggled with reconciling the large amounts of history we learned with literary analysis. I think if you are not an English major and really interested in the period and perhaps are looking for more humanities experience, you would really enjoy this course.",
                "I recommend this course for students in the English major who have not yet studied this period of English literature and for students who are interested in history. This course functioned like an English history class with a focus on poetry. It still offers the same level of intellectual rigor and challenge that other English courses do, but with a unique focus on the influences of history and philosophy."
