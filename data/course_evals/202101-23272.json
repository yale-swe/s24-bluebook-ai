These helped me make sense of and better put into order the sequence of events to think more strategically about this period. However, in my opinion the class often was heavily comprised of student presentations which took up most of the time, I wish that perhaps there could have been fewer, or at least shorter, presentations to leave more time for all the students to dig into the readings for the week and discuss the topics among ourselves."
