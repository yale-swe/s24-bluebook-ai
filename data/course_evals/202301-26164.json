                "I learned about the connection between the media and presidential campaigns. I improved my ability to look through dated news articles and contemporary ones in order to craft arguments about this topic in my midterm and final paper.",
                "I learned the most I could ever learn about journalistic coverage of presidential campaigns. It is a niche topic, but very interesting and relevant to today's political context.",
                "Learned the behind the scenes of political campaigns from a reporters POV",
                "A lot about the history of media and journalism surrounding campaigns.",
                "I really gained a lot of knowledge about the relationship between political campaigns and the media and how it changed over time. We were constantly discussing the ethics / journalistic integrity and responsibility behind media coverage throughout the latter half of the 20th century and some more recent campaigns. It was super intriguing.",
                "I learned a lot about how the political world works: how different players (candidates, advisors, reporters) interact with one another, and how these interactions have changed over time."

                "The literature chosen to support the message of the class was fantastic.\r\nProfessor Shapiro's knowledge on the subject was superior and so, every class lecture was engaging and informative.",
                "Strength: the syllabus, which was among the best I've had at Yale (especially towards the end of the semester). Books that I would have wanted to read anyways, and that any aspiring journalist/political strategist/presidential wannabe should read. We also had an abundant number of guest speakers (Washington Post columnists, Biden campaign advisers, famous magazine writers, etc.) who were extremely interesting. Weakness: the essay prompts were a little too wide. Discussions often became back-and-forths between individual students and the professor, which made it easy to disengage.",
                "I believe this course is well structured in the number of presidential campaigns we were able to discuss. The course was well-centered around a few themes relating to coverage of campaign media. Throughout the semester, we also had a great amount of amazing guest speakers who were able to touch on the contemporary coverage of presidential campaigns. One weakness would be participation during seminar discussions. It sometimes felt we were repeating the same ideas, or discussing events instead of diving into their deeper meaning.",
                "Strengths: The readings and guest speakers were fantastic. Professor Shapiro's enthusiasm about the topic was inspiring. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think having some exercises where we broke up into groups would help students feel more comfortable participating in class. I know that most of my classmates did not know my name, and that did dampen my own confidence to speak in reaction to something they said.",
                "it was basically just a class of the professor's different anecdotes from his career as a journalist.\r\n\r\nalso, it was absolutely insane that he even halfway expected us to purchase TWELVE different books this semester. one for each week. outrageous. then we wouldnt even really talk about the readings. he would assign like 150-200 pages a week. then we wouldnt talk about it. i dont even think he noticed when everyone clearly had stopped reading",
                "Great course!",
                "The content of the course was overall good and the guest speakers were fitting. The class sessions could have been more engaging by pulling in a wider perspective.",
                "Although the readings can be long, they are easy to read and genuinely thought-provoking. I really enjoyed how the course was structured, as it moved through different eras of media coverage and cultural tensions.",
                "Strengths: great prof, very interesting content and readings, fantastic guest speakers\r\nWeaknesses: none!"

                "Yes!",

                "Yes, if you're interested in journalism, politics, or just a political history geek, I would definitely recommend this course. However, if you're not willing to get into nitty and gritty details with readings, it might not be the course for you.",
                "I definitely would! The content is fascinating: I learned a ton about how the political world works, including the ways in which different players (candidates, advisors, reporters) interact with one another, and how these interactions have changed over time. There's a lot of reading, but it's generally very fast-paced and so it goes quickly. One of the best parts about the class is the fascinating guest speakers, including high-level officials on the Biden campaign, senior advisors to Buttigieg, prominent reporters, and more. If you have the chance to take this class you should!"
