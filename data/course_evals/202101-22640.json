                "You learn a lot about the philosophy of education and how to discuss philosophical texts, and the class forces you to take positions on certain things with an op-ed assignment, which was helpful. Primarily, this class was discussion-oriented about the philosophy of education, governance, democracy, meritocracy, and work.",
                "Don't be fooled by the name, which evokes \"good life\"-type Yale courses where you loosely ponder big questions. This is a political theory course, and the professors expect quite a bit of analytical rigor in the written papers. So, with that said, I learned to sharpen my analytical writing, which is always good to do. In terms of content, I read the works of some key thinkers in the field of educational theory. In total honesty, however, I'm not sure that this course granted me any profound insight into what exactly the authors were saying, or how they responded to one another. Though the professors provided a summary at the beginning of the class what the key questions involved in the text were, I think it would have been good to also provide a summary at the end of each session of what we covered and what the professors reflections on the text are. We as a class wouldn't get super far in the discussions, and I wish we could have emerged with a more solid understanding of each thinker. Overall, however, I do think I am a better writer having taken this class, and I am now well-acquainted with some of the key ideas and questions of educational philosophy..",

                "The conversations that surrounded each of the texts are wonderful. Professor Garsten and Professor Nevin led riveting conversations in class that were truly so thought-provoking. In terms of weaknesses: there were too many readings, they should be spread throughout the semesterreading 200 pages of philosophical texts in one week is not feasible.",
                "It really depends on who else in this class because it is so discussion-heavy, and the professors tend to stay hands-off and let the conversation go where it goes before intervening towards the end, or would ask discussion questions at different points of the class but not exactly steer the conversation. A lot of times, the discussion would end up at similar topics because students were interested in or more able to comment on certain subjects than others (for example, pretty much every class the focus would turn to NYC school inequality no matter what the readings that week were. Urban school inequality is an important subject, but it did get frustrating when it felt irrelevant to the material). I do think the professors did a good job with asking questions and probing the discussion, but I wish that they had maybe more deliberately steered class to avoid repetition. The readings were really excellent, and Professors Garsten and Almeida are excellent -- highly recommend stopping by during their office hours.",
                "I have a lot of feedback for this course, because I think with a few minor improvements \"What is education for?\" could be a very good seminar. Starting with the strengths, I appreciated that the professors required rigorous writing  I could tell they really wanted us to think deeply. The reading list is great, with interesting texts and a mix of philosophical and political theory, as well as some more contemporary works. I liked the structure with the first two weeks on modern topics, so that we could dive into material we were already familiar with, and then turning to the philosophical texts. The first and second paper prompts were good, too. Lastly, having two professors grade your papers, with two sets of comments, is a treat!!! Now onto my thoughts on how the course could be improved. First, I don't think the professors took a big enough role in the seminar. A few students dominated the seminar, often making general political comments that didn't always pertain to the text at hand. I would have appreciated a hands-on approach from the professor, perhaps intervention to shoot down the off-topic discussion and to hold students accountable to responding to other students. I could tell that the professors wanted the discussion to go a certain way sometimes, but I wasn't sure exactly what way that was  if you want us to talk about something, please just ask us to! This sometimes happened in the last few minutes of class, and when it did, it produced the BEST conversations of the semester. Some of my favorite seminars have involved lots of student contribution, as well as a lot of guidance from professors  which in turn makes the student contribution better. The second weakness in my mind is that the readings each week were very long, which may have been a source of the problem I have identified with the off-topic discussion, as people might not have done the full reading. Third, as for the last paper, requiring three authors in ten pages is just not enough space to do them all justice  I would change the requirement to 2+ thinkers. Overall, I would say that the strengths *do* outweigh the weaknesses, and again with some minor changes this course can be very good!.",
                "At times it felt like a lot of work. Additionally, although we received feedback on our papers from both Stephanie and Professor Garsten, grading felt arbitrary and when we incorporated their advice into the next paper, there still felt like there was inconsistencies in grading and uncertainty on what the professors were looking for."

                "This course pushed me to consider some very important questions about education that I hadn't thought about before. I think it's a really thought-provoking course that can also be frustrating at times because there are no simple answers to a lot of the questions we discussed. The readings were pretty long and sometimes difficult to get through, but they definitely felt worthwhile. Overall, I would recommend the class, but the grading was definitely a bit tough so you do have to work for it.",
                "I would cautiously recommend this course on the basis of the material and professors being excellent, but taking into account that it really depends on the quality of discussion and how willing you and your classmates are to charitably understand and engage with the material and each other, even if you disagree with them\/the readings.",
                "\"What is education for?\" is a good class. I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in political theory of education, NOT just education in general. I think the main weakness of the course was that the students were more interested in talking about modern issues of education rather than the close textual analysis that the professors seemed to want, and as such conversations veered off topic\/felt sometimes circular. So, take this course if you want to think deeply about what historical theorists have written about education, not just ponder the big questions of the discussions involving education today. I myself was pretty interested in the theory, and I did enjoy engaging with different authors and sorts of texts. The biggest strength of the course in my mind were the moments (often in the last 10 minutes of class) when the professors asked a really interesting, difficult question, and the students all had to pause and think about it  and some even changed their minds when this happened. We had one of these about every other class, and to me they made the course worth it..",
