I think the class could be made stronger if there was a more gradual and instituted way of learning vocabulary. I think because we were given 70 some vocab words and then expected to learn them  rather than, say, 10 vocab words a day  it made it more difficult to learn and practice.",
                "The course is very good in giving us speaking practice, although it's difficult to get the full value of that practice without being prepared before class. One weakness of the course might be that there was not a lot of vocabulary or grammar quizzes to push us to always be fully prepared before class."

However, I'd say that the more a student is engaged with and committed to learning the language, the more they'll learn and enjoy. For someone who doesn't want to put in the work, the rewards of class will probably be disappointing.",
