                "Strengths: I think the lecture and seminar format of DS is great.  I also liked having the class 3 days/week (I was initially suspicious, but it ended up being great, especially with the evening time).\r\n\r\nImproved: I think the syllabus could be adjusted a little.  I also think DS should rethink its final exams.  I get that timed essays are the classic exam format.  But it's a little jarring because DS teaches you one skill -- how to write a paper on a narrow topic over the course of a week -- and then tests you on a completely different one -- how to write less deep, timed essays covering lots of authors at once.  I don't think timed essay exams are really true to the spirit of DS, which asks you to think deeply about texts and let them sit with you.  Moreover, I don't think they are a good learning experience.  I don't find exams very productive in terms of my learning.  I think that the pandemic was the perfect opportunity to rethink how DS students can synthesize their knowledge at the end of the semester, and indeed some professors asked us if we might learn more from a culminating paper, but for whatever reason, DS didn't do anything.",
                "One way to improve the course would be to change the way it approaches Kant. I have no knowledge of philosophy beyond what I learned in Directed Studies, so I don't know how this could be done, but I do know that the weeks spent on Kant were frustrating. I was putting a lot into attempting to understand the readings and contribute in class, and it felt like I was getting nowhere. From talking with classmates, I know I was not the only one who was similarly confounded.",
                "Strengths: Huge breadth in course material, lots to learn and unpack. World-Class faculty and help to guide course structure.\r\nWeaknesses: Due to nature of course, not a lot of depth into individual ideas. Some concepts were left on-surface level due to pace.",
                "Strengths: Prof Werner really cared about his students and gave us many opportunities to engage with the text outside of class (extra credit, lecture assignments, reading questions, handouts, office hours)\r\nWeaknesses: General DS gripe, too many works not enough time.",
                "Strengths\r\n- Rigorous, systematic, challenging, and immensely rewarding discussions (the best I had in DS)\r\n- Supplementary materials Professor Werner takes time to put together (eg. handouts, reading questions) are an extremely helpful resource for reinforcing understanding as well as reference\r\n- Weekly lecture discussions with small groups of students enhance understanding in a lower-stakes setting (and honestly it's pretty fun)\r\n- Option to schedule one-on-one discussions with Professor Werner (even when there is no paper due) to talk about philosophical topics of your interest\r\nMinor point of improvement\r\n- Sometimes Professor Werner let's us spend a lot of time in discussion trying to figure out a specific point of confusion (eg. De Beauvoir on freedom). While this exercise is valuable, perhaps giving students the accepted interpretation and moving on is better in the interest of time"

                "Yes!  Spring semester philosophy was probably one of my favorite DS courses.  The texts and discussions are fascinating, and it's nice that you're already in the swing of how to write philosophy papers by the end of the semester.",
                "Certainly, and this is coming from someone who did not think they were going to enjoy philosophy when they enrolled in Directed Studies. This course taught me new ways to think and write, and included many of the best in-class discussions of my freshman year.",
                "I would, because I think it is a good background and good general ideas towards the field as a whole. Any incoming student would benefit towards understanding philosophical discipline. However, if the student doesn't want to commit to DS, or has a singular focus they want to get that taking DS wouldn't allow, there are other good options within the philosophy department for them.",
                "Yes if they wish to do DS.",
                "Without question, yes. This is the best DS class out of the six I've taken. As much about one learns about philosophical traditions in pre-modern and modern Europe (which one must know to understand the philosophical undercurrents in modern western society), one also learns how to properly think. Discussions, papers, lecture assignments, and one-on-one meetings with Professor Werner all contribute immensely to developing independent interpretations of complex philosophical ideas, through which one learns how to communicate and respond to intricate arguments. Thinking about multiple perspectives, and countering authoritative ideas, as well as one's own, are a must. There is probably not a better class a first-year can take to practice rigorous thought, whether one is interested in philosophy as a major or not."
