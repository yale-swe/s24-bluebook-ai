                "Learned a lot about Old English and, by extension, modern English. Cases, which indicate what part of speech a word is acting as,  were really interesting because they allow for incredible variations in word order",
                "I learned how to read, write, translate, and analyze Old English in a crash course! Wild. In doing so I also learned about the origins of the modern English languages which derive from Anglo-Saxon, and the sound-changes and linguistic evolution which took place to get there. Additionally, the old English texts we read became sort of grains of sand through which to learn about the Medieval English world across axes of politics, class, and gender.",
                "I learned not only how to read and translate Old English, but also how to analyze and understand it more deeply than at face value.",
                "Understanding of early Medieval European history, Old English vocabulary, OE sentence structure, OE meter.",
                "We learned the structure and basic vocabulary of Old English (OE) language. In addition to the language, we were exposed to the standard poetic form of OE,  the linguistic history of OE (e.g. Verner's Law, Grimm's Law, Anglo-Frisian Brightening), elements of comparative linguistics, the manuscript traditions of certain OE texts, and editing texts from manuscripts (one of the 3 options for the final project). By the end of the course, as it says somewhere in the syllabus (I think), we were reading real OE texts with the help of a glossary\/dictionary\/lexicon.",

                "Strengths: the weekly assignments were very interesting and continually built on each other as we learned more and more about the language, and Professor Thornbury provided detailed feedback on each one. The final project was also amazing because we had a variety of options to choice from, depending on our interests. Weaknesses: translating took a long time, and some weeks the translations seemed unreasonably long.",
                "Professor Thornbury prepared a wonderful semester that was well-structured and well-suited to becoming proficient at translating Old English.",
                "This is my favorite class I've taken at Yale. I felt my brain literally expanding from the very first class session. Professor Thornbury is the reason this class works so well. She is knowledgeable, passionate, and witty. My one weakness was that class periods sometimes felt boring because we would translate the whole time. More variety in activities would keep engagement up.",
                "Quite a good course. The weekly readings and assignments prevented us from falling too far behind and allowed us to make sure we were retaining the knowledge from before as we moved forward in the class. No significant weaknesses that interfered with my learning (though I did come to the class with a very helpful background in Latin and Ancient Greek).",
                "Strengths: The class moved at a fast but manageable pace. The content moved in a logical progression -- each concept built on previous ones. The weekly assignments were fun and engaging and helped me practice writing in OE. Weaknesses: I think it would be helpful if we had more mini-lessons on that week's grammar at the beginning of every class. Sometimes we would jump right into translations in the first half of the semester, which could be confusing without fully understanding the grammar lessons of that week.",
                "I thought this course was very well planned and organized. It was very easy to know where you stood with your work each week, and the expectations for students were very clear. I can't think of anything that needs improvement",
                "The course is structured extremely well for rapid language learning. The weekly assignments are designed to give you the skills you need to succeed in your final project."

                "Yes, if you are interested in reading Old English. Yes, if you need to fulfill your medieval requirement and don't want to write typical English papers. No, if you are looking for an easy course; the workload with passage translations on top of 3 chapters of textbook reading on top of a separate written assignment each week means that the workload in this class is no joke",
                "I definitely would. Though I originally took it only to fulfill my Medieval requirement within the English major, I truly have developed an appreciation for the complexity of the language and the cultures it can, in its fragments connect us to. However, I do warn that this course, no matter what coursetable says, is A LOT, both in time commitment and workload as the translations and writing assignments grow longer. So please if you sign up for this know that it is A LOT.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student but only if they truly want to engage with the material and more importantly have the time and bandwidth to do so. This was one of the hardest and time-consuming classes I've taken at Yale. With that said, I also really enjoyed all of the classes because Professor Thornbury is really encouraging and totally understanding of the difficulty that some students might face with the material. For English majors trying to knock out the Medieval requirement, I would say this is a good class but definitely different from seminars you might otherwise take since it functions, for the first two-thirds of the class, as a language class.",
                "Yes! Old English makes me look at modern English and the history of Early England completely differently. It was a joy to do the work.",
                "I would definitely recommend Old English (OE) to anyone wanting to major in English; it is an intellectually stimulating class, satisfies the Medieval requirement, and offers unique insight into Modern English literature. I took this class at the same time as a contemporary poetry class and discovered aspects of the contemporary poetry that look all the way back to OE. If you are not majoring in English (or Linguistics), I would probably only recommend this class if you are (1) interested in linguistically dead languages, (2) need a Humanities credit, or (3) just want to be able to work your way through some OE texts (e.g. Beowulf).",
                "Yes for sure!! Professor Thornbury is a fantastic and very clear professor. I learned so much about OE, and the class helped me develop a better understanding of grammar and English language origins in general.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in Old English. I think this course would be not as rewarding if you didn't have a deep interest in the language, as I found it to be a lot of translation work and if you don't love the language I don't think you'll enjoy that aspect of it. I loved the course a lot but could see how the work would be tedious for someone not committed to the subject.",
                "Yes, if you have any interest in Old English and enjoy learning new languages! I found that learning the Old English language has enriched my understanding of modern English. The community of the course was a lot of fun. However, if you're interested in medieval literary analysis, that is less central to this course."
