                "Problem sets were fairly confusing, but did not take too long (3-5 hours each for 7 psets). The exams seemed to test very arbitrary components of the course, but grading was not too bad",
                "Strengths: The course does a really good job of demystifying \"machine learning\" as a concept, describing concrete methods and algorithms to use. It also has a decent mix of math and coding, and I definitely worked a lot on my numpy skills. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class was also really spread-thin conceptually. It was pretty difficult to piece together concepts during lectures, and it took effort to get to a big-picture view of each topic. I wish we learned a little more about neural nets, since they seem like such an important part of machine learning today. \r\n\r\nWays to improve: I think lectures rely too heavily on slides: yes, they're good for regular bullet points and images that depict algorithms and results from papers. But Sahand has a tendency to just read the pre-written mathematical derivations out loud, indices and all, which is both unhelpful and hard to follow. Writing out the derivations in real-time, even if we skip a step or two, would be a lot better.",
                "there needs to be a class that prepares us to think in terms of vectors and matrices because that seems to be how everything is conveyed and what MATH 222 offers really doesnt feel enough",
                "Strengths: we covered many topics in depth, and the powerpoints were very informational \r\n\r\nWeakness: perhaps the programming assignments can be more based off of the notebooks we go over in class since the main part of the course is the math",
                "Sahand is not a very good or organized lecturer",
                "I just don't think it was a well-taught course. I didn't understand the progression of topics or why certain things were brought up when they were. It would be better if the problem sets were more explicitly explained / the programming behind them were taught better.",
                "Strength: Professor Negahban is very knowledgeable about ML. He opens up extra office hours to walk you through your confusions.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think it's very challenging for people with absolutely zero experience with Python. It takes time to understand the concepts alone. If coding itself is rather demanding, then extra efforts will be needed.",
                "I thought the course was well organized at a high level, and that the concepts were all highly relevant to machine learning. I thought that the math that we learned was important and helpful for understanding the core concepts of several algorithms. It gave me intuition when approaching problems I would not get otherwise. I think the course was weaker in its organization when it came to details. Sometimes, lectures were dense and difficult to follow, which made understanding what Sahand intended in homework particularly frustrating. Writing clearer instructions and adding relevant connections to other concepts would be helpful.",
                "While Sahand was very helpful in office hours, I personally did not feel that his lectures were well-organized to facilitate student learning. Rather than making each class a self-contained lecture, he would often stop in the middle of a Beamer presentation and pick up where he left off the following class, so that there was no real structure for the lectures. Also, for several concepts like neural nets, he focused on technical details to the extent that it was hard to keep track of the bigger picture, and it was very difficult to stay engaged in lecture as a result. This might have just been because his way of thinking about concepts didn't mesh well with my own, but I often found myself more confused after attending lecture than I would have been if I had just read the textbook."

If you're really interested in brushing up on your statistics and you feel weird about plugging and chugging ML implementations, this class (and the work you put into it) can give you a good background, and it makes reading about ML advances and research more accessible. If you're more interested in working with lots of data and have a project you want to explore, another class would probably be better. Personally, I feel comfortable to the point where I think learning about other algorithms and tweaks to the ones we learned will be a lot easier. \r\n\r\nAs a side note, I took this class without S&DS 242 and did fine! Having good linear algebra skills and a general idea about MLE is super important, though. Having previous experience with Python is also a must, and experience with numpy is helpful.",

                "Yes. ML is extremely important for a stats/CS major going forward.",
                "I would not recommend this class to other students. If you were like me, and wanted to understand the math behind machine learning while learning to apply it in practice, the class may be worth considering, however, I will say that I did not get all that I hoped. Most of the math that we learned could be self-taught much more efficiently, since almost all the math related to the class was taking gradients and partial derivatives. The coding assignments were productive, but as this class is not particularly a coding class, often disorganized and difficult to follow. I recall several times I had solved a question, and still could not understand what the purpose of the question was. I had to rely heavily on discussion forums for clarification, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but frustrating at times.",
