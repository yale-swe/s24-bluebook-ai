    "Use of pumb lines, thumbnails, more methodological approach to figure drawing.",
    "figure drawing skills. how to quickly sketch a figure. how to think about composition.",
    "Figure drawing works both as an introductory drawing course (learning about form\/volume\/line\/tone\/etc, different media, ways of seeing) and as a workshop on figure drawing specifically.",
    "I learned a lot about techniques in representing the human figure with charcoal. There was great emphasis on learning to use tone and line effectively.",
    "I learned human anatomy and how to notice different tones on the body.",
    "This course teaches you how to draw the naked human body, using various materials but mostly using charcoal.",
    "I learned about how to look more critically and draw more realistically.",
    "I gained stronger confidence with figure drawing and explored many questions of interest (including portrayal of different body types, complexions, and questions of artistic responsibility while working with models)."

   "comments": [
    "We had actually a limited number of classes that actually involved drawing from the figure (6 by my count) of which only a limited number were spent on longer drawings. I also feel like the final project lacked any form of structure or guidelines, but then people were reprimanded for breaking 'unspoken' guidelines during their critiques. One person used paint, another person drew manga style figures, others used photographs to aid in their final drawing, none of which had been discouraged in the laying out of the final project. However, when it came time for critiques all of these features were heavily criticized. I do not think it was fair these people got judged so harshly considering that there were literally zero instructions for this final project.",
    "Very enjoyable sessions\/ classes, though sometimes instructions unclear.",
    "not enough technical skills acquired through this class.",
    "The strengths of this course are definitely the ability to work with models in class and the freedom in the final project to take figure drawing into our own interests. I think we could have done more critique work in the class (though we did so briefly during the sessions with models).",
    "The course is very engaging and taught in a humane, thorough manner. I feel that there was not always a sense of continuity from class to class, possibly because there was not always homework or the homework felt unrelated, so there was always the matter of re-adjusting to figure drawing.",
    "This course was enjoyable and informative. I liked the freedom we were given during class time, and I appreciated how often we were able to have models.  I would have liked to have more assignments or guidelines for practicing outside of class.",
    "The class critics were helpful and insightful.",
    "The strengths of the course are that Professor Naess gives you a great amount of practice time, drawing bodies, to improve your skill. We also learned about good drawing techniques by observing our classmates work and other famous drawings. The opportunity to produce a final drawing project allows you to hone your skills toward one specific purpose.",
    "This course was well organized and engaging.",
    "Strengths:\r\nThe course instructor and TA were wonderful and encouraged us to capture what we saw as authentically as possible.\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\nThe MFA recruitment process interrupted our course time. For future iterations of the course, it would be great to arrange another classroom to make it possible to continue to have model drawing sessions."

   "comments": [
    "I mean, if you are interested in learning who to draw the figure, this is THE  course to take. However, sometimes you can never really tell how well you are doing or where generally you need to improve. Feedback comes in the form of ambiguous suggestions that sometimes when you follow them still lead to a negative response. I enjoyed the class for the opportunities and time it yielded for me to work on figure drawing, but sometimes I felt a little lost as to what  I was supposed to be doing or gauging how well things were going.",
    "Yes. Enjoyable lessons.",
    "yes, because i did learn a lot about figure drawing",
    "Yes. I think art classes are a good idea for just about anyone, and figure drawing feels like a great alternative to basic drawing, for example.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Just during one class period, I could feel myself improving and learning to work with the materials. It was great to be able to work from models almost every day.",
    "Yes, this class was relaxing and made me a better artist.",
    "I would reccomend this course to a student who really wants to improve their figure drawing and compositional skills through a large amount of practice drawing the naked human form.",
    "Yes I think it was enjoyable and improved my drawing ability immensely.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to grow as an artist and explore the flexibility and decisiveness required to work with live models, you should take this course."
