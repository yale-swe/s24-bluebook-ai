                "I was introduced to so many diverse authors writing in so many different forms about different topics. I've found some newfound favorite authors in this class. I learned how to have collaborative and critical class discussions over literature where we can weave our personal opinions and experiences with literature. Although the course was not essay-heavy, it was a nice introduction to college essays without it being overwhelming or harshly graded.",
                "It's difficult to articulate what you learn about loneliness. I learned about the difference between solitude and loneliness. I learned about finding solace in loneliness, loneliness amongst others, and loneliness in its rawest and most nuanced forms. The material covered in this class was extremely diverse, and our dive into indigenous poetry and literature was incredibly enriching, especially with Professor Hickey's love for that subject. Really, I learned a lot about what it meant to feel. That came not only from the readings, but also the 10-15 minute check-up session at the beginning of each class. I got to know my classmates and professor well, and it showed all of us just how different people feel--even people in the same situation, as many of us were on campus.",

This course also helped me translate my reading-analysis skills into my own writing, and I believe my ability as a writer has improved greatly as a result.",
                "We teased out the historical beginnings of loneliness and the multiple ways in which loneliness presents itself in literature (fiction, poetry, etc.). I learned how to read texts more closely and develop critical as well as theoretical understandings. Additionally, I also learned how to use archives to add a dimension to my approach to reading. This was an amazing class!",

                "BEAUTIFUL COURSE WITH BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE Professor Hickey is literally so kind and wonderful and articulate, and she helped foster a class environment where we could all connect and be heard. Readings were honestly often a delight (except Walden), and as a student of color, I felt like Professor Hickey created a diverse reading for the course and handled matters of race\/gender\/sexuality\/class without ever feeling \"fake woke\" or insensitive. Rather, you could tell that she genuinely meant what she was saying and also had spent time learning and educating herself on all of these topics (without then trying to out-woke anyone or invalidate experiences). She is the type of teacher that if you say something makes you uncomfortable  or if you need help\/an extension, then she will actually listen and understand.",
                "My only qualm with this class was the similarity of essays. Paper 2 and 3 felt like I was assigned to do the same thing, and they were both pretty vague. I love having open topics, but sometimes, I think spending a little more class time homing in on a specific goal would be worthwhile. And that should go beyond just rehashing the prompt of the essay. That might be asking a lot because the essay prompts were well put and complete, but it's difficult to grasp what to do through just reading sometimes.",
                "Strengths: This course was incredibly fun to take, and I read genres of literature I had never read before. Professor Hickey is a wonderful teacher, and such a wonderful facilitator of discussion. She makes sure the class is a welcoming and encouraging place. The readings are reasonable every week, and the discussions we have about them go wherever we feel lead them as a class. The weekly discussion leader position was fun and relatively low stress. This course creates a very welcoming and friendly environment where I felt like I could learn and discuss what I felt, which is very important considering the personal nature of this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I cannot think of any large weaknesses, except that I would have an example for the papers. Professor Hickey is very open about what she is looking for, so it was not a large issue but I do wish I had an example to look at while I was writing.",
                "This course was awesome! Prof. Hickey is a great teacher! Maybe we could have used gather.town more?",
                "The way the course was structured was a definite strength. I loved how discussions were led by one student every class and the fact that these discussions centered around thoughtful questions about the text. This led to some really thought-provoking discussions and allowed for a conversation involving multiple perspectives on the text.",
                "This was an amazing class! Prof. Hickey understood the unique nature of being a student during a pandemic and provided for me, and I think also the rest of the class, a warm, open and engaging space to learn and also build friendships. Prof. Hickey took time to get to know all of her students and always engaged with the claims we made during class discussions. The texts chosen by Prof. Hickey were diverse and provoking. Among my favorite authors that we read were Claudia Rankine, Billy Ray-Belcourt and Emily Dickinson. As for weaknesses, I think Prof. Hickey could have made the connections between the texts we were reading and our class' focus on loneliness clearer. It would have been nice towards the end of the semester to have reviewed the texts we read and trace how our understanding of loneliness as a class had evolved from the first week of class to the last. Asides from that, I absolutely loved this class. This type of class is why I came to Yale. Especially during the pandemic, a class about loneliness was therapeutic for me. If you have a chance to take a class with Prof. Hickey, do it!",
                "Strengths: Closeness of students, the selection of students just worked perfectly and everything synced, promoting a collaborative, close-knit classroom environment. Keep it up in terms of choosing students that are the right fit. A very down-to-earth professor who encourages questions and discussions is also a big strength.",
                "Course was very engaging, syllabus was great, discussions were fruitful, not too many weaknesses.",
                "I think the virtual format is always difficult, but this class handled it well! I would've loved to spend more time on the readings though, I felt like sometimes we rushed through them.",
                "The \"How were your day?\" sessions at the beginning of each class were wonderful for getting comfortable with our classmates, which helped the flow of discussion later. The variety of assessment\/project types were fantastic, breaking up the monotony of too many essays.",
                "This is an amazing first year seminar!! Professor Hickey is incredibly aware of our needs and feelings and not only addresses them but actively adapts our activities and curriculum to reflect that. We started every class with a check-in, which helped us not only just talk about ourselves a bit and get to know each other better, but also examine our private and public circles and how our readings' discussions on loneliness manifest in our lives. The readings, from a diverse selection of authors, were all very interesting and the breadth of material covered allowed us to understand loneliness through multiple lens. Often, they would reference each other, helping us to progressively build a more nuanced picture of loneliness. Our discussions were mainly led by us, but Professor Hickey would step in occasionally to add an interesting point, or give some more context, or introduce a new take. Our papers were also on broad prompts, but designed to elicit interesting and nuanced takes from us. My perception of loneliness and its importance changed so much from this class, and I don't think there were any weaknesses to mention.",

Professor Hickey did a truly incredible job making sure that school was still engaging and fun. I really felt like everyone in my class was my friend, and that I knew a decent amount about all of them.",

We're a pretty tight knit group, and I have met up with multiple members of this course outside of class just for fun. The readings and discussions were well adapted to a COVID reality, and Professor Hickey was really understanding about the changing aspect of the pandemic. Professor Hickey had us do a daily check-in, which was really nice.",

                "Yes, I definitely would! Professor Hickey is the sweetest person, and the 10-15 minute check-in at the beginning of class is such an amazing thing. It's outside of the material, but it helps you feel connected and grateful for not only your classmates but your life. Regarding course material, this class is great. There is such a deep breathe of literature from all types of authors and backgrounds--Henry David Thoreau, Billy-ray Belcourt, and Ling Ma for example. It felt impossible at first to find a definition for loneliness, but we were shown so many unique interpretations of how it feels to be lonely that it started to come together. That gradual grasp of a concept is extremely rewarding, and it's done in an incredibly interactive and thoughtful way.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any and all other students. The workload is pretty low, the payoff of the course is high, and the Professor is such a joy to attend class with. If there's room on your schedule for this course, I would recommend you take this course.",
                "Absolutely! Prof. Hickey is an awesome teacher. The course was put together very well and has given me a much deeper understanding of loneliness.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially for someone who feels the impact of isolation from the pandemic. Loneliness is something everyone experiences but is rarely talked about. I feel like this course provides important insight into how loneliness is a shared experience, while revealing how loneliness has influenced the writing of many prolific authors in a variety of ways. Super engaging, interesting course, and it helps that Professor Hickey is a fantastic teacher.",
                "Yes!! I hope Prof. Hickey offers this class again. I had never really thought much about loneliness, but this class has totally blown up my preconceptions about loneliness and expanded my thinking on loneliness to new levels. Loneliness is such a commonplace presence in our lives today, with social media, Covid-19, etc. I also think loneliness was a very unique vantage point from which to approach discussions on race, indigeneity, queerness, the digital age, nature, death, etc. If Prof. Hickey offers this class again, take it!!!",
                "Absolutely. Professor Hickey is an awesome teacher. For a STEM kid like me who barely wants to do Humanities, she'll make you willingly want to discuss, think, reflect, and write about concepts relating to our society and especially relating to the idea of loneliness, something all too prevalent during the pandemic era.",
                "Yes I would highly recommend. The content was extremely interesting and the class is run very well.",
                "Absolutely. The readings were so thoughtfully chosen, which led to such emotional and personal discussions that really allowed students to grow in the course. It was so relevant to this time as well. I absolutely loved this class and would recommend it to anyone\/everyone!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course!!! Professor Hickey is absolutely amazingshe sees her students as equals to her and that reflects in the freedom she gives us in discussions and papers.
