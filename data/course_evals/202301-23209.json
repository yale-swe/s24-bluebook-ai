But it's kinda silly 'cause the conclusion is exactly the same as what you'd think going into the course. Liberal democracy with some element of social welfare is the best kind of government we got. SURPRISE!!!",
                "I learned how to synthesize political philosopher's views across the Western tradition and compare their theories on redistribution, individual rights, and the role of morality in government. The course was particularly useful in bridging theory and practice and understanding how abstract concepts materialize into real-world politics and laws.",

I felt my understanding of the world and the way people think grow, and I feel more able to approach questions of what the public good means and how decision-making should be undertaken in the wider world.",
                "I learned about some of the leading theories in the field of political philosophy as well as how to evaluate them against and in light of each other. I also developed a deeper understanding of both the ostensible deontological and teleological purposes of democratic systems of government and how alternative designs and institutions serve those purposes better or worse than others.",

Beyond the details of each theory, I also learned the context through which they developed, how they respond and/or rebut the theories that came before, and contentions against each. This allowed me to examine political situations through a more rigorous lens, and apply diverse lines of thinking to the same circumstances.",

                "This is an excellent course. I learned a lot about some classic thinkers (Mill, Kant, Marx, Locke, etc) in a very accessible and understandable way. Professor Shapiro gives great lectures and the sections are great to supplement. If you are interested in learning more about politics, philosophy, or any combination, this is a great introductory course.",

Some big questions the class hits: What makes a government legitimate? Is politics a science? Should we strive for agreement or truth, and how would we work towards either?\r\n\r\nI enjoyed learning about the basic ideas of Bentham, Mill, Marx, Locke, Hobbes, Rawls, Nozick, Burke, MacIntyre, and more, but for me, what was most valuable about this class was connecting different thinkers to each other and applying their ideologies to contemporary political debates.",

                "Strengths: you learn a lot from an incredibly knowledgable professor. Weaknesses: sometimes lectures are dry. your experience very well depends on your engagement with the course material and your TF.",
                "Strength: it teaches all the people so you have a pretty good sense of the big ideas by the end\r\nWeakness (maybe a strength if you're lame): there is literally no incentive to do any readings. very little feedback",
                "The course has very interesting and engaging lectures with a logical sequence of philosophers throughout history. Sometimes the information gets passed by quickly, so you have to go back to understand it later. A strength of the course is in the assigned readings which are extremely rich and reasonably assigned. Section is very helpful to untangling some of the more dense articles. The lectures also draw on the readings clearly and make the connections explicit. \r\n\r\nThe course materials were also extremely accessible as they were posted online, which meant keeping up with the readings was greatly facilitated.",
                "It was a good overview of political theory and how it is shaped by historical and social forces, the ideas' strengths and weaknesses, and how we can apply them in daily life. The grading curve is slightly harsh, but not undoable. Prof Shapiro has a very distinct perspective on most thinkers that may deviate from \"the norm\" and challenge what you think.",
                "N/a",
                "This course has a very well thought out format, and the order in which we learn about philosophers/theorists is very nicely ordered in that we can make connections across the course and with our own knowledge. One weakness I would say is that the course itself doesn't really emphasize on deeper connections within the theories, and this could be for lack of time and an abundance of content, but the sections are the only time we really look at any theories with relation to one another deeper than just a moment of acknowledgement.",
                "Out of all my 25 courses at Yale I have never taken a course that makes as little sense as this one does.",
                "Strengths: very rigorous, in-depth explanation of each of the thinkers that we covereds perspectives\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: n/a",
                "We cover a bunch of material, seciton is really helpful, and some of it is super interesting. Lecture could be better organized and in terms of grading there is only the midterm, final, and participation. Smaller assignments could be really helpful.",
                "I wish there were recordings",
                "Strengths: so much engaging content, from the readings to the lectures\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures were very, very fast-paced, and the slides had very little information on them (which made recapping content quite challenging)",
                "I really enjoyed learning about the various approaches through Professor Shapiro's analysis and discussing them in section. I think some students may have benefited from the provision of feedback and opportunities for demonstrating mastery earlier in the course, and I do think a final being worth 50% of the course grade is rather excessive, but otherwise I'm not sure that I have any other recommendations.",
                "Excellent Instructor and structure of class; very interesting discussion section conversations",
                "Strengths: great lectures, great TA, great reading material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: needed more routine assessment besides just 2 tests",
                "Strengths: The course is organized under a clear overarching framework. I appreciate how Professor Shapiro uses modern examples both to showcase the relevance of older philosophical theories and to entertain students, thereby keeping us engaged. Through analysis of each theorys drawbacks and the open-ended essay prompts, the course leaves a lot of room for us to critically dissect what we are learning about. \r\nWeaknesses: The required readings are unnecessarily long (although this might be the nature of political philosophy writing), and the expectation that we finish reading before the lesson and understand it on our own is unrealistic. Towards the end, during the democracy section, it feels like the course becomes more oriented towards the professors opinion rather than a full picture. In addition, it does not seem fair that the writing intensive students do more than double the work of regular students (two 2500-3000 word paper vs. one 1000-1200 word midterm) during the semester, yet still have to take the same final.",
                "The strengths of this course were how engaging and interesting the lectures and discussion sections were. A weakness would be the level of complex readings and the lack of smaller assignments that made it so that the final was work 50%. However, I overall really enjoyed this class.",
                "Strength - it introduced a lot of political philosophy and the foundation of our democratic government. Weakness - it goes through them all quickly and doesn't provide too many real-world examples. The course could be improved if it discussed the countries where some of these political philosophies were actually part of the government.",
                "strengths-- coherent arguments, covers lots of ground within one class, realistic workload (especially the midterm format)\r\n\r\nweaknesses-- not entirely true that people with no prior knowledge of econ/philosophy/ethics could take this course and do well. a lot of self studying needs to be implemented if one is truly a beginner with no background in certain topics discussed in the class. the slides also were not super informative and were quickly covered in class, making it hard to notetake in class. this could be improved by posting the slides before class instead of after class",
                "Strength was discussion sections and the talks that we had. No immediate weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Great instructor, great TAs, great content.\r\nWeaknesses: For the most part, none. There could have been more clarity with regard to grading standards and distributions as there are such few detail given in the syllabus.",
                "Strengths: Conversations in discussion sections were very insightful and interesting. The lectures themselves were also engaging (it also helped that a coursera version was available to go back to and rewatch the lectures). Professor Shapiro explained everything in a way that was easier to digest and understand (he also provided really good examples). The TAs for this course (especially the writing intensive) were absolutely amazing! \r\n\r\nWeakness: The readings were sometimes really hard to understand and we didn't really spend that much time during class or discussion sections talking about them.",
                "Thinkers needed to be more clearly explained in lecture and more engagement  with reading would have been helpful",
                "Strengths: the lectures were great explanations of course content, easy access to TA's and help, good and important readings, great professor. The workload was reasonable. \r\nWeaknesses: section was not always helpful (content is hard to grasp, and there's way too much of it to cover in a short section). Also, there were no rubrics for the essays we had to write, so we basically had to wing it.",
                "Strengths: comprehensively covers the key phil frameworks, videos are all online, thought provoking, not that much work\r\nWeaknesses: if you're not already interested in this topic, you will likely find it pretty boring bc we go in the weeds of diff philosophies and it can sometimes feel very detached from the real world",
                "Strengths: manageable workload, omprehensive review, interesting lecture material and discussion section \r\n\r\n\r\nWeakness: course sometimes lacked clarity about where we were headed, though understandable given that it was an intro course.",
                "The structure of the course is difficult as there are really only 2 major assignments. I wish there were more opportunities to show mastery of course content.",
                "Strengths - discussions were engaging and educational\r\nWeaknesses - disorganized lectures and off-topic readings",
                "I felt the material was very interested but during lecture sometimes too much information was given in too short a time. Overall, it was fantastic course that covered a lot of material.",
                "Sometimes it's too heavy on the reading.",
                "Strenghts: Prof Shapiro gives great lectures, sections are engaging and helpful, readings are not too crazy\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: One exam is over Spring break, the other is a massive cumulative final in class",
                "I think the course does a good job of surveying a variety of political philosophers and introducing the student to their general ideas. However, some of these thinkers were very clearly given more emphasis and were studied more carefully than others; just like some of these political systems had more emphasis given to their flaws than their substance. I think it would be useful to have some readings from Plato or Aristotle or someone along those lines, since their ideas are referenced often throughout the course material as both inspirations to some of these writers and context they were reacting against.",
                "Great lectures, great prof, readings could be more accessible, wish lectures were recorded since I missed a couple and really wish I could watch the superb content",
                "More assignments related to material.",
                "The course only had 2 real assignments (the midterm and final). There should be some intermediate assignments to promote course engagement and help students solidify concepts before large tests",
                "Lectures moved very quickly",
                "Strong instructor. Well structured course. Enjoyable lectures.",
                "Strengths: engaging lectures and content, very good professor. Course material very accessible.",
                "Readings are extremely expensive and sometimes hard to keep track of.",
                "Strengths: I think that this might be the best political philosophy course offered. However, it is simply okay. Weaknesses: what you get out of section really depends on your TA.",
                "One big strength of this class is lecture. Prof. Shapiro is a very engaging teacher and covers a lot of ground while still being clear. He uses many vivid examples to illustrate his points and is very organized (often organizing points into lists), which helped me follow along. He also has a gift for summarizing pretty complicated ideas or even whole bodies of work. \r\n\r\nAnother strength was the comprehensive way we analyzed each thinker. I appreciated that Prof. Shapiro related each thinker to the others and introduced prominent criticisms of the points each made. Contemplating which parts of a figure's ideology I agreed with versus which parts seemed weaker after being scrutinized was one of the best parts of the class. \r\n\r\nIt might've been nice to have more graded assessments. Your grade is based quite heavily off of the final, which made the final feel very high-stakes. That said, this class didn't stress me out much overall, and I consider this a quite minor criticism.",
                "I think the course was generally average, I took the most away from section meetings.",
                "Lectures were really comprehensive and you can learn the entire course material by going to them and maybe rewatching for notes \r\n\r\nWish the philosophy was more specific/had more current political application and historical context, but Shapiro tries",
                "This class was super boring, the essay prompts were terrible and the TF did not care. Everyone was totally checked out, no one wanted to be there.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- I really enjoyed my discussion section\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Lecture slides go by very quickly\r\n- Prof. Shapiro is very knowledgeable, but he sometimes goes over a difficult concept without explaining it further\r\n- Would be helpful to add more information on lecture slides since sometimes there's just one word and I can't connect it back to what was said in class\r\n- The course assumes that our current democratic system is the best that we have so far, but it would've been interesting to hear more from modern-day proponents of utilitarianism, Marxism, etc., and what those societies could look like"

                "Not unless you like political philosophy",
                "Only if you're an EP&E major and need this as a pre-req. It was engaging enough but your learning depended on if you did and UNDERSTOOD the readings. I wish section was more about understanding the readings and connecting them to lecture rather than having abstract conversations about concepts brought up in class. It was hard to understand some of the more dense material.",
                "No. The most exciting parts of this class were doodling and bringing a water bottle full of ice to every class and trying to finish it in 50 minutes while attracting as few stares as possible. If it's a pre-req, take it. It's fine, and it's not that hard. But don't expect it to be super fun and engaging.",
                "Yes! It was an incredible option for learning about the foundations of political theory and understanding how these threads of thinking have evolved and grown over time. The course is rooted in history, but actively incorporates real-world examples to make all of the material visible in our current political landscape. The course has changed my view of the best system for government and has challenged me to question perspectives on economic redistribution and representation in democracy, for example.",
                "Yes, if you want a comprehensive introduction to modern political theory.",
                "N/a",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it is very interesting and engaging in the sections, I would tell the students to really keep themselves engaged with the sections and to also expect to put more time than just reading the text into their thought  because a lot of the understanding and learning is from application to the world rather than just understanding what certain theorists said.",
                "Do not take this course unless you love philosophy at Yale. This is the only course that I have gone into having already studied some of these authors and come out of lecture being entirely confused and having no idea whats going on. Truly, I left almost every class utterly confused what on earth we were talking about  even studying my notes or slides did not help. Only take this if you are totally passionate about political philosophy, and want to read philosophical, confusing texts for hours each week which may help make more sense of it all. It would also help if you knew about the authors before because they are not well described, and have read Aristotle and people like him before.  Overall, if you just want to learn basics about political philosophy in a clear, concise way -- this is not the course for you.",
                "This course is an EXCELLENT introduction to many of the major schools of political thought since the enlightenment that I would recommend to anyone interested in politics. I now feel like Ive got a relatively well-rounded perspective on the various political philosophies of our world and know where I can go for more information. Professor Shapiro was an excellent instructor and did a great job of explaining the concepts and was very receptive to student questions. Without a question one of my favorite classes this semester",
                "Yes, with the caveat that it helps to have some experience studying political science or economics to fully understand and grasp the concepts in class. I would have found this course very difficult if I did not have such prior experience. Also, the coursera version of this course may actually be clearer than the lecture itself, so if you're ever struggling to understand it, watch those.",
                "Yes! Very interesting material, will make you debate our current political systems",
                "Yes, it's a good intro to political philosophy. If you don't do the writing section, the final is 50% of your grade, so take that into consideration. Overall, I feel like I came away with more knowledge from this class than the typical class at Yale.",
                "I would! It's interesting and well put together.",
                "Yes, I think these are philosophies that everyone would benefit from understanding",
                "Yes! I received a great introduction to political philosophy through this course, and I particularly recommend it to any student who has never studied philosophy but wants to better understand the ideas of history's greatest political thinkers.",
                "Yes. I think the course provided a great introduction to a number of important theories of political philosophy as well as a means of arriving at your own understanding of what requirements a government must satisfy to be deemed \"legitimate.\" That being said, there will be very long stretches of time during which you won't be tested on any of the course material (outside of discussions in section), so I strongly advise that students hold themselves accountable for engaging with the material throughout the course on their own since you won't be held responsible for learning it for a long time, but if you let the final (which is worth 50% of your grade) sneak up on you and realize you didn't actually learn the material, you might be in for a tough final stretch.",
                "Yes 100%",
                "absolutely, makes you think about society in a whole new and thoughtful way",
                "I would recommend this course if youre interested in EP&E or a more application-based introduction to philosophy. If you wish to really deeply engage with the material and (more importantly) have time to do write two long papers throughout the semester, take the writing intensive version, as I did. Otherwise, there are writing credits which would not be nearly as time-consuming.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was unique and I feel that I have gained a lot of interesting knowledge.",
                "If you are interested in political philosophy, then yes.",
                "yes! i learned so much. however, i'd advise consistent review of material so that the final isn't overwhelming.",
                "This course helped me understand politics in a new way so yes, Id recommend it.",
                "Yes I definitely would. It was a great learning experience. I took the writing requisite version and even though it was challenging at times it helped me develop as a writer.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, taking a course with Ian Shapiro is a privilege for Yale students. You get out of the course what you put into it, so approaching the content with an open mind and a desire to learn will have great results!",
                "Yeah - it's basically a overview of the most relevant existing political theory, and the material is pretty interesting throughout. Lectures are always interesting (Shapiro has a no laptop rule so you'll be jotting down notes), and section gives you a chance to work with the ideas a bit more through discussion. Some of the later philosophers are definitely a bit harder to grasp, but they're all interesting to learn about / put in conversation with one another.",
                "Absolutely! I think it gives a really good introduction to philosophy and politics and the intersections between the two. If you're someone who's also a political science major, this course will serve you well in your other classes (especially in terms of writing).",
                "Yes, its a well structured course that covers a lot of material but be mindful that the exam questions are practically inclined, unlike what you cover in section and there are no sample questions or answers provided.",
                "Probably not as I felt it hard to really engage with the material. However, the basic knowledge I gained I do think is valuable.",
                "I'd absolutely recommend this course. Shapiro is a legend with interesting political takes, my TA was a chiller, and I had fun sitting up front and observing the lecture. I learned a lot about political thought, which is what I wanted to do!",
                "Not really unless you're taking it out of deep interest or for a WR credit (which did not take that much work but the essays are time consuming for sure)",
                "Yes, especially if you are an EPE major",
                "Yes, but I do think a basic background of philosophy would be very helpful.",
                "Yes, but only if theyve had virtually no engagement with political philosophy.",
                "Yes if you want to learn hoe to think critically and have eye opening conversations this is the class for you!",
                "I would but only if they are interested in the topic. Otherwise, I would advise them to stay away.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in the topic!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's engaging, informative, and not too challenging.",
                "I definitely would. The course is a very good introduction to political philosophy, as it introduces you to many important works in its history in a way that is accessible and easy enough to follow while still treating each thinker with a degree of nuance and real-world context.",
                "Yes for sureit isn't too much of a time commitment but the learning is extremely rich.",
                "Yes I would because it is a very engaging and interesting class for leaning about political philosophy.",
                "Of the intro to political theory classes, this is the best. Excellent instructor and was fun.",
                "Yes, for sure. Excellent introductory political philosophy class for beginners as well as people who have already read the works (equally engaging).",
                "This is a great way to get oriented in modern political philosophy.",
                "If you are looking for a really chill course, this is it. I believe this is better than the other intro political philosophy classes offerred. I had shopped one in the previous semester and this one was much more engaging. However, it is not super engaging. There is not much incentive to keep up with the reading. I think your experience in the course may really depend on your TA. Every section, my TA came in with no plan and we talked about nothing. It was a pretty painful 50 minutes every week. But it was not difficult at all; definitely my easiest course this semester.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed lecture and was super engaged in the class. Don't be intimidated if you hear the words political philosophy and think that it maybe isn't for you: the class is essentially a deeper look at how government can best serve its people and do what's just featuring a lot of famous thinkers who might otherwise be difficult to learn about (thinking about Marx here), so if that sounds interesting to you, take it!",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course to another student, a lot of the information was not conducive to learning anything real or tangible, the instructor and lectures were really hard to follow.",
                "Yes I didnt realize how good the lectures were until I sat into another plsc lecture that was all jargon. Shapiro comprehensively describes the texts w specific examples and quotes",
                "Absolutely not. This class convinced me to drop Political Science and become a History major.",
                "Yes, if interested in moral philosophy.",
                "Yes--it provides a good introduction to political philosophy and the workload is very manageable (you just have to make sure to prepare for the midterm and final)"
