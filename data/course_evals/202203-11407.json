                "I learned so much! I was entirely uncomfortable in the shop before the course and now feel agency going in and just making stuff.\r\nConcretely, I learned: welding, cutting, forging, plasma cutting, drilling, finishing.\r\nI also appreciated Desmond's assignments, which were conceptually rich and challenging.\r\nFinally, Desmond gave great feedback at the critiques that was rigorous yet appropriate to students' levels.",
                "Amongst many metal working skills, I'm the most excited about having learned to weld and cast metal. I also got more confident in exploring unfamiliar techniques and problem-solving during fabrication.",
                "I gained more confidence in sculpture in addition to specific dexterity in metal. This class really pushed me to consider more intensely how art engages with a space, given that sculpture, by nature, occupies space and communicates with the surrounding environment.",

                "I think it's a really great course. Desmond is an excellent and devoted teacher. He is rigorous, knowledgeable, and has a vision. I learned a lot.\r\n\r\nAs a place to improve, I think the course organization felt a little chaotic at the end of the semester, with too many assignments and events stacked at the end.",
                "The instruction from Desmond and Anat were huge strengths of the course, especially their insightful critiques. I also really appreciated the time dedicated to demystifying the paths to being a working artist after school this was the only class that explained the process and types of fellowships\/residencies that I might consider. They definitely demonstrated care for students as people and soon-to-be professionals. \r\n\r\nThe time commitment necessary is a weakness only because Yale College schedules are mostly not conducive to studio art classes. I think this should be a 1.5 credit class given the amount of time we are in the studio outside of class, but it's also the only class I've taken at Yale that has made me want to spend hours of my time working in the shop.",
                "I loved how open-ended each assignment was because I think that facilitates an independent studio practice well. I imagine if you are not as engaged with art making that could be a potential weakness of the course, but from what I witnessed of my non-art\/arts-adjacent-major classmates, they tended to appreciate the freedom as well. I wish the critiques were more involved, but I think thats a reflection of student interest over anything that could have been prevented by Professor Lewis or Anat, our TF.",
                "I loved this course as an introduction to a new material. Just having access to the shop and spending time working in metal with the ability to ask experienced makers for help and advice was incredibly helpful in developing my skills with metal. At times, the schedule for the class was unclear.",
                "Desmond is the strength of the class very clear in his ability to teach the tools and machines and has great knowledge as a younger sculpture who works with metal."

You get from the class what you put into itif youre not going to take advantage of the studio space and incredible resources we get in the form of material as well as instruction, then maybe the class wouldnt be as exciting.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to do metal sculpture. I think that the course catered well to a variety of experience levels and pushed everyone to consider themself as an artist and create better work.",
                "Yes, but if you are not willing to put in practice on getting better in terms of craft as an artist in this medium then you will struggle. Desmond is fair in his expectations when it comes to learning tools and processes and if you slack you will only be hurting your own chances at becoming better in metal sculpture."
