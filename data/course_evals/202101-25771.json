                "It was engaging, and it is not easy to take a day off in class (which is beneficial). Relevant assignments and interesting\/fun projects kept the course enjoyable. I do not have any complaints about the class.",
                "The course was excellent. I really liked how small the class size was because I felt like a got a lot of personal conversation time. I think it could be improved by cutting down on the online homework and replacing it with more interactive assignments.",
                "Strengths: The daily use of Spanish (either through classes or through the HW) forces you to learn the language at a rapid pace\r\nWeaknesses: The examples used in class were often well beyond the level of material learned (e.g., using vocabulary or grammar that we had not learnt yet). Although I understand that learning comes from struggling, it sometimes felt that the gap was too big.",
                "I loved the variety of activities. I thought SuperSite was very helpful for reinforcing course material. I didn't like the cultural project or the cultural readings that were mixed in - I would have preferred less time on culture and more on practicing speaking. I didn't mind the textbook, but I know some of my classmates really found it difficult to follow.",

                "The online courses worked well, but I wasn't a huge fan of having to record presentations.",
                "Succeeded: Using breakout rooms to force interactions with other students\r\nCould be improved: After the breakout rooms, limiting the read-outs \/ sharing by each group of students. Given our low level of Spanish, it was often difficult to understand what everyone was saying, leading to checking out \/ multi-tasking on our computers. Additionally, I believe that the use of Google Translate during class should be asked to be limited. I believe it often led to people creating sentences that would normally have exceeded their skill level, giving the instructor a false view of where the class was actually at.",
