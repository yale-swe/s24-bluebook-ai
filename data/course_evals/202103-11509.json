                "The lab report write-ups always take an enormous amount of time, but the teaching staff was very available to answer questions/ work through any difficulties. Additionally, the pre-lab instruction manuals were very informational and provided very solid knowledge to prepare you for the experiments/ data analysis.",
                "Strengths: experiments are engaging, excellent feedback, Dr Cooper is awesome. Weaknesses: there are weeks where there is zero work and then the workload peaks super intensely. No other course has made me pull all nighters the way this one did; then I would forget I was taking the course for a week. Instructions for lab reports are very difficult to understand. The instructions for actual experiments are dense, but then in lab you're told to ignore half of what the paper says. The rubric that we're graded against is incredibly specific, but those specific items are very hard to find in the lab report instructions (even for someone who very thoroughly reads & annotates the instructions). I think that rearranging the experiments so that electronics comes at the end and we have extra time to submit the reports would be super helpful, as well as cutting out the unimportant parts of instructions.",
                "Course and laboratory packets are unnecessarily long. Would be nice to get feedback from previous lab reports before the next one is due so we can incorporate that feedback in the next lab report and so we don't miss points on the same stuff. Cool experiments that reinforce understanding of the concepts learned in lecture.",
                "There arent any weaknesses to this course; the structure of the class is almost identical to that of other lab courses I have taken.",
                "interesting labs. Lab reports can be extremely tedious and it is often unclear what the exact guidelines are for lab reports. Despite the extensive resources on how to write them, the grading between lab reports sometimes felt a little inconsistent."

Dr. Cooper is amazing though, he's really cool & awesome to chat with and gives extensions if you need them. He really just wants to see you learn (like having us do a final presentation to practice giving scientific talks instead of some random final exam).",
