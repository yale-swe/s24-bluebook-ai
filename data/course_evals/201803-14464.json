    "This course was an excellent chance to learn about information theory, which is something I never would have encountered otherwise. Perhaps its only weakness is that we didn't spend much time working through the actual math in class, but this was possible through the readings and doesn't need to happen in a seminar format. I also thought the freedom to pursue the final research project was a strength."
