                "The last time I had taken any math class before enrolling in MathLogic (2023) was in early 2018, over five years ago. I had developed a distinct aversion to math, or at the very least to the calculus-focused trajectory (ha) of the curriculum taught virtually everywhere across the US, and didn't really understand that there were other types of math to be had. Someone told me that I had to take Sun Joo before I graduated and since two of my good friends were taking the class as well, I decided to roll the dice and try it out. I think that by the two week mark I was completely absorbed, fascinated, and stimulated by formal mathematics and the construction of a formal system. As many others have noted, the lecture explaining the formalisms behind the principle of induction, which forms the basis of the entire course and allows for induction to be abstracted from the set of natural numbers to any set closed under certain generator functions with a set of basic elements was absolutely mind-blowing, and I'd say the most important piece of mathematics I've learned in my entire life. Learning to prove metalogical propositions is a skill which sharpens the mind in a way that most other disciplines simply cannot do, and requires a heady blend of creativity, formalistic maturity, and expository skill. I gained these and more in this class, which has really been a sort of the key that has opened up the portals for my budding interests in complexity theory, theory of computation, formal systems in linguistics, ontology engineering, etc.",

                "For the first half of the semester, lecture was a pleasant experience. I found the topics interesting and enjoyed lecture. However, several weeks after spring break, the material got a lot more confusing, and I don't feel like it became more meaningful.",
                "Fantastic handouts, this course had the best lecture-PSET relevance and connectedness of any class I've ever taken at Yale. The whole class is designed to teach you how to prove completeness of first order logic. Some of that you do in class; other parts you do on your PSETs. I would suggest that the final PSET is not so gigantic and demanding in the two weeks of classes; either we have through reading week, or break it into more PSETs. It's just a lot.",
                "Weaknesses: This course professes to be an extension of PHIL 115, First-Order Logic. It was a graduate-level course which required background knowledge far beyond what I had been exposed to in PHIL 115. It also assumed this background knowledge, so that our overarching purpose of proving the Completeness Theorem was overshadowed by a need to grasp difficult, individual concepts leading up to this (overly ambitious) goal.\r\n\r\nStrengths: This course improved my ability to write logical proofs in an intelligible way.",
                "The course was very well-organized. The course is graded on your performance on the assigned problem sets alone, and these were both enjoyable and helpful for understanding the lecture. Sun-Joo is terrifically funny, engaging, and just an all around great professor and our TA Rachel was wonderful.",
                "Strengths: This class has no exams and is only graded based on psets (which might be construed as a weakness as this gives less incentive for actually learning the material). Prof Shin is hilarious and an awesome lecturer; she makes really well-written lecture notes that are easy to follow and provides great explanations. Weaknesses: The course moves very slowly as it is intended for a general audience, and therefore more mathematically-inclined students might find some lectures a little too boring.",
                "The teaching in class I found hard to follow, but notes are very helpful.",
                "Strengths: lecture handouts are very helpful and Sun-Joo is a really sharp instructor who was patient with students' questions.  Weaknesses: lectures sometimes felt disorganized. Also the collaboration policy was kind of confusing, as it felt like we weren't allowed to talk about the homework yet it would sometimes be talked about in lecture and in office hours.",
                "The course material is very interesting and it is taught extremely well. The only weakness is it was sometimes lost on me the significance of the things we were proving to mathematics or philosophy more broadly.",
                "I loved the way that this course was taught, especially its emphasis on problem sets .",
                "It would help if lecture notes were posted online, or if the professor meaningfully added to the lecture notes during lecture",
                "Strengths: the topic is fairly interesting\r\nWeaknesses: instructors often assume more knowledge from students than they have\r\nCould be improved: dumb down the language/notation in the handouts so that us non math majors can keep up - having a guide to what all of the notation means would honestly have helped a ton.",
                "Prof. Shin is wonderful and teaches clearly and in a fun way. The handouts are super helpful and (imo) the core of the course, but her lectures clarify the more formal, rigorous material on the handouts in a really helpful way. The PSets are also super helpful for developing and understanding of the material.",
                "This course is phenomenally taught, across the board (see below for appraisals of the teaching staff.) The content is almost always riveting and absorbing, and only sometimes feels contrived (usually as a setup to a further discussion, e.g. Henkin sentences), and the hard parts are always motivated or explained with examples (e.g. Sun Joo's three parables as to why the compactness theorem for sentential logic is not intuitive). Additionally, Sun Joo will explicitly tell you that the policy of not uploading the lecture notes is for a reason she keeps to herself. It's not as if she doesn't give people who have missed a class a copy of the notes for said class, so I'm not really sure why this policy is in place. (If it's because she doesn't want the lecture notes to be disseminated - many people scan the notes so they'll have them online in any event.) A way in which the course could be improved is for the TA to offer sessions in how to use LaTeX, which saves a ton of time when typing up solutions, since for many people (including myself, as a philosophy major) this is the first class in which such usage is advisable.",
                "Sun-Joo is super nice and iconic and the course is structured in a very chill way. Sometimes lectures felt a little confusing.",
                "strengths - the TA is awesome, notes are direct\r\nweaknesses - super tough to follow the lectures often",
                "I like how the psets are our only grades because you can really focus on the concepts and take your time. I did not really like the lecture style as much and wish it was more engaging, but the lecture notes are very helpful",
                "P-sets graded unbelievably harsh and its very difficult to get help on them during office hours. The material was actually very dense and many times no one would answer questions directly. Of course I dont expect profs or TFs to just give out answers but refusal to even point you in the right direction just feels uncalled for.",
                "Strengths: Sun-Joo is a good lecturer and a kind teacher. Weaknesses: kinda on me but I just found the course content much less interesting than I thought I would",
                "The content is fascinating and the pset structure is great. The lecture notes Prof Shin hands out are extremely helpful. Only regret I have is not taking better advantage of office hours.",
                "I wish we had access to the lecture notes digitally. Having them only in printed form was incredibly difficult and hard accessibility wise",
                "Deadlines could be better predicted, but luckily TFs were understanding/",

                "Towards the end of the course I felt like the material could have been explained more in depth.",
                "The courses incredibly rigorous and demanding nature is both its biggest strength and greatest weakness. This course requires students to spend significant time reviewing class notes and developing proofs for problem sets, but that time is exactly what helps students become stronger logicians and mathematicians.",
                "- Strengths: clear problem sets, motivation and instruction.\r\n- Weakness: board work is a bit hard to follow.",
                "The textbooks is terrible.",
                "The teaching staff was excellent. Professor Shin is engaging, funny, and really passionate about what she teaches. I enjoyed her humorous life lessons interspersed throughout her lectures. I liked that this class was fully pset based as well; the psets force you to understand the material before going further on, which is a blessing and a curse, since this class moves pretty quickly. There were plenty of office hours though, and Rachel was super helpful in them.",
                "Strengths  clear lecture sheets, Rachel was amazing, office hours, good distribution of work load \r\nWeaknesses  lectures didnt make a whole lot of sense (they were fun but didnt help me more than the lecture notes)"

This is not the kind of course to take if you're just looking to fulfill a QR requirement.",

                "Yesabsolutely! The proofs are moderately challenging but doable and a lot of fun. You end up proving a lot of cool theorems (I.e. Gdels completeness theorem, the compactness theorem, etc) and you will develop a great understanding of the meta-theory behind first-order logic. Highly recommend!",

It isn't that conceptually taxing if you are mathematically inclined, and even if you're not, there is a lot of support available for you to familiarize yourself with constructing proofs.",

                "This was my first logic course and overall I really enjoyed it. If you're someone who enjoys learning for learning sake and likes logic puzzles, you'll enjoy this course. Note, though, that this feels much more like a math course than a philosophy course. Proofs make up the majority of the homework, I think it's just categorized philosophy because we don't work with numbers much. But if you like the kind of philosophy that deals with valid/sound argumentation (as opposed to more artsy/theoretical philosophy), this class is a fascinating look into what constitutes valid reasoning.",

                "Absolutely! Its fun, super interesting, the material is beautiful, and it entails a nice mental workout.",
                "Please please please do yourself a favor and take this course, especially if you have no experience with formal proofs. It will open your mind to a whole new world of mathematics, logic, and philosophy, enable you to finally understand Plantinga (well, at least the non-modal stuff), set you on a path to understanding the incompleteness theorems, and provide you with some of the most elegant results the human mind has ever dared to dream of from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Also, Sun Joo is the GOAT and her presence alone is enough to justify taking the course.",
                "Chill class and interesting new branch of math that I was happy to get exposed to. However, I feel like the chill structure and confusing lectures meant that I didnt really engage with trying to understand the content or build intuition beyond replicating the notes on the psets.",
                "Yes, because it teaches valuable logical thinking skills",
                "No. Unless you are really interested in the content theres just no real reason.",
