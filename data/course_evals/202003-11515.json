I feel like I have the tools to understand most 19th century classical\/Romantic music, and I have really enjoyed getting to know more of the repertoire of this period, especially Schubert, Brahms, and Wagner. I learned a lot about ways to analyze music outside of Roman numeral analysis, and I got a lot better at writing music analysis papers and making music analysis presentations. The primary topics covered included chromatic motifs, harmonic dualism, and the Tonnetz (transformational theory). If you take the course, you will be blown away by how much you learn. I haven't looked at a piece of music the same since.",

Deeper observations for harmonies, harmonic progressions, chromatic passages, key relations, structures, and text-paintings gave me a lot of insights for each piece we studied in the class.  His class and teaching encouraged us to see the details \"precisely\" and that helps to understand each music better. Also, I personally learned teaching techniques from him- how to encourage students and how to grow them.",

                "Professor Cohn did an excellent job teaching a varied array of topics in 19th century music theory. All of the teaching methods are very effective. My only criticism is that we covered a pretty limited range of composers, which is inherent in the nature of the course, but the title of the class might have been better as \"Music Theory of Schubert, Wagner, and Brahms.\"",
                "The strengths were the ability to discuss things together in a small group, and get immediate feedback on the way we think through issues. The weakness is that there was quite a variety of levels of comfort with analysis within the class, which at times made work together difficult.",

                "It's a very good course. I felt like everything had a place in the curriculum, and that everything belonged in its sequential order."

                "I would 100% recommend this course, especially if you're serious about music theory or composition. This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale with one of the best professors I've studied with so far. Professor Cohn is very modest, but he is one of the most influential music theorists alive today, and he has practically invented most of the theory that you will learn about. You will learn so much about music theory that you won't be able to believe that you tried to analyze music before taking the class. For me as a composer, the course has given me an incredibly valuable toolset of new techniques to use when thinking about harmonies, and my compositions have immediately reflected these influences. The workload of the class can be fairly high when the papers come around (be prepared to write five papers, with many graphs), but I think that it's worth it. If you pay attention in class and spend a decent amount of time analyzing the piece, the papers will write themselves in no time. Especially if you're interesting music theory as a potential career, learning how to properly write analysis papers and make analysis presentations is super valuable; making graphs is tedious but also pretty enjoyable if you're into that kind of thing.",
                "Yes! You learn a lot about the structure of a lot of music from a very interesting professor. Totally worth it.",
                "Yes. We learned a lot of things from this class. It is not just an informative lecture\/class, but we had opportunities to think, share, study, and learn with the class\/group together.",
                "Yes -- it's a relatively harmless way to get one's advanced theory requirement. I'm perhaps the wrong person to ask, since I'm not particularly enthusiastic about the Romantic period (not a whole lot by way of early music theories in this department), but overall I felt like I learned a lot."
