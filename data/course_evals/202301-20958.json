                "This semester, I feel I learned the most about organic chemistry as a subject. By learning many of the Nobel prize winning chemistry and the basics behind them, I really felt the connection of what I was learning and how it impacts my every day life, and it definitely made the class very enjoyable.",
                "I learned about the organic chemistry basis of the catalysis of many of the everyday medicines that we use on a day to day basis. I also got a much more in depth understanding of all the basic reactions that govern catalysis.",

Specifically with Professor Miller, we got a really good vantage point to see the history of chemistry. He likes to talk about the people who made these contributions, often with anecdotes because he personally knows them. This element is really special and made this my favorite course of the semester.",

It's very satisfying to be able to look at a reaction that is unfamiliar and then be able to explain why it might happen in the way it does.",
                "A lot of knowledge about different organic reactions, and some organometallic reactions.",
                "I learned a lot of different reactions involving aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, carbonyls, epoxides, alkynes, and more. Scott has funny stories which keep the class entertaining. I also learned various retrosynthetic strategies which I can apply to my research and scientific career going forward.",

The emphasis wasn't on just memorizing reactions - rather, this course challenged the student to integrate them into broader patterns for use in weaving the tapestry of molecules, compounds, and life.",

                "Strength: it covers a lot of material.\r\nWeakness: it covers a LOT of material.",
                "Strengths: Incredibly well-taught. Interesting exams. Fantastic TAs. Great connections to chemical research, current and historical.\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, none",
                "Strengths: Prof. Miller is incredibly passionate about teaching this class and is a very engaging lecture. He explains concepts well and shows you how they are applied in research and literature. The class is tough, but you get a lot out of it.\r\nWeaknesses: Grading is unclear, as Prof. Miller won't announce the curve until the end of the course. Exams were very difficult and sometimes were very loosely related to what was covered in class.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Miller is an engaging and fun lecturer who makes attending a 9:00 AM lecture worth the trip up Science Hill. The psets were all graded essentially for completion, which was a nice low-stress way to practice that week's concepts. It's a pretty low-workload course outside of the midterms and final, which you will probably have to study extensively for in order to do well. We had practice exams before each midterm that were a good way to feel out how Prof. Miller was going to assess us. Prof. Miller uploads his lecture notes on Canvas the morning of each lecture, which is really handy to have open during the lecture (and for studying after). Whether you like organic chemistry or not, this course will undoubtedly help you to appreciate a lot of the cool stuff that modern organic chemists are doing, and how a lot of it is based on the fundamentals learned in undergraduate-level organic chemistry.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's really hard to know what Prof. Miller is going to test you on. There's so much content and only so much testing time. Unless you study literally everything, it's entirely possible that you'll miss something that's on the test. Prof. Miller also includes unique problems that you probably wouldn't find in most other orgo 2 courses, which are usually extremely difficult and force you to stretch your understanding of the fundamental concepts a little. This can be a plus if that's what you're looking for.",
                "It was taught very well so that understanding key concepts and patterns help facilitate student learning rather than straight memorization.",
                "The course assumes a much steeper learning curve than CHEM 174. The disparity in the course formats makes the transition difficult to adapt to and CHEM 175 is a lot more stressful, unnecessarily so, than its fall counterpart, mostly because it assumes a greater mastery of the content and makes larger leaps and bounds in the spring syllabus than anticipated.",
                "I liked the content of the course, as well as the way it was taught. Although it was fast paced, you get what you put into the class in terms of effort.",
                "It is a difficult class",
                "Strengths: organization \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: book readings are very long and not all of it is always relevant",
                "I think that there could have been more rigorous practice - I for one did enjoy challenges during the exam, however some problems were often just unprecedented in that we'd never seen anything like it before. Overall though, I enjoy the lectures.",
                "The exams were very hard and sometimes I felt like I didnt see them in my notes or the textbook.",
                "I loved the way the psets were structured and how available the TAs were to answering questions and meeting. I also loved the real life applications for each concept.",
                "Miller is an amazing Professor and lecturer. And the TAs are amazing. While it is a difficult class, it will teach you to just keep swimming. Just keep working at it and you will begin to understand organocatalysis.",
                "The course went into a lot of specifics during lecture, which made it very difficult to discern what the actual important material was. The main thing that saved this course were the discussion sections run by the TA's (who were amazing) and the review material given before exams, both of which clarified what we actually needed to know.",
                "The psets should be more reflective of the test material",
                "Professor Miller is an incredible lecturer, genuinely interested in the content and earnest to share his enthusiasm with his students. He makes the content seem effortless, which makes the challenge of the course worthwhile. Strengths: teaching, Miller's office hours, the TAs are godly (for office hours, study halls, and discussion sections), the peer tutors are so helpful, the structure is very consistent and reliable. The content is stressful but the class is chill. Weaknesses: 9 am on science hill may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it becomes an iconic part of the package.",
                "The course exams were difficult and the class makeup is skewed towards high achieving students but Scott is a great lecturer and really prioritizes knowledge and learning.",
                "Strengths: good pace, a great professor, challenging but fair exams.\r\nWeaknesses: slightly disorganized",
                "seemed to deviate a bit from normal orgo 2 topics but the content was rigorous and challenging. fantastic teaching assistants, and Miller is a decent prof although his exams are hard.",
                "The lectures could have focused more on patterns and problem solving methods, which is how we were tested.",
                "The course was well structured and accompanied by a textbook and regular problem sets to help students check their understanding. Problem sets included 4-5 required problems as well as an additional 20 optional problems that could be used as additional study help, so I felt that this course was very flexible for learners.\r\nThe sheer amount of material we had to learn was challenging, and could be overwhelming at times.",
                "The exams were a bit too difficult in my opinion",
                "Good",
                "Professor Miller did a great job of structuring the course and I believe that the pacing of the course and topics were all well done.",
                "A more clear overview of topics before each is introduced would make the continuity of the course better.",
                "This course is interesting, especially if you liked CHEM 174. Simply put, it's a lot of reaction mechanisms, which can be cool. However, you rarely learn the patterns that guide the mechanisms, making it needlessly hard.",
                "Strengths - Prof Miller gives you suggested textbook problems which help in test preparation. For each exam, he gives a practice exam to gauge your knowledge. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - exams are very conceptually challenging and felt a bit unreasonable at times. There were a lot of \"I know we haven't specifically covered this yet, BUT why do you think this happens?\" questions. I felt as if no matter how much I prepared, I would not do as well as I would have liked to.",
                "The class was well organized and Prof. Miller is a very engaging instructor. It would be nice if there were recordings available to be able to easily make up for missed lectures. I also wished we could do more of the off-the-textbook stuff like learning from cool papers that are relevant to the reactions we are learning in class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Miller is a good lecturer and really embraces your interest in the course material. He is very passionate about what he teaches. The TFs were wonderful and always willing to help out. We were able to drop one midterm. Weaknesses:  We didn't really know our grade until the very end of the semester which became quite stressful at times. Also, the exams were truly some of the most difficult exams I have taken at Yale.",
                "The tests were very difficult but very informative",
                "I thought the TAs did a wonderful job of helping the students. They were always willing to answer questions with emails and were very accessible to students.\r\n\r\nThis might be just for me, but I found the hard testing to be a little demoralizing and sometimes I felt like there was too much content that I couldnt cover.",
                "For the most part, Organic Chemistry II allows for much more creativity in synthetic techniques; as the students' vocabulary of possible reactions develops further, so does their ability to string together complicated synthetic pathways. I had a lot more fun this semester taking on the PSETs and tests because of this.\r\n\r\nI feel like delaying carbonyl chemistry until the end of the semester did it disservice, however. We ran out of time to fully explore the scope of these integral reactions, and with it some of the connections to key advances in the field were rushed (only briefly mentioned amino acids, didn't cover amine syntheses at all, etc.)",
                "The course was thorough and well run overall! The content was challenging but presented in an engaging manner.",
                "Strengths: taught really well, a lot of support given (through office hours, teaching assistants, etc), challenging but fair exams\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could be a bit disorganized/jump around a lot at times, went a bit fast at times, it's a difficult class, so know what you're getting into!"

Scott Miller is a fantastic professor who actually makes me want to take other organic chemistry courses, even though they are not required for me. Being in such a small class in this first-year version is fantastic in that I get to meet and know people with academic interests similar to mine. Taking a full-year course like this has really brought us all closer together in an amazing way.",
                "Yes, absolutely. If you have a chance to take this course as a first year student you should.",
                "It's required for most students who are taking it. Regardless, I would recommend it because Miller is an incredibly prof who is clearly very passionate about what he does. The TAs are also great. Just know that you will have to put in a lot of time to study for the exams.",
                "Yes. It's awesome. Professor Miller is awesome. It's a low-workload course outside of tests, so you can dedicate most of your time in this course to studying the material how you like. If you are a first-year who needs to take organic chemistry anyways, I think that CHEM 175 with Professor Miller is a way better move than taking CHEM 220/221.",
                "I loved this course so I would recommend it. I love chemistry in general so I loved everything in the class.",

While this class is difficult, it will teach you the necessary skills to succeed in harder courses that you will take later on. Also Miller is great lecturer that will make organic chemistry interesting (and not just bland mechanisms). He relates each lecture to some Nobel prize research and gives examples of when each reaction is used in medicinal chemistry.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who have an interest in organic chemistry. This class is not super easy and you have to be willing to attend office hours and review sessions to do well on the exams.",
                "100%. The people (TAs and prof and classmates) made this one of the best parts of my first year at Yale. I had no idea that I had any interest in chemistry before taking this class and it has inspired me to pursue higher level courses in chemistry that relate to my primary interest in bio. It is so well supported and there is nothing like the camaraderie that emerged from this tight-knit class. I also found my best friends here!",
                "I would if you are premed or need this course otherwise but it is a lot of work for an exploratory course.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in organic chemistry! It is very well-taught and made to be exciting. However, the exams are quite difficult so you need to really make sure you have a strong grasp of the material.",

                "If required or very interested in the material",
                "Yes, second semester organic chemistry gives you the knowledge to identify how many modern medicines function, and it would be valuable for pre-med students, students studying chemistry or related science, and any student that would like to understand the basics of medicine synthesis.",

                "Yes it was fun",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. I appreciate there being a separate course for first-year students studying orgo because I felt very close to the other students in the class and appreciated the smaller lecture.",
                "Only to chem majors",
                "If you are interested at all, do take it. First-Year Organic Chemistry is not a chance to miss.",
                "Yes, probably. I think that this is a very interesting course, where you learn a lot of chemistry that's very relavent and modern. However, it's biggest pitfall is that the tests are WAY too hard, and you are never told what the curve will be. This creates a lot of unnecessary stress. If you're prepared for that, and okay with never knowing your grade, then I would definitely recommend this class.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who is premed and/or an MB&B major. Apart from that, I probably would not recommend because there are way easier science classes than this.",
                "Definitely, I think the class was very well taught and I feel much more comfortable doing organic problems. I also really liked how we saw what we're learning be applied to modern work, like atropisomerism in a cancer drug.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student but I would say that coming into this class you must have a strong grasp on the material covered in first semester orgo and must be willing to dedicate time to reading the textbook, working through practice problems, and understanding concepts.  The exams are difficult, and if your class consists of many chemistry majors as mine did, it will often feel like you are behind. However, I learned a lot from this class as someone who really does enjoy organic chemistry.",
                "Yes, it was very informative for my knowledge of chemistry",
                "I feel like this course is rite of passage for most students going into med school or chemistry, but unlike my first semester of organic chemistry, this semester is much harder. This could have been due to the combination of teachers we had (Herzon who made his class a little easier and then Miller whos exams are very difficult) or it could have just been",
                "I'm very biased toward recommending organic chemistry to other students because I love it so much, but I think it's particularly enjoyable for students who enjoy the more qualitative, creative side of science like me. Sometimes when we focus too much on raw computation, the elegance and interconnectedness of a field can get obscured.",
                "I would, as organic chemistry is an important and interesting subject and CHEM 175 is a great way to learn more about the topic.",
                "Yes, I thought it was super interesting and really enjoyed having taken it, also taught really well, however need a strong foundation in CHEM 174 and it is a lot of time to review notes/practice/etc so make sure you have the time to give it"
