                "Jim and Paul are both incredible instructors. They set up great discussions and are incredibly generous with their time, even in a global pandemic. However, the capstone was less enjoyable than other interactions we've had with Jim and Paul (including weekly discussions for a year of the MAPHR cohort experience) in large part because no one put their foot down when certain students attempted to derail the conversation. A few students would consistently show disrespect for their classmates while these classmates were speaking by spamming the Zoom chat with entirely different topics. This dynamic, which was emboldened each week that no professor said anything about it, contributed to derailing conversations and divesting me from the work. The course is still great. I enjoyed my time in it and anyone who has the opportunity to complete the MAPHR sequence should do it. However, changing this dynamic could improve future years.",
                "I loved how we studied different critiques of Human Rights for the first half of the course. The conversations we had in this first half of the course gave us a foundation on which to understand, appreciate, and workshop other peoples capstone projects in the second half of the course.",
                "I really enjoyed the last readings, but they also did feel a little repetitive as a summary of some of the things that we had already discussed and learned about in HMRT 100. Obviously the class needed it to be classified as a credit, but I think this would overall be more productive and people would be more engaged in discussion with some different or more specific topics."
