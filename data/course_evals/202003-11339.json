                "Strengths: course content was very interesting; Weaknesses: none, really",
                "The class appeared to be oddly paced. While it started out excessively slow, the class picked up very fast at the end. This made the tail end of the class much more difficult than anticipated, and could easily have been mitigated by pacing the class more evenly.",
                "ECON 251 is one of my favorite classes this semester. The course is well-structured and well-taught. Prof Eduardo really explains every idea in a clear way. He also used anonymous forms to receive feedback from students and made adjustment in teaching accordingly.",
                "Pace is pretty fast, the homework is more plug and chug and doesn't do a great job of reinforcing an understanding of concepts.",
                "Professor Davila is probably one of the best econ professors I've had. He is really receptive to feedback and puts a lot of work into making sure that he is making the classes accessible.",
                "I enjoyed how the lectures were recorded so that I could go back and re-watch confusing materials. Professor Davila also provides a lot of practice questions that are really helpful to learn the material.",
                "The course felt very dense. If the list of topics were shortened and gone through in more depth it would be a more favorable, less stress-inducing experience. It was easy to fall behind and constantly feel like one was playing catch-up.",
                "Professor Davila is really good at explaining complicated concepts and really cares about his students. The lectures in this class were informative, but also very dense. Especially during the second half of the course, it was very easy to get behind because of the amount of material being covered, and often required multiple rewatchings to fully grasp the material. I also thought the essay portion of the course, while letting me and my peers do some research on an interesting phenomena in the financial world, seemed really random and ultimately inconvenient at a time when classes were coming to an end. The problem sets were well timed and well crafted to test knowledge of the course.",
                "There were a lot of practice problems available for completion in preparation for the exams. The problem sets felt relevant to the course material. However, I felt that the course moved too quickly and tried to cram too much material into a finite number of lectures. Oftentimes, I felt like I had to teach myself the concepts covered through completing the homework and studying for the exams. Also, we were only allowed to attend our TA's office hours (i.e. not allowed to go to other TA's office hours, even if they work better for your schedule), so if your TA had office hours at a time that didn't work for you, it was just a \"too bad\" kind of scenario. There were not many accommodations in place for pandemic-related learning difficulties.",
                "The course gets very difficult at points and it is clear that the class often did not understand what was going on the first time around. The problem sets weren't too burdensome and provided good practice. The midterm and final were difficult and required deep conceptual understanding of the topics, often beyond what was covered explicitly in class.",
                "Strengths: Covers a wide range of topics and gives a great foundation for finance \r\nWeaknesses: A bit too challenging at times",
                "Great course, very structured, a lot of good material, no weakness really",
                "The course is way too theoretical. I do not want to get a phd in financial economics, so a lot of the stuff seems pretty useless. Some of the biggest models we learn are concluded with one line at the end of one slide at the end of the lecture saying that the model fails. It seemed as if the course was set up to try and get you ready to go into phd level financial economics - as opposed to a really solid understanding of the applicable part of financial economics.",
                "This course is really fast, so you must take caution but overall, if you've had prior finance experience, or dabbled into stocks and the market, then this class should be fine. The professor is really passionate about the topic and the office hours really help you understand the content.",
                "Strength: Davila is a really fair professor and tries to explain everything clearly. If you don't get it, he'll go over it again. Also, the slides are very clear and helpful. In particular, the questions on the exam are pretty fair and are relevant to what's taught in class. The two guest lecturers were really interesting!\r\nWeakness: some of the harder concepts are pretty difficult to grasp, even with the slides and extra explanations (particularly the SDF section).",
                "Professor Davila is very devoted to teaching the course.",
                "The course material covers a lot of ground and it is generally interesting if you are interested in finance\/economics; the professor is very knowledgable and tries to listen as much as he can to the feedback that people give him in class. The weakness is that there is not much support for people who don't understand\/need more help. The most the professor interacts with his students in class is with a poll to see if people understand the concept or not, but if the majority of the class doesn't understand the concept, he doesn't do much more explaining before moving on anyways. Also, you are only allowed to attend your TA's office hours, which really restricts the amount of OH you can attend, which is especially inconvenient if you have an OH after or way before the homework is due.",
                "Interesting material, but quite rushed.",
                "It's a lot of material, which is a strength and a weakness.  I think it's difficult to synthesize all of it at the end of the course, but Professor Davila does a good job at compressing everything into one class.",
                "Well taught and planned but professor was in a hurry to cover much of the content--too much going on",
                "The professor provides tons of practice problems for the midterm and final, with explanations for (almost) each question. It really allows you to practice what will be on the test.\r\n\r\nI felt the grading tended to be unnecessarily harsh, however. With a large amount of points off for trivial math errors.",
                "Only strengths",
                "Too much material",
                "Strengths: Very Well Organized\r\nWeakness: I think the court might have been a tad too theoretical.",
                "It was very structured in the different modules which I appreciated",
                "The strengths are having a bunch of practice questions that are close to the ones on the tests so you can primarily study by doing these practice problems",
                "The course was very well taught. Professor Davila puts in a lot of work to make everything crystal clear, and I rarely felt like I completely did not understand something. I also thought the workload was well-balanced and adapted to good learning. In terms of weaknesses, I would have liked more feedback on my psets\/written assignment. I understand it is hard to give precise feedback to hundreds of students, but this would have been very useful.",
                "The lectures were well-structured and the material was well-organized. Resources were plentiful. The course could be improved by providing more guidance for the writing assignment, a research paper intended to be completed over several weeks for which little direction was provided.",
                "it was very very well taught. The sections could have been more engaging or in a different style.",
                "Strengths - Davila is very organized and a solid lecturer, material is interesting\r\nWeaknesses - too fast paced at times, psets are not as challenging as the tests (really should be the other way around in my opinion)",
                "Strength: The course material is interesting and the Professor Eduardo is very approachable.  Furthermore, we've covered a lot of material in this course over a short period of time.",
                "Strengths: You cover a lot of important information about the fundamentals that would be useful if you are considering going into finance. Really useful subject matter to be aware of in general even if you may not want to go into finance as a career. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is A LOT of information covered in this course and it can feel quite overwhelming at times if the subject matter is brand new. Because there is SO much to cover, the professor has to speed through things at time which can be tough. I really had to rely on the peer tutors to clarify topics covered in class because it was tough to get a full understanding about things given how fast things were covered.",
                "strengths: TA sections were helpful in helping me understand difficult concepts\r\nweaknesses: the professor was difficult to understand and follow along with sometimes, the course structure was disorganized at times",
                "This course could be improved by spacing out the work load at the end of term--in the last week of class we had a problem set, a substantial paper, and two online lectures to watch, in addition to in-person sessions, followed by an exam. If we could spread this out a little more, in might help students submit higher quality work.",
                "Strengths: Professor Davila puts in a lot of effort into his lectures and he is genuinely invested in his students' learning. The psets are fair and the exams are fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N\/A",
                "Strengths: Prof Davila is a fantastic lecturer -- his lectures are very clear and comprehensive, and the topics he cover are interesting. The psets and exams are reasonable; there is a large set of practice questions to help prepare for exams, which has been helpful. The TF team is very responsive and discussion sections truly enhanced the lectures. Also, Prof Davila frequently sends out interesting news articles related to the topics we learned; these articles really helped to tie everything together. Overall, just an amazing class! Weaknesses: none",
                "Keep it the way it is; I enjoyed it.",
                "The concepts seen are very relevant to the world of finance but in my opinion, it is a lot of content to be tested on in a final.",
                "So much content was covered, it would be good to have a slower pace and review more.",
                "Strengths: well-structured, lots of accessible practice materials (both conceptual & numerical practice q's with solutions), straightforward problem sets, and reasonable exams (challenging, but entirely within the bounds of what we had covered in the course). Professor very welcoming to feedback and students' suggestions. Extra materials provided for those interested in exploring specific topics further. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: psets were very short (in comparison to other intermediate level econ classes), so exams seemed to catch some people by surprise. The class as a whole may have been helped by the additional accountability of longer psets (maybe 10 questions instead of 5). Personally I did not find this to be an issue though, as I did concept questions each week along with the psets, which felt sufficient to keep up with the material.",
                "Strengths- great professor, interesting content, very organized.\r\nWeaknesses- Way too much material for an introductory finance course.",
                "The only strength to me was the class organization -- psets were quickly graded and expectations were clear. In addition, ample practice material was provided. The class had a few major weaknesses. For one, I found the syllabus to be too theoretical for my liking (and thus I feel I gained fewer applicable skills than I would have liked). Since this class replaced Intro to Corporate Finance, many of the subjects in that course were glossed over or left unmentioned (and this is what would have actually helped me in life as an investor and in my career path). Further, the course at several points attempted to cover dense theoretical math such that only those who studied linear (like myself) knew what was going on. Few of these subjects were ever tested. This was not helped by Professor Davila who sometimes struggled to explain some of the more complex topics to students. Although Professor Davila clearly cares and has a love for finance, I didn't find him to be a very concise or clear instructor at parts. This course could generally be improved by covering more financial accounting and drawing more specific connections to real market happenings (beyond just sending articles in Slack which I appreciated). Professor Davila also included a few pset questions in Python and requested students use LyX or LaTeX for their papers, neither of which I had any working experience with (and I didn't know this coming in). Projects in excel were more effective. In general this class seemed to be directed towards those aspiring for an economics\/finance PhD, which at this point I don't see myself doing. We also did not complete the full material and had to watch additional asynchronous videos on some of the more difficult topics (Black-Scholes, etc.), which was a weakness (although we had understandably a lot of material to cover in little time).",
                "I believe this course is definitely catered towards people who have had some previous exposure to financial economics beforehand. I eventually stopped going to the live lecture because the professor would go too fast and things would just fly over my head. The homework is not representative at all of what the exam will look like because they are too easy in comparison. There is also so much material that it felt like it was up to luck if I remembered what came on the test, since a lot of the material is memorization. A lot of the homework also required knowing coding and R, which I did not and made my life so much harder. Taking an R class beforehand should be a prerequisite and not just a recommendation.",
                "Very good class with responsible exams and strong professors.",
                "great course content, however, the writing assignment is somewhat questionable",
                "The strengths of the course include interesting material, as well as the fact that once you learn the concepts you can see their application right away in media such as the Wall Street Journal. The material is also covered thoroughly both in lecture and in section.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the course is the quick pace of it. Although, the material is still covered well, it would be more difficult to follow the lectures if they were not recorded.",
                "Strengths: There were a TON of practice problems we could do, and I thought the exams, which were based on those practice questions, were very fair. Professor was also really nice and reasonable person.\r\nWeaknesses: Not much, perhaps besides the one or two homework assignments where we had to do some coding, which I wasn't the most comfortable doing.",
                "Very well taught! Concepts were supported by clear graphs and interactive examples, and the professor used polls to check student understanding, adjusting pace accordingly. The problem sets and exams are all very fair, and the P\/F final project is a great idea. One weakness was that office hours were not super flexible --  you could only attend the office hour of your TF and the CBPTs.",
                "Strengths: Depending on your personal preferences, you may find the topic mater this class in and of itself to be a strength. Anyone can download Robinhood on their phone, link their bank account, and invest\/lose boatloads of money in a matter of minutes. This course helps you to understand the \"why\" behind the mechanisms at play in this simple phenomenon, teaching students about dynamics such as risk vs expected return: pricing an asset based on risk, volatility, and covariance; and why there is \"no free lunch\" in investing. Another strength of this course is the abundance of practice problems to use when studying for exams and the organization of the course \"blocks\". \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I find that this course primarily suffers from a lack of truly engaging lessons. Many of the would-be \"wow\" moments in lectures were simply brushed over as we found out that a computer is needed to actually utilize that great financial mechanism. Additionally, the course covers a lot of content and uses a lot of equations which include a lot of symbols which stand for a lot of different abbreviations. These equations, symbols, and abbreviations are, of course, like second nature to professor Davila, however they are not super intuitive and made me spend a lot of time deciphering the lectures before really understanding what was happening. Overall, I felt like I needed to attend lectures in order to keep up with the definitions of the latest symbols\/equations introduced rather than attending to understand some really interesting aspect of finance.",
                "Strengths are the teaching and the resources",
                "The professor was clearly very knowledgable and passionate about teaching this course, but I felt he covered more breadth than depth than I wouldve liked. Many of the topics were glossed over and when asked about the reason\/theory behind certain concepts\/equation, he would either just refer us to the derivation worksheet he had uploaded on Canvas or say that he didnt have time to explain it. \r\n\r\nWhile he did upload all of his slides with about 9-10 modules (we covered 9 and didnt have time for Futures), I felt that it wouldve been more useful to choose a select few and focus more on those.\r\n\r\nLastly, the exams were not necessarily difficult but they were a major time-crunch. Im not sure if I didnt allocate my time efficiently but I definitely had to rush the last 10 questions for both my midterm AND final. It was a test of knowing which equations to use rather than a test of your comprehension on the subject. Admittedly, however, this is an issue with many mathematics courses here at Yale.",
                "I found the syllabus to be a bit misleading, stating along the lines that the course could be completed successfully without referencing any textbooks. However, I found that the lectures and lecture notes were not satisfactory in explaining the large breadth of concepts covered in the course. Many times the professor went over incredibly complicated concepts quickly without diving into them deeply, which may be a consequence from the amount of material that needed to be covered in such a short time period.",
                "Prof Davila is extremely engaged and managed to fit an incredible amount of content into this semester without it ever feeling like we were over burdened.",
                "Very well put together, Professor Davila is very skilled at explaining concepts in a way that makes them easy to understand.",
                "I thought the course was well-organized for students to be able to learn remotely and virtually. It was structured well",
                "It is difficult to find an introductory finance course, so it was very nice that the course introduces the students to all of the essential finance terms and concepts without assuming that they have any previous knowledge of them. The course is trying to cover a lot of material, and I think it did a good job of giving a good foundation of knowledge. One improvement that could be made is to allow students to visit office hours of any TA (which seems to be how it is in most similar Economics courses).",
                "The course is well organized, and delivers a crash course of necessary language and basic skills for anyone interested in going into finance.",
                "Eduardo Davila is simply excellent. I can't think of a weakness about this course. Strenghts: Lots and lots of practice questions, lots of support and feedback, lots of opportunities to do well. Very good course and this is coming from someone who got a B+ in the course.",
                "Strengths: very relevant subject matter.  Problem sets and the writing assignments were fair.  Lectures were recorded so you could watch them again later.  Cool guest speakers.  Professor is nice\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes we didn't get back problem set grades quick enough.  Midterm was pretty hard.",
                "Too many words and information on the slides. The practice problems dont follow the style of exam questions, especially the conceptual questions."

                "The recorded lectures were very helpful",
                "Professor Davila was a great professor despite covid. He was engaging and earnest in his desire for us to understand the topics discussed. This in my opinion was a major strength of the course during the pandemic. One problem we experienced was that the pset feedback system was generally inefficient and unhelpful. While solutions were posted, the TF staff seemed unable to figure out how to provide clearer feedback for the first few weeks of the course.",
                "I think the class is great with use of chat boxes for questions. The instructor is able to respond to questions the students have and make the idea clearer.",

                "The class recordings were extremely helpful when it came to studying.",
                "The recorded lectures were very helpful, as students could rewatch the lectures when reviewing for tests or doing the problem sets. The office hour schedule was really confusing, as students could only attend the office hours of their assigned TF, which limited the office hours and wasn't really explained until after sections were assigned.",
                "There were opportunities for engagement during lecture in the form of answering questions. Additionally, Professor Davila often used Zoom polls to gauge how comfortable the class was with the presented material before moving forward. I thought that the extra recorded lectures to watch outside of class time was a bit much, though.",
                "Live classes were nice, but it was difficult to stay focused sometimes since just reading off the slides",
                "great zoom and canvas practices",
                "fine",
                "This class does a good job of virtual learning. The professor is always wiling to stop to answer any questions and slow down on material when asked to.",
                "Live weekly sections help.",
                "The testing actually went relatively successfully, and I liked the way these exams were proctored. In comparison to other classes, I would say that this class had the best testing proctoring\/process. One improvement could definitely be the sections. This might be on a TA-to-TA basis, because I think that the TAs write their own materials, but most of the section is going over written materials. There is little to no engagement, and so most people just turn off their cameras and don't pay attention. Cold-calling isn't really effective either, so it would be nice if there was a better way to learn the material more on section. Also, the professor kept putting extra videos outside of class time for us to watch (it was necessary for the videos at the end of the course, but sometimes he would just go over 10ish minutes and then upload the rest of the lecture on video through Canvas). I don't think most people watched these videos, and to me, it was difficult to get back into the lecture for only 10 minutes. I think it would be much better to start the next class with that material and keep everything contained within class time. It might even be better if the instructor just kept going late instead of making a whole new video.",

The peer tutor office hours were extremely helpful and there were enough times offered during the week to get help. It would have been nice to have at least one section a week recorded.",
                "recorded lectures and virtual office hours were very helpful",
                "Not necessarily specific to this class, but for all my classes which attempted to use recorded lectures, I like to give a caveat; many of my friends agreed that online lectures (especially lectures which what the professor couldn't finish in class) add much more time than just the duration of the lecture. This happens because professors can talk at a high rate without checking in with the students, going back to explain difficult concepts, or even make sure that everyone has written down what they've said. Consequently, students usually take at least double the duration of a recorded lecture to actually get to the material--plus, in a normal semester, it's not work that we would ever be expected to do. Not that it's unacceptable to students, it's just that the work really started to pile up when all of our classes assigned 15-30 extra minutes of recorded lecture.",

Engagement dropped significantly throughout the term leaving (I believe) no more than 25% of students in lecture on any given TTh. Online pset submission and grading was incredibly organized. Only thing I would change, is try to limit the total number of additional asynchronous lectures -- these led me to fall behind, especially as they covered more dense material (it might be better to condense course info as some seemed rushed or even simply go a few minutes over after lecture to finish points).",
                "I liked how lectures were recorded because if I was swamped with work it didn't mean I would have to miss them. I did not like how we were only allowed to go to our own TF's office hours. This is not a general practice pre-Covid so I don't think it should be a new practice. It meant I had fewer chances to get my questions answered.",

                "Yes. The material is interesting.",
                "Yes, if they have a keen interest in understanding finance.",
                "Sure--nice fin Econ into but not an easy class",
                "Yes I would recommend this to students before they take any other financial classes as it does a nice overview which will be helpful when taking more specific classes like corporate finance",
                "Of course",
                "I would definitely recommend. But I definitely thought it was challenging if you aren't interested or engaged in the material. We go over so much information each week, it's crazy.",
                "Yes, professor Davila was great",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if you are somewhat interested in getting a general overview to financial economics and want to learn about options, portfolios, and markets in general.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. The course is not easy per se, but definitely not a struggle. Professor Davila is very engaging and explains everything in depth. If you are interested in the topic, definitely take this course.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in careers in finance and would like to receive a broad familiarity with financial terminology, and direction on more specific courses to take in the future.",
                "Yes. Professor Davila was excellent",
                "Yes - if youre interested in a career in finance, particularly quantitative finance\/trading-type jobs or casual investing, this is a great overvieww.",
                "Yes.  I would recommend this class to anyone interested in finance or want to explore what finance exactly entails.",
                "Yes! This is a great Economics elective, especially for students going into Finance.",
                "Yes. The topics and information covered in the course are really useful and will give you a good base understanding of the fundamentals of finance. There is a lot of information covered which can feel overwhelming at times especially if the subject is new to you. It might require taking the time to go to office hours and peer tutoring to make sure you have a good understanding of the topics because of how fast lectures can go but if you take the time out to do that it will be an enriching experience overall.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who want to gain basic financial economics knowledge",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, as long as they are motivated to learn the concepts. I took it because I felt like I should, but fortunately became really interested in the topic and enjoyed the material. A person taking the class (this is for Coursetable shoppers) should be aware of: the exams were fair, but sometimes there were trick questions which you could only catch if you closely read the questions; homework sets were generally 5-question problem sets which were didactic but did not thoroughly cover every important concept.",
                "Yes! This is a great gateway class into the basics of finance. Professor Davila explains things well and the concepts are not too challenging.",
                "Yes, for sure! This is one of the best Econ classes I have taken so far. The material is super interesting, and Prof Davila distills the information in a way that is easy for everyone to understand. Prof Davila genuinely cares about his students mastering the material.",
                "I can only speak for other STEM-inclined students with minimal exposure to finance, but, for someone in this cohort, I would certainly recommend the course. I learned a lot, and it was much more mathematical than I anticipated (which I enjoyed).",
                "Yes, this class is very good at explaining finance concepts for people who don't have any financial background",
                "Not unless you can handle a fast paced lecture style",
                "Professor was great and good at speaking with students.",
                "Yes! Some mathematical self-confidence is necessary for this course, but I think that this course is very accessible to anybody interested in learning the material. I knew nothing about financial economics going into the course, and learned a ton throughout the semester. Seemingly many people take this course because they are interested in working in finance, but not matching that description shouldn't be a deterrent. It certainly wasn't for me, and I hope it won't be for anybody else. I personally found the material in the last few blocks of the course to be the most interesting. Arbitrage is fascinating!",
                "Only if they are really interested in financial economics. It's kind of a difficult course, though.",
                "Yes, especially for the mathematically inclined interested in econ but want to know a little more about the theory that supports basic financial instruments, portfolio management, trading strategies.",
                "If a student aspires to a PhD, this is a great class, both for the theoretical material and speaking with Professor Davila. If some form of Intro to Corporate Finance is offered, however, I'd recommend this in place of this course for those who might want to learn basic financial literacy and are considering a business-related career. I took this class not for my major (simply to learn simple financial concepts), and I'm not sure this course was necessarily well-structured for this.",
                "I honestly wouldn't. This course took a lot out of me and really don't think it's even necessary for going into Finance. If you have prior knowledge as a finance bro, then go for it. Also be aware that the class is mostly guys, as this sometimes made me feel uncomfortable when in lectures and guest lectures, guys dominated the conversation.",
                "Yes. If you want to learn finance, this is the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. If they are interested in learning about finance, this course serves as an excellent introduction.",
                "a must take before any finance internship",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to students who want to learn about finance and its connection to the real world.",
                "Absolutely. You learn so much and you don't need a finance background at all to succeed. Professor was very fair and grading reasonable, you learn a lot, and the material itself is so useful. What more is there to ask for in a course?",
                "I would recommend this course, especially if one has yet to learn the fundamentals of finance. Davila is an excellent professor, and you can tell he really cares about his students' learning experience.",
                "This class is a fun continuation of the sprinklings of financial theory that you may have picked up on from introductory micro and macro. I would not recommend this course if you are looking to become a stellar investor in one course, because you don't really learn about the status of the current stock market or how to invest in it yourself. This class (like a lot of Yale Econ classes) is more academically geared. It gives you the tools you need if you were to make a computer program modeling financial trends or if you were to research market allocation mechanisms. This course also has some frustrating moments. The lectures and slides can be tiring and sometimes boring. The problem sets are simple regurgitating and applying the equations sprinkled across the lecture slides, and the exams are timed and sometimes feel as if they are trying to trick students as much as they are trying to gauge student understanding of the course.",
                "Yes. You should take it if you are an econ major.",
                "Yes, if it was in-person. I personally wouldnt recommend to take it remotely. I also didnt start going to PT hours until after the midterm, but Id highly recommend starting to go once you feel like the material starts to get confusing or overwhelming. They were extremely helpful and explained some concepts better than the professor, in my opinion.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in finance. It is a necessary introduction to any further courses in the finance sequence.",
                "sure if interested in financial econ",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Yes.",
                "This is a very good class, would definitely recommend! Professor is great, clearly loves the course material and is very passionate",
                "Anyone interested in learning about finance should take this class. There aren't too many undergrad finance classes so this one is worthwhile",
                "Yes! It is a great way to learn the essentials of finance without being too overwhelmed. The professor and the TAs are all very patient and helpful.",
                "Anyone interested in finance needs to take this course. It is incredibly useful.",
                "Yes and Yes. Eduardo is an excellent professor. You learn so much in this course. If you want to understand financial markets and securities, this is your course. I got a B+ in this course, so you can trust that I'm not biased. The B+ was for because I messed up on the final (didn't read the instructions). However, this course has lots of practice material and the professor offers so much help. Take the class.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in finance and who has the required prerequisites.  I think it's better to take this class after Shiller's ECON 252 class since that one is less math based and gives you a good foundation for ECON 251 (this class).  This is a great class and the professor is knowledgeable and nice"
