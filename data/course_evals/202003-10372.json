                "This course was an excellent opportunity to develop historical reasoning skills, including primary evidence analysis. Dr. Freeman is also a legendary writer and is super intentional about making time to help improve her students' writing skills, which is lovely. Also a great opportunity to develop insights into the Early National period with a scholar who is both brilliant and also incredibly open-minded and curious.",
                "I learned all about early American politics, from name-brand politicians to politics on the ground, political organizing, and women's role in politics. It was really awesome to learn about themes such as authenticity and the role of honor, as well as learn about present-day political movements such as the scholarly analysis of the Hamilton play!",
                "This course provides the skills and confidence to think like a historian. Each seminar is a lesson in how one may think about issues and break them down. This year, Professor Freeman allowed more space for connecting history to the present which was also very helpful. We all got to see live how a historian breaks down the past and connects it to the present, then we were able to try our hand at it as well.",
                "I learned how to articulate and sustain a historical argument concisely.",
                "We learned about early American politics, some of the debates that the founders had, and which people were included\/excluded in politics. We discussed how this period connected to modern politics as well.",
                "Learned a ton about early American history from numerous perspectives, great readings selected",
                "I learned how the push and pull of early American politics created trends we still see today",
                "As someone who is pretty new to the history of early national America, I was able to delve into the history of this period and gain a broad understanding of its politics (I have genuinely never been able to tell the difference between any of the Founding Fathers until taking this course). Professor Freeman also taught us how to approach primary sources, perform independent research, and to question history (and who writes it\/has the final word) with a critical eye.",
                "Historical research, primary source database research, academic writing, research design, critical analysis of historical sources, deeper understanding of the real people behind the Founding period of the United States and what motivated them."

                "Strengths: Professor Freeman!! If you have an opportunity to take a seminar with her, take a seminar with her. \r\nWeaknesses: Vey few! Readings could be a bit tedious if it's not your area of interest, but it's pretty easy  to know how much you need to do to participate meaningfully in seminar.",
                "Strengths: Professor Freeman for sure. To be taught by such an esteemed historian and the leading scholar on Hamilton was really special, as was reading her work and learning about her thoughts on Hamilton! Also, I felt the readings were carefully selected and that they provided amazing insights into the time period. Discussions were great too, students had a lot of opportunity to talk and Professor Freeman was extremely encouraging! On our first draft of the final paper, Professor Freeman line-edited everyones papers and gave really helpful feedback and guidance!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the weaknesses solely related to taking a course during the pandemic, and had nothing to do with the course specifically. One thing that could be improved was a little bit more accountability and feedback for reading responses and more specific commentary on the readings before we dove into the discussion.",
                "Strengths are everything, no weaknesses!",
                "Professor Freeman is very passionate and knowledgeable about this time period which made for a lively discussion. I also liked connecting the topics to the present day and thought that helped me think more critically about why studying early American history mattered. Professor Freeman was also accommodating for the craziness of this semester which was helpful, and she gives really detailed feedback for the long research paper. I can't really think of any weaknesses other than the readings being long sometimes and the research paper taking a lot of work, but if you're up for it this is a great class.",
                "Great professor, great readings.",
                "Strengths: Professor Freeman is a phenomenal professor. She's engaging and enthusiastic in class, and really understanding given the circumstances of COVID-19 (willing to adjust the syllabus, give extra time on final papers, moving class during the election, etc.). The readings in the class are also interesting and come from various angles, particularly those who have typically been excluded from mainstream academic circles\/come from marginalized groups. This semester, Professor Freeman also put aside time for us to discuss the modern applications of our readings, which I enjoyed and helped make this class feel relevant to our current lives.\r\n\r\nI also really appreciate how Professor Freeman breaks up the final paper writing process with smaller milestones so that she can give you clear, detailed, feedback on your work. It helps with your academic writing past this class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There's a lot of reading, and it's difficult to finish all of it every single week, but this is sort of to be expected with Yale history seminars!",
                "Professor Freeman is extremely devoted to her students. She worked with us every step of the way in crafting our research papers and choosing our topics to a degree unmatched by most professors at this institutions. She spent time providing detailed comments on our written work and clear feedback (including line edits!) that made us better historians and writers. Class discussions were lively and engaged, so that the class still felt like a community despite the separated distance. The readings were interesting and well-tailored to the material. Professor Freeman made sure to include and center voices traditionally left out of the discussion of the period such as black people and women."

Pretty much every student participated and discussions were extremely engaging!\r\n\r\nCould be Improved: Having a more specific topic for the discussion could have funneled it a little bit more, as sometimes it could drift significantly away from the readings.",

It was difficult to conduct research for an original paper with the vast resources available. It was hard to know where to start. I think that there could have been more guidance on this front.",

I came in with very little background in early American history (I pretty much forgot everything after the APUSH test), and I felt that this course gave me a great perspective on the actual personalities and the various lenses of early American politics. It was not a survey course at all, but a deep-dive into historical study that provided a really nuanced perspective on early America that would be beneficial for anyone. I'm really excited to take more courses in this area, and hopefully more with Professor Freeman!",
