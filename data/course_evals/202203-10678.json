                "I deepened my grammar significantly. Whether it be applying the future tense or differentiating between the imperfect and the preterite, I feel that my grammar/conjugation has improved significantly. I also learned a lot of new things about Spanish speaking countries and the cultures attributed to them.",
                "I learned a lot about what I would say are the most essential and commonly used tenses from the language from preterite to subjunctive. I also learned a good amount of vocabulary about useful topics. I became more comfortable with using the language, especially in speaking and listening to it with the immersion we have in class. Learning about the culture was also very interesting."

                "Strengths: I thought the class was very well designed. Classes were challenging but a lot of fun, and we had a good variety of activities and assessments. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: For the first month or two, it felt like we had too many things due each week for me to be really absorbing the material. The pace in the second half of the course was more conducive to learning thoroughly.",
                "Strengths: small classes; one online day; different types of activities\r\nWeaknesses: exams are weighted too much; homework material should not cost money.",
                "The course is a well-oiled machine. It's a lot of work, but if you do it all you'll feel at least somewhat on top of everything.",
                "There are three exams in this course. I felt that the unit tests covered too much material at once. It may be better to have more exams over less content. There was also a lot of memorization with this course. I think time could have been better spent on other activities.",
                "Strengths: emphasis on extemporaneous speaking and in class activities which helped solidify my understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: maybe more in class conversations",
                "More in class lessons of grammar and vocabulary. Worksheets are not as engaging as lecturing with the professor.",
                "Strengths are that the class is very well organized, the detailed textbook is followed well, the in-class activities are enjoyable and engaging. However, I wish we spent more time reviewing the grammar concepts in-class. The grading is very unforgiving, but many different activities and exams compose the grade, so having a weakness in one area doesn't hurt your overall grade too much."

                "Yes. I thought the professor was very knowledgable and grading was fair, with clear rubrics for assignments.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are looking to improve your oral proficiency and general grammatical/conjugation knowledge.",
                "Many students taking this course are likely doing it for the language requirement, but I would still recommend this course. The course itself and the daily homework can be very time-consuming, but it's very well-organized. Garcia is a very nice professor, makes the class fun and engaging, and is great at helping you understand the grammar concepts."
