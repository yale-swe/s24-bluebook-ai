                "I really enjoyed the how much I was able to connect this course to other courses I was taking. I had no idea how much Catholic Thought has affected history.",
                "The Catholic Intellectual Tradition has an extensive reading list with texts from the first century AD until 2015: The Gospels, Augustine, Aquinas, the mystics, reformation and enlightenment thinkers, several papal encyclicals, 20th century autobiographies, and poetry and short stories. It's a mix of philosophy, theology, literature, and history. The section (mine at least) focused on close, philosophical reading of texts (as opposed to historical contextualization, though we did some of that). Lectures reminded me of AP European history as they had a lot of historical context for the week, though of course the material was college level and there was more analysis from Prof. Eire than you'd find in AP Euro. My European history & knowledge of philosophy is pretty strong, so I can't say this class gave me new insights every single week, but I did learn a lot, especially about some things I had never read about before (mystics, the autobiographies, the encyclicals). I really enjoyed the readings and think this class was worth spending a credit on..",
                "This course was really enlightening to me as a Catholic student because I was able to learn about my faith and its history.",
                "The class provided a broad survey of various Catholic thinkers, texts, and ideologies over the course of a thousand years.",
                "Knowledge about different Catholic thinkers throughout history, skills with reading their works of writing",
                "I gained greater insight into the historical threads that run through the Catholic tradition -- a respect for paradox, a deference to tradition, a desire for continuity, and an intense struggle to understand the relationship between sin and grace in the Western Tradition.",
                "I learned a lot surrounding the rich history of one of the oldest institutions being the Catholic Church. Additionally, I learned a lot surrounding theological and spiritual thinking.",
                "Overview of 20 centuries of Catholic history.",
                "How to read primary sources, write comparative analyses, discuss intellectual history and religion",
                "I learned so much about the Catholic tradition and the thinkers that formed it. As a Catholic, I really had never dug deeply into the tradition. This course was incredibly rewarding.",
                "I learned a lot about the philosophy that formed the Catholic faith. This was a wealth of knowledge that I had never even considered before this course, and now I feel like I could talk about it for hours."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: My TA, Alison, was absolutely lovely and I learned a lot from her section. Prof. Eire is a straight chiller  obviously brilliant, very funny, cares about his students and isn't super strict. I enjoyed the lectures by Prof. Eire and Prof. Brenzel the most (over the guest lecturers) but I do think the guest lecturers added to the course with their expertise. Many of the readings are pretty interesting, such as the autobiographies, encyclicals, and the short story. I appreciated that the lecture slides were on Canvas. Weaknesses: I would have liked if Prof. Eire gave us deadlines for the papers at the start of the term instead of 1-2 weeks in advance..",
                "The lectures provide fascinating perspectives and contextual information on the various thinkers and texts encountered in class. It was especially interesting to note how each thinker was related to their predecessors or pioneered a new interpretation of Catholic thought. However, the discussion section was not highly engaging and oftentimes did not go further than summarizing the texts, rather than encouraging analytical thought or collaboration with other students.",
                "Strengths: variety of perspectives from guest lecturers, it was so cool to hear from people who were experts on the specific topic we were learning about on that day! also Prof Eire is so knowledgeable and was happy to enter into good discussions about the topics of the class\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes the readings were really lengthy, which made it hard to thoroughly do all of them.",
                "I think the course has a fascinating trove of content -- and it's wonderfully explained and expounded upon. I would have appreciated more opportunities for student-engagement with the material in class; there wasn't really any student interaction in the lecture, as that was pushed into the discussion section. That's a fine general model -- but I think that even a small amount of student engagement in lecture would have been helpful.",
                "A lot of reading and not everything is really necessary",
                "This course was great as is and was very approachable for those knowledgeable in the Catholic Church and those with no prior exposure.",
                "This class goes very fast. Maybe slowing it down some.",
                "Strengths: really interesting readings, TAs were great, very nice, discussions were stimulating, low\/reasonable work load\r\nWeaknesses: since this was a survey course, we could not go into as much detail as I would have liked in certain topics.",
                "Loved the lectures and readings (especially Carlos Eire's lectures). I think the midterm\/final format would be more valuable if it were not passage ID. Given the volume of reading and thinkers we covered, I think this was an unnecessarily difficult format and something that focused more on the real takeaways of the course  thinking through the connections between thinkers and events in the tradition might be more valuable.",
                "Very interesting topic to learn about and discuss in section. The readings that were picked out were fascinating and I could tell that there was lots of thought and care put into the class's course packet. One thing that I personally didn't enjoy was all the guest lecturers. While it was nice to hear from various professors and experts, it was difficult to adapt to each lecturers different teaching style.",
                "This course was a great overview of the Catholic intellectual tradition, and it does an excellent job of linking everything together into one cohesive history. However, a few of the readings were excessively long and tedious. I found myself getting lost while I was reading."

                "This is a really great course. As a non-Catholic, I was able to learn a lot, and I'm really glad I took this course.",
                "This course really surprised me. I was taking it for a requirement but it turned out to one of my favorite classes. I would definitely recommend it.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in reading some of the important works in the Catholic tradition. I know a lot more about Augustine, Aquinas, Erasmus, Pascal, Thomas Merton, Pope Francis, etc. than I did before taking this course. However, this course is pretty introductory, and you might be better off taking some of Prof. Eire's advanced seminars if you already know a great deal about the authors I listed, or if you're a European history buff, or just already knowledgeable about theology. I liked the course format (2 papers and 2 quote ID & writing exams) and I enjoyed the lectures. I got this class to count for the philosophy major so if you're studying philosophy you could do that too. Take it with Alison as your TA if you can, she was fantastic. It was a nice course and I don't regret taking it at all..",
                "I would recommend the course to other students who are seeking to expand their knowledge on the roots of Catholic traditions and the evolution of doctrine and thought over hundreds of years of practice.",
                "Yes! Learn a lot about the progression of this major religion over time, and the many conflicts that it faced. And you also get to meet and learn from many different Yale professors who have super valuable insights.",
                "I would. I think this class is very self-selecting probably -- and the students in this class are ones that already would be interested by the content. I think for that group of students, it's a lovely course. I at least learned a lot, particularly about early Christianity.",
                "Yes! If you are looking for a gut humanities class then I would recommend this course. Additionally, you dont have to be very knowledgeable in the Christian tradition to excel in the course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! Professor Eire is amazing and the selection of primary sources on the syllabus are actually so interesting to read. Even if you are not religious, it is so interesting to learn about how Catholic thought has evolved over the centuries. One of my favorite classes Ive taken at Yale.",
                "Yes. If you want a relatively light workload and a fun class then take this one.",
                "Yes, great class to learn more about the rich intellectual history of Catholicism and to dive into a wide array of primary sources. Even if you are not Catholic, this is a great chance to learn more about a religion that has shaped so much of the world.",
                "Yes absolutely. So valuable to learn about a tradition that has shaped and touched so much history.",
                "Yes! It's really a fun history course. Beware of all the reading, though.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in learning about Catholicism. The readings (although they were on the longer side) were great indicators of the religion's most major themes and questions, and always left room for thought."
