                "The class is pretty straightforward. We did 21 lessons of Paul Rouzer's textbook, which is exactly 850 vocabulary words. Not sure how many grammar points that is, but it's at least 20+. Just like learning any language, this class entailed the accumulation of grammar and vocabulary, but also insights into what Chinese people(s) were thinking 2000+ years ago. And also the various foot chopping punishments and suicides that were committed. A major theme of the course was recognition or being understood by another person (to \"zhi\" someone, so to speak) which was found in pretty much all of the stories we read. Get ready for 10 short stories\/proverbs, three \"biographies of the stabby guests\" (or, assassin retainers), the story of Bao Si, and Mother Meng part 1 and part 2. Who knew there were like 5 ways to express \"I\/me\" and just as many to politely and hierarchically express \"you\" in literary Chinese? Fascinating stuff. BUT and this is a mega \"but\" just because I learned a lot, that does not mean whatsoever that it was worth it. Mick Hunter is arrogant and full of himself and it really shows through his blatant lack of respect for everyone. Frankly, I'm embarrassed that Yale hired him."

                "STRONG: stable structure, recording\/ppts uploaded promptly, grading relatively straightforward, learning goals laid out from the get-go, one textbook, tiny class, taught in English, knowledgeable professor. WEAK: Mick disagrees with Rouzer's definitions way too many times. The texts vary dramatically from three sentences to entire pages of 500+ characters. Some lessons have 20 vocab words while others have close to 80, with many have multiple definitions and pronunciations. Why did he make us memorize the Mandarin pronunciation when I can assure you the classical pronunciation would have differed greatly? That seemed worthless. At the beginning of the semester, way too much attention was on \"memorizing this sentence\" of the story. For what reason? That was unnecessary stress. Studies have shown that rote memorization does nothing for retention or accumulation of knowledge, so why on earth would we do that? And then as quickly as he forgot on some days to test us, we stopped doing it altogether, with the new stress of maybe being called on to repeat all 5 definitions for a word. Well, that happened once and only once. Scoring the quizzes out of 20 points is cruel. You might get one question wrong and boom you got a B. There's no reason for that, and people in past years, per the reviews, have complained about this too. What's up with professors not listening to feedback? Do we fill these out for no reason? Mick's personality is horrible. Rude, condescending, and demeaning. Sharp, snappy, disrespectful, and impolite. And he had the audacity to complain that we all looked dead and tired at 9am in the morning. When he consciously asked the registrar to hold this class at 9am in the morning. Ridiculous. Refusing to answer questions that had been asked before--this is a language class. Questions will be asked again. In the amount of time that it took him to refuse to answer and tell the student to check the recording, he could've answered the question and been done with it. He got so fed up with an apparent mistranslation of \"chen\" (subject\/minister or polite first-person pronoun addressing a superior) that he stopped class and yelled at us about it. Absolutely inappropriate reaction. Go ahead and read years' worth or reviews lauding this white man teaching literary Chinese and ancient Chinese thought. Believe them if you will. But it's not like I'm letting loose on a man who gave me a bad grade. I did remarkably well actually and I'm particularly proud of that b\/c this class was so painfully stressful. Mick is like if the bad chem lab professor taught in the humanities dept. Y'all know who I'm talking about. You'd never choose to take his class willingly. But you have no choice, b\/c he's the only prof teaching it, and there's only one section. So you suck it up and dredge through it. Sure, I'm glad I took the class and it's definitely a unique opportunity. But his vitriolic rhetoric, adamant refusal to answer questions, and negative comportment throughout the semester put a bad taste in my mouth. And frankly, it's shocking to me that the EALL dept would want Mick to keep teaching. He's rude for NO REASON. If you doubt yourself for a second, he yells at you. If you're unsure of something, he makes you feel stupid. If you speak too slow or have a speech impediment, he accosts you. If you're late or sick, he lets everyone know. If your sound bothers him, he alerts you. Yells at his kid(s) during class. Complains about his dog barking. Newsflash: no one cared until you brought it to our attention. For a class all about respect, relationships, and \"zhi\", it would've been nice to have been respected. The weaknesses of this class come at no surprise to me, but what was astonishing is how much they made me not excited to get up at 9am for this class. I also hated that he changed the quiz due date to Wednesday at 5. That helped no one and put undue stress to do the new lesson and finish the quiz. Do not take. Save your soul. Please."

                "As Mick said in the course video \"this course promises to be a beacon of stability in what promises to be a very chaotic semester.\" Sure, it was. One lesson per class. Quiz once a week (mostly). Powerpoints available after class and recording uploaded promptly. One textbook the whole time. Simple. What wasn't great was how he reacted to various mishaps. Wasted time telling people their internet was bad or reprimanded rather harshly if they were only a few minutes late. I'm sorry, but what devilish person would choose 9am as their selected class time? Especially when people were zooming in from the midwest, Texas, and China?! Mindboggling. So cut some slack for them when they're barely two minutes late or visibly sick. I really hated the quiz format too. First you had to type in Chinese, which is a lot slower if the characters are not commonly used in the modern era; handwriting actually would have been faster, albeit tedious. Multiple students complained about the time crunch, but it was never addressed. There's no reason our time should be so limited, b\/c in the real world when we translate things, we're not given 10 minutes and then it disappears; especially during COVID, he could have relaxed the limit. Otherwise, in terms of COVID, it was just fine."

                "Absolutely! Prof. Hunter is fantastic.",
                "Absolutely not. This is by far THE WORST class I have ever taken and I've taken 37 college classes. When you learn a language, a huge part of the experience is the personality of the professor, the warmth of the classroom, and the fun environment. Mick is like if you took a piece of garbage, rolled it up in more garbage, stuck it in a dumpster, left it for a few months, let it decay, and then took it back out. There's literally no way to describe it in any less-crude terms and even still I'm not sure I'd encapsulate the experience. On the very first day of class he said \"he was the best person to teach this class\" sure, a native Chinese professor totally couldn't teach literary Chinese better than a white man. Then he proceeded to be condescending, demeaning, rude, arrogant, haughty, self-absorbed, full of himself, and just downright mean throughout the rest of the semester. Honestly, what could I have expected, he's on the Executive Committee, so it came with the whole ordeal. 1, if there was an ounce of background noise in your vicinity, he made it a point to cut you off and let you know. Wouldn't be so horrific if he did it once, but he did it every single time, even if NOBODY ELSE CARED. And if your wifi connection wasn't great, before you could even say \"hey, how are you,\" he had to let you know. \"Your connection is choppy.\" Cool, I know, and it's the 13th week of this issue, no. one. cares. 2, if you were late, he made sure to let everyone know. In his course video, he mentioned that he'd be flexible with time zones and record lectures if you were late or had to miss. Nice. No. Two students were zooming from mainland China and a few others from non-EST. One student was 5 minutes late one time, and visibly sick, and he proceeded to stop class, demean her for being late \"x don't ever be late again and don't let this become a pattern,\" which was completely unnecessary. We weren't even doing anything important?? Why did he make it a point to be rude? 3, if you were just a tad too slow for his liking, he had to let you know. I was incredibly taken aback when he told a student they were too slow when they were reading the Chinese text out loud \"next time, you just have to be faster, that was way too slow.\" Be encouraging, not discouraging. 4, email etiquette was horrific. If you emailed him late, and he responded late, he made it seem like it was your fault that he was answering after midnight. Nobody forced you to answer this late?? 5, if you couldn't remember a word, he berated you like you were stupid. 850 words in one semester is a huge amount. That's faster than quite a few modern Chinese classes. But if you got something wrong on a quiz or wrote something wrong in the homework, the tone of the comments was condescending \"where'd you get that???\" \"Huh?\" 6, he accidentally shared too much of his screen one time, and we saw that he had a dictionary up on his computer, after telling us that we had to memorize everything. Double standards much? 7, three homework assignments went ungraded. Asked about these and was ignored. They stayed \"submitted\" on Canvas. 8, in a 7 person class, he felt the need to curve our grades. Why?? Because there were too many As? What distribution were you looking for?? 9, if you asked a question that had already been answered, instead of politely responding, you were met with \"we already covered that, were you paying attention? Check the recording.\" In the amount of time it took you to say that, you could have answered the goddamned question. The class was about variation in translation, but if you were too literal or too abstract, you were reprimanded. Biggest hypocrisy was that a major theme was respect and recognition and not once did I feel respected or valued. He found ways to tell people they were wrong, interrupt them to let them know of an internet problem that bothered no one, he was rude, dismissive, and acted like the king of the world. AVOID at literally all costs and take it in China."
