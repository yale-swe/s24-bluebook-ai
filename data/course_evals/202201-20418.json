I appreciate the time we took to understand different kinds of vaccines and governmental agencies that deal with vaccines. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The vast majority of our readings centered on white, wealthy experiences of antivaccinationism and I think it was a huge omission to not talk more expansively about how issues of class and race impact the history of vaccines. We talked quite a lot about gender and motherhood, but we only briefly/tangentially explored how forms of oppression impact vaccine access and information.",
                "Strengths: cool assignments, Professor Schwartz is great (super available, knowledgeable, really enjoyed hearing about current events at the beginning of class). No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths - interesting readings and class discussions\r\nWeaknesses - some discussions felt repetitive, class felt less seminar-style and more lecture at times.",
                "Professor Schwartz is an absolute joy to work with!",
                "Strengths: reading load was manageable, clear instructions for writing assignments, good instructor feedback\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't feel very connected to any of my classmates, and I ended the class without knowing the majority of their names",
                "It was a great course! The length of the final paper felt a bit long but it did allow us to go in-depth with primary sources, which was a great experience.",

The workload for the class is pretty reasonable, with weekly reading responses, two midterm papers, and a final paper.
