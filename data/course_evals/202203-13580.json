                "Strengths: THE PROFESSORS. They are the kindest, most considerate profs you will ever have. They are also receptive to feedback when the reading or workload is too much. They literally go above and beyond in every way. The class teaches practical skills such as reading scientific papers, writing a public policy report, and presenting research, which was nice. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe just some extra support for students who do not come from a scientific/psych background earlier in the year!",
                "Strengths - professors really cared about the students and our learning needs, class structure was diverse in mediums of learning (speakers, classmate presentations, videos, discussion of readings) but consistent with expectations, readings assigned were manageable and appropriate. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale because I found myself learning to learn - not to prove myself or meet a deadline. For each class, we could fill out an anonymous feedback form and the profs actually read and responded through action to improve the classroom. The content in this class is also rarely acknowledged or engaged with at Yale. It felt that the class was grounded in a disability justice framework and I improved as a learner and researcher but also as a person and ally.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - need to publish the rubrics sooner (though this was still better/faster than most of my classes). I really appreciated the Modules with instructions & examples of each assignment. It was one of the first syllabi that actually fully made sense to us students!",
                "strengths: super interesting material and assignments\r\nweaknesses: a bit disorganized, sometimes too much discussion",
                "This was a fantastic course with incredibly responsive instructors; they were truly some of the best professors I have ever had at this institution. And they were incredibly knowledgable about all subjects"

                "I definitely would. It is so important to dedicate time to learning about and internalizing the perspectives of people with disabilities, who are often overlooked, or have their needs assumed for them. It is simply something everyone should be educated about, especially people considering going into fields in education. Ideally, no one should become an educator without taking this course.",
                "Yes. 11/10 class. This class was focused appropriately on major themes and facets of disability studies, while still giving students the opportunity to research and explore topics personally meaningful to us. The workload was manageable and engaging. This class is also important because students aren't trained in disability justice before coming to Yale, despite Yale having a large disabled student population. It was important just to learn about how to better support myself, my peers, and our collective learning needs.",
