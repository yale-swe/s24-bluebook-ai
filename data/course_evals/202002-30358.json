Without a doubt, the amount of time that you spend will discipline you and prepare you for L5 Arabic, because you are constantly engaging with the language. I have definitely learned a lot more vocabulary and ways to express myself, my thoughts, etc.",

    "While not fully immersive (like a study abroad would be, for example), the course was still pretty intense and required dedicated study time every day.  As as a result, my Arabic has improved rapidly.  I also think that the necessary online-ness was handled well (helped also of course by our small class size), and I felt engaged despite being alone in my room and (shhhh!) in boxer shorts.  I'm sure the course could be improved somehow, but I'm not really sure how unfortunately, so I can't give any helpful feedback there - I thought it was quite good as is.  Obviously the online-ness made things less efficient and the digital audio occasionally amplified my struggles to understand spoken arabic, but that's not remediable really unless we take to global coronavirus policy-making or virological research.  Also, all feedback and grading was impressively speedy.  (Also just a note, I put below that the workload was greater than most courses, but I don't think its a fair comparison since its an intensive summer class not taken alongside 3 or 4 others like in the year)",
    "good",
    "Great course; I learned so much in 5 weeks. I often felt that my speaking skills were not up to par, especially given that I had taken the past 1.5 semesters of Arabic remotely, but I don't know how that could have been improved. Natakallam was great, but I wish we had started earlier in the course. The Yale language tutor program was not at all equipped to handle the class schedule, but that was not the instructor's fault."
