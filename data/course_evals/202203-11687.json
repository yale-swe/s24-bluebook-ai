                "Strengths: Professor Schmertzler, although tough on the outside, cared so much about each student's success both in and out of the classroom. He made himself available to help students with careers and other more personal questions despite his insanely busy schedule. He pushed us all incredibly hard and demanded 150% of our effort every single class. There was not a day that went by that he did not act as a dynamic professor, unafraid to call on students and push their logic and argument to its limits. The textbooks we used were written all by him. This strengths section is short in comparison to the weaknesses, but I cannot emphasize how highly I think of this course. It is, without a debt, the best course I have taken at Yale and the course in which I learned the most.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I see no weaknesses with Professor Schmertzler or the course material itself. However, I think that Professor Schmertzler could do a better job going forward in creating a less toxic and cliquey learning environment. Given the course title and material, the class was full of type-A, hardcore finance bros who live and breathe this information. For students who were less capable and previously knowledgeable, it created an intimidating atmosphere. There were many opportunities to work in groups, yet these groups were also self-selected. In a field like finance, I believe learning how to work with anyone is critical. In this class, it also would have broken up groups that formed and were clearly exclusionary. Despite being eager to work in finance, this class unfortunately validated the aggressive, testosterone-filled environment that is corporate finance. That being said, this is a small weakness in an otherwise fantastic class.\r\n\r\nSomewhat related to the above, it was slightly annoying to see that we had to purchase the required materials for this course despite them being written by Professor Schmertzler himself. More importantly, whatever publishing company he used absolutely sucked. The books took almost a month to arrive, making it hard to complete readings in the beginning of the semester. At a minimum, he should use a local New Haven printer like most other courses do.\r\n\r\n(the classroom was also unbearably hot - that's on Yale tho)",
                "No weaknesses! Extremely informative and enjoyable class.",
                "You will work hard but if you put in effort you will learn a lot.",
                "Less modeling and much more theoretical but one of the best classes at Yale Ive ever taken",
                "Tough course, but you learn a lot - if you're getting into finance after college, this course is good preparation.",
                "Strengths are that it will make anyone well prepared for an investment banking or private equity analyst job after school if they put in the work. No weaknesses I can think of",
                "Strengths are how comprehensive the material is that we study and its practical application. Very robust combination of basic concept review combined with case studies to cement understanding. Few weaknesses to the course, maybe could have spent more time on developing three statement models and placing more emphasis on that. That is what I found most challenging for the final.",
                "The course was much more self-directed than I expected. If you want to do well you really have to put in the time and teach yourself the concepts from reading the textbooks. While some of the material is covered in class, it's not done so in a way that will teach you if you haven't put in the work yourself. I found the most valuable \"material\" from class was not actually what was in the textbooks, but guided engagements with private equity scenarios both from the past and from the present. Professor Schmertzler is a great lecturer and I learned a lot from the interactive parts of the course.\r\n\r\nCertain things could be improved with regards to the logistics, which I've listed below:\r\n1. A digital copy of the textbook would be a) more accessible to students, b) easier to annotate, and c) avoid the problem of black\/white printing for charts, and the inclusion of hyperlinks that can't be clicked on.\r\n2. While a lot of the class didn't necessarily have a \"right answer\" or \"correct way\" to do things, I learned a lot from the times where the professor walked us through certain assignments\/calculations\/models, which I wish happened more frequently.\r\n3. Taking the class without a strong finance background made it exponentially more difficult, but I'm not sure if there is a good\/efficient way to fix that.",
                "Unlike perhaps any course you've taken at Yale, Professor Schmertzler will give you real and raw feedback. Be ready -- it is only because he is deeply invested in your learning as a student.",
                "Strength: the professor is one of the top ones of his field. He explains concepts really well. \r\nWeakness: the amount of reading assigned sometimes is too heavy.",

                "This is the best course I have taken at Yale. That being said, it is also the course in which I had the most work by far. Do not come in expecting this to be a chill class by any means. Although corporate finance is not particularly difficult (it's based on simple math), the workload is incredibly daunting.\r\n\r\nTo give you a better idea, the class met Tuesdays and Thursday during the semester. Unlike other courses though, we essentially had a problem set's worth of work plus required readings for each class session. For me, this meant that most Monday and Wednesday nights were spent grinding away on the readings and whatever other case study or homework we had in that class session. Despite that, Professor Schmertzler still expected students to come into class having fully digested the readings that were assigned (which I often failed to do for most of the semester). We also had to read the Financial Times on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I cannot recommend this course enough to a student who is seriously interested in pursuing private equity. I interned in investment banking this summer, yet I feel as though this course has taught me so much more than that experience did. More importantly, it teaches you the important terms, history, and ideas that are not as accessible in a work-setting. Anyone recruiting for finance jobs often recites the line \"if you wanted to hire someone with the best financial and excel skills, go to Wharton.\" That sentiment probably still holds true for the modeling aspect, yet I know have such a deep academic understanding of private equity knowledge that I feel as though I can operate on a similar playing field. It's one thing to be a modeling monkey (what you might get at Wharton) but it's a completely different idea to understand the complexities of building a private equity capital stack and understanding the various parties that are involved.",
                "Absolutely no question. Worth every minute you spend on it. It really is a class where you get out what you put in. If you want to learn, you do the work necessary. Extremely rewarding and probably the best class I have taken at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. Best course at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student at Yale interested in a career in finance or investment. The skills and methods taught by Prof Schmertzler go beyond private equity and are applicable to anyone in a leadership role.",
                "Yes, 100%, this is one of the best classes Ive ever taken and if youre interested in finance this is the best class to ever take.",
                "Yes - strays away from the Yale liberal arts vibe and prepares you well for a career in finance.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student going into investment banking or private equity after Yale. No other course will come close to giving them the same preparation as this one.",
                "Yes, if you want to enter a career in finance and investing, it's a must - very comprehensive and solid learnings.",
                "Yes - if you are willing to put in the work. I took this class because I wanted to know if private equity was a good career path or not for me. Pretty much every other person in the class had interned at a bank last summer and thus had the prerequisite financial background. Not having that background made it difficult for me at first, but it soon became clear that everyone was roughly on the same footing in terms of the difficulty of picking up and working with the material. It is a lot of textbook reading, and there are not many opportunities (besides the infrequent case studies) to practice and understand the techniques you are learning in the book. At first, I didn't do a good job of that, and there were times in class where I felt much less \"plugged-in\" to what was going on than other people with a stronger finance background. That being said, I realized that I needed to put in a lot more time, and that just because I didn't intern at Goldman Sachs didn't meant that I wasn't smart enough to figure things out on my own. Only by the time of the final case (which I was admittedly pretty freaked out about), did I realize how much I had actually learned during the class.",
                "This course is a must-not-miss at Yale. Preparing for class every Tuesday and Thursday is a full-time job - memorize the numbers, read the Lex, read the chapters, and do the case. But you will learn more than you perhaps have before. Trust the process.",
                "Yes, if you want to work in private equity or venture capital.",
                "Yes. This is the best pre-finance career class at Yale, period. This class teaches business, finance, and investing better than anything else (classes, books, podcasts, networking calls, internships).\r\n\r\nBe warned, this class is best suited for the proverbial finance hardo. You must have pre-requisite knowledge to succeed and enjoy the experience. It will be quickly obvious if you are or are not a good fit. There were some students with less background knowledge (e.g. vc experience but no modeling or strong background in corpfi) who were able to succeed with extra effort.\r\n\r\nProfessor Schmertzler is tough but very kind. He was my favorite professor at Yale and this was my favorite class."
