                "its hard",
                "Strength: PSETs were helpful for exams\r\nWeakness: recorded videos from 2020 were hard to follow - too fast. Also, we got no grades back for our homeworks for the second exam - and Glenn actively ignored questions on Ed inquiring when we will get them back. There was 0 feedback on our work done after mid-March until last exam in May.",
                "The only strength I can possibly see for this awful course is that the pure subject matter (like in the textbook) is interesting. But the poor execution of this course on the part of Glenn makes the course uniquely traumatizing and the content uninteresting. The only way for this class to improve is with a different professor. Glenn is a nice guy, but he doesn't understand how stressful this class is from our perspective as students. By giving us one day to study for the midterm (by making a problem set two days before the midterm) or by having a final a week BEFORE reading period while we have classes including in Algos (that had content relevant to the final exam). His lectures are also very confusing and concepts that can be easily explained are made to be way more complicated than they need to be. He also reversed the grading distribution for some reason during the pandemic (to be 70% exams and 30% psets) which added another level of stress to this course experience.",
                "The tests were hard. But I guess that was just the content. Would have been helpful if the recorded lectures were named after the topics covered in class (though this is specific to online learning). Could have given more examples on how to actually write up a proof/explanation to questions like those that appeared on the hw and exams - still am not sure what the level of detail necessary was.",
                "Strengths: GLENN IS THE BEST. Course has a nice variety of topics without being too broad.\r\nWeaknesses: poorly designed office hours infrastructure and scheduling led to scarcity of resources. Some ULAs were unprepared.",
                "Strengths: Can't think of many.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Way harder than it needs to be. Way more work than it needs to be.",
                "It's algorithms.  It's hard.  This is the type of class you expect by taking algorithms.  I might make the psets count for more though.  It's kinda rough that 80% of our grade is exams.",
                "Technically, an incredibly good course. Not a lot of student collaboration is encouraged though, which could be good for learning.",
                "Lectures are pretty dry but Professor Glenn does his best to make them interesting. This is one of those classes where you just have to grunt through even though the material is tough and dry, because it is definitely helpful if you are looking to have a career in CS",
                "There's a LOT of material and it isn't always clear what is necessary to know (or even helpful to know, as some of the topics covered in lecture/videos are just never brought up again). \r\n\r\nAlso, office hours was set up extremely unintuitively this semester, with extremely long wait times that often resulted in very little help after waiting for ~2 hours. There also was not a queue until a fair way into the semester, so there was always a lot of confusion about how long the wait was? Previous CS classes had already solved this problem with a Google Docs queue (or Rob's really cool web app office hours system, csofficehours.org) so I'm not sure why office hours was so chaotic for this class. \r\n\r\nAlso, there was a cheating scandal for the midterm and to me it seemed to be handled really poorly because I (as someone who did not cheat) was terrified at the ensuing series of vaguely ominous, threatening posts that Professor Glenn made on Ed because I was worried that the teaching staff may have thought I had cheated since some of my answers were similar to the homeworks, which was totally allowed since it was open-book, and it was just really really stressful.",
                "I very much liked the style of lecture combining both prerecorded videos that we could watch at our leisure and live virtual lectures where we could ask questions to solidify our knowledge. Also the topics in the later half of the course were very interesting. One weakness in my eyes was that it seemed the discussion on loop invariants went on for too long and it could have been cut down a lecture or two to make more room for the survey of approximation algorithms at the end of the semester.",
                "Strengths: Professor Glenn is meticulous and the problem sets and exams are well-set. Exams are challenging enough to produce a curve that actually looks like a proper curve (whereas in other classes, you have 80% of people getting 90+ on an exam), so you don't have to worry about getting perfect answers or getting a low raw score. In the remote setting, the ability to pause and rewatch lectures makes it easier to understand and follow the lectures, which I think was a problem students faced in past years.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Glenn speaks like a robot in his recorded videos, which is very unfortunate because it makes it really difficult to understand and follow his train of thought. He spends a lot of effort in making the videos, but I suggest that he not follow a script while teaching. The natural intonations that come with teaching and explaining are lost, which seriously affects the intuitive understandability of the recorded lectures. I have struggled to follow the recorded lectures and find them a pain to watch. It might be better to do more explaining and teaching live. Also, problem sets were not returned on time (HW 4-6 returned after final). There is also inconsistency in grading the homeworks, with some students getting off with mistakes, while some students getting really strict and nitpicky graders.",
                "Strength: having the optionality between attending class and solely viewing the recorded mini videos made learning efficient.",
                "This course has a lot of resources, which is a great thing, but I found it difficult to navigate them sometimes. Especially towards the end, it seemed like there were a lot of videos from sort through when looking for a particular concept. But overall, this course is fantastic-- its remarkable how much Glenn is able to cover while remaining succinct and thorough.",
                "Strengths are that it exposes students to the fundamentals of algorithm design. It also challenges students with some of the most common problems in computer science, which can then be used as a knowledge base for solving more complex issues. Weaknesses are that the pacing is sometimes inconsistent, and the material can sometimes feel like it doesn't flow naturally. Providing a clearer topic roadmap at the beginning of each major unit would provide better clarity and an intuitive explanation for the importance of each concept. Faster grading of homeworks would also provide more instant feedback of progress and areas-of-improvement to students.",
                "Overall I thought that the course was well designed for student learning. The recorded mini lectures on each topic were a nice format for the virtual semester. Professor Glenn was dedicated to student learning and answering student questions. The ULAs were very helpful and I appreciated the problem overview sessions for the psets.",
                "The lectures, recorded videos were good",
                "I thought that the pre-recorded videos were incredibly helpful to look back to. I think that live lectures were sometimes a little long and therefore hard to follow for the entire hour and 15 min.",
                "Strength: good psets and materials \r\nWeakness: office hours were a mess on the second week of each pset; pre-recorded videos on Thursdays were insanely fast (we would cover an entire live lecture of material which is usually 75 minutes in a 6-minute recorded video sometimes). Live lectures were sometimes very boring and just introduced new topics/examples - I feel like the hard material like difficult proofs should be in love lectures and the easy stuff like examples should be in the pre-recorded videos to make it easier. They also only graded 3/6 psets by the time of our final exam, but honestly it didnt matter that much",
                "The material is pretty interesting and some of the homework assignments were actually somewhat enjoyable if you like thinking about problems. However, I found the lectures pretty boring, and a few problems on the homework/exams felt needlessly tedious and long.",
                "The strengths are definitely the lectures, both the prerecorded ones and the live ones. Professor Glenn does an excellent job of being engaging while also being extremely clear in his proofs and algorithms. Another strength was office hours with Glenn, often times I would be almost there with a solution and just needed him to point out something obvious we had mentioned in class which was nice. Also, he is very kind and always willing to help students. Another strength was the problem sets. They were often fun to do! On the other hand, sometimes I think the problem sets were too short or not difficult enough. This is especially true when we have two weeks to do about 2-3 problems but then the exams consist of 4-5 homework problems with way less time. What would be good if we had more practice homework problems and maybe one more challenging question. Another weakness is probably the exams. While fair in the sense that all the questions are doable, they often got me with the time constraints and had I maybe a few more minutes I'd've been able to finish up some of the questions more cleanly. That being said, the class is curved so its not a big deal.",
                "the beginning of the course is a bit theoretical. I feel like invariants are kind of pointless thing to understand. Learned a good amount --- but wish it wass more focused on different algorithms and less on proof/theory",
                "I think some of the topics are very interesting, but the first half of the semester is kind of boring / a slog. It's also unclear most of the time exactly how specific we needed to be in our proofs and grading could sometimes feel a little arbitrary. I loved Glenn's prerecorded videos, he is an acting icon.",
                "A strength of the course is that it covers much more material than other algorithm courses at peer institutions (according to Professor Glenn). A significant weakness to this aspect is that we do not have enough time in the semester to go through the material so my classmates and I can fully understand what we are expected to learn, especially if the only lecture material on any topic is a seven-minute pre-recorded video packed with dense material with little additional examples, explanation, or discussion.",
                "I thought the videos and live lectures sometimes did not feel cohesive and it look a long time for the grading of psets. This made it extremely hard to keep track of progress.",
                "Strengths: \r\n\r\n- several of the algorithms we discussed were interesting and applicable to the real world\r\n- the recorded lecture format (which Prof Glenn puts a ton of work into) really helps a lot for allowing us to see notes, pause the video, and re-record\r\n- I like that finals and psets end before reading period - it takes a lot of load off us students in terms of staggering workload at the end of the semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses and improvements:\r\n\r\n- I think the lectures could be even more helpful by explaining things not so much in mathematical terms but in laymans terms, that is, by adding more examples with real numbers of lemmas and proofs and theorems in action (showing how we could find intuition for figuring it out ourselves)\r\n- I'm not sure why psets were made from 75% of our grade to 36% of our grade this year, but that made the class much more stressful in what has already been a stressful pandemic year.\r\n- Didn't like how the break day on 4/8/21 was ignored, and that we were still assigned pre-recorded videos to watch",
                "Glenn covers a great amount of material (including things not in the Kleinberg-Tardos text but also from CLRS and other sources) to make the course very valuable in terms of teaching us a wide breadth of the design and analysis of algorithms. However, I do wish there were a more organized form of lecture notes than just the copies of his OneNote markups. I think a more organized LaTeX-style set of concise notes (or even topics) would have helped. The teaching staff was great, but office hours' sign-up and meeting system could be improved. I also wish we spent less time on loop invariants (which became pedantic very quickly) and more time on the topics at the end of the course, e.g. PSPACE, approximation algorithms, and randomized algorithms, since those were very interesting.",

You spend a decent amount of time completing the problem sets anyways because they're still the same difficulty, but now they're worth like 3% of your grade. Which is frustrating. Instead now the exams count for a lot more, which I think makes less sense. Also, there needs to be a well established office hours system. There was no queue at the start of the semester and this led to chaos -- or even worse, the queue was on the zoom chat which not everyone could see.",
                "For me it felt like a kind of slow start, getting the meticulous points about loop variants done. I greatly preferred the second half of the course.

It makes absolutely no sense. \r\n\r\nThroughout, it's difficult to understand what exactly you need to know for the exams, and in order to do the homework assignments you often have to pull \"widgets\" out of thin air or it's impossible to solve them.",

If it could be adjusted to give more weight to the problem sets that take hours upon hours to complete, I feel the grading would be more fair. To make timed tests that contain questions as difficult (and more unintuitive) worth 64% of the grade is unreasonable in my opinion. You can do poorly in the course even if you put in hours of work and effort into it.",

Since the lecture material was often dry and difficult to engage with, there was rarely more than 30 students attending class, even though 119 students were enrolled. The pre-recorded lectures were even worse, as there was no chance for engagement while covering the material, and complex topics were reduced from multiple lectures to a single seven-minute video.

Glenn doubled down on the work, didn't loosen any deadlines, and when people were caught cheating on the first exam he made the second exam shorter in time allowance (but not length), closed-note, and proctored. He spent a couple weeks during the \"cheating\" incident essentially threatening students on EdDiscussion, telling them they might as well drop the course if they cheated because he would find them. This was around the time that Yale's community was struggling mental-health wise, and it didn't feel right for that to be going on at the same time. \r\n\r\nHe also included weekly \"videos\" we had to watch instead of Thursday lectures. At first I thought this was nice because I wouldn't have to sit through an entire lecture, but he would essentially boil down a lecture's-worth of content into 15 mins of video so I'd find myself rewatching portions very often.",

The workload is low, problem sets are only once every two weeks, and take quite a short time to do if you attend the problem overview session. I learnt a good bunch about algorithms although the time spent was less - this is a very time and cost-effective course!",

The problem sets are genuinely fun to figure out and the algorithms we learn about are interesting and useful in many different fields. The most annoying part of this course however was loop invariants which is by far the hardest part and it is the first topic we talk about so if you don't like that, don't worry the material gets wayyyy better as you go on. A lot of these topics are also probably really relevant for technical job interviews if that's your thing though I felt it was really satisfying to learn as a subject on its own. That being said, I also shopped 366, Intensive Algorithms, and the lectures seemed much more motivated and rigorous than those of 365. If you have the time to invest in 366 I would definitely take that over this, but this class will still teach you everything you need to know from an introduction to algorithms you really need albeit without as much problem solving practice.",

It is disappointing to know that since the topics covered in the class are crucial to a well-rounded education in CS, students will surely be required to take the course, no matter how poor the evaluations are. If someone who is interested in learning about Algorithms is not required to take this course, I would remind them that half our lecture material was covered in a similar manner to a ten-minute YouTube video, and there are many other resources online to gain a similar learning experience as an alternative to taking this course.",

But they never take 5-10 mins to watch, learn, and digest due to the amount of content packed into the videos and the speed which Glenn goes through the material (he even manages to leave out content somehow). You'll learn more from the TF's problem sessions where he does a far better job at explaining and breaking down the content. I also do not understand why the grading distribution was changed from 25% exams, 75% HWs in previous years to 64% exams, 36% HWs especially during a PANDEMIC.

The course material is definitely very interesting and the problem sets were fun to work through despite taking as long as they did, but I did not particularly enjoy the class. Professor Glenn is a nice guy and I think he can be a good teacher, but his expectations are unreasonable at times and his lack of responses on important ed questions was frustrating. I know problem sets take a while to grade, but it was nerve wracking to have only half of our problem sets graded by the second exam. We were not able to review our mistakes on them to avoid them on the exam or even know how well/poorly we were doing in the class so far.",
