    "This class helped me reframe literary analysis and understand how we travel and how we communicate about travel.",
    "I think my academic prose improved significantly and I learned how to better critically read and analyze texts. I also learned a lot about the world because the focus of this class was travel writing.",
    "I read a lot of greater literature and improved on my close reading and writing immensely.",
    "In this course, I was able to get a firsthand experience of what college-level writing looks like. I intended to take this course as an 'intro to writing' course because I began my time in college extremely unsure about my writing. In this class, I was able to improve upon my close reading skills, strengthen my analytical ability, and develop a sense of tone and structure for my papers. I was also able to experience a seminar setting; something that was not possible in any of my other classes. Through this I was able to know my professor better, which allowed me to reach out whenever I was unsure about an assignment, needed assistance, or wanted advice.",
    "This course especially helped with my writing, as well as close reading ability. My repertoire of famous literature developed as well. Each of the four papers I wrote worked on a different writing skill, among these close reading, research, and using literary theory. I feel I have a strong basis in college level academic writing through this course.",
    "Developed my writing and close reading analysis.",
    "I developed my ability to write with cohesive ideas and logical flow.",
    "By taking this course, I learned about the importance of time management. At several points throughout the semester, I found myself struggling to make enough time for all of my assignments and ended up pushing essay deadlines back more often than I would've liked."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really loved that this class allowed me to read different texts regularly so if one text didn't speak to me, I didn't have to write about it. Additionally, I liked the small classroom feel and getting to engage not only with my responses to the texts but the insights of the professor and my peers. \r\n\r\nOne weakness is the structure of deadlines. First of all, a lot of the papers were concentrated towards the end of the semester. Additionally, there were often large reading assignments corresponding with essay deadlines which made it difficult to do both.",
    "A strength of this course was the vast selected texts that we read. I liked that we read essays, poetry, and novels that all dealt with different perspectives and aspects of the world. A weakness was that sometimes the reading wasn't distributed evenly--some days the reading was light, and other days it was much heavier and difficult to balance.",
    "This class was great! The work balance was good and I was able to learn a lot nd enjoy the course.",
    "When it comes down to it, this class isn't as hard as it seems. This class is very good at taking large, overly detailed texts and refining a question or idea about the text into a fully-fledged paper. The pacing of the class is also fairly easy to follow along with. I feel as though the class would improve from starting the course with easier texts, since the first text that we read, Innocents Abroad, was a little difficult to understand at first, and I felt as though I had to constantly catch up after that point.",
    "The syllabus of the course was very strong, and Professor Wild did an excellent job gauging which novels were most interesting to us and focusing on those. The assignments were ver clear and the instructions easy to understand. The one place the class could be significantly improved is in the discussions. Sometimes it seemed like the discussion would fall flat when no one felt like they had a good answer to a question.",
    "The greatest strength of the course was the revision process and amount of in-depth feedback that was provided.",
    "One strength of this course would have to be the healthy balance between class discussion on story details and finding meaning. I personally think that the instructor, alongside the class as a whole, melds plot and personal reflection well. While some texts such as Mark Twain's Innocents Abroad and Alejo Carpentier's The Lost Steps offer details pertaining to travel, others including Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities and Todorov's \"The Journey and Its Narratives\", dive into philosophical thinking and allow the audience to think beyond what happened, read in-between the lines, and build conclusions that they can relate to the real world. Likewise, some of the texts offer personal reflection, all the more sustaining the equilibrium between thought and movement. \r\n\r\nI also love the implementation of first drafts being due before final versions as students got the chance to learn from their peers and the teacher about areas in their work that they need improvement on before being properly and truly assessed on their progress. \r\n\r\nOverall, I do not think that this course suffers from any major weaknesses. While deadlines for paper assignments could be pushed back to give students more time to work, I think that proper time management from scholars also serves as a factor in the issue. As a result, I don't consider the due dates too much of a problem in the course."

    "I would definitely recommend this course! It was fun to engage in and I always looked forward to going to class.",
    "Yes. I benefited from reading such a variety of texts and I enjoyed the discussions and essay topics.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student who wants to take an English class! The class is very interesting and covers a wide range of important and relevant topics.",
    "For a student that does not mind spending a few more hours a week reading and annotating texts, this class is great for learning how to write in a college setting.",
    "Absolutely! The course material was very interesting and the essays were fun to write. I would recommend the course especially to people who like literature and close reading, and who are intrigued by the idea of travel and adventure.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course because I enjoyed the reading and found the writing and revision processes to be greatly rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in perceptions on, benefits from, and experience with travel. Going into the class, I felt unsure at first. While I considered travel an interesting topic to discuss through books, I didn't know the particular route that the course would take in terms of philosophical thinking and real-life Over the course of time, however, I found myself pleased with the balance between personal reflection and real-world travel in the text as I got the chance to shift class discussion from the events of the text to the meaning behind them along with what they reveal about real life and the modern age, all without feeling insecure or offtrack. As a result, I would highly recommend this course to students who'd like to dive deeper into the subject, and explore what their own honest opinions about the necessity of travel."
