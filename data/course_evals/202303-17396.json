In particular, I feel I gained a much better understanding of tone and how to regulate my own tone given the parameters of the assignment and my audience. I was able to hone these skills by way of the variety of writing assignments we were given, which varied in scope and tone and intended audience, and also by reading and reviewing my peers' work and by being reviewed by them in turn. I gained a broader understanding of \"environment\" from the readings we were given, and my understanding of what constitutes \"environmental writing\" was also greatly expanded.",

The readings were all carefully selected to improve our understanding of nature writing, as well as creative essays and journalistic writing more broadly. Professor Burdick's feedback on our assignments and advice given in class all helped me come away with a deeper understanding of how to approach nature writing and journalistic writing about other subjects."

            "comments": [
                "I found that the greatest strength of this course was its basic premise: that we would work on our writing by simply writing as much as possible, and that we would learn from doing as such alongside the other students in the class. Indeed, I thought all of the assignments were well-designed, demanding but also reasonable and very flexible to a variety of interpretations (and I particularly enjoyed how many different directions all of us students took our writing in, which was enabled by this flexibility), and, above all, they were all really fun to do. Although there are three main writing assignments, I also really appreciated the smaller weekly writing tasks, particularly the Letter assignment, which I didn't expect to appreciate as much as I did. I also really enjoyed the readings, particularly the shorter \"microcosm\"-like essays from the earliest sessions of the course from the Norton Book of Nature Writing. I enjoyed the format of our class meetings, which were entirely discussion-oriented. Despite being two hours, these meetings really flew by and I appreciated the insightful comments from my fellow classmates. Lastly, I appreciated how supportive Alan was a professor, particularly during office hours, which he expected us to attend (and this expectation did indeed encourage me to attend).\r\nThe only weakness of the course that I can think of at the moment is that towards the middle and end of the class, it felt like we shifted to studying journalism more particularly and the process of interviewing subjects and writing feature-type pieces. I hadn't really been expecting this, nor is it an area of interest of mine, so I was a little disappointed to leave the other, more essay-like and free-form, types of writing behind. Still, I did learn a lot about this type of writing, and in the end I enjoyed doing that type of writing for the second and third assignments, so I can't complain too much. Perhaps I'd recommend that going forward, only one of these two assignments is based on journalistic-type review, instead of both, or that the students get a choice in the format they choose for one of them.",
                "I liked how the content was shaped by the students and how accessible the professor was",
                "strength: the workload really isn't that high (2.5 major assignments and some short weekly assignments), readings are interesting and useful, peer review can be a bit intimidating, but is really helpful\r\nweakness: can't think of anything",
                "Loved the course, really a breath of fresh air, wished I had a few more smaller assignments in the class so as to keep on top of working the writing muscle.",
                "Strengths: excellent readings, good assignments, phenomenal discussions with Alan. Could have used slightly more structure (better communication of what we'd be discussing when, better timing in classes, etc.)",
                "Strengths: Complete flexibility of topics to write on and research. The professor provides lots of support in choosing a topic and carrying out the research\/interviews.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing!"

In general, I found the class to be broad enough to be accessible and inviting to any student, but I felt encouraged to take my writing in specific directions that made it actually feel very personal and impactful to me. The workload was not unreasonable at all for the amount that I learned and for all that I am taking away from the course. Just know that the grading feels very honest, thoughthat is to say, even when you put in the effort, this class is not an easy A.",

                "Yes, absolutely",
                "Yes! Phenomenal way to read a lot of great writing and improve your own. Excellent structure of feedback on papers. Discussions sometimes left something wanting, but you could always contribute more to them.",
