                "I really enjoyed the lectures, and the weekly problem sets were informative and helpful. I would recommend a greater emphasis on national accounting, since we only covered it in one lecture.",
                "It was a great class! I didnt know much about foreign exchange coming it, this definitely gave me a stronger foundation that I can continue to build upon. Some concepts could be a bit too complex at times, but the problem sets offered good opportunities to practice.",
                "Many of the weaknesses might be due to the virtual environment, which was a struggle. Hard to say for an in-person class.",
                "The theory was interesting, but I wish there was more discussion of contemporary issues.",
                "Content and lectures are very well-organised since they largely follow the textbook. In the Fall 2020 (online\/ virtual) format, the exams were harder than the PSETs because they were take-home\/ open book, which was a little bit of a negative. Otherwise, the course grading structure was well-balanced across participation, PSETs and 3 take-home midterms. But perhaps more clarity on the curve\/ grade distribution along the way would have been great! Professor Fieler is kind and excellent, and always reserves 15 minutes at the end of class for open-ended discussion on everything from the course content to her work ex in M&A to the finance job market",
                "The course does a good job motivating why the material is important. Professor Fieler also brings a lot of knowledge of and experience with the material. That said, the course slides\/lectures were not structured clearly, leaving me confused at times. The course also felt like it moved along quite slowly, and the problem sets were not particularly comprehensive.",
                "Good structure of the course as students learn about various graphical models that can be used to analyze different issues in international finance (exchange rate policy, exchange rate crisis, etc). I especially appreciated the three takehome midterm structure of the course this semester.",
                "The course does a great job of summarizing important concepts in international finance. Even though the course was conducted entirely online, Professor Ana Fieler and the TF are very accommodative to students' requests for feedback and help on the homework. The course could include more collaborative projects that would teach students more quantitative reasoning skills like dissecting economic papers and models related to international finance.",
                "I think the professor should start offering recorded lectures, live (not take-home exams), and practice problems. The take-home exams were challenging (professor said she'd make them extra challenging) and we did not get any practice exams like in previous years. However, the professor is a very nice person. It is just unfortunate that things were online."

                "I thought the course transitioned well to the virtual format. It may have been more engaging to work in breakout rooms or small group discussions so that people could talk more.",
                "I enjoyed the style of testing and problem sets. I wish lectures had been recorded. Especially when discussing some of the more complex topics, the ability to go back and rewatch portions of the lecture would have been valuable.",
                "Live virtual lectures with \"mandatory\" attendance was more engaging as it ensured that students were able to keep up with the material and see their professor and classmates each week. The chat feature on Zoom allowed students to participate who did not feel comfortable speaking in the front of class.",
                "Good that there was a discussion section at the end of each class, and the take-home exams were very well made.\r\n\r\nI would say perhaps office hours could have been at better times, both because they interfered with other classes, and were often at very early times in the morning, even if you were in the US in another time zone.",
                "I thought the more challenging take home exams worked relatively well. They pushed the boundaries of what we learned, but I do think they tested understanding of the material. That said, I think that Professor Fieler's decision to use 1 hour of the 75 minutes for lecture (and the 15 minutes for discussion at the end), to limit focus on a Zoom lecture, was a mistake (although an interesting concept). We essentially never used the last 15 minutes for a productive use, so it often felt like a waste of time.",

In the latter half, there's less math and more discussion of global economies which is a littler harder and reading may be beneficial.",
                "Yes",
                "I would definitely recommend it. Learned much more than in international trade courses about how the global economy works, and it actually helps in understanding different types of policies, rather than the existing status quo, which other econ courses tend not to acknowledge at all. Also really good if you're interested in economic history",
                "I probably would not recommend this course. It does offer some important background in international finance, but in its current form the course isn't structured well to facilitate learning and moves too slowly through the material. If the slides were re-done to provide a more clear outline of the class, and the lectures were restructured to move faster and in a linear manner, I would be more inclined to recommend the class to students interested in international finance.",
                "Yes, would recommend if you're interested in learning about how countries set their exchange rates, how current account imbalances came to be, and how countries respond to exchange rate crises. You will mainly learn various graphical models (like in intro micro) and this is quite accessible while still being challenging.",
                "Yes, indeed. The material is super interesting and real-word related.",
                "Yes, I would recommend the course to students who enjoy macroeconomics and have an interest in international finance policies. The course's workload is not too challenging and you will still learn a lot of new facts about international finance history and future directions.",
                "Yes and no. If you are prepared to take detailed notes in lecture and study, then yes. If not, no. This class isn't recorded so you have to pay attention in lecture. In my other classes, I would simply zone out during lecture and everything was fine as I could watch the recordings."
