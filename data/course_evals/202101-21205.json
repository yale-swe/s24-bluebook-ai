We also read a number of interesting academic articles on hope theory which helped me improve my reading comprehension and analysis.",

We also got a lot of opportunities to talk about our papers one-on-one with individual conferences which was very useful, especially over zoom.",
                "This course had no real weaknesses in my eyes besides the fact that it was virtual. The course had a number of strengths. First off, through in class activities, homework assignments, and writing assignments, I definitely improved my writing. The course readings were also fairly interesting, and they covered a wide-variety of topics. The professor was also very accessible, and this definitely allowed for an easier learning process. Finally, the small discussion format made the class very engaging and allowed me to get to know people in the class.",
                "Strengths: small size of the class (we were only 6 or 7!), very engaging for a zoom seminar (lots of different activities, breakout rooms, peer editing, etc). Another big strength was the topic of the class! It was so interesting to learn about hope from an academic perspective and also from a personal perspective. And of course, Sam was incredible. He clearly cared about all of us as people and as students, and truly made my experience in 114 amazing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it felt like the time allotted to peer-review essay portions was a bit short/rushed. Making the breakouts even 5 minutes longer would be helpful.",
                "The strengths of this course are the seminar style and the way how it is set up to usually let the student read the information/advice for writing, discuss it, and sometimes use the skill. That way the things that are taught in theory can clarified and tested out. I think the course's weaknesses are that the times that we can test out the theoretical ideas and skills are dependent on what we write and revise in our peers' work. When we send in our drafts, we don't get direct, applicable feedback for stuff related to the skills we learned in class. It would be better if the feedback were more tied somehow to the things that we learned in class."
