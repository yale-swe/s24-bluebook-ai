Lispector's short stories are overflowing with material that could be discussed for hours upon hours. This is great introduction to Clarice Lispector if you've never read her before, and it also offers interesting glimpses of Brazilian culture.",

I can't wait to read more of her work. Throughout the semester, I developed substantial knowledge of Clarice Lispector's style, important skills in literary analysis and interpretation, and new insight surrounding the powerful connections between literature and philosophy (which Clarice so articulately, and masterfully, plays with)."

I really loved taking a seminar that had graduate students in it, too. It was a first for me but also very exciting to hear what they had to say about the short stories that we read.\r\n\r\nI can't think of any weaknesses."

I think it's a great opportunity to become more familiar with the work of one of the greatest authors that Brazil has ever known. Clarice is just as fascinating as an author as she was as a person. She is the kind of writer that you can't help but be fascinated by. Every literature enthusiast should read at least some of her works!"
