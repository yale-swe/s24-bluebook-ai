                "It is good to learn high level research skills and build a network of research minded students.",
                "Strengths: the groups were very helpful in bouncing off ideas. Dean Chang's lectures as well as the guest lectures were very engaging and very helpful in contextualizing PSETS. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think more general \"workshops\" in which we went over successful grant proposals would have helped in guidance. I also think that the timing towards the end of the class was a bit stressful as we were in a limbo as to whether we would get summer research funding or not. However, I think this might be something that can be easily fixed by just moving up deadlines a bit.",
                "Strengths: This course will definitely give you a strong background in reading literature. I developed critical thinking skills in terms of evaluating an author's bias, research methodology, and validity of results/conclusions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Interaction with peers was largely limited perhaps as a result of the remote, virtual class format. Weekly psets and presentations could get repetitive and unengaging at times.",
                "Course work was highly intense and as energy dwindled throughout the semester, the class started to get very lifeless. The final proposal is also graded very ambiguously and harshly.",
                "I think one big strength of this class was when Dean Chang gave introductions to the papers beforehand--it really set the stage for reading the papers. One way the course could be improved would be to increase discussion among students who are not group members.",
                "The strength is the people in the class and the dedication of Dean Chang. I was a little bit afraid in the beginning because I had never been exposed to research before, and even though it was not easy, I felt like I learned a lot in this class thanks to Dean Chang's availability and to the collaborative atmosphere of the class. The only weakness is that the class sometimes felt a little bit too long, but I feel like that is more of a weakness only in online learning.",
                "Very good course- class was a bit long but interesting",
                "Strengths: You learn a lot about different science research fields, and we even got some guest speakers, so it was nice to get different perspectives. \r\nWeaknesses: Expectations aren't always clear, but Dean Chang does his best to give a lot of feedback on written work!",
                "The course was great in preparing the students with some knowledge for the PSET.",
                "Strengths: a very well organized course, clear purpose and effective approach to achieving its goals. Psets and papers are all very interesting and selected with purpose. Dean Chang is also amazing as an instructor and as a mentor in general. Weaknesses: none!!",
                "A strength is that it was challenging enough to help me learn a lot. A weakness is that the class had somewhat of a competitive environment that sometimes shifted the focus away from learning and towards comparing your work with that of other students.",
                "This course had an abundance of strengths ranging from a format that allowed us to improve our comprehension skills to intensive grant writing.  The course helped me improve in a variety of ways. With the weekly discussions on the papers and PSETS, any confusion about a topic was cleared up. In addition, the format of the class allowed for collaborative learning. \r\n\r\nThe one thing I wish would be improved would be the timeline of the final grant proposal. While it was wonderful to have more time to write the proposal, at the end of the course there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether funding would be received. Due to the start of research being extremely soon, preparations to be on-campus had to be made before funding confirmation.",
                "Strength: I highly recommend this course if you don't want to apply for a research fellowship! As long as you score above an 85% on your grant proposal, Dean Chang will give you funding! It was so great to find a mentor and a research project that genuinely interests me and practice presenting to my classmates. Additionally, it was very interesting watching guest lecturers and hearing about the experiences that led them to where they are today.\r\n\r\nWeakness: It was sometimes difficult to understand the scientific papers. We started reading two or three papers each week for the pset this semester, so it was even harder to grasp the literature when the concepts were confusing and the literature was all interconnected. Additionally, as we got further into the semester, we stopped following the syllabus, which made it very hard to grasp deadlines for major assignments including our grant proposals and proposal presentations. The first and final drafts of the grant proposals were due in May, which was terrible because it was so late into the semester that if we didn't receive funding from Dean Chang, we would have nothing for the summer because that was past the deadline for everything else you could apply for!"

                "I think presentations over zoom with screensharing really succeeded and were pretty seamless. What could have been improved was having more breakout rooms to discuss with people possibly before or after presentations to debrief and get a better understanding of the presentations.",
                "Different groups lead the discussions on the read papers and break out rooms were used sometimes to promote conversations among the students.

                "The format of the course was fun and engaging. In this semester, instead of giving presentations on the papers read, each group was given a question(or two) in the PSET to answer for this class. This discussion of the PSET allowed for more in-depth analysis of the paper and more collaborative work. Finally, every student had to give a presentation of their proposal; while the presentation was nerve-wracking to make, it was wonderful to see what everyone was doing and to learn more about a large variety of different research fields and approaches.",

Finding my research mentor was one of the things this classed helped incredibly with.",

This course is best suited for people who are truly interested in the science and research itself rather than the social impacts or how the medical system works. If you find the scientific process of hypothesizing and critiquing methodology tiresome, this is not the course for you.",

You learn a lot about reading/understand scientific literature, as well as how to craft a well-thought-out research project and write the subsequent grant proposal. The papers were very interesting to read and class was often interactive and allowed for lots of questions/discussion.",
                "Absolutely. Dean Chang is an amazing professor and cares very deeply about his students. He is available to meet when students need and is dedicated to ensuring that students have the tools they need to succeed in the class and beyond.",
                "Definitely! You must have a strong interest in science, but you DO NOT need to have previous research experience, just some biology background. In the beginning it might feel like a big challenge to be thrown papers on going research to read if you have not done it before, but Dean Chang will be there to clarify the concepts necessary for you to understand it, and he will be very happy to help as much as possible with the problem sets (which are not easy, but very rewarding) and the other assignments. Moreover, I feel like the people in this class are great, and it is a great opportunity not only to develop your skills in STEM, but also to figure out how science at Yale works, since Dean Chang loves to share his experiences here. Make sure you don't have too many classes in your first semester, as this class might not feel like a 0.5 if you don't have previous experience. Anyways, I loved this class, it has been my favorite so far at Yale and I would definitely recommend it!",

                "Yes, you learn a lot, and it's especially helpful if you want an introduction into biology research! You also learn about a lot of different topics, so you should enjoy the class, as long as you have a general interest in biology!",
                "I would recommend this course for students highly interested in STEM, specifically in biology. Otherwise, I would say that this course will not be for you.",
                "Yes!! Absolutely take this class if you would like to gain a better understanding of science in the context of academia and would like to gain a strong foundation on how papers are structured. Dean Chang also cares so much about his students and shares so much wisdom about things outside of the classroom too, like career advice and funny stories in general, so absolutely take this class if you can!!",
                "I would only recommend this if they are looking for a rigorous course that will greatly improve their scientific research skills. It was a very helpful and interesting course.",

                "I would recommend this class if you are into science and want to conduct research. If you apply and get into the course, definitely take it! The class was very difficult and the professor could be frustrating at times, but overall this course was incredible. Additionally, since most people in this class are very high achieving it could feel very intimidating at times, but being in class made me much more confident in my scientific abilities."
