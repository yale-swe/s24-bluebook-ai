                "Strengths--Marta is one of the best and most dedicated professors at Yale. Weaknesses--basically everything else. This is a course that was passed down to Marta, and you can kind of tell that this is fundamentally a pretty flawed class. \"World cinema\" as a concept is one that can really only be critiqued, which we did do in the class, but not nearly enough. I wish we had continued to come back to the concept as one to consider and think about. One of the reasons \"world cinema\" is a flawed concept is because how can one teach the entire world? This is the largest problem with the course--because nobody in the class, including the professor, is actually an expert in say, Indonesian documentary, the class basically became each student (of which there were 21 in a seminar) latching on to other concepts they were familiar with, which of course other students were not equally familiar with.",
                "Selection of films is wonderful, seminar style facilitates good discussion. Because it covers such a broad range of films, it can sometimes feel like it lacks depth in certain topics, but the breadth and diversity of films makes up for that",
                "At the beginning of the course, more information could be given for how to approach film analysis, especially if it's from an unfamiliar context.",
                "Strengths: Interesting films, good class analysis and discussion, great instruction. Loved the talks\r\n\r\nOnly weakness I would say is that it felt like this class was more suited to people who had prior knowledge in film analysis, world politics/history, and/or theory.",
                "I do think this is a super difficult course to teach because of how many regional cinemas are discussed, but I think there could have been more of a focus on the concept of world cinema generally and then more of a deep dive into a couple regions.",
                "I really enjoyed the selection of films and the class discussions. This class was incredibly stimulating and engaging. I would not change anything.",
                "The class felt unapproachable at times because of the level of discussion and the underlying assumptions of knowledge. While some classes were a blast, some entered a realm that left it hard for most of the class to participate. Simple explanations of concepts could have been helpful and not time consuming.",
                "Strengths: \r\nincredibly well organized while being flexible for its students\r\nwell-led discussions\r\nthe people teaching the class just really know what they are talking about\r\nwell-facilitated office hours\r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\nthis class should be a lecture, as it usually is. The people in the course were honestly insufferable in terms of how much they tried to monopolize the conversation with discourse of philosophers many people hadn't read. Additionally, a lot of the conversations were centered around the social justice readings of films. Though this is important, I really don't think that we need to scorn a film made 60 years ago for not being as culturally appropriate as it would be if it were made today. Marta is a genius and should be leading the discourse and development of the course."

I probably would recommend other film classes to a non-film major too. It became a confusing jumble of concepts, mostly because of other students adding things to the conversation, during almost every class. I think there were also some non-film majors who didn't seem to take the class very seriously. But there is nothing fundamentally unpleasant about the class that would stop me from recommending this class.",
                "Absolutely. Prof Figlerowicz is an amazing teacher and a kind and caring person. The content is engaging and interesting, even (perhaps especially) if you are not a film major. You will learn a lot, and everyone in the class will have a different perspective to offer about the films. The assignments and reading responses are fun and the selection of films is top notch.",
                "Yes, the professor is amazing and you get to engage with such a breadth of film.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student that is interested in learning about film in general. This course will not only expand your film language, but it will also expose you to cinema cultures that you likely would not have otherwise given a chance.",
                "Yes! Anyone should take this course, whether you are a film major or not. It informed my view about the world (and what we mean when we say 'world'). I appreciated all the times the class pushed me out of my comfort zone. I can also say that, while Marta and Katie were fantastic, I learned just as much from my fellow students.",
