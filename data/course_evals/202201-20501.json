It is clear to me that every student in the class improved tremendously in all modalities (listening, speaking, writing, reading). The goal of the class was refining and sharpening all of the skills that we have developed over the past few years of studying Russian. This semester there was a strong focus on vocabulary building / improving vocabulary, and all of our hard work paid off! I was very inspired by the students in the class who have only studied Russian a couple of years, because at the end of this course I noticed incredible improvements in them. They are speaking so much now! If you take this course, you will improve your Russian so much.",

It is everything a language course should be. The professor is both an instructor, as well as like a mother to her students. She looks after us all. The amount of work and detail that the professor puts into developing the curriculum is soooo massively appreciated. She spends so much time developing her courses. Any Russian class with Doctor Dolgova and you know that the course is going to be amazing.",

                "I would! It is great to be in a class where students are passionate about learning the language and are learning it for different reasons. People genuinely want to learn and it isn't just to fulfill a language requirement.",
                "Yes, this course is a must if you are serious about learning Russian. If you are in your final year, this is the perfect course with which to end your many years of studying Russian. It is Fourth-Year Russian at Yale! This is often a student's last chance to study Russian (unless they continue studying in graduate school, or study abroad). If you study Russian, then do not leave Yale without taking this course, you will be missing out on so much! There is just no professor like Doctor Dolgova, and the curriculum / courses that she makes are like art. Like in the Fall semester of Fourth-Year Russian, you will watch many beautiful and brilliant movies, you will read articles, discuss a variety of interesting and relevant topics that really do help students master the concepts they've learned over the years. You will learn so much. The atmosphere of the class is also very conducive to learning. It is really not a lot of work, but when you are immersed in a language like this that is not your native language it can feel like a lot. It is not a lot! It is all done in a low stakes environment where all students are measured only against themselves. Students are encouraged and made to feel welcomed. You will feel at home. I definitely felt at home. Take the class, it is perfect!",
                "DEFINITELY!! If youre trying to continue L5 level classes take this before the L5 literature classes because it solidifies you knowledge of Russian grammar and gives you an entire year of more practice.",
                "Yes, if they want to learn Russian.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn Russian!",
                "Yes! This is a great way to take your Russian up a notch by learning sophisticated grammar and engaging in frequent conversation practices."
