                "I gained a very good knowledge on the history and foundation of the carceral system in the United States and the inequalities that led to mass incarceration and the issues that still permeate the system and society.",
                "Learned about the history of prisons, racial criminalization, policing, and mass incarceration. Also engaged extensively with prison abolitionist theories, strengthening my conviction in the desirability of a world without prisons.",
                "I learned how to quickly analyze a lot of heavy material, learned the different perspectives of the modern carceral system, and was able to develop my own perspectives and opinions on the matter.",
                "I improved my research skills by taking this course.",
                "History of mass incarceration as related to racial discrimination and slavery.",
                "How to write a historical research paper.",
                "Did a ton of cool reading on the history of imprisonment, introduced to amazing scholars. Realized just how large and varied the carceral state is.",
                "I gained valuable writing experience; I had never written a 12-page paper before, and I was really intimidated. But my TA and the multiple checkpoint assignments (dates for finding sources, outlines, etc.) made it much less stressful than I could have been. I also learned how to evaluate historical material in a nuanced way, and I learned a lot about things I had never thought about. This class truly made me see the American policing and incarceration system differently, as someone who was already engaged in criminal justice.",
                "I learned about the historical development of mass incarceration, especially the different ways in which the law was weaponized to target Black people. I gained insight on the expansive ways that carceral state operates to criminalize, surveil, and discipline.",
                "I thought this lecture was a fantastic course. Not only did I learn a lot about the history of mass incarceration and its impacts on the present day, but Professor Hinton continually emphasized the way historical thinking could contribute to larger movements over modern-day problems. She consistently brought in guest speakers from other fields to show how historical research was part of a greater advocacy movement toward abolition, which I found incredibly inspiring. Moreover, the course was well-structured, and the TAs were incredibly helpful in guiding us through the assignments throughout the term.",
                "I learned a lot about the philosophy and theory behind the prison industrial complex  it goes beyond racism and prejudice. Social control drives the system, and we learn how and why it works.",
                "I gained a lot of insight into the history of mass incarceration in the United States and the early origins of policing. I also improved my analytical and writing skills by working through the midterm and final papers.",
                "I learned everything I needed to know about mass incarceration."

                "I think this course was perfectly taught.",
                "Strengths are that the material is very interesting and the course is pretty well paced. A weakness is that there is a sometimes unmanageable reading load.",
                "Strengths: Prof Hinton is very knowledgeable, we had some great guest speakers. Shoutout to my TF Juan, he's the best!\r\nWeakness: Isn't very well-structured, sometimes felt a little bit repetitive and just citing statistics in lectures.",
                "Strengths: breadth and depth, great topic and good focus on historical writing \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could maybe be paced better?",
                "Strengths- amazing and engaging lectures, accessible and warm professor, truly interesting material, wonderful TAs\r\nWeaknesses- quantity of readings made it difficult to truly engage with the material sometimes; it was easy to get behind, even as someone who usually assigns myself ~30 pages of readings per class every day in order to complete all of them. After getting behind, it becomes easy to feel discouraged and stay behind.",
                "The strengths are the very stimulating readings and discussion sections. Students are very engaged with the pieces we read and produce very generative discussions and theorizing. A weakness is that the amount of reading assigned is overwhelming and cuts into your ability to deeply engage the readings like I wouldve like.",
                "The strengths of this course were the fantastic teaching team and the sheer diversity of resources on the syllabus. Moreover, the number of guest speakers that visited the class was incredibly helpful for understanding how the history of mass incarceration connects to modern advocacy. The weakness of this course, however, was that there was sometimes too much material to realistically read in a week, so my classmates and I often had to prioritize what to read at the expense of other material on the syllabus. I think this amount of reading somewhat detracted from our overall engagement with the sources.",
                "I would say a huge strength of the course is definitely Professor Hinton and the TFs. They are incredibly passionate about the content and the students' learning and well-being. It is clear from their teaching that it is something they care about and are willing to impart their knowledge on us.",

                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Especially if that student wants a new perspective on the abolition of the prison system. You will learn about the history of the carceral system and how it mimics slavery in some ways, you will learn the foundational philosophies of prison, study first hand accounts from Angela Davis, Malcom X, and other scholars, and learn the ways in which it still affects us today in modern prisons, immigration detention, and increased surveillance of minority youth.",
                "Yes; interesting material and good teaching.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. A very standard and well-supported history and writing class.",
                "I would recommend because you learn so much about mass incarceration and abolition.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Hinton is a fantastic lecturer, and the teaching team is incredibly helpful throughout the semester. I always received clear feedback on my essay assignments, which I think really improved my writing over the term. You should definitely take this course before you graduate!",
                "Absolutely. Hinton is one of the best lecturers at Yale  she is engaging and every lecture is jam packed with knowledge and passion. She's wonderful to learn from and also cares very much about her students and their learning!",
                "Yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student for a variety of reasons. Mainly, the topics discussed in this course are incredibly important for us to know more about to be able to change how things are in this country. It is a history that has been obscured to us for far too long and I think Professor Hinton does an amazing job in teaching us about the history of policing and how identity plays into it. Another reason to take this course is because of the amazing individuals that teach it, whether it is Professor Hinton or the TFs, they are amazing people with distinct passions and they are always more than willing to talk to students and impart their knowledge.",
