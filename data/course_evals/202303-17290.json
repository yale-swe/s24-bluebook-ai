Eased into the material very well, but later allows for an incredible interwoven network of themes and information that we can use to argue during case studies, tabletop exercises, and outside the course as well."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths - it goes into a lot of depth and the order which you learn things is well organized. There are assignments spread out over lots of areas - eg case studies, two papers & a rewrite, final, and tabletop exercises, which means you are able to work on your grade and not have it be defined by any one assignment. Weaknesses - no clarity on the grading at the beginning of the semester, and was harder to know where you stand since there are so many grad students. The multitude of assignments meant a high workload that wasn't necessarily to learning more. The lectures could sometimes be dry and there was not often material discussed that wasn't written on the slides. There was a sample exam provided but no answers and it was frustrating sometimes to have the group discussion exercises left up to randomization.",
                "The course was absolutely incredible, allowing for such inn depth information and pursuing own interests through paper topics and weekly coffee chats. The professor and TAs worked together really well to make the material accessible to all (writing as an undergrad, while the overwhelming majority of students were graduate students, and even with experience working at the Fed)."
