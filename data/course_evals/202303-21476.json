                "First, I was exposed to a nice collection of Greek tragedies, most of which were entirely new to me. I got a lot of insight into the big tragedians, the nature of tragedy, and how to write literary analysis for plays.",
                "A dive into one of the most important traditions in the Western literary (and continental philosophy cannon). Greek tragedy is so influential in poetry, drama, philosophy (from Hegel, Nietzsche, to Lacan, Heidegger), and it can be read much more deeply than what DS or a quick survey might have offered you. I became a much better exegete.",
                "Deep read through several Greek tragedies. Really got to know the Greek tragedians and ancient Athenian history better, as well as attitudes toward tragedy and how to read a tragedy.",
                "A great survey of classic Greek plays. I definitely acquired a strong base knowledge of the works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides that I had not interacted with before.",
                "The coursework includes a variety of Greek Tragedies, a Comedy, Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, and Plato's Symposium. We discussed the ontological and political values in each Tragedy as well as the similarities and differences between the Tragedians and their separate attitude toward Greek society. \r\nThe course especially furthered my understanding of the relationship between philosophy and literature.",
                "I became a much better writer through practice, read some beautiful tragedy, and gained insight into an art that has tragically been lost in modern times. I want to read more tragedy after this class because I found it rich in its ethical lessons, in the way it moves me emotionally, and in the way it shapes my ethical disposition.",
                "Read a selection of tragedies, and considered the reception of tragedy in comedy and philosophy. Learned how to read tragedies closely and to discuss these texts as works of political theory.",
                "Learned close reading, interpretation of Ancient Greek plays, and a better understanding of the relationship between philosophy and poetry in antiquity",
                "Beyond the content---reading and discussing Greek tragedy and comedy---this class was an intellectual gauntlet. Was constantly pushed to think of new interpretations, consult secondary literature, sift through the texts for evidence, prepare strong defenses of my interpretations and arguments against others'. Student quality in the seminar was otherworldly. Like the best humanities classes, you got the sense that everyone could end up being a wildly successful lawyer---yet, for the moment, we were all here, talking about a bunch of plays, trying to wrench meaning out of them. People would twist the texts this way and that with their interpretations. Everyone, most of all Professor Schillinger, was such a compelling speaker, reader, and writer that I'd often leave seminar more confused about a text's meaning than I had been when I came in. But confused in a more profound way. It's a brilliant course."

            "comments": [
                "S: I love the workload, one play a week. It gives you a chance to actually dive into the story, and is very manageable. The professor was very knowledgable and offered great insight. He was always well prepared and I respect his perspective a lot. He also incorporated some other works (Aristotle, Nietzsche, Plato), that helped round out the course. \r\n\r\nW: I would have appreciated more class time devoted to some of the literary structure and poetry of the plays. We certainly focused on the plot, but I think I would have gained from learning more about the different meters in the poetry, including reading some of the original greek to see exactly what we were talking about. Also, I would have liked to watch more plays or see one in person.",
                "The syllabus is fabulous. Dan Schillinger is also fabulous. Discussions were generally very strong because the readings were assigned really perfectly. The discussion questions / introductions at the beginning of seminar from Prof. Schillinger were also terrific for framing discussion. The writing assignments were a particularly strong part of the course, as were office hours accessibility for them. I did some of my best work at Yale in writing for this class, and I think it was because the prompts (and OH) helped spark my intellectual creativity in a way that got me really excited about the work.",
                "Very strong discussions that moved along quickly and opened new insight into the tragedy. Great questions to consider. \r\nWeaknesses: never quite answered some of the big questions satisfactorily. What is the purpose of tragedy? Does it have a political purpose? Feel like there were a lot of answers but no big summary takeaway.",
                "Strengths: Professor Daniel Schillinger. He is incredibly dedicated to his preparation for class and prioritizes class engagement.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Only one seminar per week. Would have liked to meet twice since discussions were so engaging on each text! We often ran out of time at the end.",
                "Strengths: the course fosters discussion very well. There were no serious weaknesses I could think of.",
                "Strengths: insightful comments by the professor, thought-provoking discussions, good pacing for the readings, all of the texts were wonderful \r\nImprovements: although I loved reading one (usually) tragedy per week, it would've been great to read an interpretive piece (e.g., by Foucault, Sartre, Arendt) alongside it, since these thinkers were often mentioned but we did not read their actual views for class; perhaps it could be structured to meet twice a week, with the first class devoted to close-reading the tragedy and the second class to discussing the tragedy together with the interpretive piece. It would have been interesting to also supplement the readings with more historical context.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Schillinger came to every course well prepared and was very open to discussion. He also gave high-quality feedback on essays. Weaknesses: None that I can think of at the moment.",
                "Strengths: Some of the best students and one of the best Professors at Yale. And some of the most haunting, horrifying, perplexingly beautiful pieces of literature ever written. \r\nWeaknesses: I think the Nietzsche went over everyone's head. A good primer on Thucydides and Athens' imperial period would be useful historical context to have included. I'm not a fan of the once-a-week seminar format, but others may disagree."

                "I would highly recommend this class, especially for those who haven't read Greek tragedies. As someone who didn't do DS, many of what we studied was brand new to me, and I loved it. The plays really are entertaining, and the professor is great at exploring them. \r\n\r\nI would say he is a fair grader, but it's probably tougher than what you might be used to. I think you have to get used to the kind of essay/work he's looking for. That being said, he is very accessible and wanting to talk through ideas. He cares very much about the content of your ideas!",
                "Yes, I definitely would recommend this course, especially with Professor Schillinger. Greek tragedy is amazing, and the body of secondary literature on it is fascinating as well -- leaving you so many great directions to go.",
                "Recommend if you are truly interested in reading Greek tragedies like its a lit class. Not so much if you are into politics (as this is quite different).",
                "Yes. This course is excellent for even those with little experience in the classics. I would definitely encourage those unable to take DS to take this course and work on their textual analysis skills.",
                "Yes, Greek Tragedy is not niche literature but really foundational to modern drama, philosophy, and literary criticism. It is reflective of Greek and Modern values and tensions in and beyond politics. The course is well taught with a very manageable workload.",
                "Absolutely. Even for students who do not have a humanities background, more students should be reading tragedy, especially those with little interaction with emotion, so as to learn how their spirited souls can be properly directed towards living an ethical life. The readings and the discussion environment of this class are all conducive to this kind of learning.",
                "Yes. Tragedies are inherently fascinating to read, and the course had a perfect workload so that you could really dive into the text for each week. The discussions were well-facilitated and often challenged my initial readings of the texts, giving me new tools to think about tragedy.",
                "Certainly! It was a treat to learn about the ancient rivalry between philosophy and poetry under the guidance of Prof. Schillinger. Loved the class. Highly, highly recommend.",
                "Yes. Best class I've ever taken. Not a free or easy A at all, but you can learn so much from reading and struggling with the Attic tragedies. What are they trying to say? What makes tragedy haunting, memorable, even beautiful? Were the Tragedians making arguments at all, or was their work all just a gory form of entertainment? Art is powerful because we don't, and perhaps can't, fully understand why it works on us. But trying to do that, through literary analysis, is an incredibly challenging and rewarding use of your intellectual energy. And there's no one better to do it with than Professor Schillinger.",
                "Take any class with Schillinger that you can. He cares a lot about his classes and students, and his syllabi are well chosen.",
                "Any student who is interested in really pulling out the personal relevance of the Greek tragedies, and in understanding their own sense of politics through thinking about justice, democracy, persuasion (or is it propaganda?) and education should absolutely try to take this course. I have taken several other seminars on Greek tragedy at Yale, generally from far more established professors, and there is no substitute for this one."
