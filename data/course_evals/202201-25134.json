Prof. van Dijk and Antonio (the TF) were both responsive with feedback about assignments. No weaknesses as far as I could see!",
                "I think this course is exciting because it not only encourages us to go deep in one selected topic that we are interested, but also give us opportunities to learn from others' presentation. And I believe it would be better if the assignment discriptions can be more detailed.",
                "As someone with previous ML research experience, the course provided a good way for me to explore my existing interests in ML. However, for someone who is entirely new to this topic, I could see how the free-form structure of the course could feel confusing.",

This course serves great as a seminar-style class where you can work on topics you're interested in, but I can see how it might be intimidating to someone with no prior experience in ML. (For those with prior experience, it's great because there's no rehash of the same topics you learn in other AI electives  you get to dive right in to the new research topics!)",
