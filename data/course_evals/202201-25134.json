                "This course is a great seminar-style class for students experienced with machine learning, where you get to showcase your research interests (you get to select the topic you present on and do you projects on) and learn about new topics from other students and guest lecturers. Prof. van Dijk and Antonio (the TF) were both responsive with feedback about assignments. No weaknesses as far as I could see!",
                "I think this course is exciting because it not only encourages us to go deep in one selected topic that we are interested, but also give us opportunities to learn from others' presentation. And I believe it would be better if the assignment discriptions can be more detailed.",
                "As someone with previous ML research experience, the course provided a good way for me to explore my existing interests in ML. However, for someone who is entirely new to this topic, I could see how the free-form structure of the course could feel confusing.",
                "More background around each of the models and applications presented (including of student presentations and projects)",
                "weakness: some guest speakers and students weren't that engaging when they present. strengths: very diverse ideas presented and get to work on what we are interested in"

This course serves great as a seminar-style class where you can work on topics you're interested in, but I can see how it might be intimidating to someone with no prior experience in ML. (For those with prior experience, it's great because there's no rehash of the same topics you learn in other AI electives  you get to dive right in to the new research topics!)",
