                "Strengths: such an amazing course that I absolutely love. I loved that it was a small seminar and that I could interact and have discussions with my peers. I got to know them and we would build on what we were each saying. Also, the selection of books was amazing and I could tell Professor Markovits but a lot of time thinking about the precise order to read the books in. Honestly, it make for a delightful experience comparing each novel to the one before and uncovering the ways in which the novels speak to each other through being bildungsromon novels.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. I thought Professor Markovits was very good at leading our seminar discussions, especially considering that all of the class took place on zoom. The readings were interesting, too. I appreciated that we were able to read texts both from England itself and from the colonies. Honestly, I don't really have any complaints.",
                "Professor Markovits is wonderful! She is incredibly smart and really cares about her students. There are many opportunities for students to receive feedback. This course is well-organized and the expectations are clear. There is a lot of reading in this course, but the novels are enjoyable. If you are interested in thinking about how growing up is shown in literature, definitely take this course!!",
                "There was a lot of reading piled towards the beginning and not as much at the end. It could have been spread out a bit more! Otherwise, it was a great class and we read a good combination of books.",
                "There is a LOT of reading assigned, and especially the last book we read felt pointless, as we already had to have a prospectus for the final paper submitted before we started it. I also felt like Markovits was a hard grader. I enjoyed reading the primary texts much more than the critical essays, but you can't get around those in an English class. Also, we had to have a draft of our final paper submitted on the Monday after Thanksgiving break, which caused some pain (and bewildered questioning from parents) during what was supposed to be break. That said, the discussion was always illuminating, the primary texts were mostly fantastic, and Markovits is one of the most engaging and thoughtful professors I've had during Zoom-college yet.",
                "Strengths: Great books for the most part, fantastic professor who was a great discussion leader and also wonderful to talk to. Good amount of assignments, flexibility in topic choices for assignments\r\nWeaknesses: Not too much interaction with peers, but that probably was influenced but the Zoom format, too.",
                "This course was by far the best virtual discussion that I experienced this semester. The use of breakout rooms and the small class size really allowed all of the students to engage with the works together. The use of the discussion board and the requirement to post before class always meant that we had a jumping off point at the beginning of the conversation and were able to recognize our classmates for their contributions. While there is a lot of reading, all of the texts were really great and I think the sheer breadth of reading was a strength when it came time to write essays."

The canvas discussion posts are sort of like that, but not really as fun.",

                "YES YES YES! I loved this course, just absolutely loved it. Not only are the book selections amazing but Professor Markovits has a way of pushing you to think about the novels in ways you never thought to before. The seminar is great because you get to actively discuss the novels and what your perspective is. It is truly amazing how two people can read the same book and get largely different takes on it. So, for this reason, I learned just as much from the Professor as I did from my peers. Also, another reason I loved this course is that it is so welcoming to non-english\/literature majors. This was one of my first literature classes and I never felt out of place! Professor Markovits is extremely welcoming and fosters a great environment for you to talk about your ideas about a book or a passage, even if they are not fully fleshed out yet or you are just thinking on the spot. I can honestly say this is one of my favorite classes at Yale and I feel that students should really consider taking it. In my opinion, for non-english\/literature majors, it allows you to get that well-rounded liberal arts education that Yale offers.",
                "Yes. To be honest, I hadn't had that much experience with Victorian literature before taking this class, and I wasn't sure it would be for me. But I found both the readings and the discussions to be very rewarding! Now, I find myself really wanting to explore more texts from this era.",
                "Yes!! This course is a Yale gem.",
                "I would!",
                "Just beware that there is a lot of reading that you have to stay on top of. Additionally, I found out I don't enjoy reading critical essays that much in this course, so if you feel the same way I might recommend a class with more focus on the primary texts and close-reading rather secondary essays.",
                "Yes! I loved this course, and Professor Markovits made each seminar engaging and intellectually fulfilling! I learned so much!",
                "Yes!!!! Wonderful books to read, and your writing will improve a lot if you take advantage of Prof. Markovits's offer to read drafts in advanceshe gives really thorough comments that make you a better writer and thinker.",
                "Absolutely, especially for an English major. This was the best course I have taken at Yale so far and really engaged with the type of literature I am most passionate about. You get to knock some classic books off your to-read list and the two required essays have the potential to be really fun if you meet with your professor and pay attention to discussion."
