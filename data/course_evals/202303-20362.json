                "great course overall!",
                "I thought weekly homework was reasonable length so we could review the week's material, but not take too long.",
                "The strengths of the class were the in-class problems and examples to help us understand. The course focused on both the math and the theory behind the math to create a good understanding of the topics. The weakness of the course was that the quantum derivations were very math-heavy and hard to understand. This could be improved by going through the derivations more slowly and explaining each step in greater detail.",
                "The course grading and exams were extremely fair. The instructor makes fairness a priority. I like that.\r\n\r\nThe course could be made more challenging. The homework was very easy, including the optional problems, and I felt that harder problems would have helped me learn more.",
