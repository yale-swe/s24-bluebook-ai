                "great course overall!",
                "I thought weekly homework was reasonable length so we could review the week's material, but not take too long.",
                "The strengths of the class were the in-class problems and examples to help us understand. The course focused on both the math and the theory behind the math to create a good understanding of the topics. The weakness of the course was that the quantum derivations were very math-heavy and hard to understand. This could be improved by going through the derivations more slowly and explaining each step in greater detail.",
                "The course grading and exams were extremely fair. The instructor makes fairness a priority. I like that.\r\n\r\nThe course could be made more challenging. The homework was very easy, including the optional problems, and I felt that harder problems would have helped me learn more.",

                "Yes! This is a great follow-up to physical chemistry II. The concepts in 466 are similar to those in CHEM 332, and it's really useful to see them taught from another professor. It helps you understand the concepts and math in a new way.",
                "Well structured and clearly explained",
                "yes, if you want to learn about quantum mechanics! the math isn't too bad at all. if you're not interested in the material at least a little it will be hard to follow along.",

                "I would recommend this course because it provides a good foundation to understand quantum mechanics.",
                "Yes, it was well structured and clear",
