The writers room format in the second half of the semester is very helpful for hearing how your screenplay actually sounds, getting external feedback, and seeing what you need to rewrite. You're pretty much on your own for the development and writing of the screenplay, as in a nonacademic context, which is great.",

There could be more variety in the lesson plans: not just watching and discussing films the first half then work shopping the second half. Maybe there could be an in class pitch, or a \"present your favorite scene\" kind of assignmnet.",
                "Strengths: The workload is very fair, Prof. Lapadula is an amazing resource and always provides helpful feedback. He cares for each student immensely and is invested in their success. \r\nWeaknesses: The workload is not spread out between the semester. There will be weeks with very little work and then the week when your first draft is due it gets very busy.",
                "The first half of the term was spent really watching clips of films, but I wish we could have spent more time reading short scripts and analyzing them in class or doing more exercises to prepare us for the midterm folder.",
                "The workshop portion of this class is its greatest strength. It fosters a collaborative environment and sense of community with the class and you learn a lot from the stories you read each week. Professor Lapadula is very knowledgeable and passionate, but the workload for the midterm is heavy and you have to be proactive in starting it early especially sine you don't have set deadlines for assignments from the beginning.",
                "Strength - Create really comfortable environment to share your writing with peers and give feedback. Mid-term folder is a great assignment.; Weakness - first half of the course (before we start reading student's drafts) is a bit unstructured. Maybe we could read some short film scripts and evaluate or even watch short films.",
                "More deadlines leading up to the midterm folder so that it didn't feel so overwhelming when the duedate was all at once",
                "Strengths: I liked that I could write about any story; the freedom was great. It was also really cool to meet people in the film industry come in as guest speakers, especially the screenwriter agents.\r\nWeaknesses: I feel that more collaboration could be facilitated outside of classes. So much of the collaboration outside of classes are student-run and as many students have different, busy schedules it was difficult to schedule the weekly meetings that the course recommended."

                "I might recommend this course to another student as a way to expose them to screenwriting if I know that they have a strong motivation in screenwriting itself. As a simple beginner course I don't think it's necessarily comprehensive enough for someone who is not self-motivated since most of the learning comes independently.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Lapadula is a wonderful instructor who's eager to help students in any way he can. This is a great course to break into the world of screenwriting. The design of the course allows you to create a community with your classmates and fosters learning and growth."
