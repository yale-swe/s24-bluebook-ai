                "Too much to count, honestly. Reviewing for the final exam made me realize how much dense information we covered in a very short time frame it seems like. See syllabus for what I would consider an accurate depiction of what was actually covered. Knowledge - Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, learning how to set up physics problems in general! Skills - LaTeX, searching for help online. Insights - the \"intensive major\" lives up to its name.",
                "A lot, this was a great mechanics course, I feel like in addition to the material the methods of analyzing equilibria, thinking about infinitesimals, and the intuition for rotational motion were all helpful.",
                "This course is an extensive treatment of classical mechanics. We reviewed Newtonian methods before spending the majority of the remainder of the semester developing Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods, i.e., looking at mechanics with a focus on energy and action. We also learnt about special relativity using linear algebra, which I appreciated (although it would be difficult to follow with a linear algebra background, which almost everyone should have by this point).",

At the end we briefly previewed expanding Lagrangian ideas to understand more advanced areas of physics.",

Additionally, students were tasked with learning Mathematica and related software to approach computational problems, culminating in a problem set on chaos theory.",
                "This was the first time since starting physics in high school that I felt I made a huge jump up in my physics knowledge.

It taught me discipline, to say the least!",

                "Lecture is fairly disconnected from homeworksmost of lecture is spent deriving formulae that are used in class.",
                "Material was exactly what you'd expect, which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned.\r\nProblem sets too often did not provide any insight into the material. Too much algebra and not enough cleverness required.",
                "The strength of the course is the amount of content that it covers. We did most of the chapters in John R. Taylor's Classical Mechanics and I felt like I learned quite a bit. However we spent too much time at the beginning going through chapters 1-5, which were mostly review from physics 180/200/260, and therefore rushed near the end. I would have liked it if we had spent less time on the review and more time covering the chapters after 5.",
                "Strengths were Professor Poland's lectures and the homework; the LaTeX extra credit and the extra credit problems after the midterm were very helpful. Tests were difficult but fair; grading was also fair, though grading of homework was a bit slow.",
                "This course is very interesting in that it provides powerful tools to mathematically deconstruct complex physical behaviors. It also delves into very interesting topics, including chaos and relativity.",
                "course and lecture is a little too math-heavy--  yes physics is inherently math heavy but i feel like i didnt gain a lot of the conceptual aspects",
                "This is a great course for anyone wanting a rigorous treatment of mechanics beyond high school level. Prof. Poland follows the book closely, which is very helpful.\r\n\r\nI think the structure of the course is well as it is, but it is true that I would have preferred to not have spent so long on Newtonian mechanics at the start of the course. I am sure it was revision for almost everyone in the class, and if we had spent less time on it, then we could have spent more time on relativity (which I feel confused quite a few people in the class), or other advanced and more interesting topics. I would like the psets to have been graded quicker, as I went into the midterm only having received feedback of 2/6 psets, and to the final having recieved 7/11.",
                "Strengths: Professor was very engaging with the class, office hours were always helpful for PSETs or questions in general. Grading was very generous. Classes are easy to follow, if unclear, can refer back to the textbook which provides pretty good examples and explanations. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: PSETs can be graded much faster. Even after exams, the last 3 PSETs were still ungraded which made studying for the final more difficult. However, answers to the PSETs are released right after the deadline.",
                "Strengths: Classical Mechanics by John R. Taylor was good -- easy to follow and comprehensive\r\nWeaknesses: We cover a lot of material very quickly. Thus, the students are expected to follow the mathematical gibberish that is written on the board in the span of 5 seconds before we move to a different topic. Often, I questioned whether I was in a math or a physics class. Very little theory was covered even when prompted by students. I regret going to every lecture -- I would benefited more if I had just read the book, which I ended up having to do anyway. The exams were difficult with problems that were unlike any of the PSet problems and unless you have a very strong math background, you would have a difficult time succeeding in them. On top of that, they were not checked until at least 3 weeks later, which meant that students did not know how they should improve. There was only one midterm, which means there a lot riding on it but it was during class so the time was not even close to enough for how hard it was. I wasted over three days on studying for it but it did not seem to help at all. \r\nImprovements: Cover fewer topics. Please. We are not learning anything by moving to a new chapter every week. Give us time to understand. Also, remember, this a physics class; we are physics majors because we like physics. I think we would appreciate some physics sprinkled in among all the math. \r\nAdd another midterm.",
                "Strengths: The textbook used (John R Taylor) was comprehensive and clear. \r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were not worth going to due to them being effectively the same as the textbook with no clarification. The homework assignments were really long, unclear and the Professors and TAs office hours did not make them more manageable. The exams were unfair  very few homework-like problems appeared, and instead the midterm and final were semi-random problems tangential to the material we were prepared for. Practice exams were available, but were also not comparable to the actual assessment. A good grade in this course is an act of Fate as opposed to a students achievement, unless said student is a math major as opposed to a physics major, in which case their experience may be different. \r\nImprovements: Cover less material to enable students to engage with it at a deeper level. Make the exams more in line with the rest of the course. Cover the physics from the point of view of physics, instead of explaining it with abstract mathematical concepts.",
                "Strengths: Genuinely interesting information. The psets kicked my butt but forced me to learn to really understand. I have a love-hate relationship because I very much enjoy physics but I struggle to pick it up as quickly as the students who came from the advanced physics intro sequence, and I think many 200/180 students felt this sense of inferiority, a concern that was not assuaged by the professor.\r\nWeaknesses: Information was covered very quickly and it was not always clear what level of mathematical know-how was required to successfully complete the psets. There was often a more math-y way to do the problems and a less math-y way which was occasionally still accepted, but during lecture it was always the heavy math version. It would have been beneficial to make clear what was the intended takeaways from each lecture and what was more fluff/mathematical proof background info.",
                "I think this was a good course, my only comment would be PSET grading took very long and it was hard to get feedback to improve upon.",
                "Prof. Poland effectively delivered the content in lectures, which were engaging (although, the Watson Center doesn't have the best classrooms!). I feel like I learnt a significant amount over the last semester which is a credit to his teaching abilities and deep knowledge of the subject material - I cannot recall him not being able to answer a question. Beware the PSets - they will take you a significant amount of time, so don't leave them until the last day! Prof. Poland's notes were extensive, but sometimes difficult to follow.",
                "A major strength is Professor Poland's enthusiasm for the class. You can tell he truly loves the material and teaches it well as a result. The only thing that couple be improved would potentially be a little more emphasis on teaching notation, as it can be introduced all of a sudden and not explained.",
                "Course was fun and interesting to me, but many of the students seemed to have already seen the material and they might disagree. Professor Poland also taught pretty much out of the textbook, which was great for exam studying but also made attendance questionable.",
                "Strengths: Material toward the end of the course (after the midterm) is fascinating. Poland is a great instructor--you can tell he enjoys physics and sharing physics with us.\r\nWeaknesses: Problem sets are challenging and were often not the best preparation for exams. Expect to spend an inordinate amount of time (7+ hours)  on a handful of them. Not enough useful exam review materials were shared with us, and there seemed to be a huge disconnect between exam problems and problem sets. It would be nice for the instructor to give more than 3 practice midterm problems and more than 6 practice final problems. Expect to spend a lot of time learning Mathematica. Also, Taylor expansions are a major feature of this course, yet how to use them in physics is never explicitly taught.",
                "The course teaching was incredibly clear and concise. Poland's explanations really were built from the ground up and were digestible no matter if one had taken 200 or 260 or had only taken courses as a Math major. The TFs were helpful and insightful and made the course much easier to understand in case there were lingering topics that were only lightly touched upon in class. The problem sets were not too long (and Poland even put on bonus points for LaTEXing them and eventually even additional problems for practice) and the students were all highly collaborative!",
                "Some strengths were that the class closely followed the textbook, the lectures were recorded, and Professor Poland would post his notes, which was very helpful for reviewing and relearning. Also, the course provided a lot of resources to do well, as Professor Poland gave out extra credit, he was very generous with extensions, and there were many office hours times available. A challenge was that the course moves extremely fast and it is difficult to keep up with the math. I often had to consult the textbook to review material after lectures.",
                "The course's strength lies in its dedication to reinforcing new content - for example, after their introduction the Euler-Lagrange equations are used heavily throughout the rest of the course, adding a powerful tool to the physicist's toolbox. The problem sets are also carefully constructed to reinforce chapter content and put it in conversation with the computational competencies students need for future work.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness I can identify seemed to be a logistical one - I'm not sure if it's a function of poorly organized work on the student end or an overly large student to TA ratio, but we didn't receive several of our problem sets in time to get feedback before the midterm and final exams. Solutions were posted, so this wasn't a major issue, but it did seem to stress people out.",
                "After reading nearly the entire course textbook, I would say the lecture notes that Professor Poland uses for lecture sometimes mismatch the weight of what's important in the chapter with how much we spend on it in class. Specifically the notes for chapters 9, 10 and 11 at least in my opinion were impossible to follow. And some of the special relativity lectures at the end of the semester got unreadable with all the matrix notation. I think circling back and recapping what everything is, how we got here, and most importantly what this is leading to makes it easier to follow. The course content is also just hard and there is a lot of cover so I don't know what I would do myself.",
                "Good class overall-great textbook and great professor.",
                "I think the course overall was great. My only note is that sometimes lectures seemed a bit complex/tangential, maybe because some topics became very theoretical. Otherwise, I liked the organized lecture notes, the problem set structure and the exams.",
                "The course had interesting psets and exams, and the professor's lectures were great. I think the course could have been made better if we spent less time on newtonian mechanics in the beginning of the course and discussed topics like canonical transformations and Poisson brackets more in depth.",
                "Strengths: the grading was fair, especially the +5 points for LaTeX and the bonus questions. The lecutures were also usually very helpful and provided good examples.\r\nWeaknesses: while lectures usually were directly applicable to the current topic, they at times became a bit too abstract and introduced notation that while useful didn't seem fully necessary (specifically the special relativity lecture).",
                "Strengths: The textbook, and Prof Poland's enthusiasm in lecture about the material. The grading of tests was also extremely generous (which is counterbalanced by the considerable difficulty of the tests). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The level of knowledge assumed about the topic in lecture is not, in any way, shape or form, coherent with the prerequisites. There is no real explanation of the new concepts beyond overview of notation. For that reason, lectures were extremely hard to follow, and I caught more than one student reading the textbook during lecture in order to understand the content/ even be remotely engaged. The material beyond the Midterm is needlessly confusing (why not have an actual introduction for tensors instead of writing down random matrices for example?) despite how interesting it may be. \r\nFurthermore, a lot of the students come from a STEM heavy background, which means they have been taught most of the material beforehand/at least an intro to the new concepts. That is good for them, but if you try coming in with nothing but the LinAlg, Multi/Phys 180,181 intro, you'll suffer. Another thing of note for this class is the atmosphere, that is NOT conducive to learning. There was a group of students who made it their life's goal to laugh/side eye judgmentally every single time someone would ask a question about the material. Not to mention some will full on ignore you, to the point of not returning a nod at office hours, or barely answering a question you might ask them. For a class that is best survived in collaboration, that was disheartening to witness. Quite honestly, if I had gone in with the idea of pursuing a Physics major, I would have given up. \r\nI have to mark another point for fairness, that actually heavily affected my experience in the class and, to some extent, my mental health. It was the first and only time I felt like being a woman affected my experience in an academic setting. Women are a minority in the class, which should not be a problem beyond the staggering disproportion (I noticed a maximum of 20% of students were women, give or take, which is low). However, insidiously, I felt isolated by some male counterparts, who would stare at me like I had grown another head whenever I tried to participate to conversation. There is no way to say that is solely due to sexism, so I won't say that. But it felt a lot like it to me, although I can't say my experience is the same for every woman in the class. I also don't think those behaviors were intentionally malicious, or even intentional at all.\r\nI honestly only understood imposter syndrome thanks to Physics 410, and that I know for sure is not a unique experience! By the end of the semester, I could not even be bothered to try asking a question in lecture or office hours or anywhere anymore (which led to me knowing close to nothing about the last chapter). I think my experience would have been vastly different if the class had cultivated a more inclusive environment; there is a reason the Physics major is reputed to be white, male and rich. I don't know how you could improve that for next year, but I would have been better off never setting foot in that lecture hall, and until it changes, I would say anyone who is not utterly passionate about Mechanics is. The sad part is that I was, to some extent.",
                "Strengths: the textbook is extremely well structured, David's enthusiasm in lecture, the grading is quite generous\r\nWeaknesses: the attitude of some of the students in PHYS 410 is quite disheartening. The disparity between the levels of students is not acceptable. To say that a phys 180 student is qualified to take this course next to a phys 260 is not. New content is brushed over (both mathematical and physical). New concepts are introduced without being explained at all. Students often had to read the textbook during lecture to grasp what was going on, and to attempt to structure the lectures notes. The content before the midterm was graspable (as the professor tried to start off slow), but what happens after the midterm is incomprehensible. Chapters such as chaos or special relativity are barely explained, which leads students to attempt to do the pset with only the textbook as reference. \r\nHowever, knowledge is not the greatest weakness of this class, it is the atmosphere. The few times I dared ask a question, some students would quite literally burst out laughing as the answer seemed evident to them. This is UNACCEPTABLE. No student should feel that their questions are stupid, or not valid. However, this is the way phys 410 will make you feel: that you are not qualified (even though you are!) enough to be in this class. There is a group of ten-fifteen students that dominates the class and makes everyone else feel like they are not enough. The atmosphere is not conducive to learning. For the first time in my life, I understood why some women do not feel comfortable in STEM environments. The sexism in this class is palpable. There are perhaps 8 girls in a class of 50, the boys do not address the girls (in disdain perhaps).",

                "Take if required, interesting topics, but not my favorite class by far.",
                "If you want to learn CM, and learning CM opens lots of doors, this is probably your best bet here.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in physics. I took it as a math major and thought it was interesting.",
                "Yes; Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics is pretty useful and provides a pretty systematic and nice way to analyze systems.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to students who are interested in theoretical science and have a strong background in mathematics.",
                "no. this course made me reconsider my major",
                "Absolutely! I think this is a fantastic intro physics course to take, both as a physics as well as a math major. You don't really need the physics intro sequence to succeed (there were a few freshmen in the class this year that did well). David Poland is a great lecturer (as I am sure many people acknowledge in these reviews): he follows the book Taylor very closely, which is useful to study, as well as posts many lecture notes. In some stem classes the lectures are somewhat empty, but I feel like almost everyone showed up to the 410 ones. \r\n\r\nThe workload is what you should expect of a college class, and the grades are very good: you get extra credit for submitting psets in latex, the midterm was very straightforward.",
                "Yes I would. If you are sitting on the fence between intensive and non-intensive, definitely shop this class. There are a lot of resources, and you are never stuck on a question without an answer when studying for the exams.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless they know at least the math for it before coming in. This entire course felt like a review -- like I should have known the material already and I did not because I was fresh out of Physics 200. People in Physics 260 did, so they were fine -- at least for the first half of the semester. If the student wants to learn physics, this course is not for them, it is only for people who want to learn math without ever thinking about the physical implications of said math -- or are willing to teach themselves how it all works, which is what I had to do. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the student must have approximately 15-25 hours each week for the PSets, even after going to all the office hours they can make. Yet, when the exam comes around, no amount of studying is going help -- again, unless they knew the material before.",
                "No, I would not recommend this course to anyone. The only people who may benefit from this course are those who already covered advanced classical mechanics in high school, or people who understand math much better than they understand physics and would like to learn about applications of math in physics contexts. If you are a physics student looking to expand your knowledge, do not take this course  you will most likely leave confused and doubting whether you still like physics. \r\nIf your heart is set on the intensive major and this course is unavoidable, read the book and start on homework assignments early. You will learn much more by working through problems on your own.",
                "Only if considering the intensive major. It is very challenging (but fulfilling, if you like math) so it would make more sense to take 402 in the case that you don't need the intensive course. I liked the pressure to work hard and learn hard but not when it came to final exam time, in which the test was not accurately representative of the preparation we had in psets.",
                "Only someone interested in the topics. But, if so, I highly recommend.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to a physics major, and don't be afraid of it! It is difficult, but certainly manageable.",
                "If you want to learn about Lagrangian/Hamiltonian formulation of physics (which is important to many fields) I highly recommend it. However, the rigor/explanation of what's happening is a little ambiguous on the math side; it's a class for every physics major including those who don't care about proofs. The professor is good at explaining things and an excellent exam writer, grading is generally fair, the course isn't thrilling and mostly follows the textbook but it's an important foundational course.",
                "Take this class if you fall into one of the following three categories: you took Physics 260/261 (or some advanced level of intensive physics in high school), you are a math major, or you have a large amount of time to devote to this class. Otherwise, under no circumstances should anyone take this class with Prof. Poland. You will learn a lot, but the class is very intense and fast-paced, and the psets tend to get very mathematically heavy. Prof. Poland is a great lecturer and he does care about the students and our understanding of the material, but the final exam was unreasonably difficult. To summarize, I felt that this class was essentially a math class disguised as physics, which gave any math major an advantage (to put things into perspective about how divided the class was, the midterm average was a 79 with an insanely large standard deviation of 19).",
                "Yes! I would highly recommend this course, for both the material and the teacher. Poland will help develop your problem-solving skills as a physicist, and will help you mathematically mature (lord knows I needed it). It was an excellent course and I learned a ton!",
                "Definitely. Great course, not too much work. As long as you pay attention in lecture or read the textbook, you'll learn a lot and probably breeze through the course.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in theoretical physics and/or solving hard problems. It is a challenging course, but not insurmountable. I definitely feel far more comfortable with classical mechanics than I did at the start of the semester. Try to put it off if you already have multiple courses with challenging psets.",
                "I absolutely would recommend this course! It was one of the most enjoyable courses I have ever taken here at Yale and solidified my love for physics. It was clear and the workload was always very manageable, and the tests were difficult but still incredibly fair. If you put in the work, it will be incredibly rewarding.",
                "I would recommend it, but the course is definitely challenging and the psets were consistently my heaviest assignment every week. Some problems on psets felt impossible unless you approached it in the right way and basically required you to go to office hours. However, if you are interested in physics, the content goes very in depth mathematically, and I thought that Professor Poland did a really excellent job of presenting the material in an engaging/exciting way.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students, as it provides the more unified, integrated view of physics necessary to access higher level coursework in the field (and related ones, too). But beyond just that, it teaches students how to think about problems and decompose them into simpler steps, through an analysis of coordinatization, characterization (of kinetic and potential energies usually), and conservation. This framework is crucial to all quantitative work in the natural sciences.",
                "If you are truly interested in theory and willing to put a lot of time in then yes. But I would advise you to think twice before taking this just if you were amused by intro physics. If you don't put in the time to understand everything (ideally read the book) then you are wasting your time working on the psets.",
                "Yes-class was a robust intro to mechanics.",
                "This course is going to be quite difficult if you're not coming from PHYS 260/261.  You may find this course rather uninteresting if you're a math major seeking to fulfill the BS requirement.  If you have a strong background in physics and are passionate about the subject, this course is absolutely for you.",
                "Absolutely. I'm not a physics major but this course was very enjoyable",
                "Absolutely! If you are interested in physics and have a background in multivariable calc and physics with calculus, i would definitely recommend that you take this course, even if you are a first year. The content was very interesting and foundational for physics students, and the course was very reasonable in terms of difficulty.",
                "Yes, even if you come to hate everything else about the course (which I strongly doubt as the PSETs help you learn the material, the exams are fair, there is a generous curve, and the lectures are fun) the build up to the last lecture where Professor Poland takes you from special relativity to string theory in 75 minutes makes it all worth it.",
                "I would recommend this class to a very specific student. If you have EXTENSIVE background in Physics, want the intensive physics major, and don't mind being isolated/have a strong group to head into the class with, take it. The material is interesting, and Prof.Poland is nice. You'll probably have a good time with your friends. \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in Physics, may not have taken 260, and are not a stereotypical physics major, DO NOT take this class. It honestly ruined some aspects of my semester; not so much because of the content (which I'll say and repeat, is very interesting) but because of the class itself.",
                "I would recommend this course to a very specific type of student. If you are an intense physics major, have taken phys 260 and have an extensive background in mathematics, go for it. The content is interesting and professor Poland is kind. \r\nHowever, if you have only taken phys 180, under no circumstance should you take this course. You will be lacking in knowledge compared to the other students, and you will feel it. When introducing a new topic, there is no explanation as to what you are studying as it is assumed that you know the content.",
                "yes! Poland is a great professor and really cares about his students understanding the material. Would recommend over 401!",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, Prof. Poland is passionate about teaching and makes lectures interesting. The course covers a wide range of topics in classical mechanics through the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods.",
                "I would recommend this class if you are a physics major or need to complete the science requirement for math major. Although some of the topics were interesting, the class was extremely difficult, so I think this class is catered toward those with a strong foundation of math and physics."
