We learned about drawing with line and drawing with value; learned about how to draw portraiture and draw with one- and two-point perspective; learned how to use vine charcoal, compressed charcoal, and different kinds of pencils. I realized that I really enjoy working with charcoal, and that if I put the time into a drawing, I can make something I feel really proud of. That's a pretty general theme here - I often go into a new subject area thinking \"I probably can't really do this; this is probably for the kids who have been doing it for much longer,\" but then I try it out and realize \"this is really accessible and everyone should try it!\""

                "Strength: Flexible learning environment improved my ability to pay attention and show interest in the course\r\nWeaknesses: The length of the class was extremely long, I think perhaps if it was set up with a 10 minute break in the middle we could be more productive for the full length of the session.",
                "An evaluation of peoples beginning art levels would be helpful",

                "I wish there was more in-class instruction on pencil drawing.",
                "Kern and Can were great instructors - super calm and friendly, really good vibes. That's a huge strength of the course. Another strength was the way it was set up - twice a week, two long stretches to just draw or work on whatever we were working on that week. I really liked the student artist presentations, getting to see and learn about different famous artists each week. The short example / instruction / mini lectures combined with a long time to work on the new technique was great. No weaknesses!"

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student! Kern is wonderful, the workload is very light, and this class is a wonderful break from some of the crazy workload classes at Yale. If you're interested in drawing at all, you will enjoy this class!",
                "Yes! It's that simple.",
                "Yes. You can't learn to draw without doing it, and I think this class gives you the tools to learn at the same time as just putting you in a space where you are forced to try.",
                "Yes i would recommend it to anyone.",
                "10/10 would recommend. Super fun, feels really good to draw, great teachers, likely an interesting group of other students, people you wouldn't necessarily see or meet otherwise. Homework is low, only five assignments, projects are open and fun."
