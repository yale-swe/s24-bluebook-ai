                "this course covered water treatment methods within the context of energy. the class was mostly quantitative engineering applications of the topic, but also had some qualitative context",
                "You learn a lot about water purification and electrochemistry. The focus of this class is primarily on the water part of \"Water-Energy Nexus\" but you also see how the two subjects intersect.",
                "Through this course, I learned a lot about the different ways that we can work solve our world's water issues. From water treatment to electrochemistry to membranes, I really gained an in depth understanding of the field! I feel like the nature of the problem sets and exams improved my problem-solving and collaboration skills in the classroom setting.",
                "Water chemistry",
                "This course was great to learn about the basics of how water and energy intersect when it comes to water treatment, as it was very relevant and well taught. The topics covered have a holistic intro to the topic as reactor kinetics, cell electrolysis, and membranes were covered",
                "This is a really interesting course that covers a variety of topics in water treatment, chemistry, and energy. The main concepts were mass balances of water treatment, electrochemistry, and membranes. Concepts are applied not just to treating water in a traditional sense, but also to hydrogen generation, carbon sequestration, and waste stream diversion and nutrient recapturing.",
                "Working knowledge of water and wastewater treatment as well as different considerations for determining which treatment type/s are best for different locations and needs.",

                "this class was really interesting and fair overall",
                "Sometimes the problem sets were a bit unclear or assumptions were made that weren't stated anywhere but it got better throughout the semester and I'm sure in future semesters it will be even better. The pace was also a bit off at the beginning but I think as this course it taught more it will get a lot better!",
                "I really appreciated how Professor Winter took feedback throughout the course in order to improve it as it was in session! I felt like overall there was a very clear and in depth transmission of information in lectures but at times the wording of the homework questions were confusing in a way that made me question my understanding of the material. This was often cleared up in office hours or over email but I think it would have been nice to have the questions themselves be more clear in terms of what they were asking. I also think that it would have been helpful if the material for the homework was covered a little more in advance or the due date of the homework was changed. Just in that it felt like every week the earliest I could start the homework was Tuesday because of the material covered and it had to be finished by Friday at noon. It would have been helpful if we could hand in the homework anywhere from Friday at noon until Monday at 9am or something. I also think that it would have been nice if there were an online submission option along with the in-person option.",
                "This was the first time the professor taught at Yale. The class material seemed very standard for an engineering class, it was at times very very dull, however the professor took a genuine interest in her progress as a teacher. She asked for feedback and actually made changes to the class and teaching. I feel like she also cared if we were doing well and took time to answer questions in detail.",
                "Strengths: Office hours were helpful, the difficulty of exams and psets was fair, overall a good balance between calculations and conceptual applications. There aren't any weaknesses that come to mind, a couple of the psets were time consuming but compared to most engineering courses the workload isn't bad.",
                "The readings weren't required, but often you could use them to get deeper insight on the content being covered. Sometimes you could also use them for reference during psets. With that said, the collection of readings were not great at times.",
                "Strengths: This is one of the only application based classes I have taken in the Environmental Engineering major, so it was really interesting to see how this degree can be used after graduation. The concepts in the class built nicely upon each other and the material was engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The pacing of the class was inconsistent. Often, the material needed for homework would not be presented until a day or two before it was due which was frustrating. Additionally, since this is an upper level engineering class, the basics of chemistry (ie. equation balancing) and math (ie. units balancing/dimensional analysis) should not need to be covered to the extent that they were in this class, as much of the equation solving felt repetitive and unnecessary.",
                "The professor was very strong and the support for assignments was awesome. There were always sessions going on whether with the professor or Claire as the TA."

                "I definitely would! I think that the structure really allows for non-environmental engineering majors to understand and enjoy the material. It would definitely be a decent amount of work for a class taken for fun but overall I think that it would be worth it!",
                "Yes, but know its mostly water chemistry thats relayed to energy, but the actual focus on energy is low.",
                "Definitely - although it is required for environmental engineering majors about half the class was from non-engineering majors and the content is very accessible with some math and chemistry background. The topics are very interesting to anyone interested in water/water treatment and its effects on climate change, energy, nutrient cycling, and other topics. Definitely go to the TA help sessions if you can and do psets in groups, that's the only way I could complete some of them (although they're not too time consuming if you have some help).",
                "Yes, if the syllabus sounds interesting to you I think the content will not disappoint.",
                "Yes! This has been one of the best classes I have taken as an ENVE major. Everything we learned had a clear real-world application and felt multi-disciplinary in the class discussions we held.",
