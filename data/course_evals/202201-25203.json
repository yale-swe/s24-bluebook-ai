                "We learnt a bunch of watercolor techniques and were lectured about pioneering watercolorists such as Turner, Homer, etc. The one thing that Professor Van Doren tried to make us appreciate was the simple process by which a complex painting could be painted. By breaking difficult paintings down into a series of steps, we were able to accomplish quite a bit in the class.",
                "I learned so much about watercolor in such a short amount of time and I am so grateful for it. I learned a lot not only about watercolor, but also about life and how painting applies to life in helpful ways. I gained insight into the incredibly cool art resources and museums that Yale has that we students just have access to for free. I loved this course. I gained a lot of skill in being freer and less skeptical of my art and the work of others. Also the art history element of this course was SO INTERESTING.",

            "comments": [
                "The course focuses the historical element pretty solely on the use of the watercolor in the west. Talking about Japanese watercolor, for example, was an afterthought that was half tacked on to the beginning of one class period. Also there wasn't a lot of guidance in what was expected for papers, and a fellow student needed me to send them materials that the professor never sent to them.",
                "A weakness was that more time could be spent on learning specific techniques instead of focusing so much on other works.",
                "I believe the course was excellent and does not have any weaknesses.",
                "I enjoyed greeting to paint. this is definitely not a semina class however and was more of a lecture for about 1.5 hours and then painting for 1.5 hours",
                "This course encourages you to go out of your comfort zone and explore new art styles. You gain a newfound appreciation for the medium. This course can be more engaging during the lecture part of the class.",
                "The biggest strength is definitely Adam Van Doren! He brings enthusiasm to the class and is insanely funny; class was very chill (but also occasionally boring and sleepy). Another strength of the class is its low-stakes nature, as it's aimed at absolute beginners to painting (like myself.)  Only about 40% of the grade was based on the paintings, which were graded on effort. That being said, Prof Van Doren does require you to paint a painting or two each week, which is not too difficult but can get a little tedious. Grading for essays was a little unpredictable, and at times, it felt that Van Doren expected a bit much out of first year writers. But it was also reasonably easy to get a good grade on essays, provided you kept your vocabulary in check (not repetitive)",
                "The strengths of this course are the professor, Professor Adam Van Doren, in combination with his teaching methods and class organization. The class was half art history focused from our brief readings and half painting. We all formed a tight community within the class since it is so small. It was really fun since we were able to have such a nice relationship with the professor. And Van Doren encourages painting outside whenever possible and this element was/is definitely a strength of the course. I think the only way that the course could be improved is having like a 5 minute break between the half of the class that where the professor is teaching and the portion of the class period that we are painting because it is a long class which can be tiring when kept in the same room sitting still the whole time. Only weakness I'd say is that it isn't a writing credit and honestly requires a lot of papers and writing for a non-writing credit course.",
                "There could be more teaching about technique and one on one instruction versus talking about history.",
                "Strengths: Lots of hands-on learning, by spending class time painting. Also I liked that the professor emphasized that the work was mainly experimental, so we could try different techniques and not worry about every piece turning out well\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the presentations could be a bit drawn out and did not seem as useful as the painting process itself. Also, it was often difficult to understand exactly what our professor was looking for in our essays."

                "I think this class did a lot to open to me to visual medium's as form of artistic expression, and I also learned a lot about art that I didn't know. It was, in a way, life-changing. I really love watercolor now, and I didn't know that before this semester. But I think that also came out of my personal level of engagement with the weekly painting assignments.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in art.",
                "I think that this class was a really fun and easy class to be in. i enjoyed getting to paint a bunch and it was definitely a nice break from my other classes. at points the paintings could get a lot. also there are essays in this class and it is not just painting. however, i thought it was a fun class and i liked getting to learn about watercolor artists and getting to go to the museums.",
                "Yes! It is a great way to destress and learn about watercolor. The essays challenged me to analyze art in new ways.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to a student who wants a chill class to learn how to paint. I became friends with my seminar mates and it was a nice experience for me. I would, however, advise to be wary of the amount of writing you will be doing, which is comparable to a weak writing credit (about 15-20 pages for your essays.)",
                "YES please take this if you have any interest in art or watercolor. It was so fun and just a really nice break in the week. I love the professor and think he will always be one of my favorite professors.",
                "Yes, it was a fun and interesting course.",
                "A very fun class, nice to take as a fifth class if the rest of yours are more intense and hardcore. Might be a bit more work than you expect since there are several essays and a lot of weekly paintings, but the structure of meeting only once per week is helpful too."
