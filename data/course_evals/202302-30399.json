                "Strengths: Syllabus is very organized and the course timeline is extremely clear. Professor Pushkarskaya is very transparent about the difficulty of the course and its fast-paced nature, and she is more than willing to provide academic support. No surprises during the semester. The TA Christian provided very clear feedback on homework and exam performance.\r\nWeaknesses: Could have more guidance related to practice application problems.",
                "A strength is examples were used that are happening in real life right now. More complicated material could be explained more simply.",
                "I am weak in coding because it is the first time that I have learned in coding. I am good at calculating and doing exercises.",
                "The strength is that this course is very knowledge-intensive. The weakness is that the interaction between the teacher and students is not enough, maybe this is because it is an online course. I think in the future more interaction should be involved during class.",
                "The strengths are that you learn what you need to in 5 weeks, it is paced well if you are willing to put in the work. the weaknesses are that you learn what you need to in 5 weeks, it is very quickly paced so it is best to reach out to your peers to form a study group from the beginning and crack challenges that you have right away. Some of the way things are taught is not very intuitive, so it may help to look up some YouTube videos or something to break things down into simplier terms, or get a sense for how to do practice problems."

If you has previously used R, then that part of the course shouldn't be too challenging, if not then you should be willing to commit to learning some R the first couple weeks."
