I also found the feedback after each submission for an essay, outline, etc. to be extremely helpful and clear. She always gave me some bigger idea to chew on and make my essay substantially more engaging/stronger. The readings were also phenomenally interesting, especially if you are into mindfulness.",

I also thought the topic in general was a strength, as it made me feel very grounded and grateful in a difficult semester. Also, the other students in the class came to become people I would consider good friends.\r\nWeaknesses: some of the readings were a little dry, and some of the essay prompts (P1 and P2 especially) were a little confusing",
