   "comments": [
    "I gained a broad knowledge of modern and historical topics in public health, including drug pricing, the war on HIV\/AIDS, genetic testing, IVF, the tobacco industry, and more.",
    "This course provided a broad knowledge of numerous historical and current issues in Medicine and public health. Professor Bazell does an excellent job of providing historical context and personal anecdotes to  put current events in perspective",
    "I learned about the policy behind public health crises. I developed a skill to look behind biased media into the true facts of the matter.",
    "I do not feel like I learned much from this course as all we did was analyze repetitive articles about topics that have either been disproven or are irrelevant to the current climate of medicine.",
    "I learned a great deal about the history and opposing viewpoints about many of the current topics in public health. The readings from this course gave us insight into not just the current issues in medicine but also how news is reported and perceived by the public.",
    "I learned how to analyze scientific articles and popular news articles to tell the difference between the two.  I learned how to edit Wikipedia.",
    "I learned a great deal about public health and the systems in our country and world.",
    "I learned a overview on many public health issues, to include epidemiology, vaccinations, cancer screening, HIV\/AIDS epidemic, tobacco and lung cancer, and war on drugs.",
    "I learnt a lot about public health related issues and specifically tobacco and the industry's use of adertisements, HIV and end of life matters. I learnt how to more effectively read scientific journal articles and improved my understanding of them. This class really caused me to reconsider some of my beliefs and question, what is often known as a normal or appropriate response to social issues, such as drug addiction and hospice care. I really appreciated this class and thought provoking discussions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course covers lots of materials and moves very fast, so if one topic is boring to you, the class will move on from it within a week to something new. This is both a strength and a weakness, because sometimes I found that I wanted to get deeper into a topic but we had to move on.",
    "The course can be difficult to navigate at times. For instance, there is little guidance for certain assignments. They are loosely structured and often require in-person clarification.",
    "It was collaborative and the information was intriguing, but the format for discussion and engagement with the material could have been more varied.",
    "The course could be improved by updating the syllabus to better reflect the purpose of the course, as well as removing pointless assignments that do not enhance learning since we never had enough time to go over the time-consuming articles.",
    "The strengths of this course include the interesting and very relevant material as well as the class discussions. The weakness of this course is the ambiguity of the wikipedia assignment.",
    "The material is interesting but I dont feel like a learned a lot of new information. I wish the class thought and discussed solutions to public health problems rather than discussed how the information about health issues is presented.",
    "The class was interesting and the readings helped me to understand the material better. I think that we spent a bit too much time on cigarettes, however.",
    "Strengths: \r\nThe course covered many subjects, and looking back, I learned a lot of new terminology that I had never been exposed to before. \r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\nThe course covered many subjects very quickly.  Some subjects were only given one or two classes to discuss, and the information presented was biased.",
    "This course provides a great background in public health issues and the material was covered well using the assigned readings as an introduction. There was an imbalance in the time and material allocated to each issue. I thought there was too much emphasis on the tobacco industry and smoking and this time could have been allocated to other issues that we spent less time on. I think this course could be improved by providing some more feedback to students. We never got any feedback, except at the end of the midterm assignment and for the final paper."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are at all interested in public health take this course! Professor Bazell takes some time to warm up to, but after a few weeks I was really enjoying his teaching. You can really tells he is an expert in the field, and it is especially interesting to hear him tell personal stories about his time at NBC reporting on health crises.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for anyone trying to understand broad-base issues in public health. It helps you understand the numerous issues that are currently being faced in the space. In addition, the large amount of class discussion and debate provides you with the necessary tool and techniques to speak on such topics.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot about medicine and public health, and was very engaged with the material.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student considering the information presented in the class is outdated, which is ironic since the purpose of this class is to study current issues in medicine and public health. The most recent information discussed was the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s, which while relevant, does not show the current climate of the medical field.",
    "Yes. If you are pre-med and you want to be more educated on many of the current issues going on in medicine and global health, then this is the class for you.",
    "The Media & Medicine lecture some of my friends took this semester teaches the exact same information in a more interesting way. The stuff we learned was cool but the professor often made it boring.",
    "Yes, it was very interesting and a great way to begin my time at college.",
    "I do not think I would recommend this course to another student.  While I learned many valuable concepts, I found that much of the discussions were one-sided and biased.  I also found that the quizzes in the course did not give an accurate representation of what we were learning and reading about.  Many of the quiz questions were worded poorly with more than one correct answer.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in these issues. I thought the issues presented and the welcoming attitude towards debate aided in learning and open discussions. The course offered a platform to discuss difficult and controversial issues."
