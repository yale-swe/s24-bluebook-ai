It really helped that I had already heard a lot of the grammar structures and vocab from home as a heritage student, and now I am much more aware of how I speak as well because I use the things that we have learned when I speak. It really is one of those classes that it may seem like there's not much happening in the moment, it really builds up overtime. Choi ssn was also very understanding and helped us a lot and checked on us to see if the material was too difficult or was going too fast. I thought the class was going a little fast, but I do understand that it had to if we wanted to get done on time, but it wasn't too overwhelming. I do think after taking the course, I have grown a lot in my writing, but of course, you should take other classes beyond this if you want to continue to improve. I did appreciate that this class did help in learning useful phrases and going through situations that students will likely encounter later in their life. like interviews and learning different honorifics.",

Maybe it was Zoom but wow there were so many \"this is so meta humor lmao\" moments in class.\r\nWeaknesses: lessons could be a bit more engaging, more practice with reading could be done (feel like this was most lacking among all my skills), and additional writing tips.",
                "Very good at practicing writing especially.",
                "The course had students from different skill backgrounds, yet the material was gone through pretty quickly. Prof. Choi went through the exams really quickly, which was especially difficult given that the exams were in real-time (she would scroll through a document on her screen).",
                "Strengths include learning lots of grammar and vocab that a student might encounter later in their career, speaking practice with a TA every week, homework assignments that reinforce what you learned in class, very flexible deadlines, easy access to the professor for help\r\nWeaknesses: some people might have found the class to be too fast-paced, tests were done in very short time frames and I felt that I was rushing every time (I think making the tests shorter would help with the time crunch), you don't get too much practice in class but mostly outside of class, and it was kind of hard to connect to other students as the regular classroom setting is lost, but the breakout rooms were a good way to meet other students in the class.",

                "Strengths of this class are that it works of off a foundational knowledge and understanding of Korean, which is great for people who speak at home or are strongest with speaking\/listening vs. reading\/writing. However, I don't think the class translated well to an online format, and I found that it was often unclear what class expectations were, and when work was due as the syllabus and weekly assignments sheets did not often match up. I think that this course might benefit from being streamlined, or with more explanation during class time."

Since the course was remote, the disorganization made it harder to grasp the content matter. Additionally, for the exams, the professor would scroll through a document she was sharing to the class. She would try to micromanage the time for every section, which made it really stressful to complete the exams. On top of that, sometimes, it was hard to understand what she was trying to communicate to the class.",

I definitely think that this should stay an important part of the course as it did help with speaking and getting to know the other students. This was my first language course at Yale, and I think it was pretty good given the covid situation: we had the lectures, and discussions and cultural readings that were translated pretty well over zoom. I don't have many criticisms towards the course.",

Where we might be getting an in person paper for a test, online it is much harder to test take when you are only offered part of the test for a specifically timed portion, while still having to look back and forth from your laptop to your paper. It felt as if the test timing was not adjusted with digital format in mind, and it made it hard to focus on the actually content of the test."

I will say that the speaking proficiency among the students in the class varied, we were all had a weakness in writing, so I would not be too concerned if your speaking wasn't the best. The class is a good mix of discussion, lecture, breakout rooms, and homework assignments. I enjoyed the class and would definitely encourage L2 learners to continue on in the sequence or for a student to take the placement exam and get into the sequence.",
