   "comments": [
    "CHNS 152 was very insightful in terms of Chinese sayings and terminology, and being Chinese it tackled a lot of topics (strict parenting, Chinese food culture, etc.) that felt very relevant to me",
    "I learned how to speak more formally",
    "I came into this course knowing how to understand and speak Mandarin conversationally, but the course definitely helped me improve my writing and formal speaking skills. The course materials push heritage students to elevate our existing grammar and vocabulary into more advanced Mandarin. I also enjoyed that the textbook covered subjects on Chinese and Chinese American culture.",
    "My newfound use of formal Chinese, the concept of which I had not learned before. Chinese political vocabulary and various other contextual vocab.",
    "I learned how to talk\/write in a higher level. We learned alot about how to use some more sophisticated grammar structures and many new characters.",
    "This class was less intense than I had originally expected, and I didn't learn as much as I thought I would, but it let me practice my Chinese every week and kept my language skills from getting rusty.",
    "I developed knowledge about Chinese culture, I expanded my vocabulary, and diverse grammar concepts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Some lessons crammed too much information while others on the other hand felt very easy, and sometimes when the homework, test, essay, and project were all coming at once the work really piled up.",
    "Strengths: Rgular practice of new vocabulary and grammar structures\r\nWeaknesses: Movies were not very helpful",
    "Strengths: Xu Laoshi! She was a wonderful, super attentive, engaging instructor. The heritage aspect of the course could be problematic, but my class and I ended up bonding over our Chinese backgrounds. Weaknesses: Since we were learning so much grammar and vocab at such af fast pace, it was sometimes difficult to remember and actually what we learned when speaking Mandarin.",
    "It is strong in fostering a small classroom environment where people are comfortable contributing, although a weakness is definitely that those with comparatively weaker backgrounds in Chinese are at a disadvantage and at times discouraged from speaking up.",
    "The strengths are that the course is very well taught, and that the course material (especially the textbook!) is all very interesting and very relevant to Chinese-Americans.",
    "Since 152 is a heritage class, most students have similar backgrounds, and the curriculum is specifically tailored towards heritage speakers. Thus the material is relatable, but is taught in a way that focuses on formal vocabulary and grammar we may not have otherwise learned at home. In my opinion, the biggest weakness of the course is that there isn't much opportunity for discussion in the classroom. Most of the time spent in class was the professor talking about previous night's reading, and our participation was limited to repeating what we had read in answer to very pointed questions.",
    "The course had comprehensive studying of vocabulary and walked us through examples of grammar well. It also walked us through culture and concepts nicely."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely!",
    "Yes - the class is great for honing your speaking, writing, and reading skills",
    "Yes! Xu Laoshi is a wonderful instructor who is very attentive to students (and gave us chocolate). I improved my Mandarin speaking, reading, and writing skills a lot.",
    "It is a Chinese class, and if you sign up for it I assume you know what youre signing up for. I recommend it.",
    "Of course! There is a fair bit of material, but now that the course only meets 3 days a week (it used to meet 5 days a week in previous years), it's alot more manageable! We learned alot, the teacher was great, and we had a great classroom dynamic.",
    "Yes. This course won't improve your Chinese by leaps and bounds (at least it didn't for me), but if you're looking to fulfill your language requirement or maintain your language skills, you should take this class. You'll still learn new things and there is always homework, but the workload is very manageable, and it's well organized.",
    "Yes, I would.  A great class for anyone interested in Chinese and is at a higher level."
