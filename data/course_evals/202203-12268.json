                "I enjoyed the first half of the course (linear programming) much more than the 2nd half (convex optimization). I think the material became too dense with equations in the 2nd half. The benefit for putting in the time to learn the concepts in the 2nd half was not there, especially since there was no final exam and the majority of the psets could be done without attending lecture and simply by reading the relevant parts of the textbook. I really did enjoy the first half of the course, however, and learning about algorithms such as the simplex method.",
                "I loved the first half of the semester, when we really took a deep dive into how to formulate and solve problems as linear programs. I didn't enjoy the second half of the semester as much because it was more of short intro into dozens of different optimization topics, and we weren't able to dive deep into any of the topics, so I don't feel like I necessarily mastered any of them like I mastered linear programming. Maybe some topics need to be removed from the course so there's more time to do a deep dive into the remaining topics.",
                "I enjoyed some of the coding portion of the problem set, and wished that there wouldve been more of them because they helped me learn more beyond the theoretical knowledge and lets me apply the methods we learned. The homework can be pretty challenging because it could take a long time to figure out simply from lecture notes, but the TA is very helpful for that.",
                "The course has a project part to allow students to read frontier research topics.",
                "Very rigorous demonstration and systematic knowledge. Sometimes the mathematical derivation is too detailed, though. Students may feel lost and dont know the big picture.",
                "strengths: extremely organized lectures\r\nweakness: while we had a great TF , the other ULAs seemed to be behind the course material (some of the material they were unfamiliar with and could not help)",
                "Strength: Very clearly organized lecture notes. Prof. Yang has definitely spent time on that. He is very nice and patient during office hours. Good homework designs and very interesting lecture content.\r\nWeaknesses: Graduate students are expected to perform much better than undergraduate students in order to have a similar grade",
                "I believe this course was well-organized. It had the right amount of homeworks, right amount of written exams, and right amount of final project. Not a single component demands too much, so they are balanced. The method the instructor followed to teach the material was well-structured. The lectures were fun and intructive, and several demos were conducted to illustrate abstract methods."

                "sure",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Prof. Zhuoran Yang is very good at teaching and explaining abstract math stuff. Compared with reading textbooks in optimization by myself, a big advantage of this course is that Prof. Zhuoran Yang would explain a lot of deep intuition behind formula. Such intuition is extremely valuable because it shows why people inventing those algorithms would think in that way. Prof. Zhuoran Yang is also very nice and willing to help students.",

It is nice to finally have a good teacher for this course. However, note that half of the course was spent on linear programming. If you are taking this course for machine learning algorithms, that may not help that much.",
