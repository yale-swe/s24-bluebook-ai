                "I learned a lot about the process of medical device design, from ideation to regulation. I also learned about what it is like to work in \"industry\" - which was very refreshing!",
                "An understanding of the medical device, industry and regulation",
                "Knowledge of the design process as it applies to biomedical devices. Basic understanding of intellectual property and FDA approval. \r\nBasic understanding of how to use Abaqus for simple FEA problem.",
                "Really enjoyed how project based this class was",
                "I gained insights into the entire process of designing a medical device, from start to finish. This included prototyping, FDA approval, learning how to work on a team, and more.",
                "I learned about the medical device design process and the FDA regulatory process. I didn't learn much about prototyping\/design (it wasn't covered as thoroughly as in MENG 185 with Prof Kramer-Bottiglio), but I got to practice those skills (Gantt chart, etc). I got to go on some interesting tours.",

                "BENG  404 provides a broad, applied introduction to various topics in medical device design. The course offers a unique opportunity to gain an intimate look into the inner workings of medical\/biotech companies through numerous field trips, listen to accomplished professionals through speaker events, and work on an extended project.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the field trips, the course covers finite analysis and provides rudimentary introductions to some of the tools used in the industry. However, the most valuable aspect of the course is the mentorship and introductions to the design and industry applications of medical devices, such as hip replacements. \r\n\r\nOverall, this course is an excellent choice for anyone interested in pursuing a career in the medical device industry. The hands-on experience and exposure to real-world applications make it a valuable learning experience."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: super engaging, interesting and great prep for real world. Awesome hands-on projects. Wonderful field trips",
                "This has been one of the best courses I have taken and would say that our faculties and teaching assistants were really supportive and helpful in our learning process. Tours have been eye opening for me to learn about different aspects of medical devices and I was thrilled to learn about them. It brought the curiosity side of me and that was the greatest strength. In terms of weakness, I would suggest having interdisciplinary team members would allow better collaboration and support from each other while prototyping a medical device. This would improve their personal learning as well.",
                "The weakness of this course is that it is pitched (and listed) as an advanced mechanical engineering course, but non mechanical engineers are encouraged to take it (perhaps 5 out of 40 students were) and non mechanical engineering professors teach it. Because of this intellectual diversity, very little advanced mechanical engineering can be taught in the class because most students are about 17 courses behind the engineers, and indeed this is not the focus of the class. The focus, and strength, of MENG404 is its dive into the considerations and goals of the medical device industry which has its own systems of regulation and ideation and many of its own challenges. Students receive an overview of the *business* of device design, which makes this class great because indeed medical device design has many stakeholders. People in the class may well go on to become doctors, lawyers, or investors in a life-saving medical device, and this class may set them on that course or give them a solid background if it comes up unexpectedly. \r\n\r\nThe final project in the class, however, is a design project, and that requires engineers who will learn something from the act of doing a funded and holistic project (i.e. not designing a classical mechanism in a vacuum, but one with stakeholders, doctor input, etc) but will not learn new design skills from lecture. This class should not count as a thesis for BS12 or BA students, because not much is demanded from the mechE's, and not much is learned. \r\n\r\nIf this class is to be listed as a MENG elective, there should be a separate course code with separate requirements available to the mechanical engineers, one that expects students to have previously taken Strength and Deformation (MENG I), Dynamics (MENG III), Mechanical Design, Machine Elements, and Materials Science. Those students would be qualified to receive lectures on fatigue failure and the advanced analysis of hip replacements; medical device component manufacturing techniques, surface finishes, quality assurance, and metrology, all of which differ from standard industry; biocompatibility concerns of different parts, their materials science origins, and testing for 510k; design methodology, pFMEA, dFMEA. If a mechanical engineering professor were conscripted to support this splinter section of the class, and all of the groups were guaranteed at least one engineer, then they could put together more workable and thought-through prototypes. \r\n\r\nI agree that having diversity in the class is very important, and if this class were 100% engineers, than they would not engage as deeply in interviewing doctors and patients, considering stakeholders and business concerns, etc etc; but as it is currently taught this class is a wonderfully fun, highly organized, overview of a complicated industry. It is not a high level mechanical engineering class.",
                "Strengths- the field trips and the diversity of students in the course, it was lovely to work with a group throughout the entire course and really see a project from start to finish\r\nWeakness- requires a LOT of out of class commitment, but it was so fun, so not really a weakness",
                "This course gives you a lot of freedom in the pace of the project, but for some it can be difficult to complete on time and more guidance is needed for making sure groups are staying on track. But you are allowed to pick a project thats interests you and work with mentors. There are also a lot of field trips that are interactive and fun.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Wiznia and Tommasini are both wonderful and give you a lot of freedom to take charge over your project! I also really enjoyed all of our field trips and speakers.\r\nWeaknesses: I think some of the Zoom speaker sessions we had were a little less engaging, just by virtue of being online.",
                "Very applicable skills and terrific knowledge required",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed the projects and working with my project groups. As a mechanical engineer, I appreciated the opportunity to work with students majoring in BME, MCDB, and even a few grad students (masters' and PhD).\r\nWeaknesses: Many of the lectures were not very engaging, especially when conducted via zoom.",
                "Strengths: You gain a lot of valuable knowledge outside of engineering from this course. The lectures span topics of intellectual property, patents, FDA clearance, 3D modeling, the design process, etc. This is not simply a design course. You will work on a term long project while learning about all different aspects of the medical device industry.\r\nWeakness: You get out what you put in. Different groups put in very different effort into their projects. Most of the project work is done outside of class and there are not many standards created for the amount of work you need to be doing.",
                "Really independent during this class, also exposes you to alot about engineering after college! many guest speakers which was great. however, have to do alot of work on the projects on your own time, as most classes are dedicated to guest speakers and field trips.",
                "There isn't much time for working on the projects during class. The lectures often run over time, and often involve speakers (there were too many speakers in my opinion). It was difficult to get an early start on the main project because of the hip implant project in the first half of the semester. The course isn't super organized.",
                "Felt a little like too much of the class was spent in lecture. I would have liked more time spent working with software or learning technical skills needed for engineering.",
                "I wish the project were more consistent throughout the class. Some had very engaging and high-maintenance projects whereas some were more laidback. A middle ground would be better.",
                "This course offered a ton of field trips allowing students to get a better understanding of the medical device industry.",
                "Strengths: the project was really cool and I loved working with my team, working hands-on and going through the process. \r\n\r\nWeakness: more structure when working with the medical preceptor (a timeline on what goals we should reach, how long brain storm should be, how many prototype iterations we should have)",
                "The course really encouraged hands-on learning, which was great.",
                "I absolutely love the field trips in this course and the speakers, while sometimes varying in engagement, were generally captivating and extremely interesting people. This course has huge amounts of industry applications and such a broad array of things that it introduces to you. Many of the lectures are speaker events, with new speakers every week that constantly introduce you to new ideas. Outside of speaker events and field trips, I will never see hip replacements in the same wayProfessor Wiznia's lecture series on that was also extremely captivating."

                "Yes, if you're interested in medical device design and would like to work on a group project. It wasn't that time-consuming (although I also had good teammates who were on top of things, so the workload was distributed - this might vary based on your group\/project). The field trips are fun, although the lectures are long and often not particularly informative (from a mechanical engineering perspective, some stuck me as not-technically-accurate). The professors aren't super organized but will respond to emails quickly. Overall it's a good class.",

                "Yes! It made me more enthusiastic about joiing the industry and learning about the research and development of every product! Definitely kindled my curiosity in many aspects!",
                "Yes, because it gives you hands-on experience. You learn really quickly about the medical device world and get to work with professionals in their field.",
                "Yes if they are interested in building medical devices and having a hands-on class. Also it is a valuable class to take even if one is just interested in healthcare more generally because it provides interesting perspective.",
                "This class was really cool to hear from many guest speakers from the field and learn about different aspects of the medical device industry.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if you have any interest in the medical device industry. The field trips alone make this course so so fun. Additionally, it doesn't require that much direct medical industry experience. I'm not a BME major, but was able to hold my own and it was an enlightening experience."
