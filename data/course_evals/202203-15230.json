We deeply examined the field of photography and I learned the merit of and weight to give to this field. I also learned how to incorporate urban studies into my study of photography.",

                "This course taught me a lot about how photography impacts our way of viewing different aspects of our contemporary society, and how it is important in the make-up of cities. It was really interesting to see the symbiotic relationship that urban spaces have with photography, and how they truly influence each other. This course also provided me with a lot of insight on how to be an informed viewer of photography and to think critically about the messages that photographs about a place are sending.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Too many to count. This class was simply incredible. First of all, the vibes were great. From the first day in the class, Prof. Hankins created such a warm and welcoming environment. Prof. Hankins facilitated the development of a great class camaraderie and a truly engaging academic atmosphere. Any class you have the chance to take with her, take it. She is an incredibly supportive and generous professor inside and outside the classroom. I was excited to participate in this class each and every day. I also loved how varied the class was. We'd move from all-class discussions to small group workshop activities, to looking at a piece of media and having a discussion about it. I looked forward to every single class meeting of this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is a very minor weakness, but I would have loved to engage more with the other presentations in the class, as they felt sort of rushed on the last day. If we had a day midway through the semester where we did some sort of presentation on our first two assignments, this may have allowed us to spread it out more by doing two mini-presentations midway through and at the end.",
                "I thought that the syllabus was fascinating and I loved how we read photography theory, urban studies theory, and also looked at photographs. I loved how we went to the art museum and archives and even took photographs ourselves. Kristin was such a wonderful professor, who engaged students and gave us the chance to share our thoughts, while also guiding discussions with strength and knowledge.",
                "Strengths: Definitely Prof. Hankins! She is awesome, kind, and very knowledgeable about what she teaches. The readings, class discussions, small group discussions, semester-long project, and field trips were also strengths. \r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "- Fun community and class discussions\r\n- Readings felt too heavy /too much at times",
                "Strengths: Professor is kind and greatly encouraging and helpful; most readings are interesting and relevant; assignments are structured in a intuitive manner; the field trips to the YUAG and Sterling Library were incredible!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the assignment instructions can be a bit unclear, greater clarification in class and in the instructions would be helpful; some readings can be very long and too theoretical; class discussions can drag on too long sometimes, perhaps better organisation of students would make the discussions more productive",
                "The strengths of this course are that you are constantly viewing photographs and reading about photographic theory as it pertains to cities. Because of the breadth of material one truly is learning to apply the same skills of analysis to different materials. The way that this course is structured also allows for a lot of independent thinking, which allows you to grow and transform your opinions. I think one of the most valuable conclusions I drew from this course is that it is okay to have an opinion that was \"wrong\" or that you end up disagreeing with later, and that it can often make your argument stronger. One thing that I wish I would have come out with is a bit more secure knowledge about specific revelatory photographers. We touched on a few in the reading, but the class discussion was much more conceptual. I wish that there might have been more structural on the historical aspects of things.",
                "You do not need to be a professional photographer to take this class! I used my phone, and this class served as a great way for me to dive deeper into street photography without having to worry about buying a camera or weirdly elite standards for my photos. The Professor is amazing, passionate, and gets deeply excited and invested in her students' projects. The readings can be a little dense sometimes, but the Professor v much understands that and takes the time to unpack and go through them with the class. There's also a very manageable workload, and the three 5-page papers and the final exhibition are paced out well so they serve as good checkpoints throughout the semester. You get to pick your own site in New Haven and do a mini exhibition on it.",
                "Strengths: structure in weekly readings and reading responses, resulting in class discussions, a small seminar style discussions, mutli-media presentations in class and visits to see photos in person at Sterling and the YUAG. Not a stressful class."

At the same time, you are encouraged to explore your own passions through the assignments and how they manifest in the city of New Haven. The structure of this class is artfully designed, complete with field trips to the Yale Art Gallery and Yale Archives, and being in a seminar led by Prof. Hankins is a joy.",
                "Yes. Hankins is an amazing teacher and it is a really niche fun subject area. I think that if you are interested in this kind of subject this is a great course.",
                "Yes, Kristin is an amazing professor. She is so excited about the topic and her enthusiasm rubs off on her students. The projects and tasks she gave us allowed us to dive deep into the subject. We learned so much about the subjects, and we were engaged the entire time.",
                "Yes! Super interesting readings, class discussions, and field trips! Prof. Hankins is awesome, and the semester-long project is a great way to engage with New Haven through art. It was also a low-stress experience thanks to the way that Prof. Hankins organized the course and cultivated a welcoming class environment. Prof. Hankins even brought us treats for Halloween and for the final presentation (candy and donuts)!",
                "- Yes",
                "If they are somewhat interested in photography and urban spaces, yes. The interest does not need to go very far for this course to be enjoyable. On the other hand, if one has no interesr, this course will be tough to get through because it can get theoretical",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! If you are interested in photography, art, history, curating, urban, and American studies, I'd say this course is a must. You touch on such a wide range of subjects, and you truly walk out of the class with a new perspective of your surrounding and the way in which art and cities interact with each other. The independently structured assignments also promote willing engagement and curiosity that I think is an important attitude to develop if you are interested in research.",
