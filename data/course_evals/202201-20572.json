Weaknesses: Assignments due almost every single class for the first half of the semester, and at least weekly in the second half. This could be a strength for some people in that you never have a ton of work to do at once because it is broken down into lots of small stages that are submitted every few days instead of all at once.",
                "The major strength of this class was honestly professor Hirsch. She truly cares about her students and was always available and willing to help. The class is a bit fast paced. To anyone taking this class, I'd recommend doing the inquizitive quizzes in your first week to ease to load for the rest of the semester - that was what I did and it still felt like a lot was going on in the class."
