It also was fascinating to learn in depth and from primary sources about the progression of the Russian Revolution over the course of 1917.",

I learned a lot about the different political parties of that time, how the government transitioned, how the Bolsheviks were able to take power, and about the biggest issues and struggles facing the country. I was also able to greatly improve my reading and writing skills in Russian through the readings and reading responses.",

                "Strength: Immersive and detail oriented/academic conversations and language\r\nWeakness: If it's above your language level, it's incredibly hard to know what is going on",
                "Strength: since class is a seminar, definitely kept me engaged. The assignments and assessments are also constant, which is both a pro and a con. Weakness: the readings can feel overwhelming at times. They are often very dense and can be confusing. Definitely great to read sources like that but maybe assigning less would be helpful.",
                "The biggest strength of this class is the professor. Professor Muravnik is one of the best professors at Yale, he is very kind and attentive to his students. He is always very engaged in the seminar and flexible in terms assignments. As for the material, reading primary documents and comparing different points of view is a great way to learn history.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness was that we focus to much on the readings and spent a lot of time in class just answering the questions, which were directly related to the text. I think it would be better if readings only served as a background and we were able to learn more new material in class and discuss share our own thoughts on the subject instead of reciting the assigned readings.",
                "I found the lectures fascinating, and I think the tests were a good way to engage with the texts and measure our comprehension. I think the breakout rooms to answer questions about the texts were at times a little hectic and overwhelming, but when discussion was a bit more open I enjoyed it more, and the lecture was very helpful as a format to give context to the readings. As a non-native Russian reader, the texts were at times a bit long and difficult for me, and perhaps could have benefited from shorter selections.",
                "The main weakness of this course is that all of the knowledge is taught based around primary readings. They are fantastic and useful, but for such a complicated history it would have been really useful had we started each unit with one lecture class to go through all of the key players and events before delving into the primary readings.",
                "This course is extremely well-organized, interesting, and facilitates student learning greatly. The readings, assignments, and in-class discussions really worked very well together. The course was split up into four units, each covering a few months of the revolution. After each unit, there was a quiz and exam, which really helped with solidifying the knowledge of the material before moving on to the next unit. All of the excerpts that we read added something interesting to my understanding of the Russian Revolution and they complemented each other well because it gave us the opportunity to see and understand different perspectives of the same events. The professor was wonderful and very supportive, always giving us clear feedback on all of our assignments. Although this is not a weakness, I think that the student presentations sometimes were not as helpful as our in-class discussions and breakout room conversations. Although they were interesting and it was great to hear how other students understood the text, I think that sometimes the presentations took up a lot of class time and there was a lot of material to cover so sometimes we did not get to everything. However, overall, the course is really wonderful and I would recommend it.",
                "There is a lot of reading (all in Russian) that is pretty difficult for non-native speakers, but if you set aside time to do them they're manageable",
                "The course was very interesting, engaging, and informative. It was exactly what you would want out of an upper-level language course, that is to say, you forget that you are even in a language course. It could be improved by simply having more class time. I know that's not necessarily possible, but I feel that this course would make an amazing 1.5 or even 2 credit intensive reading course.",
                "This course dives very very deep into the history of this period using primary and secondary evidence. The professor is also incredibly well versed as both a historian and linguist. The materials and resources are very dense and very hard to follow. I felt incredibly overwhelmed by the content and by the structure of the exams."

The use of primary sources as the main content of the class was awesome, as we were learning about the year from key participants in the events we learned about. I would caution that the readings are very difficult, and that a non-native speaker may feel somewhat lost or behind at certain points in the course. That said, its a fun challenge, and Constantine is nothing but supportive.",

You will learn a lot about the Russian Revolution from the professor and from the course material. The historical texts from the time of the revolution really give a deeper understanding of how and why the events unfolded as they did. You will get to read excerpts from accounts written by people who were leaders of the transitional government and leaders of their respective political parties. This course is a really interesting and in-depth look into that part of Russian history.",
