   "comments": [
    "I learned much about bilingualism and its role in the world\/ the effect that bilinguals have on society\/ the societal opinions of bilingualism throughout history. A vast number of languages and cultures were touched upon as well as a variety of subjects from linguistics, sociology, and anthropology.",
    "I think this course made me reexamine my previously held beliefs on language in a way that helped my critical thinking and writing skills.",
    "Overview of basic sociolinguistic concepts, interesting readings about bilingualism in different areas around the world, conceptual framework for thinking about bilingualism and multilingualism on a larger scale\/from an anthropological lens"
   ]
  },
  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths include not having readings that are too demanding, learning about the application and further analysis of reading materials in class, and meeting only once weekly. Weaknesses include only having two short papers and a final research paper and at times too much\/too little variety in information learned for one class depending on readings. One tip of improvement is providing guided questions that may help encourage more commentaries and increase class participation as well as potentially once weekly short blog\/reading responses to the materials.",
    "Professor Errington will give you enough space to engage with the course as much as you want. So if you want to put in a lot of time to explore everything, he'll be a great facilitator and sounding board. But he won't pressure you to do everything to enjoy the course so if you don't do the readings or pay attention in class, it won't be fun.",
    "The course deals with a really fascinating concept, but could benefit from clearer and more direction in terms of both the assignments and each individual class. I'm not completely sure what I'm supposed to take away from everything that we read and discussed."

   "question_id": "YC409",
   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to students that have interest in learning more about the effects that bilingualism and being bilingual have on the world and vice versa. The topics are very interesting and diverse and students themselves provide further insight to the material discussed by speaking about personal experiences or their topics for the final research assignment.",
    "I really enjoyed this course because it was a broad overview of issues and ideas in linguistic anthropology, which I haven't really explored. There are two short papers, which were not hard to write about and a final presentation\/paper. I thought this along with the weekly readings was totally manageable and I really appreciated the way that the professor wasn't pressuring us with work, but rather giving us different ideas to chew on and approach from our own intellectual pace and desires. It was definitely an intimate discussion every week, but I ended up really liking the class material, professor and people by the end.",
    "Generally interesting course, would recommend. However, you definitely have to do the reading to reap anywhere near the full benefit.",
    "If you're interested in this specific topic of bilingualism from an anthropological standpoint, then yes. Especially helps if you have a linguistic background or are interested in linguistics. This is one of those classes where you get as much as you put in, and otherwise it's not worth taking if you're just looking for a filler class."
