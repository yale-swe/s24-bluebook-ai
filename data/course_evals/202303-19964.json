It has helped me think more deeply about the audiences I am appealing to and how I am justifying the relevance of what I am writing about to my readers. It has helped me to break down some of the rigid writing norms that I was exposed to in high school and really think about why Im writing in one way or another. Throughout the semester, I was also able to reflect on my writing process and time management (procrastination) and talk this through with my teacher, working towards a more healthy relationship with writing. Lastly, on the two final pieces I was able to learn a lot about a research topic that I really liked and about myself, in the personal topic I chose to write about!",

She is one of the kindest and most attentive teachers Ive ever had and honestly shes a big part of why this class is so awesome. She designed the class herself so shes passionate about the topics and readings she brings up, but at the same time she is absolutely open to new and different perspectives. Her feedback on essays is honest and detailed but also encouraging! Some of the essay prompts did feel a bit daunting at first, due to their broadness, but once I found an angle that I liked they became awesome intellectual pursuits.",

                "YES!!! This was my only seminar class this semester and it was honestly a beautiful experience. The more the semester went by, the closer and more comfortable I felt around my classmates and teacher, which created an awesome environment for learning. The topics we discussed were very diverse - revolving somehow the topic of human emotions - and I liked most of the readings. The essay prompts were also quite varied and I had a lot of freedom to explore my own intellectual curiosities in my writing. If you want to have a broad exposure to college writing (and reading) in a relatively low-pressure environment and you are curious about topics surrounding emotions in the human experience then this is the class for you!",
