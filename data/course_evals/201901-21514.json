   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Sometimes PollEv would not work and time would be spent waiting for the connection to stabilize.",
    "Professor Chun was charismatic, and the research requirement provided a great opportunity to get exposed to psych research and learn about ongoing research projects.",
    "Strengths: All the lecture slides were posted, and there wasn't really much day-to-day homework.\r\nWeakness: The textbook readings did not exactly match the lecture material and therefore was a bit disconnected. Also textbook readings were a lot sometimes, and since they didn't overlap, then it was actually quite a bit of content to review before every exam.",
    "I think the tests\/papers could be better organized. Students werent really instructed\/pushed towards whats important to know (salty because I studied the things thatd be important to know in our actual lives and we were often tested on things that arent applicable to our lives).",
    "Interesting course content.",
    "Strengths: great lecture! Loved teaching style of Professor Chun; also enjoyed the structure of the class being spread out with readings, short papers, and exams\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
    "Strengths: Marvin Chun is a great lecturer. He speaks clearly, funny, and his slides are clear and organized. He makes the lectures interesting and relevant. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The TF grading for the papers can feel a bit arbitrary. However, the papers aren't worth much, so it probably won't affect your grade much in the end anyways. Also, the textbook readings can be dry.\r\n\r\nMix: the guest lecturers. Some were incredible (esp. Peter Salovey and Laurie Santos), but others were less so.",
    "I think one of the strengths of the course was how engaging it was. Professor Chun included relevant ideas and videos in each lecture in addition to polleverywhere which kept everyone very engaged. The material is also all relevant to our everyday lives! I think one of the weaknesses was how disjoint all of the lectures were and also the guest lecturers were not as engaging as Professor Chun.",
    "The strengths of this class were that Dean Chun brought in a lot of guest lecturers who were experts in their field. One of the weaknesses of the class was that I felt Dean Chun had his hands tied by being dean and teaching the class at the same time. He spent way too much time talking about how the studies conducted assumed a gender binary, and he shied away from getting in to more controversial studies regarding differences in gender.",
    "strength: great instructing, interesting, all resources on canvas, very good textbook\r\n- text book did bring up interesting context, but maybe the level of importance of the each text book topics should have been pointed out more, since some sections seemed unnecessary and weren't tested, but some were. More overlap\/discussion of the textbook would have been helpful.",
    "Strengths include guest lecturers. Weakness is the very large size of the coarse and random grading on essays by the TAs.",
    "Weaknesses: too big of a class, small level of interaction, frequent technical difficulties, lecture slides difficult to follow\r\n\r\nStrengths: some good guest speakers, video recordings of lectures\r\n\r\nWays to improve: shorter lecture slides (30-40 slides max), and more time spent on each slide",
    "The strengths of this course are the material that you learn and the way that it applies to your everyday life. A weakness of this course was that due to its size, it was hard to feel like you could interact with the professor and ask questions during lecture.",
    "Marvin Chun is a great lecturer, and there's not a lot to improve.",
    "Sometimes, the concepts were not explained as well as they could have been. The text was highly informative, filled with a ton of information that was not very relevant. Nevertheless, we were required to read them because small parts of them would be tested on in the midterms.",
    "Strengths: super engaging, great professor, good balance between textbook info and his own info, not too much work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of material (but still worth it!)",
    "There is little interaction with the TA's which is unfortunate. Professor Chun however is amazing!",
    "The amount of material in which we as students have to get through between the textbook and in-class notes is a LOT. I feel like this course could do without the textbook since within lecture we go over the most significant material anyway. I also think the papers were graded much harder than they should've been and it wasn't fair that the average grade given out to people was supposed to be a 6, instead of trying to give students as many points back\/as much credit as their work deserves.",
    "Strength: riveting lectures, great material\r\nWeakness: tricky exams",
    "The lectures are really interesting and engaging. The readings were not. Taking this course Credit\/D and focusing mostly on the lectures made the calss a lot more enjoyable for me.\r\n\r\nThe papers in this class felt unnecessary - the topics were too broad and didn't really contribute to my understanding of the materiel.",
    "The course lectures very engaging and relevant but the readings are long and not all the material on the reading is tested.",
    "Marvin made it subjectively more difficult than any other time this course was taught. It was supposed to be an introductory class and he made it way more difficult than introductory level classes. He also made the information a lot about himself and Yale's accomplishments rather than actual psychology.",
    "Strengths of this course is that the material is super interesting and Dean Chun, and basically any psychology professor at Yale, is best in their field. The class is large so there can be cool class polling and interactions with the studies. But this is also the weakness; since the class is so large, you begin to feel more like a number in the system for them.",
    "Lectures were very engaging. Expectations were very clear. The exams were short and on the easier side since many questions were repeated from the practice exams.",
    "The material was very interesting and the workload was manageable as long as you stayed on top of your work. Not many weaknesses, it was one of my favorite courses at my time at Yale.",
    "Obviously Dean Chun is a good lecturer. There was somewhat limited help I guess. The requirements for the papers were somewhat unclear at the beginning of the semester. \"Good writing\" seemed to be way more important than the actual criteria laid forth. The lectures were interesting. The exams were a comfortable level of easy\/hard. It just wasn't spectacular. Just average I guess, but I couldn't tell you why. The lab requirment was really fun though. I learned a lot from them and they were really interesting.",
    "Marvin was engaging but the class was too easy and there wasnt enough hw to keep people continually engaged",
    "Despite being a lecture, this was actually a fantastic course that I really enjoyed. I feel like I learned so much that was so applicable to my everyday life and to my interactions with other people. Having taken this class I feel like I understand not only myself better, but also the people and the world around me.",
    "i felt like i was tested on the content of random studies presented in class, i dont feel that i came out with much general knowledge of psychology. i feel the tests were oddly specific, making it difficult to succeed.",
    "Weakness is that lectured get continuously a little boring. Strengths is that overall lectures are interesting. Weakness is that papers were very obscure and subjective when it came to grading.",
    "The lectures were good. I liked participating in the studies. Otherwise was a fairly basic intro course.",
    "Large lecture has its downsides. It's easy to stop paying attention. But all lectures are recorded and put online so that was very very helpful.",
    "Dean Chun is incredibly engaging lecturer, keeps students interested for majority of a 75-minute lecture which is impressive! Some guest lecturers were very interesting, others not so much, but a lot of that is based on the teaching style of the particular instructor. \r\n\r\nBecause it is a broad survey course, the class does not get into any topic, field, or question beyond a very superficial, surface level. Of course, that's because there is a lot of material to cover across different topics in a short time, but for someone looking for a deeper dive, a higher-level seminar in psychology could be more interesting (though this class will likely be a prerequisite!)\r\n\r\nLectures sometimes felt disjointed jumping from one topic to a completely different one, but overall very engaging for a huge introductory class. Generous grading for the most part as well.",
    "The guest lecturers were a great way to learn the material and about the lecturer's work at Yale.",
    "Strengths: broad range of topics and very interesting lecture topics that balanced technicality and generalization well. Good feedback from graduate students on essays.\r\nTo improve: The order of topics was rather confusing, especially since textbook chapters rarely aligned with lectures.",
    "The lab requirement was a lot. I think requiring fewer credits would be helpful, especially since they aren't even graded. Also, the readings were just too much. 99% of the textbook readings assigned were not tested, but you couldn't predict what would be, so it was best to read all of it just in case. But at the same time, I felt like a lot of my time was wasted on reading useless information.",
    "Professor Chun was a strength of the course!\r\n\r\nI think one of the strengths was that, for certain topics, guest lecturers who specialize in those topics were brought in to teach them. I think this greatly improved the quality of learning since we were learning from experts in that specific area. A weakness may be that the lecture feels impersonal but it is unavoidable when the course has so many students taking it.",
    "Strengths - really applicable to the real world, really interesting, taught very well\r\nWeaknesses - a little difficult to know what information was important for tests and papers",
    "marvin is quite flustery and frenetic, stuttering a lot which makes it harder to focus and decreases students' engagement during the lectures. There could be better feedback given on the papers, and more help in reviewing for the exams.",
    "The lecture style was challenging however Mr. Chun made the environment interactive.",
    "This course's strength is in its teaching, particularly Dean Chun, who really makes an effort to help students understand and learn psychology. He often incorporates new psychological research into his lectures that give a nuanced interpretation of the discipline. Dean Chun's lectures are very interesting and I always left class knowing that I had learned something new. A weakness of this course is the lab requirement, which although it was very interesting, was never emphasized throughout the course. Many students had forgotten about it by the end, leaving them scrambling to fulfill it. Another weakness is the feedback given on papers  which I did not find to be particularly helpful for improving my grade on future papers.",
    "Pole everywhere was a weakness that wasted a lot of time.  It was engaging because of having many guest professors, interactive elements (class participation) and music at the beginning.",
    "The lectures were great and engaging, polleverywhere hardly ever worked though but Im not sure how much can be done to fix that",
    "Professor Chun was a very engaging lecturer, and the information was topical.  The downside of the class was that the readings were dense and boring.",
    "Sometimes it felt like I was just memorizing fun facts for the tests. I am not sure what could be done about this. Also, some of the guest lectures were less engaging than Prof. Chun.",
    "The quiz app rarely worked",
    "The instructions for papers felt incredibly vague.",
    "Sometimes lectures felt disorganized. Dean Chun is very funny though and enthusiastic about the material.",
    "Lectures were extremely engaging and I learned a lot from them. In other classes I hardly learn from lecture at all, but this class was great.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was that there was some highly debatable leftist opinions thrown in, but compared to other Yale classes it was not too much.",
    "The lecturer is good but the course is very broad and moves quickly.",
    "I loved how engaging the material was.",
    "Extremely well-organized. Marvin Chun is wonderful!",
    "Good lectures",
    "Only weakness is the amount of reading does not justify how few textbook only questions showed up on the test. You could not read the book and perform average if you really study the lectures, but just to get those few points you have to skim hundreds of pages of reading.",
    "Sometimes the information presented in class seemed tangential and a bit like a bad standup routine. On the whole however the class was well paced and had many interesting guest lectures.",
    "Some of the lectures were a bit boring. The guest lectures in particular ranged from very engaging (Santos, Salovey) to not engaging at all.",
    "Integrate the textbook a little more to incentivize reading on time",
    "I love the course. The material was very engaging and covered wide variety of topics. I would say the only weakness is that tests cover a lot of material, some of which can seem unrelated to each other,  especially because the textbook chapters focus on different materials the materials.",
    "It is a very big lecture but TFs are available for help",
    "I didn't know what to expect for the first exam, but once I took it, I figured out a way to study that would be helpful. therefore, the future exams went better.",
    "The course was very interesting in its material, but the discussion of notes during lecture was pretty surface-level and fast at times. It was a lot of reading in a short amount of time too so it was hard to keep up. I wasnt a fan of the surface discussion on so many topics, but do understand that is what intro classes are for. There was very good feedback on exams and essays so I could learn how to do better.",
    "The lecturer is excellent. The papers were sometimes less interesting to write for most people, but the workload was reasonable.",
    "The lecture is too big. I think it would be interesting for the class to have sections. The role of the book felt a bit off to me as some of the topics we were required to read were not discussed or explained in the lectures. In this sense, a discussion section would allow for clarification of the topics in the textbook as well. I thought that the class succeeded in exposing students to the various areas in psychology.",
    "The course needs more guest speakers.",
    "A big strength is that psychology is just simply an incredibly interesting subject, and was very interesting to study as a non-psych major. A major weakness is definitely the size of the class, but there really isn't anything to be done about that, because it is such a popular course for a reason.",
    "Strengths: get a taste of different psychology classes and learn what psychology is about.",
    "It was very well organised\r\nLectures could focus on some more depth",
    "Good workload. Would be better if textbook was utilized",
    "Its weakness is that it is a very big lecture so there is little to no interaction with instructors. Its strengths are that the lectures are great, very interesting and easy to follow.",
    "Strengths: guest lectures were really fun, Dean Chun is an engaging lecturer, the material is usually interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: theres just so much material you often have to kind of rush through it.",
    "The course was relatively easy. I wish there were a little more structure in terms of things supposed to be read in the textbook coming up in lecture.",
    "Doing the polls and having fury lecturers kept the class engaged",
    "Engaging material; could be structures so that material follows other related material.",
    "Strengths; teaching style \r\nWeaknesses: dependence on the textbook for material not covered in class",
    "I loved all the guest lectures. I wanted more class participation duh as Marvin directly asking questions",
    "Strengths: Dean Marvin Chun\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The TAs were terrible. I would try to ask mine for help on ways to improve my performance in the class but they are unable to  help with the tests because they test minute details that not everyone picks up on. Grading is completely arbitrary. Also, the papers were graded very harshly and overall the class caused more overall stress than was necessary. Furthermore, Poll Everywhere frequently malfunctioned which wasted time during lecture.",
    "The structure of the course could have been a little more coherent.",
    "Strengths: introduces you to a lot of areas so you can see what youd like to learn more about in psych\r\nExpectations are pretty clear for exams and essays \r\n\r\nBUT essays are an odd task (like summaries of experiments not an argument), and the class jumps around a lot and doesnt go very in depth into anything so if you dont like that style I wouldnt recommend taking it",
    "It's a great course",
    "It was a little too broad and skippy",
    "This course was effective in surveying the various foundations of psychology - the textbook was especially helpful in this regard. However, there were serious problems with the content taught in the class, both in terms of its accuracy and its relevance. In terms of the former, it must be noted that psychology is a scientific field like every other, and its legitimacy is totally compromised when the conclusions of the discipline are contorted to gel with whatever positions are politically, socially, or culturally dominant. We must determine first determine what is true and subsequently revise our folk conceptions of human behavior to accord with this true, not the other way around. I fear that this class did not do this effectively. In controversial topics where psychological science has nonetheless generated pretty clear conclusions (the nature of intelligence, gender differences as a product of culture or nature, etc.), this class did an inadequate job of sticking to the science in spite of what is politically hip. This is by no means easy to do, but it certainly must be done nevertheless if a scientific discipline is to take itself seriously. Additionally, this class seemed to have something of an identity crisis in deciding whether it was an Intro Psych class or a generic version of Laurie Santos's \"Psychology and the Good Life.\" In trying to be both, it never quite became either. \r\n\r\nAll too often, when the class should have been learning the basic foundations of the psychological discipline, we were too busy being told that sleep is good, stress is bad, and that studying social phenomena with a gender binary renders the information of the study \"outdated.\" The opportunity cost of teaching this information is high. In the future, I hope that this course is taught with a closer alignment to the science of the field and an explicit rebuke of the idea that our political and ideological presuppositions should inform pursuits of scientific truth.",
    "The lectures are very engaging and relevant to the present day, rather than just repeating historical or more memorization-directed information in the book. However, the lectures did feel a bit rushed, disorganized, or hard to follow at times. I think the assignments and exams were very reasonable and valuable to my learning in this course.",
    "It kind of jumped all over the place. There was so much reading and just not that much learned. I know Professor Chun was trying to keep it engaging and interesting (which he definitely did well) but we didn't need such poppy lecture topics. Diving into things a bit deeper and staying organized would have been hepful.",
    "Making textbook info and lecture info line up more",
    "Chun was very engaging and caused me to want to be in class.",
    "This courses strengths are the lectures. They were very engaging and fun to listen to and pay attention to. Professor Chun did a great job of making things relatable and interesting every time. The weaknesses lie in the tests. I thought the tests were a little too lecture heavy. There were more than I thought fair number of very specific lecture questions. Other than that, great course.",
    "I actually wish there were more assignments because it put a lot of weight on every individual one\r\nHowever lectures were very compelling and fun to be in",
    "It was good",
    "Strengths are in the brilliant faculty teaching the course. The greatest weakness for me was the testing, the vast amounts of information made it exceptionally hard to choose what to study and assign significance to different topics.",
    "Its very test\/paper heavy. Wish there were more grades.",
    "In class polls are a poor tool because they are counted for a grade. They were prone to technological issues.",
    "The class is pretty straightforward and does what it sets out to do, but the short papers felt a bit tacked on and unproductive. Additionally, while some of the guest lectures were engaging, they did significantly vary in their quality and organization.",
    "This class was strong all around",
    "less ambiguity with questions on exams, more application",
    "strengths - very well taught lectures, engaging guest lecturers, very clear syllabus, instructors very communicative on Canvas and in lectures\r\nweaknesses - not too many opportunities to meet professors, course coodinators, or TAs",
    "Loved it. TA paper grading could have been more consistent.",
    "-The textbook was good, Dean Chun was an excellent lecturer.",
    "A lot of information, emphasize that class material is important. Not much feedback about your work since its a very big course. It seems to be on your own.",
    "The strengths are the guest lectures. The weaknesses are engagement with material outside of class.",
    "Better feedback on how to improve on the essays, some of the feedback seemed kind of vague. It had pretty good lectures and guest lecturers.",
    "Dean Chun",
    "Most of Dean Chun's lectures and guest lectures were interesting and strong, but a few failed to engage at the same level, which led to the information they taught coming across less comprehensively.",
    "Great class!",
    "Lectures were fun and informative. The polls were a fun way ti interact with the students.",
    "Professor Chun was very engaging. I would suggest making the papers worth more points because they take a lot of time but don't affect grade much which was frustrating.",
    "The strengths of the course included the highly active TA's, the willingness for the educators to engage with the students, and the highly understandable material. The only weakness I have to remark upon is the difficulty in speaking directly to the professor, but given that Dean Chun is a very busy man it is understandable. This, however, did not take away from the quality of his teaching.",
    "This is a very well taught and engaging intro class. However, an intro class is an intro class so it's easy to be disengaged.",
    "Give more concrete notes on what is important to pay attention to in the textbook",
    "Very informative and engaging lectures  (strengths)\r\nSometimes too much information\/cumbersome  (weakness)",
    "Could maybe improve the course by working more of the reading into the lectures. This class had a ton of reading that pretty much all the students simply couldnt keep up with.",
    "It's all memorization but it's interesting memorization.",
    "Sometimes it felt as though lectures were completely separate from each other -- there was a lack of a flowing trend or pattern in what was being taught. This made studying for midterms very difficult because we were unable to study from underlying concepts and instead had to do pure memorization.\r\n\r\nI also felt that Professor Chun brought in his role as Dean a bit too much. The constant references to \"Yale\" professors, and researchers, and references that didn't add to the course content were a bit irritating.\r\n\r\nLastly, the topics covered in the lecture were completely disparate from the topics covered in the textbook-- both of which we were required to study from for exams. It feels unintuitive to have students learn half the material for exams on their own through the textbook. If these could better be synthesized so students can learn mostly everything for exams from lectures, it would have been much better.",
    "Lectures could be clearer",
    "Overall there was very little information actually given in this course. Although I enjoyed the videos and such, I've come out of the class feeling like I've learned very little for a full semester class. I didn't have to pay much attention in lecture to get the points, and although a lot of the subject material was interesting, it didn't feel like a science class or a class where I gained a lot. Also copying and pasting so many of the past midterm questions onto new midterms felt a little lazy. Most of the guest lectures were good though and added to the course.",
    "Pretty good all around",
    "The guest lectures were fantastic and engaging, the examples were awesome. A weakness is that the course felt like it lacked a broader overview of psychology as a whole (with little to no introduction to the different fields like structuralism and gestalt psychology).",
    "This course has interesting material but doesn't actually bother to teach it during course hours. The majority of the material is learned from the book and the course does not actually teach you anything. Lectures focus on innane and irrelevant examples of concepts that are not core to the understanding of psychology. I have taken a far superior psychology course at my local technical college. Don't take this course if you actually want to learn anything about psychology.",
    "For a 400-500 person lecture, it does a great job at keeping everyone engaged.",
    "Strength: Marvin Chun\r\nWeakness: Poll Ev, because the internet did not work very well in the class, also the class encouraged last minute cramming, which could have been improved with smaller, more often quizzes.",
    "I thought the lectures were taught well, and the material itself was inherently engaging. However, the lab requirement was a bit frivolous.",
    "Amazing lecturers, some guest lecturers were just okay though. More practice exams or problems would be appreciated",
    "The course did a great job touching on a variety of subjects within the field of psychology. There was a lot of material to cover, and I thought the curriculum was well organized and hit all of the cool topics in psychology. There was a good balance between hypotheses and the studies that supported them. I also liked the guest lecturers. The class did a good job integrating textbook material. No glaring weaknesses.",
    "Human behavior is a fascinating subject, and psychology is generally a compelling way to study it. The greatest weakness of this course is in the arrogance and lack of self awareness with which psychology continues to use its power to pathologize in the service of the entrenchment of capitalist hetero-patriarchy which becomes increasingly apparent throughout the course.",
    "I thought this course was pretty good. The strengths are the engaging lectures and the lack of busywork outside of class. The only weakness to me is that on occasion, Professor Chun would use the platform of our course to discuss issues regarding politics at Yale, which I thought was unwarranted.",
    "The course is highly structured and organized, and there was a great amount of feedback. It was interesting and not too difficult.",
    "I think lectures could have been a little less showy and more content based. I loved the text book. Also lets be honest, the papers were ridiculous and unnecessary.",
    "Strength: ways to follow with the powerpoints, lectures were interesting\r\n\r\nWeakness: So much information to remember its hard to retain it all and know whats important",
    "I loved that the course covered a lot of subfields of psychology, but I wish we could dig deeper into each field.",
    "The lectures were fairly entertaining and Dean Chun always put in an effort to keep students engaged. As a result, the lectures always contained a lot of media such as videos that demonstrated the psychology we were learning. However, as a consequence of this, much of the stuff in the textbook is not covered in class and I felt like I did not learn much of the textbook since it was not reinforced during lectures. Also, at times the lectures are completely disconnected from the textbook chapters we are supposed to read with the lectures so it can be a little disjointed and make retention of the textbook knowledge much more difficult. Another weakness is that the essay grading is extremely hard to decipher and in order to do well on the essays, you basically have to ignore the format they give you for what an essay \"should\" look like.",
    "I wish they had TA review sessions. Everything else was amazing.",
    "I honestly cannot comment on any weaknesses of the course. It was perfect.",
    "This course was great in that it was super insightful and interesting and really taught us the practical applications of psychology. A weakness of the course is that it is way too big so its hard to get individualized attention and have a chance to talk to Prof Chun. Another weakness is that the course is more examples of psych concepts, so the textbook reading is vital to understanding fundamental psych principles behind the concepts.",
    "It was a large lecture course so there wasn't much individual interaction but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Dean Chun did a great job making class engaging and entertaining; I always looked forward to lecture! The workload was very manageable and the participation in the psychology studies added to the class by being a first-hand experience of how what we learned in class is being in research.",
    "The lectures were engaging and interesting. I loved the Poll Everywhere feature as it made the class more interactive. The textbook was also very helpful. As far as weaknesses, while I thought the experiment part could be interesting, 5 hours is a lot to expect from us, as this doesnt take into account travel time and most sessions were far longer than listed on the website. Also, I had experiments cancel on me 3 times which was frustrating. Despite this I loved the class and enjoyed taking it and learning about psychology!",
    "Strengths: well-taught, good notes, understandable and manageable class expectations \r\nWeaknesses: lots of memorization for tests",
    "Class was engaging and well taught.",
    "Strength: interesting and engaging\r\nWeakness: no reviews for the tests",
    "Strengths: good teaching, engaging lectures, appropriate level of depth of material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Often devolved into lukewarm social justice takes and Professor Chun sometimes struggled to balance his dual role as professor and dean.",
    "I enjoyed certain lectures and most of the guest lectures. However, I felt that we had to memorize a lot of irrelevant details in the textbook for the exams.",
    "Strengths of the course include covering a lot of different material to introduce students to a wide range of topics related to Psychology and the course including guest lecturers. A weakness was releasing the slides after the course only because I used them both prior and during lectures.",
    "The course was very broad so it was a good introduction to different fields in psychology. The lectures were always very engaging. I would work on the polleverywhere for the future, since there were a lot of technical difficulties.",
    "The strength of this course was Professor Chun. He really made an effort to connect with students and make the course a fun experience. The course material was also very interesting and incredibly applicable to everyday life. \r\nIn the future, however, the course may improve by only inviting guest speakers that will increase the quality of the class.",
    "Strengths - Dean Chun was an amazingly charismatic and engaging lecturer. The topics and real-world examples he covered were all super interesting and a great way to expose students to the field of psychology for the first time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The exams mainly tested the rote memorization of terms\/concepts, which required you to read 50+ pages of textbook readings a week, which could be very dense and hefty. If you are more of a big concept\/discussion person, then this class's grading system may not be suited for you. The grading of papers was also very subjective, and feedback was limited.",
    "Having 3 midterms and no final is awesome, class isnt a ton of work, lecture is always really engaging",
    "I thought the lectures were super engaging. I wish that more of the material of the lectures and readings overlapped.",
    "Strengths- On the whole very interesting material presented well. Guest lectures were interesting. \r\nWeaknesses- Could have given more direction on how to write essays.",
    "Strengths- it was nice having guest lecturers who are leaders in their respective domains within psychology\r\nWeaknesses- would have been nice to have regularly scheduled office hours",
    "Strengths- guest lecturers\r\nWeaknesses- lack of personal interaction, perhaps improved by open office hours",
    "Strengths: lectures by Professor Chun were great, and all super interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: lectures by some guest professors were not up to our usual standard, and some test questions were oddly specific.",
    "The content is extremely interesting and the poll everywhere questions kept the class engaged. The research reports also were an interesting way to let students learn more about what they were interested in.",
    "It is a very broad survey of the field of psychology and therefore covers many different arenas. A good intro class.",
    "Engaging, good coverage of a variety of topics, great to have guest speakers",
    "I felt that the course was well-designed, with three short research papers and three exams interspersed over the semester. The lectures were also generally very engaging. I honestly can't think of anything to improve upon for a course of this type except that sometimes, the in-class polls were finicky and making it work took up some lecture time.",
    "I liked the course a lot",
    "I saw no point in having both essays and tests. I understand that the essays were rather short, but adding those with the tests and lab requirements was honestly too much. Have either the essays and make them longer or the tests with no essays.",
    "Too impersonal. Could do with a section to help me learn.",
    "Good lecturer -- interesting course -- liked integration of videos",
    "The use of videos in class and various examples of psychological studies were very useful in helping me understand the concepts. However, I wish that more guidance or emphasis were given on the papers we had to write.",
    "Well taught! Classes were fun and engaging.",
    "The course had a bad overall structure, and the topics did not seem to be chosen as to build upon each others. Prof. Chun lectures were interesting, but the textbook was way more useful as a learning material. Finally, exams with questions such as What is Psychology?, to which the correct answer (according to Prof. Chun) is Fun, is, in my humble opinion, ridiculous and not actually college level.",
    "I really really loved this course! My favorite part was learning about psychology and the social injustices that are occurring in the nation. I wish the course could relate a little more the readings since I would have trouble connecting the two.",
    "Strengths: Marvin Chun makes the class very interactive with polls (and fun polls at that), and his lectures are generally very interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like this class is heavily catered towards first-years with zero experience in psychology. The graphs on the slides are often explained poorly and sometimes even inaccurately, and while the lectures are cool because of their novelty and inclusion of videos and funny graphics, we never go beyond the surface level of psychology.",
    "A strength of the course is definitely the interesting lecture materials. I enjoyed the interesting experiments presented in lecture. Dean Chun was always available after lecture to answer questions. A weakness of the course would be its large size, which discourages many students from asking questions during lecture.",
    "Focus more on actual psychology, less on current affairs",
    "I believe the tests were unfair",
    "Strengths are that the info and lecture were engaging. The Weaknesses being that sometimes the guest lecturers talked too fast.",
    "Strengths are that the textbook is good and the material is interesting to learn about if you like psychology.\r\nTHe weaknesses were the way in which lessons were structured and how course material was tested through out the semester. The most useless part of the course was the essays that we had to write rather than reading responses or chapter summaries. So vague and confusing.",
    "I think the papers were a strength. They were short and doable but also a great learning experience and a perfect way to incorporate primary research sources. I think they should be better guided though. They were extremely open-ended and hard to determine what was expected of us. The lectures were not too engaging, but I think that's hard to do in any class that's 75 minutes.",
    "The lectures were very interesting and I really appreciated the polls.",
    "Some of the lectures try to put too much content about a subject in a single lecture, which makes the information seem disjointed since there is only time to state the facts and not much of the connections to the overall chapter discusses. This makes learning in class more of a challenge because connections are only being made mainly through the textbook. Of course, having the textbook reinforce lectures is expected, but having the occasional rushed, disjointed lecture does not make lectures seem very necessary other than for taking specific facts that could be found in the slides. Most lectures were fine in how things were explained in details, so again, this mainly applies to certain lecture days that felt rushed.",
    "Dean Chun does an excellent job of introducing basic knowledge from many facets of Psychology in an engaging, understandable, and humorous way.",
    "Strength - gives good overview of the field of psychology. Very easy to do well in the course. No surprises on the exam. Powerpoints are available during class so you can take notes. \r\nWeakness - hard to get good grades on the mini-papers, but they do not determine your grade.",
    "strengths: clear, straight forward lectures\r\nweaknesses: grading of papers were inconsistent",
    "the lectures were quite interesting, however guidance on the papers was lacking and more support in that area would be valuable",
    "I would be happy if the course was more structured: a more logically connected system of topics instead of 10 different themes in psychology. The writing assignments felt a bit disconnected from the rest of the course as well as the grading system for them. I think it would be more helpful to have sections to discuss the material.",
    "A strength is that the information is very interesting and was presented in a great way by the professor. It could be improved by better explanation of some of the studies, graphs, and data.",
    "The strength of this course is that it is very interactive, there are many polls in the class to keep everyone engaged in the content. A weakness of the class is the textbook reading is very dense with many pages and many vocabulary words that are needed to know.",
    "Strengths: The lectures were fascinating and engaging. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The papers were difficult to complete in a satisfactory way, as they required multiple sources but a short word count.",
    "It has many strengths. A weakness is that it should have more interaction with TA's.",
    "Lectures felt a bit long at times, so perhaps diversifying materials\/activities could help. Still, I really enjoyed lectures and the mix of studies and definitions we were presented with.",
    "Interesting topics, guest lectures were also very interesting, textbook reading took alot of time and was tedious",
    "The course covers a lot of psychology material, but the lectures are not related to one another so it can be difficult to understand what to study\/learn.",
    "The strengths of the course was that the material was interesting and engaging. Weaknesses were that some of the guest lecturers gave weak presentations.",
    "The lectures didnt provide a underlying knowledge of psychology",
    "The strengths of the class are that the vast majority of the material is really interesting, and so I was always excited to go to class, and even reading the textbook was enjoyable. Nearly everything we learned could be applied to or seen in our daily lives, which made it all the more intriguing. However, because it was an introductory class, I felt that we didnt really go into enough detail for any of the topics. The conclusions of some of the studies we learned about seemed very overarching and without enough specifics to know the conditions under which they are actually true. Also, sometimes the lectures moved WAY TOO FAST, and it was impossible to keep up. Luckily all the lectures were posted on Canvas, but the things that were said in class but not on the slides were easy to miss.",
    "Strength: Very interesting information, great guest lecturers, not too much work, tests were not difficult.\r\n\r\nWeakness: It's a pretty massive class so getting feedback on papers is difficult but still manageable.",
    "Big lecture style, so harder to stay engaged. No sections either so even harder to stay engaged with material throughout the week.",
    "This course was utterly useless. I don't feel I learned anything but how ridiculously biased professors are allowed to be in their teaching. The Poll Everywhere's were also simply a mess.",
    "I think this class was great! I thought the guidelines for the papers were a bit unclear but thought the lectures were incredible and the tests were very fair.",
    "I think that one of the strengths was the lecture. Dean Chun is so engaging and really makes lectures interesting and easy to learn from. One thing that I think could be improved is maybe to go into more depth on each topic rather than fit so many topics into one semester.",
    "I think this class was good at making sure its students went to class, but I think it would have been better if our textbook notes were a homework assignment, because it's super easy to fall behind otherwise.",
    "strengths - interesting lectures, cool guest speakers\r\nweaknesses - the tests were really hard \/ i wish the essays were weighted heavier to balance the hard tests",
    "Lectures were fun, interesting and engaging. But reading was so dry that I didn't get anything from it so I stopped doing it.",
    "The lectures were very engaging. It would have been nice to receive more guidance about writing the papers.",
    "The course had very interesting lectures, but the readings were long and tedious.",
    "I feel like Dean Chun is a really nice guy, but I felt like sometimes the course was a little all over the place. The stuff was relatively interesting (not exactly riveting, but pretty interesting) but it was kind of hard to study for the exams because sometimes the questions would be weirdly specific and ask super detailed things about like a particular study on a particular slide in a particular lecture. \r\n\r\nThe guest lecturers were hit and miss, some were spectacular (Laurie Santos omg) and others were kind of boring (sorry). \r\n\r\nSometimes, the essays felt random, I wish they were somehow more integrated in the course with the material. But they went alright, as long as you were organized in how you structured the material. I felt like the instructions for the essay were not exactly how the TAs graded our essays, because the instructions were kind of confusing, but it ended up okay.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Dean Chun did a great job with being transparent with the grade you were going to get. Like everybody knew and that takes away a lot of stress of \"what is my grade\" so that was really nice of him",
    "The course had incredibly strong lectures. They were both enjoyable and informative. The exams were fair and reflected the information presented in lecture. However, I wasn't a huge supporter of the essay component. While the aim was clearly to provide students with experience reading professional papers, there was an overall lack of feedback regarding the writing process.",
    "Exams really tested trivia more than concepts and I found that annoying.",
    "Strengths: Class participation, interesting content, guest lectures!\r\nWeaknesses: The various topics discussed had no common thread and seemed to have been all over the place, which made it harder to understand bigger concepts and general themes",
    "Lab experiments were useless and a waste of time, the papers should be graded on a better skale",
    "Strengths:\r\nIt is very well-organized and assignments were fair and clear! Lectures were interesting and fun that I never wanted to skip any class for this course (which is rare..)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nmaybe give a guideline in detail about exams? studying notes and slides from lectures were great but textbook readings were sometimes overwhelming and it wasn't easy to even skim through everything.",
    "strengths: well-organized, fair number of resources, straightforward\r\nweaknesses: TF commitment to helping students was highly variable and mostly gave at most as much as you put in",
    "I really enjoyed the Poll Everywhere stuff, really make lecture more engaging. I'm, not sure the article write ups were the most effective, though, I ended up just skimming the journals and although it's not ideal it made it a lot of time for not a lot of learning.",
    "I wish there was section. I don't learn well in lecture. Also, I am terrible at multiple choice tests. I wish there were other ways to assess learning.",
    "Marvin Chun was a wonderful lecturer - clear and engaging. There was a lot of material but if you put in the time it was not difficult to learn.",
    "The weakness is the grading. It would be much better to get rid of the tests because they just came from the book, and were very predictable. Instead, it is much smarter to test by having us write two paragraphs on the topic that were taught each week or maybe a page a week on the topic to see if we actually understand it. Are we able to think critically about implicit bias, about the broken window theory and connect it to our lives at Yale, New Haven and the world around us? or are we just puppets who need to fit out the right bubbles? I figured out the formula for this class early on. the exams were very predictable and honestly boring and lazy on the part of the instructors.  Why not test us like the intellectuals that we are instead of teaching us to memorize random words and meanings? Teach us to think critically about Yale and the world, our future depends on it.",
    "Internet speeds led to wasted time during lecture.",
    "Covered a lot of topics and classes were fun.\r\nDidn't really gain that much specific knowledge in certain areas. Lots of the things we covered were things we already knew (ex: talking about the fact that racism and sexism exist, etc.)",
    "I think having the sessions recorded and online would have been really helpful it looked like SSS already had the necessary stuff there to do it. The slides were very bare and sometimes it was hard to hear if you were in the back (because front seats fill up fast) so having a recording would have been really helpful",
    "The strengths of this course are the fantastic lectures by Professor Chun, and the good variety of material. I was always engaged in class, and I actually enjoyed delving deeper into a topic with the papers. If any, the main weakness would be that the exams included a lot of information from the textbook, which was often small, somewhat arbitrary details, so it was a little difficult to figure out what details to focus on.",
    "My main qualm throughout the semester was how the research papers were graded. I felt that the TAs didn't really have a standardized grading system or a rubric from which we could clearly know their expectations. Certain TAs seemed to grade more harshly than others in general, and I think this resulted in an unfair disadvantage to students who spent equal (if not more) effort on their papers if they were assigned to a harsher TA.",
    "Strengths of the course is that the lectures were engaging and I really gained an insight into Psychology research done at Yale. One weakness of the course was that the connections between the lecture and textbook material were not clear enough.",
    "I think the weakness of this course is that the book material is never reviewed or gone over. It is very vague how much of the material in the textbook will be covered in the exam, how in depth to go, or what material is even useful. I would recommend having section to go over the book material and review it or go over more specifically what will be tested in each chapter or topic.  The strength of this course is the fascinating lectures and the comprehensive material and how applicable it is to the real world.",
    "Marvin Chun was by far my favorite lecturer I have had thus far at Yale. Lecture was always engaging and easy to follow. The format of the course was well-organized and the course coordinator was extremely helpful.",
    "The lectures are great when the professor isn't as nervous, but gets repetitive and boring when he just reads off of the slides.",
    "Lectures were extremely fascinating and I learned a lot of surprising things and the science behind a lot of psychological concepts. I always looked forward to attending class, and even reading the textbook was usually interesting. However, the short essays didn't add to my learning and seemed to be graded inconsistently\/arbitrarily.",
    "This course's strength was certainly its instructor and the way in which he engaged students with the topics that were discussed in lecture. Marvin Chun was an amazing lecturer who had an infectious passion for the subjects that he was teaching. The guest lecturers were also a very interesting aspect of this course, as they brought in different viewpoints and talked about various issues from the standpoint of a specialist. The breadth and depth of topics that the course covered allowed for a comprehensive, yet interesting introduction to psychology. For me, the experimental part of the course seemed somewhat unnecessary. Specifically, I believe that this part of the course did not offer a substantial understanding of the reasons behind the experiments or the specific nature of the experimental setups. I did not feel that I learned from participating in these experiments. Rather, I felt as a subject that was \"used\" for the purpose of research without that actually adding to my learning within the spectrum of the course. Furthermore, the papers may at times have seemed disjointed from the topics that were covered in lecture, and the fact that we had no clear outline of how to write a paper in psychology within lecture, certainly created this environment of ambiguity when it came to the assignments. I acknowledge that an outline for how to structure a paper was available to us online; however, that does not compare with an overview from the instructor during lecture.",
    "I thought the course was well organized in the logistical sense. The relationship between the Professor, TFs, classroom participation (PollEV), and the lab participation process was all very smooth. However, the curriculum was not very well organized. It was unclear how the topics in each lecture related to each other, and there was not a clear central theme to the class. Also, it was incredibly difficult to know how to study for the exams, as there was a lot of information from the textbook that was tested but not taught in class.",
    "Strengths: fun interactive in-class polls to demonstrate key psych concepts, lectures based on empirical evidence\/studies that augment textbook material\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lecture material was not organized in a clear and logical manner, which I guess is a result of not following the book"

    "Ya boiiiiiiii",
    "Absolutely. Chun is a terrific lecturer and the guest lecture circuit was fascinating.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it was interesting and rewarding.",
    "No",
    "Yes. It was a pretty great introductory class for learning about psychology. I do feel like I learned a massive amount of information on how the mind and human behavior works and also learned about a lot of the famous studies. It is, however, a bit more work that you might expect, just because textbook readings were a lot. But if you keep up with them, then it's manageable and won't be so difficult to learn it all before the exam.",
    "Probably not. I think psychology is important to learn but not necessarily when its structured this way.",
    "Yes. Good introduction to psychology.",
    "Definitely! Even if you aren't a psych\/related major, this class is so much fun, especially with friends!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You gain an introduction to major psychological findings, and it's taught by a great lecturer: Professor Chun. The material is mostly really interesting, and Professor Chun makes it relevant to our everyday lives; people want to come to lecture. The readings take, on average, 2-3 hours per week, so it's not that much work. There are three 2-3 page papers and 3 midterms. There is a fair amount of memorization to do for each test, but it's definitely doable; overall, it's a relatively low workload class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. As somebody who didn't take AP Psych in high school, I really enjoyed learning about famous studies and influential psych theories that influence my everyday life. It isn't a huge workload either, but there is a lot of material on each midterm.",
    "I would recommend the class but with a different professor. I had high expectations going in to the class, but other students regularly pointed out wrong information that was given during class.",
    "Definitely, because interesting contents, good textbook that is enjoyable, interesting, even amusing to read, good instructing, many topics, so chance that some are interesting to a student is higher. No final exam, but contents spread over non-cumulative midterm exams.",
    "Yes. Especially going into finance and business, the psychology classes are very relatable and applicable.",
    "If you really really enjoy learning psych, you should take it. That being said, if you're looking for a gut, this is not the class for you. Retaining the subject material can be challenging, especially if you're not fully invested in the class.",
    "I really wanted to love this class. However, it didn't meet my (admittedly lofty) expectations for a number of reasons. First, the lectures. I was expecting to be blown away. On the first day of class, Prof. Chun teased us with a lineup of all of the superstar faculty we'd be getting guest lectures from that semester, from Laurie Santos to Peter Salovey. And on the days we didn't get guest lecturers, we'd have to settle for a world-renowned neuropsychologist and the dean of Yale College. However, the guest lectures varied wildly in quality. It was almost absurd. Some of them were phenomenal. Salovey's, in particular, was the best lecture I've ever watched in my entire life. Others were snore-inducing. In the middle of this wide, wide spectrum was Prof. Chun. Although he was a good lecturer, it became clear over the course of the semester that his decanal duties were affecting the quality of his lectures. In fact, he admitted it, saying, \"It doesn't feel like it used to,\" and then blaming it the slides that he posted before class. Sorry, honey, it's not the slides, it's you. Regardless, it was overwhelmingly apparent that he cared about us and wanted us to be wow-ed by psychology. Which brings me to the assessments. I don't think the assessments were reflective of the spirit of the class at all. The exams were all about memorizing studies and vocabulary terms, which is fine, but is that really what Prof. Chun wanted us to take away from the class? A bunch of vocabulary terms that we'd forget as soon as we walked out of the exam room door? I doubt it. Finally, the order of the lectures really needs to be revamped. Save Salovey and Santos for last. I feel like we hit the best of the class a month in and the rest of it was just a slog.",
    "I think Intro Psych is an incredibly useful class to take regardless of your major due to the way it is truly used in everyday life.",
    "Yep! It's super fun.",
    "If you want a broad intro level psychology course, sure why not. Some of the concepts were cool.",
    "Yes! If you are even slightly interested in psychology but dont know what parts of it, take this course and you will probably find your niche.",
    "Yes for sure if you want to learn about the basics of psychology",
    "Yes, Dean Chun was very engaging during lectures, so it was actually quite fun.",
    "For sure. Best course I've ever taken, and the lectures are incredible.",
    "Yes, especially with Marvin Chun.",
    "Not if Marvin Chun is teaching it. He's interesting and a great teacher, but made this course so much more difficult than it was in years past.",
    "Yes! Psychology can be applied to everything.",
    "Yes! If you're at all interested in psychology, you will learn a lot!",
    "Yes, it is a great class to take even if you aren't a prospective psychology major. It teaches you a lot of information that is applicable to the real world. Very entertaining and well-taught class.",
    "Yes. It's comprehensive and fun.",
    "Sure. If you've never taken a psych class before, it's interesting and a good introduction to the subject. Marvin Chun is great to get a lecture from. It wasn't an experience, but it was fun.",
    "Yeh i would. it was pretty interesting and fun and not too much work and tough to do bad",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if Marvin Chun is teaching the class. Intro Psychology is a must if you are human being living on the planet earth.",
    "Definitely! It was such a fun class. I always looked forward to lecture and was always very engaged. The assignments are very manageable and there is always very clear feedback.",
    "no, it is not a good way to learn psychology",
    "Yes, it aS very interesting and not too much of a workload.",
    "Yes, I found it interesting especially as someone with no psych background.",
    "It's interesting and worth going, just easy to miss a lecture and then stop caring.",
    "I would recommend it if you intend to take more psychology courses. I think it's a great introduction and sets you up for the rest of the classes in the major. It also focuses on research psychology which is very interesting and definitely drew me to the field.",
    "For a student with NO prior experience in psychology AND needs this as a prerequisite (ie, if you are a psych major), it's definitely worth it\r\n\r\nHowever, if you're planning on just taking one psych course, I would recommend trying to get into a more specific seminar",
    "Yes. This is a good introduction to psychology that presents engaging topics and memorable studies without an overwhelming degree of detail. If they had previously taken psychology (as I had), the pace may be a bit slow, but there is enough new information and interpretations to keep the class engaging.",
    "Yes. This class wasn't too challenging and it was fun to take. The lectures were also really great. I loved the guest lecture series, especially the love lecture given by President Peter Salovey.",
    "Yes because I feel like a basic knowledge of this stuff is important no matter what your major is",
    "I would recommend taking this course if you are interested in psychology but do not want to delve too deep into it. The course is great for learning about various topics in psychology but does not really go indepth into any of them (which makes sense).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's a lot of fun to take - the lectures are genuinely interesting - and you learn a lot.",
    "yes, I learned a lot for an Introduction to Psychology course. This definitely is not a gut however, and should be taken seriously.",
    "Yes if they want to learn about why they do what they do.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in psychology, but may not want to major in it. I truly believe that this course is for everyone who is willing to put in the effort. The class is definitely not easy, but it is manageable. I feel that many of the lessons I learned became very relevant to my everyday life and I found myself with a better understanding of some of society's most pressing issues such as drug addiction and personality and mental disorders. If you want a course that will teach you about real life, this is the one!",
    "yes.",
    "Yes, a good course with information that is relevant to many other subject areas.",
    "Yes, psychology is something used on everyday life and this class does a great job of showing that.",
    "If you are interested at all in psychology, or plan to major in it, I would definitely take this class. You will have to put significant effort in to receive a good grade, as with any Yale course.",
    "I think it was an overall good experience. Sometimes studying for the tests felt like busy-work, but I don't think that can be avoided. They wanted us to succeed, and we learned a lot of cool things.",
    "yes! very well taught",
    "Yes",
    "Yeah! If youre interested in psychology its a great place to start.",
    "Absolutely. This is a great SO and survey of psychology. You dont go too in depth on any topic and its fun to talk about lots of different things.",
    "Yes, good class if you need a social science.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course because it applies to the real world",
    "Yes. I absolutely loved this course. It was very interesting.",
    "I would probably recommend this course to another student as it was well-run and is a prerequisite for more advanced psychology classes, but I didn't learn as much as I thought I would (probably because I've gone to a lot of therapy in my life and also frequently listen to NPR).",
    "YEs - because it is an excellent overview of most major psychological developments",
    "Yep. Good class.",
    "100%.",
    "Good overview of psychology, interesting for people with a minor interest in psychology and interesting for people who have to take it for the major so I would recommend.",
    "Yes, but if its possible for you to place out with your AP score, do it.",
    "Yeah I enjoyed it",
    "I definitely would!",
    "Yes, it was an interesting class",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in taking psychology. It is an intro course though, so it is a lot of information to grasp that you make not be familiar with if you've never taken psychology. There may even be people with experience that you're competing with.",
    "Yes if you interested in psychology, otherwise it would be very hard to be motivated to keep up with all the readings.",
    "I would - this is a good way to fulfill a social sciences credit for a STEM student, and Dean Chun is a wonderful professor.",
    "Yes. It is good if you are curious about psychology in a general sense.",
    "I would because psychology is needed to help reduce stress.",
    "I found this course to be incredibly interesting and comprehensive introduction to psychology, and would definitely recommend to anyone who isn't scared off by the thick textbook readings that one has to do for each exam. Marvin Chun is a great (albeit sometimes awkward) lecturer, and the energy that he brought to class was always incredible.",
    "I would so the student could learn more about a different subject.",
    "Yes, it was a great introduction, quite interesting and not too much work",
    "For people considering a psych major or something similar, it's useful because it exposes you to the breadth of the field. But overall the large lecture experience was very disappointing and probably not worth it given everything else Yale has to offer.",
    "Yes but I feel like it was poorly organized in terms of what went into exams",
    "I took it for credit in the cogsci major. You wont get that much out of it so its better to take a higher level psych course if you really want to learn. This course is fairly easy though, easier than they make it seem.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course, its a must take whenever Marvin Chun is offering it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in a wide overview of topics in psychology. I think much of the knowledge in the class is pretty practical for everyday life which is really fun. Be aware, however, that the course is a substantial amount of work and does dive into the material in great detail which may be hard to get over unless youre interested in psychology, especially since reading the textbook is important for exams.",
    "It can be a really fun lecture class. I liked what we learned and it was never an extremely stressful class. Dean Chun also has a lot of guest lecturers who were great and added a new dimension to the course.",
    "Yes, if you want a fun overview of psychology.",
    "Yes! I really appreciate Dean Chun putting a lot of effort for each lecture, and I really like the TAs!",
    "Yes, very interesting and applicable universally.",
    "Yes! Especially with Dean Chun.",
    "Yes, I believe the subject matter is necessary for all aspects of life",
    "Yes",
    "To take a class with Dean Chun, yes. For enjoyment, no.",
    "I would recommend this course! I learnt a lot about the human mind, and all majors could benefit from taking this course!",
    "Yes - I would definitely recommend taking this course with Marvin Chun. He was a great and engaging lecturer, and all of the exams were administered and graded fairly. If you study the lectures and read the textbook, studying some of the key terms, you should do just fine on the exams (which often look similar to past ones). It's also just a very interesting subject that is relevant to everyday life, so I would recommend that everyone take into psych. We had three short papers this semester (500-800 words) that were focused on a topic and research based so the more you engage with research the higher grade you would get. The lab requirement was the biggest nuisance - you essentially had to attend\/participate in 5 hour-long studies throughout the semester. It wasn't hard and some of them were really interesting, but I'd recommend spacing them out (online ones won't pop up much).",
    "If youre looking for a broad intro to psych, I think it delivers, and it was fun to take it with Marvin Chun",
    "Yes, very interesting class for anyone really.",
    "Yes - I certainly walked out of the class knowing more about psychology than I did walking in. However, some of this information (as I have described earlier) was extremely misleading, and undoubtedly led to the wrong conclusions being drawn in the minds of many who were formerly unacquainted with the discipline. Thus, I would advise students to take this class, but with a skeptical and cautious eye. Factcheck claims that strike you as outlandish or important enough to change some relevant opinion of yours.",
    "Yes! The information is so valuable and interesting even if you are not interested in psych. It is so cool to learn about the reasons we do what we do, especially when related to current problems. I found so many connections between the things I learned in this class and information in my other classes, which was so cool.",
    "Eh... I already knew most things or could at least intuit them. But I enjoyed learning from Marvin. And did pick up some cool facts about psychology.",
    "Yes, for someone esp an underclassmen who wants a low stress intro course thats still interesting",
    "I would reccomend this class to anyone interested in understanding the broad mechanisms of various types of psychology",
    "Yes!!! So interesting even if you dont want to be a psych major",
    "Yes, I would. I think its important for every student to take this course. It really opened up a new perspective for me on evaluating conflicts with others and with myself. I found it to be very applicable to life with makes it all the more worth it.",
    "Yes absolutely because of the lectures",
    "Yes, especially if the student is considering any further activity in psychology. It demonstrates well what the different fields are and what each field does.",
    "Yes but only if theyre interested in psychology.",
    "Yes, this course is a great introduction to psychology and the lectures are always interesting.",
    "Yes, as the knowledge that you walk away with is highly aplicable to life even if you don't need the psychology\/social science credit",
    "Yes",
    "yes, good introduction to psychological concepts",
    "If you haven't taken psychology and want to understand how to mind works and the consequences of that, this class is a must-take. definitely not a gut but the workload is manageable and you feel like you're always learning something that could be useful to know.",
    "Definitely, but Marvin teaching it is a huge plus, I haven't heard it is as good w other teachers.",
    "Yes, an interesting course. Very broad, but it is an intro course so that's expected.",
    "Yes very interesting and lectures were engaging. You get what you put into it, as its easy not to do readings and just coast through. Because of the curve its not that hard to do really badly but also hard to do really well. It is definitely not a gut.",
    "Yes its an important subject.",
    "Yes, I think this is a very interesting course and it teaches cool things about behavior and thought.",
    "yes",
    "Definitely, you'll learn useful, applicable things about the mind and behavior that cut across a variety of fields and could be central to tackling some of the world's most pressing problems.",
    "Yes, 100%! Its not a hard class, just 3 non-cumulative exams and a few easy research papers. You dont need to do the textbook reading either its cumbersome and doesnt help. Definitely take this class! As close to an interesting gut youll fine at Yale.",
    "Yes, psychology is a fun subject even with interesting topics that everyone should know at least a little bit about.",
    "Yes!",
    "This course is not something you can \"cheat\" in terms of skirting around material you think won't matter on the exams. Everything and anything is fair game - but that's the major charm of the class, in that the material presented is done so on a leveled field. Nothing seems to be more important than other content, making for an interesting learning experience. The class is demanding but quite fun.",
    "Yes, the content is very interesting and Professor Chun made very accessible to the students.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! I found it so interesting. No matter your interests, psychologically can always be engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were specifically looking for a broad psychology class. I think there are likelyore specific intro classes that are better alternatives.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes I loved it and it was chill and predictable workload",
    "Yes if you're pre-med, or if you need to take this class for your major. However, if you have any previous psychology experience, this class may feel repetitive.",
    "Not really",
    "Maybe if they're interested in a relatively easy course that gives a very superficial overview of a little of psychology, not if they're looking to really learn about the subject in a meaningful way though.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes - it was really interesting (both the material and the way in which it was taught) and Marvin Chun is an incredible teacher.",
    "Do not take this course if you are actually interested in psychology. Just take the higher courses and spend time focusing on the interesting stuff.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, the class is a good introductory class, and I feel like I learned a lot. Good exploratory course.",
    "Yes! It's a wonderful introductory course that teaches you fundamental insights about human behavior, while not being that much work. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Definitely",
    "I would recommend this course to any student. Psychology is relevant to all aspects of life, and it's valuable to take an introductory course on it. However, this class did not convince me of the legitimacy of several parts of the field despite Dean Chun's best efforts.",
    "Yes. Find out if psychology is a field you're interested in.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Yale is very well known for psychology and I think this course represents the positive things about the subject in a nice overview.",
    "Yes, it was an interesting course that was not overly difficult. I would definitely recommend taking it as a 5th class Credit\/D\/Fail, as this alleviates any stress that would be associated with the class, and you can just learn a lot.",
    "Yes! I learned a lot, it was very engaging and interesting. Dean chun is a great professor",
    "Yes definitely. Super fun and super interesting.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. The psychology we studied in class was really helpful not only in terms of academics but in real life too. Dean Marvin Chun and the guest professors also made the material engaging and interesting.",
    "I would recommend it if you want a broad overview of psychology. If you are taking this course in order to learn psychology for the MCAT because you are pre-med, I'm not sure I would recommend it since the content covered is not as standard as other more standardized psychology courses are. Since the material is relatively easy to understand, you might be better off just self-studying it.",
    "Yes. Professor Chun is an amazing lecturer and he knows how to engage the audience. I think everyone should take this class once in their Yale career.",
    "This class is an absolute GEM that I recommend ANYONE take. Professor (Dean) Chun does a fantastic job making the content that we learn applicable to the real world while keeping the lectures funny and engaging. I took this class to fill my social sciences requirement and it turned out to be one of my favorite classes of my semester. I think that anyone who is looking to fulfill the requirements and\/or has even the slightest interest in psychology should take this course! This is, in my opinion, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.\r\n\r\nI should mention, if you do the textbook readings (which honestly don't take that much time, maybe 1-2 hours a week) and the research papers (take more time, but only 3x a semester) the workload honestly isn't that bad. And if you do that, getting an A in the class\/high grade is very easy. The best part about this class, though, is that PSYC 110 is one of those rare classes where you don't put in a ton of work, but you learn a ton.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as a way to learn about psychology, which is super useful in real life! This is definitely a class that I quote all the time when I talk to other people and the insights you gain from this class are super valuable.",
    "Absolutely! This class was one of my favorite classes that I've taken at Yale so far. It was a great experience, and I learned so much about a subject I had never been interested in before. This class actually made me reconsider my MCDB major... It was great. Please take it. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Yes, it was a very fun and informative course.",
    "Absolutely! I looked forward to every lecture and the workload is manageable even with a busy schedule.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, Dean Chun made the class very engaging so if you are interested in psychology or just want to try it out, it was a great class.",
    "Yes! Loved it!",
    "Yes! If you need a social science credit or are an aspiring psych major, this class gives you a decent grounding in the discipline. The textbook is also fairly good.",
    "I would recommend the course because the material is very relevant.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would. It was an engaging lecture and you learn a lot of psychology that can be applied to different fields.",
    "I would 10\/10 recommend this course to another student because the psychology knowledge is useful to everyone. The class taught me to engage with scientific research in a fun and interesting way.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, but keep in mind that this class in NOT a gut course. Only take it if you are prepared to complete all the readings. It will definitely help if you have some psychology background because the class is curved. If grades may stress you out, then this is a great class to credit\/D\/fail because the lectures are wonderful but the tests and grading system can be a source of stress.",
    "Would definitely recommend. I always looked forward to going to lecture. Material was always interesting, lots of awesome guest lecturers, and Marvin Chun was great at tying what we learned in class to current events. The class is kinda like reading Snapple caps for a semester",
    "Yes, I think that the lecture were super engaging and that one learns a lot about who they are and humanity around them. Its a super fascinating and applicable course!",
    "Yes, regardless of whether or not you intend to major in a discipline like Psychology or Cognitive Science",
    "Yes, engaging and important to understanding others, also the content can be a break from everything else",
    "I would recommend this course to other Yale students because I think the course teaches us very useful informationinformation relevant to our everyday lives. Also, the things we learned in this class pertain to every major and every person.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It's a fun, engaging, and interesting class. The stuff you learn here is truly applicable to your reflections on your everyday life.",
    "Yes! I think all students should take at least one psychology class, and this is a good introduction to a breadth of subjects. Very manageable and interesting. Dean Chun was a great instructor!",
    "yes. it was really good and interesting even if not considering psychology as a major. comprehensive, engaging",
    "If you are at all interested in Psychology, yes!! Gives you a great basis and a lot of what you learn will make you think differently about aspects of your everyday life. Work involves 3 short paper assignments, 3 exams--it's nice that they aren't cumulative--and the requirement of gaining 5 credits by either participating in or observing psychology studies, or writing supplementary papers.",
    "Yes, I think it is a very interesting class",
    "If interested in Psych, then yes, I would. It is just basic information that is rather good to know, so actually for anyone, I would.",
    "Yes!",
    "No, especially if you're not into lectures. There are better social science credits.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students, especially first-years, even you are not a prospective psychology major. This course's material is useful in helping facilitate the transition into college life and adulthood; for example, we learned about the best methods for studying and relieving stress, using psychological principles to support them.",
    "Sure.",
    "Yes! Great intro course",
    "If one is interested in a very superficial and very desorganized introduction to psychology in a class in which jokes are part of the exam, then yes. Otherwise, no.",
    "Definitely yes! Whether you are into psychology or not, Professor Chun makes the content so interesting. We learn about so many studies that revolutionized so many fields, and we even get to hear about these studies first-hand from the professors who made them.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who has only taken one or no psychology class before, or a first-year trying to figure out if they want to be a psych major. Be warned: the information is very basic, and the concepts are all over the place. But overall, a fun and interesting class (and a good 5th class, because the workload is very low).",
    "I would recommend this course to another student since it is intellectually challenging while manageable in terms of workload. I would caution his or her about the large amount of reading outside of classes, but I would emphasize that the lectures are interesting.",
    "This class is ok. It does its job as an intro psyc course",
    "Probably not. Tests were unfair.",
    "Marvn Chun is a great lecturer and makes the course quite engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course to any potencial psych major. Its not a painful class, but its not too exciting either. Its nothing you didnt know before really, its just more stuff of the same basic Psych info weve learned a thousand times, Stanford prison experiment, amygdala and Pavlov.",
    "I would, but not highly. It's just an intro class, nothing too special.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. It's a great class of breadth, allowing students in social sciences to determine where their greatest passions are.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, as taught by Dean Chun, to other students, regardless of what they plan to major in.",
    "YES!! If you are even mildly interested in psych (or not), take this course! Dean Chun is great. He finds ways to make all the material relevant to daily life and has engaging slides.",
    "yes! Dean Chun was a great lecturer, made classes very enjoyable and informative, also interesting to learn aspects of science that are applicable in our everyday life",
    "yes, this class was interesting and engaging without being overwhelmingly difficult",
    "I found Intro to Cognitive Science much more exciting than Into to Psych, so if you are looking for a fun course about the ways humans think or something along those lines, take CogSci instead!",
    "Yes, the material is very interesting and the professor is great.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The concepts learned are very interesting, and the class itself is a fun class to be in. Dean Chun is very funny and makes the class very engaging to be in.",
    "Yes, I thought this was a very engaging and fun course to take.",
    "Yes. Dean Chun is an amazing lecturer.",
    "Yes! As someone who just took it credit\/d\/fail, I learned so much more than I expected to. Especially if you're also someone who's never taken psychology before, this can be a great introduction to studies and concepts you may be familiar with, but have never formally learned in a classroom setting.",
    "Yes, I think this course would provide a good base of knowledge to take many different kinds of classes later on.",
    "No, because I found that the class did not cohere, I did not quite know what the general themes or takeaways were, and the exams were difficult.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is an excellent introduction to the science of psychology that everyone should be exposed to.",
    "Yes, however I would say it was as exciting as I expected it to be",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student at Yale. It is a great introduction to psychology, and I think it is an important topic to learn a bit about, no matter what field you may be going into after college. Psychology can be applied to your daily life all the time, and it is also just cool to understand peoples minds and behaviors. The exams are entirely based on how much of the lectures and textbook you can memorize, and the papers are not too bad.",
    "Yes! Marvin Chun is a great lecturer, genuinely funny and engaging and cared a lot about his students. I also really enjoyed the information being covered in the lectures and that it was slightly different from the textbook that way it wasn't completely redundant.",
    "Yes. I think I learned how to approach my own life\/personal issues\/metal health from the viewpoint of a psychologist. This has helped me to recognize certain mental-health related patterns in myself and take productive actions to perform my best and be kind to myself from a mental-health standpoint.",
    "Nope! This course taught me virtually nothing, it was just a platform for Dean Chun to spew his own views and opinions. I hardly studied for the third midterm and just picked the most \"PC\" answers for the multiple choice and got above the average... ridiculous.",
    "I definitely would! Every lecture was super fascinating and I learned a ton!",
    "yes",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course! It is a great way to begin learning about psychology and to work hard without being overwhelmed. This class is very rewarding if you put in effort, but the workload is not stressful or unreasonable. If nothing else, take this course for Dean Chun! He is a wonderful lecturer and is clearly very passionate about teaching and about psychology.",
    "Yeah, it was a good time.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend to a student who wants to learn real-life applications of psychology.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course to any student regardless of their major. This course was interesting and useful for everyday life.",
    "If you want a fifth class, this might be for you, because the workload is relatively light and while you do have to study, it's really not bad, you just have to do it. While I didn't find the teaching to be anything spectacular, Dean Chun did do a solid job and it was a fine class.",
    "Absolutely. Intro Psych was one of my favorite classes, and it's an excellent addition to any schedule.",
    "YES! I would recommend this course to any and all Yale students. I feel as if we all have an inner drive to understand where our modes of thinking and behavior originate and this course does so well in explaining that thoroughly.",
    "yes",
    "Yes!! As a student from one of the Yale graduate schools, I was a bit hesitant to take Yale college course at first (b\/c of its difficulty and heavy workload), but it was totally worth taking it, and I would love to take more college classes!",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed the material in this class. It has awoken a love for Psych and I'm excited to see where this love takes me. I had some inkling that I might be interested in the mind, but after taking this class, I realized I definitely am. So, for anyone who is on the edge or hesitant about taking it, I think they should definitely go for it.",
    "I would definitely recommend, seems like good and fun information to have in life.",
    "No. It's unusually difficult for an introductory course.",
    "Yes it's a great intro to psychology.",
    "makes it hard to get an A, but society demands an A. at least now I can describe this phenomenon as cognitive dissonance",
    "Take this class seriously. I, for one, did not, because I told myself that this was a gut and continued to study for my harder classes. That was a big mistake. But if you aren't dumb like me, then this class is a great time with lectures that I actually enjoyed.",
    "Not so much unless they are an intended Psychology major or want to see if Psychology is something for them to explore. Otherwise, it sort of seemed like a waste of time to someone who wants to gain valuable and in-depth knowledge in a topic.",
    "Definitely! This course is relevant to everyone, no matter what your major, and is a great overview of a bunch of different, really interesting topics. Take it with Chun if you canhis lectures were the best part of the course.",
    "Yes, I think that the knowledge gained from this course is very beneficial and relevant to daily life.",
    "Yes, it's a great course",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students because it gives a good insight into Psychology at Yale.",
    "Yes, if you're looking for a social science credit or you have to take it.",
    "Yes, I think this is valuable information for anyone to have.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. Psychology is extremely relevant in so many facets of life in any career, and the class material is broad yet detailed enough to form a solid background in psychology. Even if I do not decide to be a psychology major, I know this course has provided me with knowledge that can be useful in my everyday life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to other students, to both those who are planning on majoring in psychology and those who are just interested in the topic!",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to students that are interested in psychology, or are interested to learn how humans think and why we think they way we do. I feel that this course provides students with a very interesting, holistic, and comprehensive understanding of psychology, while it is fundamentally enjoyable and interesting in every sense. The instructor is amazing and he does a great job in making sure that the core theme of the course (that we are all psychologists and that psychology is relatable) is constantly underlined and outlined in lectures. There are always interesting examples that are used to frame specific psychological principles, something that adds to the interest that the course elicits.",
    "I don't know. I will be taking cognitive science next year, and based on what I've heard I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone who is on the cognitive science track because it covers many of the same topics as intro to Cog Sci, but to a more shallow depth.",
    "Yes! It's an engaging way to get introduced to psych."
