We have learned a lot of tenses, all 3 Japanese alphabets including 70 kanjis, speak easily on any simple topics, and even write essays in Japanese. That amount of work allows you to learn topics in one semester you might learn by doing it yourself for 2 years. Highly recommend it if you like Japanese.",

The instructor did point us to the Japanese-graded readers in the East Asian Library on the 2nd floor of Sterling. Unfortunately, those books cannot be borrowed.",
                "The daily homework is really helpful. The textbook is great.",
                "A weakness is the quantity of work that was given because sometimes it wouldn't be beneficial in improving language skills and would only add more time to the class preparations/homework.",
                "I like how languages here at Yale meet everyday because it forces you to be engaged with the material to actually succeed. The everyday homework assignments were also helpful to make sure you were putting in the work outside of the class as well.",
                "Strengths: Level of engagement and work.\r\nWeaknesses: Uneven learning speed and starting knowledge. (but this really cannot be fixed as everyone learns at different speeds and has different backgrounds)",
                "No weaknesses! Be only ready for a lot of work, which might be challenging if you prefer something other than Japanese. That should not be a problem as Stever Sensei is the best Japanese teacher. Highly recommend her even if you need to wake up earlier for these classes. She always gives valuable pieces of advice and teaches terrifically!",
                "I really appreciate the emphasis on speaking and conversation, as in past language courses, I have learned that the best way to fully immerse oneself in a language is to engage in conversation using that language."
