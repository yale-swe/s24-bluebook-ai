Students gain experience working with several model organisms, including D. melanogaster (fruit flies), C. elegans (worms), sea urchin, starfish, and zebrafish.",

Examples include PCR, bacterial transformation, ELISA, and organisms like Drosophila and C. Elegans. There were also many opportunities to hone skills such as scientific writing and lab recordkeeping."

                "The labs themselves are quite enriching, and students have the opportunity to use top-notch equipment while researching with several different model organisms. However, several of the course assignments seemed impractical. Most lab reports were over twenty pages long, and the notebook entries differed greatly from what I am accustomed to writing for my own lab work outside of this course. Given that most scientific journals have a page\/word limit and notebook entries should be as concise as possible in real-life lab situations, I wish I would have received more feedback on how to approach these assignments in a more practical manner.",
                "Strengths: opportunity to learn something new each class, very hands-on, highly relevant to conducting research in an actual bio lab, collaborative environment, Professor Moreno prepares detailed lab handouts and guides us through each lab\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the rubrics\/scoring guidelines for the lab reports and lab notebook entries were a bit ambiguous"

            "comments": [
                "Yes! I came in with limited experience in labs, and this course was incredibly helpful. Dr. Moreno is incredibly supportive and available if you have any questions, and the labs were engaging and matched incredibly well with the BIOL101\/102 sequence. Writing four lab reports and keeping up a lab notebook was also beneficial. It was clear Dr. Moreno was preparing us for working in labs in the future, which was exactly what I needed as someone new to it all. I would definitely recommend this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who have little to no prior lab experience, as this course equips students with basic skills for note-taking and grant writing, all while allowing students to gain familiarly with the model organisms they may encounter within an external lab. Professor Moreno even goes above and beyond by listing labs related to each week's experiment that are currently accepting undergraduate researchers. However, I would not recommend this course to students who already have lab experience or upperclassman who need a biology lab solely for the purpose of fulfilling pre-med requirements. In these instances, the extensive work instilled within this course may actually counter some of the more practical writing that students who already have lab experience may be used to.",
                "Yes, if you want hands-on experience with wet lab research and bio techniques. Even as someone who has worked in a molecular bio lab before, I learned a ton of new things. I think it's generally rare to get to work with several model organisms and perform such a range of techniques while working in a single lab, so this course offers a unique opportunity to do just that in a short period. It's also not too strenuous for half a writing credit."
