                "Ximena is an amazing professor, and this class is definitely a must for anyone wanting to learn more about Latine Activism in the U.S. The readings were sometimes very long, and the discussions appeared more so like lectures, but Ximena's insight and commentary on the course material was definitely very valuable and helped me make connections that I otherwise would not have.",
                "I felt that my writing skills were much improved by taking this course. It also taught me to really think outside the box and nurtured a space where I could openly express my ideas.",
                "This course allowed to have a better understanding of Latinx activism and the history of the latinx community. It allowed me to understand the diversity of the Latinx community. By analyzing readings and also getting a look at how community organizing works, this course allowed me to learn a lot.",
                "I learned knowledge about US interference in Latin America, and how Latin American people as a whole worked to fight against the United States' injustices.",
                "I learned about a different perspective of Latinx people in the United States. I also learned about the history of many Latinx countries and how this shaped the geopolitical landscape of these counties. The instructor also worked in political theory in analyzing historic activism movements.",
                "Gained insight into the history of Latinx activism, the formation of grassroots organizations, and the challenges of creating coalitions",
                "I learned about Latine history and the Latine diaspora. I was also introduced to the archival resources available at Yale.",
                "By taking this course, I further developed my argumentative skills through my papers while using distinct types of sources to get my point across. This course also allowed me to continue working on critical thinking skills that allowed me to voice my opinion and interpretations in class discussions.",
                "I learned about Latinx activism in different Latine communities, such as Caribbean, Central Americans, Mexicans, Chicanos, queer communities, undocumented communities, etc. It's important to note that there's a diversity of perspectives because latine classes often center around Mexican narratives and often exclude many communities in the Latina diaspora. I also learned more about debates on Latinidad and what it means to be Latine from our different readings and discussions.",
                "I really enjoyed learning about the history of many policies affecting Latine communities in the U.S. and in their home countries, as well as small grassroots initiatives that aimed to alleviate the effects of such policies. Beyond the classroom, Profe. Ximena took a hands-on approach by dedicating a component of the class toward helping a community organization. People in the class were able to work with Junta for Progressive Action in New Haven and Comunidades Unidas in Utah. Additionally, Hurricane Fiona's disastrous effects on Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic enabled our professor to encourage a bake sale to donate money for relief efforts in these countries. The bake sale was a huge success, raising over $1000, and was a great way to bond with our classmates and organize.",
                "This courses allowed me to critically read and synthesis text. It allowed me to vocalize my thoughts in seminar-like discussion and helped me further my research and writing skills.",
                "This was one of the most insightful courses I will ever take at Yale. I know understand more of what LatinX political activism has been portrayed in the United States. This is a course that has taught me about various LatinX leaders and their impact in the communities. Before this course I was oblivious about the importance of external forces in the face of change for the LatinX community. For example, the ways in which the US has impacted the waves of migration North from Central and South America."

            "comments": [
                "Sometimes it appeared too much of a lecture, and I feel I wasn't encouraged to give my thoughts on the course material enough.",
                "One of the strengths was that the readings and the work alongside it (2 response papers, midterm, and final paper) were all based on topics we are genuinely interested in. However, the downside to this course is that it lacked a solid structure. The course was a work in progress since the beginning and the professor consistently made modifications to it as we went along.",
                "I think that the content in this class is very strong and one that we aren't used to learning a lot about.",
                "The strengths of the course are that it covers a wide array of topics. The weakness of this course is that it heavily focuses Caribbean countries rather than Central American or South American countries.",
                "This course is wonderfully laid out. Expectations are clear and the instructor takes care in the materials provided for the class. Overall, this class helped me develop a historical perspective and allowed me to analyze historic events. This course also focuses on building the ability to construct effective arguments and papers. The only thing I didnt love about the course was the occasional lack of conversation due to a historical lecture taking place of discussion. However, these lectures were essential in order to fully engage with the material.",
                "Strengths: Profe Ximena is a wonderful and kind person, the class is not too difficult; Weaknesses: doing the readings often felt pointless because we didn't actually talk about them in class, Ximena basically just lectured. I think there was sometimes too much of an emphasis on writing quality and high school English skills like syntax, grammar, and word choice rather than the content of the essays.",
                "I would say it definite strength of the course is having Profesora Ximena as the instructor. As she teaches, one can clearly observe she's passionate about what she's teaching, which encourages one to learn more about the topic at hand. I would say it would help to have more assignments prior to discussions as it would further facilitate and help lead discussions.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lopez Carrillo cares about her students immensely. She always makes sure we're on the same page about assignments, changing deadlines, and changing the syllabus as we went on. She was very easy to talk to and would even go to our student performances. She's also very, very detailed with her feedback and I really appreciated the time she would take to help us outline, recommend sources, an give feedback on our plans and our essays.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was less room for student engagement as time went on because Mondays were treated more as lectures and Wednesdays we'd have more time to talk as students, but it was hard to jump in because it felt like we had to say something in the middle of class instead of having a set time for student-led discussions.",
                "The course is taught mainly lecture based leaving very little room for discussions. The only assignments in the course were pretty simple to do You dont have to keep up with the readings to get by in the class",
                "I think a strength of this course is the reason behind its existence. Profe. Ximena discussed that she wanted to create a course focusing on the successful efforts of Latine communities who have fought back with oppressive systems, as academia tends to simply focus on how these communities are oppressed and make them seem defenseless. I think one weakness of the course would be its structure and teaching method. Because the reading material is so dense and there is a lot of history to cover, the course really felt like a \"leminar\" (a seminar that has a lecture-style component) which I personally did not find helpful at times.",
                "The course is very engaging and has great reading material. The work los is fair and the professor is an amazing educator.",
                "Strengths: The instructors did a beautiful job explaining the content and relating it to our daily lives. Proffesor Lopez is easy to understand and keeps us engaged during instruction. This was one of my favorite classes. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish that there could have been a little for discussion about each topic with more thought provoking questions. In addition-- I wish we could have set up a volunteering plan from the beginning of the year."

                "If Ximena teaches the course again, it is definitely one that other students should highly consider. I got the chance to get directly involved with a Latine nonprofit and to actively engage in what the class was teaching us about: Latine Activism.",

                "I would totally recommend this course to another student. It will allow them to leave with a better understanding of the Latinx community and will leave them with a variety of topics to further explore.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because Professor Lopez Carrillo is the sweetest person ever, she explains the history very well, and she provides use feedback on assignments that truly help you on the next one.",
                "I highly recommend this course. The instructor is engaging and provides consistent feedback. The material is enlightening and applicable to today. The course also had a component of volunteering for community organizing as a project. This pushed the class to apply the material we learned in class to the real world and gave an incredible introduction to the world of activism.",
                "Yes, as a first-year student this class was an excellent introduction to the rigor and sophistication of a Yale class while still allowing me to enjoy the weekly readings.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as we discussed very interesting topics surrounding less-known examples of Latinx Activism and it allowed for important conversations. Not only because it covers interesting topics, I think overall it is a course that individuals should take to learn more about the history of Latinx Activism and how that has had an impact on what we see today.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who have no background in civic engagement work and for students who do. This class makes activism very accessible and learning about it too.",
                "Yes mainly because of the civics project part of the course!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Being able to learn in community, especially having other fellow Latine classmates, is very helpful because we are able to talk about our personal experiences.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is highly engaging and discusses LatinX history that is usually left out of the typical American curriculum.",
                "I absolutely recommend this course. I have seen an improvement in my writing, my critical thinking skills, and the questions I ask my self about each reading."
