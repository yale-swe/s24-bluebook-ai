                "Strengths: There were abundant opportunities to receive help and guidance! \r\nWeaknesses: There was a lot of material to cover, and oftentimes it felt like the first and second halves of the course were totally disconnected.",
                "Strengths: Well-rounded course topics that introduce you to a variety of statistical concepts that are actually relevant to your life. The poli-sci part of the class was actually extremely interesting and done quite well. I liked that the lectures were pre-recorded because there is so much material and I was taking my own notes so I could pause and go back when I needed to. The quizzes in the general part also helped solidify the notes. The TFs had office hours all the time so if you had questions you could almost always find a time to go. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is so much material that it can feel overwhelming if you don't keep up. The psets are kind of long.",
                "Honestly it was fine the way it was. I enjoy learning on my own.",
                "Strengths: recorded lectures made it easier to spread out my time across my other courses. Tons of office hours available made it accessible to reach help. Weaknesses: felt like there was a lack of review sessions, which could've definitely helped",
                "Strengths: Lots of opportunities for office hours, prerecorded lectures made the format flexible, first two exams allowed ample time\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Final exam was quite long given the time constraint, discussion board questions often went unanswered in the second half of the class, prerecorded lectures were often longer than the 2 hour and 30 minute weekly block if the course were in-person",
                "The strength of the course was the lecturers, who were extremely engaging and always very helpful. There were also many resources that were available to help, especially office hours with TAs or lecturers. The weakness of this course was that the online recorded lectures were difficult to engage with and the material was often very dense.",
                "Strengths: the amount of office hours available to students and the feedback given on homework. Additionally, the emphasis on the homework packets rather than solely exams helps with learning the material better. Weaknesses: the asynchronous approach to the course makes it easy to fall behind on class work and exam preparation.",
                "The prerecorded lectures were very good and did a good job explaining the topics. The modules were also organized really well so that it was easy to see which lectures corresponded to each quiz and problem set. A weakness would be that since it was all asynchronous, it was very easy to be disengaged.",
                "A strength was definitely the organization of the class, and how accessible the professors and TAs were. Especially in a semester where people could not be together in the same classroom, it was really impressive and so caring that there were so many office hours held throughout the week (like 60 hours total!). That way, we were still able to build a professor-student relationship and feel the camaraderie of taking a class together."

It's kind of intimidating even when you are keeping up with the fast pace of the lectures and topics, but the topics are extremely useful and can be applied to a lot of different subject areas and your life in general. The poli-sci part of the class is also really useful for diving deeper into regression analysis which was actually quite enjoyable and interesting, and it focuses on political data sets which was also nice.",

                "If a student is looking for an engaging way to learn stats, this is definitely the way to go. This class is not dry at all, like one might expect a stats class to be. JDRS is a really dynamic professor and he makes learning stats fun and not intimidating! During office hours JDRS was always patient with students and it was clear that he really wanted to help guide students learning and make sure they really understood the concepts. It was really nice to feel like JDRS was giving us one-on-one individualized time during office hours, even though there were ~20 other people on the Zoom at a time. \r\n\r\nProfessor Rader was very well organized in the way she organized her lectures in units, and I liked how she posted them throughout the week so that it was not an overwhelming number of videos assigned all at once. Rather, we could keep up with her pace. I also liked how many real world examples from political science journal articles she used throughout her lectures, which made it easier to grasp the concepts she was teaching. \r\n\r\nI also took this course while taking another political science course where we read and analyzed a lot of political science articles. It was cool to see the overlaps between the two classes (especially when both classes discussed the same studies!) and taking both helped me better understand the content of each class."
