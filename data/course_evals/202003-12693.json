I learned how to engage in a seminar in a way that flows from whoever comes before me and to always tie my insights back to the text.\r\n\r\n4.

Working out how to fruitfully advance a reading, understand a peers reading, advance an alternate reading, and bring up other passages or authors that you think speak to the issue at hand. \r\n\r\nI took from the course a sense of how metaphysics has in many ways become less ambitious, but that simultaneously may mean that it has a greater chance of success. The course is titled 'the end of metaphysics', and you begin with Kant's effort to keep the possibility of a shared world. Many of the later thinkers do not seem to have as systemic a grounding for their supposed natures of reality as Kant did, and some don't even overtly advance what their metaphysics are. Sometimes, thinkers seem to be trying to come to terms with the 'end' of metaphysics, rather than trying to save it. However, that in itself sometimes felt like it verged on developing a new metaphysics, albeit a much less secure one."

                "Strengths: Professor is very engaged, reading load is very manageable, syllabus is great and the readings are very interesting\r\nWeaknesses: 3 hour format can be tiring and sometimes it feels like we get no headway during class discussions",
                "Strengths: \r\n1. Professor Levene is a really sharp teacher and seminar leader. The seminar felt genuine, not like some philosophy classes where everyone is sort of floating in space and trying to show off. Everyone was really engaged and making good comments.\r\n2. I liked the three hour, once a week format. The workload wasn't too high but I felt I gained a lot from every reading anyway.\r\n3. Loved reading literature as philosophy. The thesis of the course (as I understand it) is that the END of metaphysics (the border between metaphysics and whatever is beyond that, e.g. faith or a lack thereof) is where all the interesting thinking happens -- we talked about belief, reason, what happens when you lack both of those. It was very interesting to me. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI really liked the course, but Profesor Levene did kind of spring an assignment on us mid-semester where we had to lead a discussion. And my date got pushed back a week because class got cancelled so I had to present on a day that wasn't ideal for me (I had a final that morning). This could be fixed simply by sticking to the schedule and syllabus! Not a big deal..",
                "The actual length of the seminar need not be 3.5 hours; I feel a shorter discussion could suffice since everybody is too fatigued to contribute meaningfully after hour number two.",
                "S: We study some very interesting texts whose links are difficult yet fruitful to explore. Professor Levene is very helpful in guiding conversation and spurring on new thoughts and points of view of the text.\r\nThis course will really test philosophy majors, and especially those who are used to philosophy that is easier to pin down than metaphysics is.\r\n\r\nW: Sometimes the reading is too difficult to understand or explore fully without a bit more help from the Professor",
                "The course was really interesting and really great! The student-driven discussions were definitely a strength, since that made the class feel very participatory and engaging. That said, at times the conversation stagnated a bit, so perhaps a bit more structure for sections of the class, which was a three-hour bloc, could have helped us keep moving. Overall, I definitely liked the structure.",
                "The three hour seminar was a bit long, but other than that incredibly strong!",
                "Prof Levene and Netta are great, and I really enjoyed our discussions. I thought the Kant discussions at the beginning of the course were particularly interesting and informative. My only complaint was that I felt that we didn't touch enough on the overall theme of the course...I felt reading the syllabus that the class would examine the texts through the question of if metaphysics is at an end, but after the class I didn't really feel like I gained any ground on the thematic question of the class, only on close reading.",
                "Nancy Levene is a real asset to her students intellectual development. She expects students to do the legwork to understand the texts themselves. The strength of this is that the understanding reached and questions raised are much better understood than they would be in a lecture survey course of the same thinkers. The other side of the coin and the weakness of this style is that you do move slowly, and it can sometimes feel like a slog, especially over zoom. \r\n\r\nIt is really hard to recreate the magic that can happen in a seminar room over zoom. I have two suggestions for how the course could try to. First, having an intro question\/short icebreaker-esque thing should help people be more engaged for longer. It wakes people up, connects them to other participants  as people not just interlocutors, as well as simply practicing what conversing looks like over zoom. \r\n\r\nSecondly, I would recommend that the grading structure of the course is changed to incorporate participation. Prof. Levene is right when she says that to write good essays (and thus get a good grade) in the course requires you to do the work in class, however, I can't help but feel that a direct tying of participation to grade would incentivize better engagement from almost all undergrads, myself included. For instance, if I was not planing to write an essay on a thinker that we were just reading for one week, I am incentivized to take it easy, or at least to prioritize my other work. However, as someone who likely got a B+ in this class, perhaps I am not particularly well qualified to judge what is necessary to get the best grades. \r\n\r\nThese are both things that could be done once we return to in person classes too. \r\n\r\nI thought the selection of authors and passages was generally excellent and worked well together. However, I don't think we as a class got much out of the Poetry week. I don't know if this is a reflection on us as a class, or on the circumstances of the semester, but we never really got out teeth into very much."

You get out what you put in -- readings are relatively short, but prepare to spend time making sense of the readings if you want to have something to contribute. You probably will have to work very hard on your papers to do well -- Professor Levene is not an easy grader, but she is very precise in her feedback, which I respect.\r\n\r\n2. I think the thesis of the course and the reading lists are great for anyone who wants to think deeply about choice, belief, reason and what we do when philosophy only takes us so far. Morrison was probably my favorite text I've read all year.\r\n\r\n3. Professor Levene expects a lot from her students, and I liked that my work was held to a high standard because it pushed me to work harder and make better comments. Still, I liked the atmosphere in the class and thought it was actually rather relaxed, with friendly students and a cool TA. \r\n\r\n4. I thought deeply in this course.

The level and depth of understanding you will get out of thinkers, including (perhaps especially) those you have read before is almost unparalleled at Yale. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, If you have taken a bunch of philosophy courses and found them to be either pretentious or dry, looking for faculty outside the department teaching courses can be a good strategy. \r\n\r\nGrading is on the stricter side, but less so than with someone like Kagan. I think I got a B+, whereas in another course I might have gotten an A- for a similar quality of work."
