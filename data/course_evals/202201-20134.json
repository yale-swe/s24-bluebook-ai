                "I think it is a great way to improve auditory comprehension and speaking skills.",
                "I liked the format of the course, which was almost entirely comprised of rigorous class discussion about themes, symbolism, and stylistic aspects of each text we read. My main complaint about the course this semester was the choice of books. The theme was \"exile and return,\" which leads quite well into an exploration of non-French francophone literature (i.e. writers from former French colonies or occupied territories) especially from writers of color. Although we read a few books from that category around the end of the course, we also read \"ourika\" and \"lettres d'une pruvienne,\" which essentially entailed white authors writing from the perspective of imaginary characters of color, and included insensitive language and portrayals of those characters' cultures. Although our discussions of these books clearly acknowledged the fact that they were problematic, I did not think that they spoke to the theme of the course, nor were they pedagogically useful. In general, the idea of having a theme for the course was interesting, but the selection of texts may have been more exciting if it was not limited as such.",
                "Strengths: Interesting literature read--good discussions\r\nWeaknesses: Classes were repetitive at times with how similarly structured\/led each individual class was",
                "This course should have a smaller class size. My section had too many people in too small of a room and it was difficult to have everyone involved in the discussions. This being said, I love the discussion-based structure of this class. You read a work\/a section of a work (be prepared for large reading assignments) and then come into class and basically just share your thoughts and get into (friendly) arguments about your interpretation. It's a very fun intellectual environment. There are only 3 significant graded assignments, a presentation and 2 essays which are not that difficult and you have the opportunity to turn in a corrected version to get points back.",
                "The amount of reading was challenging, but reading responses helped me process the text by writing about it. The course covered a diverse range of novels from vastly different time periods with different writing styles, which I thought was interesting. \r\n\r\nI was often frustrated by our class discussions, in which one or two students consistently dominated the conversation. I found it very difficult to jump in and participate. It was hard to stay motivated to complete all the readings when I often did not have the chance to demonstrate my knowledge in class.",
                "Sometimes there were a few days where there was a lot of reading assigned that was hard to complete in the time given, especially when there was also a written assignment to complete that day."

                "I would; it's not too hard and I think it can be really fun if you engage with it the right way. Don't stress too much about the essays and get help early on if you need it. Definitely learn to skim when it comes to the books because there's a lot of reading. Also be prepared to participate a lot in this course; if you're shy about speaking that's something to think about before taking this course.",
