                "The course is flexible in nature, adjusting its timeline and structure depending on each class of students and the films they aspire to produce. Each session, there is enough opportunity for all students to talk about their projects and workshop not only creative ideas but also logistical\/production issues. As is the nature of student filmmaking, we often act as producers for our films, even if we have another producer officially involved, so this dedicated time to talk through ideas, problems, and solutions is invaluable. Though it is a year-long course, with the first term dedicated to writing, I feel like it could benefit from encouraging pre-production earlier in the first term, even if it overlaps with later drafts of the writing."

It requires an investment in your peers' work. If you are willing to bring a constructive and collaborative spirit to the class, you will meet trusted creative accomplices that will support your filmmaking at Yale and beyond."
