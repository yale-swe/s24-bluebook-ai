I also learned a lot about literary analysis and writing in general.",

                "Strengths: Professor Mahurin is amazing and full of personality. She dedicates a lot of time to ensuring individual success, including meetings to discuss planning\/essay ideas and grades. She makes it a priority to get to know each student. The reading list is fantastic. Small-group, comfortable setting.\r\nWeaknesses: Depending on your preferences, these may or may not be weaknesses. She does cold-call on people and you will have to give answers in each lecture. Essays for the course have lots of freedom (which is great), but there are not prompts.",
                "Strengths: selection of readings were great, something to look forward to every week. Discussions were very interesting, Dean Mahurin is great at organizing the course and conversations. Weaknesses: might have wanted more time to discuss certain texts.",
                "This course is full of strengths. The only weakness is how little time we had to discuss each text. I'm glad we got to study a large selection, but we only had two class periods to discuss each text which didn't do them justice at all.",
                "Dean Mahurin does an amazing job of facilitating discussions about the texts that we read, and keeping the class light even when we discussed pretty heavy topics. She also gives great feedback on assignments and tells you what you need to do for each one.",
                "The syllabus is AMAZING and full of must-reads. You will want to read every reading. The essays are also well-organized and the final exam was honestly extremely fun. Take it!",
                "The strengths of this course were the quality of literature augmented by the richness of discussion facilitated by Professor Mahurin and my peers. Do NOT be discouraged by the workload of reading a book per week. Everything we read was highly enjoyable, informative, and rich. There are no weaknesses to this course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Mahurin always had super insightful things to say and was easy to meet with. All the books on the syllabus were fantastic. My classmates always seemed to be engaged, and I loved hearing their thoughts because they often pointed out things I didn't notice while reading. \r\nWeaknesses: I didn't have any qualms except maybe 72 hours to complete the final exam rather than 48 would have been nice.",
                "I liked the seminar-style class. The whole class was discussion-based and flowed very smoothly. I liked how small the class was and that everybody participated. One improvement could be some extra guidance for essays and strategies for how to write them.",
                "I think this is an amazing course with lots of strengths  the texts selected were all very engaging, rich texts. I enjoyed the discussion style of the seminar and felt like I learned a lot from both my professor and peers. The only improvement I can really think of is if there were more opportunities to be graded, such as smaller assignments throughout, or if it was made more clear how much of each text we were supposed to read before every class, so that we would know more precisely what was going to be discussed. However, I feel like these are minor things.",
                "STRENGTHS: first, Professor Mahurin, who treasures these texts and leads her students to treasure them. Wonderful texts ripe for discussion, reflection and even debate. Heavy though certainly manageable reading load, especially if you read ahead. Above all: the thought-provoking discussions we have, which I always looked forward to. No weaknesses."

                "Small group was able to meet outside (with PPE and distancing) a few times- good for learning. All Zoom lectures were in live time with mics and cameras to facilitate a real discussion. Student presentations live over Zoom were engaging.",

                "The small section was a success because it allowed everybody to engage and participate. I also enjoyed the outdoor classes we had so that we could meet people in person.",
                "I think that having discussions over Zoom and meeting outside in real life (since our class was small enough) was the best that we could do to make the class engaging, which I felt like it was. It was definitely great to see my classmates in real life, and I was a big fan of when we would meet in person when we could manage to. I also thought that breakout rooms were a nice way to mix it up.",
                "Professor Mahurin adapted this course very smoothly to pandemic learning conditions. We were able to hold fruitful discussions over Zoom, and I appreciated the two times we met up in-person. It was easy to follow along when we were reading from the texts (at least in my case, as I had print copies), and sometimes Professor Mahurin shared her screen to share relevant excerpts, songs, etc."

                "Yes! It leads you to think critically about people of color and the complexities of Southern culture\/life, the reading selections are awesome, and Professor Mahurin is wonderful. If you like small group discussion sections and reading, you'll love it.",
                "Yes, you get to read incredible texts that usually are not part of high school or college curricula. Dean Mahurin gives great insight into the texts and always offers a different perspective of looking at things. Her feedback is very clear and direct, so it is easy to find ways to improve your writing. The workload can be tough since it requires a lot of close reading, but it is manageable.",
                "Yes! The texts were amazing, the discussions were engaging, and Professor Mahurin is so encouraging and supportive.",
                "Yes!!! 10000%. This course was amazing and everyone should take a course like it or at least a course with Dean Mahurin at least once during their time at Yale.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. Take it. We were so lucky to have the opportunity to take this class as first-years. If you are even vaguely interested in African-American history, American Studies, the South, regionalism, literature, etc. how can you not take this class?",
                "Yes!! Overall, it was a great zoom learning environment 12\/10 would gladly recommend to anyone. Since this was taught as a FYS, I haven't taken that many other classes but this was definitely my favorite this semester, and I suspect it'll still be way up there by the time I'm a senior. The syllabus was well-crafted and I think this is the type of class that attracts people who actually want to be there and do the reading. Also loved when Professor Mahurin read things aloud because it kinda felt like voice acting and was nice to listen to. She cold calls sometimes but not in an intimidating way (if you aren't sure how to respond she won't pick on you or anything). Cannot rave about this class enough.",
                "I would recommend this course. The professor is great and very engaging. She always brought energy to the class and her love of the texts showed through in the way she facilitated discussions. The texts we read were so important and beautiful and helped bring a new perspective to readings and life in the South. The beauty of Black culture was represented in the texts we read.",
                "Absolutely 100%. The books we read are amazing, and I think reading and studying literature by black Southern authors is extremely important for anyone, but especially for us at an elite Northern university who for many of us have not been encouraged to learn about the black South. Being aware of the culture and experiences of those in other parts of the country is absolutely essential to being an aware, active citizen, which I think we all strive to be.",
                "Without a doubt, yes! A valuable opportunity to engage with great literature with a wonderful professor in a close class community. Professor Mahurin makes every discussion a journey-like conversation in which you develop deeper insights into and appreciation for the texts, their nuances, and their authors."
